Without impurity the semiclassical energies correctly reproduce the Landau
level spectrum. For a given Landau level the WKB energy depends on the absolute
value of angular momentum in a way which is consistent with the exact
diagonalization result. Below the supercritical impurity magnitude, the WKB
solution can be expanded as a convergent series in powers of the effective fine
structure constant. Relevance of our results to validity of the widely used

the cooling and the heating processes of a possible compact star based on the
upper limit of observational X-ray luminosity. From the cooling process we
found that a solid quark-cluster star, which has a stiffer equation of state
than that of conventional liquid quark star, has a heat capacity much smaller
than a neutron star. It can cool down quickly, which can naturally explain the
non-detection of a point source (neutron star or quark star) in X-ray band. On
the other hand, we consider the heating process from magnetospheric activity
and possible accretion, and obtain some constraints to the parameters of a
possible pulsar. We conclude that a solid quark-cluster star can be fine with
the observational limit in a large and acceptable parameter space. A pulsar
with a short period and a strong magnetic field (or with a long period and a
weak field) would has luminosity higher than the luminosity limit if the
optical depth is not large enough to hide the compact star. The constraints of
the pulsar parameters can be tested if the central compact object in 1987A is
discovered by advanced facilities in the future.

to use all available antennas and perform equal power allocation with

asymptotically large number of transmit or receive antennas by obtaining the

ruptures and possible corresponding acoustic features. We found that the
fraction of triangles remarkably scales with the detachment fronts. There is a
universal power law between nodes' degree and motifs frequency (for triangles,
it reads T(k)\proptok{\beta} ({\beta} \approx2\pm0.4)). We confirmed the
obtained universality in aperture-based friction networks. Based on the
achieved results, we extracted a possible friction law in terms of network
parameters and compared it with the rate and state friction laws. In
particular, the evolutions of loops are scaled with power law, indicating the
aggregation of cycles around hub nodes. Also, the transition to slow rupture is
scaled with the fast variation of local heterogeneity. Furthermore, the motif
distributions and modularity space of networks -in terms of withinmodule degree
and participation coefficient-show non-uniform general trends, indicating a
universal aspect of energy flow in shear ruptures.

We refer to it as the distributed soft coding (DISC). In the proposed scheme,
each relay first uses the received noisy signals to calculate the soft bit

encode the SBEs of source symbols based on a constituent code generator matrix.
The SISO encoder outputs at different relays are then forwarded to the
destination and form a distributed codeword. The performance of the proposed
scheme is analyzed. It is shown that its performance is determined by the
generator sequence weight (GSW) of the relay constituent codes, where the GSW
of a constituent code is defined as the number of ones in its generator
sequence. A new coding design criterion for optimally assigning the constituent
codes to all the relays is proposed based on the analysis. Results show that
the proposed DISC can effectively circumvent the error propagation due to the
decoding errors in the conventional detect and forward (DF) with relay
re-encoding and bring considerable coding gains, compared to the conventional

uniqueness does not hold, invariants of this monoid give a measure of how badly

linear in 1/epsilon. For many practical concave cost problems, the resulting

that the lifetime of the structure is longer than 500 Myr; such long-lived

galaxies with solid-body rotation. The old stellar populations (red giants and
red clump stars) of the putative companion are consistent with those of the
extended halo of NGC 6822; this argues against the interpretation of this

linked to the formation of the HI hole via an interaction. Since there is no

formulations of quantum gravity is overcome with a Schr\""{o}dinger equation for
quantum geometrodynamics that describes evolution in intrinsic time. Unitary
time development with gauge-invariant temporal ordering is also viable. All
Kuchar observables become physical; and classical spacetime, with direct
correlation between its proper times and intrinsic time intervals, emerges from
constructive interference. The framework not only yields a physical Hamiltonian
for Einstein's theory, but also prompts natural extensions and improvements
towards a well behaved quantum theory of gravity. It is a consistent canonical
scheme to discuss Horava-Lifshitz theories with intrinsic time evolution, and
of the many possible alternatives that respect 3-covariance (rather than the

  convection-diffusion equation with variable convection coefficient",,,,,"math-ph math.MP math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a new family of implicit compact finite difference schemes for
computation of unsteady convection-diffusion equation with variable convection
coefficient is proposed. The schemes are fourth order accurate in space and
second or lower order accurate in time depending on the choice of weighted time
average parameter. The proposed schemes, where transport variable and its first
derivatives are carried as the unknowns, combine virtues of compact
discretization and Pad\'{e} scheme for spatial derivative. These schemes which
are based on five point stencil with constant coefficients, named as
\emph{(5,5) Constant Coefficient 4th Order Compact} [(5,5)CC-4OC], give rise to
a diagonally dominant system of equations and shows higher accuracy and better
phase and amplitude error characteristics than some of the standard methods.
These schemes are capable of using a grid aspect ratio other than unity and are
unconditionally stable. They efficiently capture both transient and steady
solutions of linear and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations with Dirichlet
as well as Neumann boundary condition. The proposed schemes can be easily
implemented and are applied to problems governed by incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations apart from linear convection-diffusion equation.
Results obtained are in excellent agreement with analytical and available
numerical results in all cases, establishing efficiency and accuracy of the
proposed scheme.

number in [1,n] can be written as a sum of distinct divisors of n. This
motivates us to define f(n) as the largest integer with the property that all
of 1, 2, 3,..., f(n) can be written as a sum of distinct divisors of n. (Thus,
n is practical precisely when f(n)\geq n.) We think of f(n) as measuring the
""practicality"" of n; large values of f correspond to numbers n which we term
practical pretenders. Our first theorem describes the distribution of these
impostors: Uniformly for 4 \leq y \leq x, #{n\leq x: f(n)\geq y} \asymp
\frac{x}{\log{y}}. This generalizes Saias's result that the count of practical
numbers in [1,x] is \asymp \frac{x}{\log{x}}.
  Next, we investigate the maximal order of f when restricted to non-practical
inputs. Strengthening a theorem of Hausman and Shapiro, we show that every n >
3 for which f(n) \geq \sqrt{e^{\gamma} n\log\log{n}} is a practical number.
  Finally, we study the range of f. Call a number m belonging to the range of f
an additive endpoint. We show that for each fixed A >0 and \epsilon > 0, the
number of additive endpoints in [1,x] is eventually smaller than x/(\log{x})^A

The renewal process is
known as bone remodelling and is operated by bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts)
and bone-forming cells (osteoblasts). Both biochemical and biomechanical
regulatory mechanisms have been identified in the interaction between
osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Here we focus on an additional and poorly
understood potential regulatory mechanism of bone cells, that involves the
morphology of the microstructure of bone. Bone cells can only remove and
replace bone at a bone surface. However, the microscopic availability of bone
surface depends in turn on the ever-changing bone microstructure. The
importance of this geometrical dependence is unknown and difficult to quantify
experimentally. Therefore, we develop a sophisticated mathematical model of
bone cell interactions that takes into account biochemical, biomechanical and
geometrical regulations. We then investigate numerically the influence of bone
surface availability in bone remodelling within a representative bone tissue
sample. The interdependence between the bone cells' activity, which modifies
the bone microstructure, and changes in the microscopic bone surface
availability, which in turn influences bone cell development and activity, is
implemented using a remarkable experimental relationship between bone specific
surface and bone porosity. Our model suggests that geometrical regulation of
the activation of new remodelling events could have a significant effect on
bone porosity and bone stiffness. On the other hand, geometrical regulation of
late stages of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation seems less
significant. We conclude that the development of osteoporosis is probably
accelerated by this geometrical regulation in cortical bone, but probably
slowed down in trabecular bone.

solving the word problem (equality testing). However, normal form computation
has a much wider range of applications. It is therefore interesting to
investigate the complexity of computing normal forms for important classes of
groups.
  For Coxeter groups we show that the following algorithmic tasks can be solved
by a deterministic Turing machine using logarithmic work space, only: 1.
Compute the length of any geodesic normal form. 2. Compute the set of letters
occurring in any geodesic normal form. 3. Compute the Parikh-image of any
geodesic normal form in case that all defining relations have even length
(i.e., in even Coxeter groups.) 4. For right-angled Coxeter groups we can do
actually compute the short length normal form in logspace. (Note that short
length normal forms are geodesic.)
  Next, we apply the results to right-angled Artin groups. They are also known
as free partially commutative groups or as graph groups. As a consequence of
our result on right-angled Coxeter groups we show that shortlex normal forms in
graph groups can be computed in logspace, too. Graph groups play an important
role in group theory, and they have a close connection to concurrency theory.
As an application of our results we show that the word problem for free
partially commutative inverse monoids is in logspace. This result generalizes a
result of Ondrusch and the third author on free inverse monoids. Concurrent
systems which are deterministic and co-deterministic can be studied via inverse
monoids.

search of known neutron stars a precise knowledge of the star parameters is
used to apply optimal filtering methods. In the absence of a signal detection,
in a few cases, an upper limit on strain amplitude can be set that beats the
spindown limit derived from attributing spin-down energy loss to the emission
of gravitational waves. In contrast, blind all-sky searches are not directed at
specific sources, but rather explore as large a portion of the parameter space
as possible. Fully coherent methods cannot be used for these kind of searches
which pose a non trivial computational challenge. The second part of the talk
is focused on SGWB searches. A stochastic background of gravitational waves is
expected to be produced by the superposition of many incoherent sources of
cosmological or astrophysical origin. Given the random nature of this kind of
signal, it is not possible to distinguish it from noise using a single
detector. A typical data analysis strategy relies on cross-correlating the data
from a pair or several pairs of detectors, which allows discriminating the
searched signal from instrumental noise. Expected sensitivities and prospects
for detection from the next generation of interferometers are also discussed

graph, and surprisingly find it give rise to a broad model of edge packing
problem, which itself falls into the model of forbidden subgraph problem.
Specifically, given a graph G(V;E) and a constant c, the problem asks to choose
as many as edges to form a subgraph G'. So that in G', for each edge, at least
one of its endpoints has degree no more than c. We call such G' partial c
degree bounded. When c = 1, it turns out to be the complement of dominating
set. We present several results about hardness, approximation for the general
graph and efficient exact algorithm on trees. This edge packing problem model
also has a direct interpretation in resource allocation. There are n types of
resources and m jobs. Each job needs two types of resources. A job can be
accomplished if either one of its necessary resources is shared by no more than

both the stellar and gas scale-heights to vary in order to estimate the best
fit parameters. We found that NGC 3621, NGC 3521 and DDO 154 are well fit by
MOND using expected values of the distance and M/L. NGC 2403 required a
moderately larger $M/L$ than expected and NGC 2903 required a substantially
larger value. The surprising result was that the scale-height of the dominant
baryonic component was well constrained by the rotation curves: the gas
scale-height for DDO 154 and the stellar scale-height for the others. In fact,
if the suggested stellar scale-height (one-fifth the stellar scale-length) was
used in the case of NGC 3621 and NGC 3521 it would not be possible to produce a
good fit to the inner rotation curve. For each of the four stellar dominated

dispersions of face on spirals. We conclude that modelling the gas

evolution of our Galaxy, not much is known about the origin of fluorine (F).
Models suggest that the F found in the Galaxy might have been produced mainly
in three different ways, namely, Type II supernovae, asymptotic giant branch
nucleosynthesis, or in the core of Wolf-Rayet stars. Only a few observational
measurements of F abundances are available in the literature and mostly for
objects whose characteristics might hamper an accurate determination of
fluorine abundance (e.g.,complex mixing and nucleosynthesis processes,
external/internal contamination). We derive the F abundances for a set of nine
cool main-sequence dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood, based on an unblended
line of the HF molecule at 2.3 microns. In addition, we study the s-process
elements of five of these stars. We acquire data using the high-resolution
IR-spectrograph CRIRES and gather FEROS data from the European Southern
Observatory archive. Several of the analysed stars seem to be slightly fluorine
enhanced with respect to the Sun, although no correlation is found between the
F abundance and the iron content. In addition, the most fluorine enriched stars
are also yttrium and zirconium enriched, which suggests that AGB fluorine
nucleosynthesis is the dominant source of fluorine production for the observed
stars. Nevertheless, the correlation between [F/Fe] and the s-elements is
rather weak and possibly masked by the uncertainties in the F abundance
measurements. Finally, we compare our derived F abundances to previous
measurements of alpha-element and iron-peak element abundances. Type II core
collapse Supernovae do not appear to be the main site of F production for our
targets, as no correlation seems to exist between the [F/Fe] and the [alpha/Fe]
ratios.

  In practice, verification problems for language classes that are not perfect

bounded languages if it is closed under Boolean operations relative to every

show that the class of languages accepted by multi-head pushdown automata are

The bi-directed, fast Doppler motion of explosive events observed

as a pair of bidirectional jets moving upward and downward from a reconnection
site. We discuss the problems of such a model. In our previous work, we focused
basically on the discrepancy of fast Doppler motion without detectable motion
in the image plane. We now suggest an alternative scenario for the explosive
events, based on our observations of spectral line tilts and bifurcated
structure in some events. Both features are indicative of rotational motion in
narrow structures. We explain the bifurcation as the result of rotation of
hollow cylindrical structures and demonstrate that such a sheath model can also
be applied to explain the nature of the puzzling `explosive events'. We find
that the spectral tilt, the lack of apparent motion, the bifurcation, and a
rapidly growing number of direct observations support an alternative scenario
of linear, spicular-sized jets with a strong spinning motion.

We show that the ratio of the two calculated classical Doppler Effects, with

respectively, remains constant equaling [1-(v^2/c^2)] : 1 , in all orientations
(longitudinal, transverse and any arbitrary angle). Furthermore, we show that
the Doppler Effect as predicted by special relativity, is in each and every

This leads to two contradicting conclusions: (1) by the receptor that the clock
associated with the emitter runs slow, and (2) by the emitter that the clock
associated with the receptor runs slow. These differences can be resolved if we
theorize that light travels at speed c with respect to the emitter as it leaves

approaches the receptor. The postulation that light travels at speed c with

  With very large MIMO, we think of systems that use antenna arrays with an
order of magnitude more elements than in systems being built today, say a
hundred antennas or more. Very large MIMO entails an unprecedented number of
antennas simultaneously serving a much smaller number of terminals. The
disparity in number emerges as a desirable operating condition and a practical
one as well. The number of terminals that can be simultaneously served is
limited, not by the number of antennas, but rather by our inability to acquire
channel-state information for an unlimited number of terminals. Larger numbers
of terminals can always be accommodated by combining very large MIMO technology
with conventional time- and frequency-division multiplexing via OFDM. Very
large MIMO arrays is a new research field both in communication theory,
propagation, and electronics and represents a paradigm shift in the way of
thinking both with regards to theory, systems and implementation. The ultimate
vision of very large MIMO systems is that the antenna array would consist of
small active antenna units, plugged into an (optical) fieldbus.

construct cosmological models from those solutions by smearing some dimensions

approaches the others as the time evolves. However, for Dp-brane ($p\le 7$)
without smearing branes, a singularity appears before branes collide. In

Evolution (LTE) orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular

mechanism for inferring the packet delays approximately from the buffer status
reports (BSR) transmitted by the UEs; the BSR reports only contain queue length
information. We then consider a constrained optimization problem with a concave
objective function - schedulers such as those based on utility maximization,
maximum weight scheduling, and recent results on iterative scheduling for small
queue/delay follow as special cases. In particular, the construction of the
non-differentiable objective function based on packet delays is novel. We model
constraints on bandwidth, peak transmit power at the UE, and the transmit power
spectral density (PSD) at the UE due to fractional power control. When
frequency diversity doesn't exist or is not exploited at a fast time-scale, we
use subgradient analysis to construct an O(N log L) (per iteration with small
number of iterations) algorithm to compute the optimal resource allocation for
N users and L points of non-differentiability in the objective function. For a
frequency diversity scheduler with M sub-bands, the corre- sponding complexity
per iteration is essentially O(N(M^2+L^2)). Unlike previous iterative policies
based on delay/queue, in our approach the complexity of scheduling can be
reduced when the coherence bandwidth is larger. Through detailed system
simulations (based on NGMN and 3GPP evaluation methodology) which model H-ARQ,
finite resource grants per sub-frame, deployment, realistic traffic, power
limitations, interference, and channel fading, we demonstrate the effectiveness

($\simeq 10$ Myr), intense burst of massive star formation which is expected to
lead to numerous core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Previous VLBI observations,
carried out with the EVN at 5.0 GHz and with the VLBA at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz,
resulted in the detection of a large number of compact, bright, non-thermal
sources in a region $\lsim$150 pc in size. We aim at establishing the nature of
all non-thermal, compact components in Arp 299-A, as well as estimating its
core-collapse supernova rate. We use multi-epoch European VLBI Network (EVN)
observations taken at 5.0 GHz to image with milliarcsecond resolution the
compact radio sources in the nuclear region of Arp 299-A. We also use one
single-epoch 5.0 GHz Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN)
observation to image the extended emission in which the compact radio sources
--traced by our EVN observations-- are embedded. Twenty-six compact sources are
detected, 8 of them are new objects not previously detected. The properties of
all detected objects are consistent with them being a mixed population of CCSNe
and SNRs. We find clear evidence for at least two new CCSNe, implying a lower
limit to the CCSN rate of $\nu_{\rm SN}\gsim$0.80 SN/yr indicating that the
bulk of the current star formation in Arp 299-A is taking place in the
innermost $\sim 150$ pc. Our MERLIN observations trace a region of diffuse,
extended emission which is co-spatial to the region where all compact sources
are found. From this diffuse, non-thermal radio emission we obtain an
independent estimate for the core-collapse supernova rate, which is in the
range $\nu_{\rm SN}=0.40$ - 0.65 SN/yr, roughly in agreement with previous
estimates and our direct estimate of the CCSN rate from the compact radio
emission.

fainter in the near-infrared than brighter radio sources at the same redshift,

infrared--radio correlation to separate our sample into radio-loud and
radio-quiet objects and show that only radio-loud hosts have spectral energy
distributions consistent with predominantly old stellar populations, although
the fraction of objects displaying such properties is a decreasing function of
radio luminosity. We calculate the 1.4-GHz radio luminosity function (RLF) in
redshift bins to z=4 and find that the space density of radio sources increases
with lookback time to z~2, with a more rapid increase for more powerful
sources. We demonstrate that radio-loud and radio-quiet sources of the same
radio luminosity evolve very differently. Radio-quiet sources display strong
evolution to z~2 while radio-loud AGNs below the break in the radio luminosity
function evolve more modestly and show hints of a decline in their space
density at z>1, with this decline occurring later for lower-luminosity objects.
If the radio luminosities of these sources are a function of their black hole
spins then slowly-rotating black holes must have a plentiful fuel supply for
longer, perhaps because they have yet to encounter the major merger that will
spin them up and use the remaining gas in a major burst of star formation.

an attractive experimental parasite for malaria research since it can infect
olive baboons (Papio anubis), non-human primates that have similar
host-pathogen interactions to humans. This study was carried out to determine
host immunological profiles provoked in olive baboons during the course of an
infection with Plasmodium knowlesi. A total of eight adult baboons were
intravenously inoculated with overnight cultured blood stage P. knowlesi H
strain parasites. Five of these baboons became acutely infected while the other
three became chronically infected. The immunological basis of this dual outcome
of the infection was determined by measuring circulating cytokine (T helper 1
and T helper 2) and antibody (immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M) responses
elicited in the infected baboons on a weekly basis by Enzyme Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for up to six weeks post infection. Generated data
for the first time indicated that acute P. knowlesi malaria is accompanied by
increased concentrations of interferon gamma (IFN gamma), tumour necrosis

10 (IL 10), IL 4, IL 12, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM in the baboon host.
These results are largely agreeable with data from human studies, thereby
increasing the relevance of the olive baboon - P. knowlesi experimental

nucleus (AGN) in the optical band. If these sources are powered by star
formation activity alone, they would be the most extreme X-ray luminosity star
forming galaxies known. We have investigated the mechanism driving the X-ray
luminosities of such galaxies by studying the X-ray emission of three moderate
redshift (z ~ 0.1) examples of this class, selected from a cross-correlation of
the SDSS-DR5 and 2XMMp-DR0 catalogues. X-ray spatial and long-term variability
diagnostics of these sources suggest that they are compact X-ray emitters. This
result is supported by the detection of rapid short term variability in an
observation of one of the sources. The X-ray spectra of all three sources are
best fitted with a simple absorbed power-law model, thus betraying no
significant signs of star formation. These results indicate that the X-ray
emission is powered by AGN activity. But why do these sources not display
optical AGN signatures? We show that the most likely explanation is that the
optical AGN emission lines are being diluted by star formation signatures from
within their host galaxies.

5-year lifetime. Gaia's science data comprises absolute astrometry, broad-band
photometry, and low-resolution spectro-photometry. Spectroscopic data with a
resolving power of 11,500 will be obtained for the brightest 150 million
sources, down to 17th magnitude. The thermo-mechanical stability of the
spacecraft, combined with the selection of the L2 Lissajous point of the
Sun-Earth/Moon system for operations, allows stellar parallaxes to be measured
with standard errors less than 10 micro-arcsecond (muas) for stars brighter
than 12th magnitude, 25 muas for stars at 15th magnitude, and 300 muas at
magnitude 20. Photometric standard errors are in the milli-magnitude regime.
The spectroscopic data allows the measurement of radial velocities with errors
of 15 km/s at magnitude 17. Gaia's primary science goal is to unravel the
kinematical, dynamical, and chemical structure and evolution of the Milky Way.
In addition, Gaia's data will touch many other areas of science, e.g., stellar
physics, solar-system bodies, fundamental physics, and exo-planets. The Gaia
spacecraft is currently in the qualification and production phase. With a
launch in 2013, the final catalogue is expected in 2021. The science community
in Europe, organised in the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC), is

belonging to the bluer part of the HB, are thought to be more He rich (\Delta
Y=0.03 or more) and more Na-rich/O-poor than those located in the redder part.
This hypothesis was only partially confirmed in NGC 6752, where stars of the
redder zero-age HB showed a He content of Y=0.25+-0.01, fully compatible with
the primordial He content of the Universe, and were all Na-poor/O-rich. Here we
study hot blue HB (BHB) stars in the GC NGC 6121 (M4) to measure their He plus
O/Na content. We observed 6 BHB stars using the UVES@VLT2 spectroscopic
facility. In addition to He, O, Na, and Fe abundances were estimated. Stars
turned out to be all Na-rich and O-poor and to have a homogeneous enhanced He
content with a mean value of Y=0.29+-0.01(random)+-0.01(systematic). The high
He content of blue HB stars in M4 is also confirmed by the fact that they are
brighter than red HB stars (RHB). Theoretical models suggest the BHB stars are
He-enhanced by \Delta Y=0.02-0.03 with respect to the RHB stars. The whole
sample of stars has a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.06+-0.02 (internal error). This
is a rare direct measurement of the (primordial) He abundance for stars
belonging to the Na-rich/O-poor population of GC stars in a temperature regime
where the He content is not altered by sedimentation or extreme mixing as
suggested for the hottest, late helium flash HB stars. Our results support
theoretical predictions that the Na-rich/O-poor population is also more He-rich
than the Na-poor/O-rich generation and that a leading contender for the 2^{nd}
parameter is the He abundance.

bow shock is optically thick and has developed a trapped ionization front. The
density at the head is at least five times larger than in the background
ionized gas. We discover a narrow arc of high T_e([N II]) values delineating
the southeast edge of the head. The temperature in this zone is about 1,000 K
higher than in the rest of the field and should correspond to a shock-heated
zone at the leading working surface of the gas flow. This is the first time
this kind of feature is observed in a photoionized HH object. We find that the

effects of the [O II] lines in the compressed gas at the head of the bow shock,

fundamentals of the RF-signal sampling technique, which has found widespread
applications in 'digital' oscilloscopes and sampling scopes, are discussed. The
key element in these front-ends is the Schottky diode which can be used either
as an RF mixer or as a single sampler. The spectrum analyser has become an
absolutely indispensable tool for RF signal analysis. Here the front-end is the
RF mixer as the RF section of modern spectrum analysers has a rather complex
architecture. The reasons for this complexity and certain working principles as
well as limitations are discussed. In addition, an overview of the development
of scalar and vector signal analysers is given. For the determination of the
noise temperature of a one-port and the noise figure of a two-port, basic
concepts and relations are shown. A brief discussion of commonly used noise
measurement techniques concludes the paper.

decidability question for equality of streams defined in a restricted format.
This restricted format consists of prefixing a symbol at the head of a stream,
of the stream function `zip', and recursion variables. Here `zip' interleaves
the elements of two streams in alternating order, starting with the first
stream. For example, the Thue-Morse sequence is obtained by the
`zip-specification' {M = 0 : X, X = 1 : zip(X,Y), Y = 0 : zip(Y,X)}. Our
analysis of such systems employs both term rewriting and coalgebraic
techniques. We establish decidability for these zip-specifications, employing
bisimilarity of observation graphs based on a suitably chosen cobasis. The
importance of zip-specifications resides in their intimate connection with
automatic sequences. We establish a new and simple characterization of
automatic sequences. Thus we obtain for the binary zip that a stream is
2-automatic iff its observation graph using the cobasis (hd,even,odd) is
finite. The generalization to zip-k specifications and their relation to
k-automaticity is straightforward. In fact, zip-specifications can be perceived
as a term rewriting syntax for automatic sequences. Our study of
zip-specifications is placed in an even wider perspective by employing the
observation graphs in a dynamic logic setting, leading to an alternative
characterization of automatic sequences. We further obtain a natural extension
of the class of automatic sequences, obtained by `zip-mix' specifications that
use zips of different arities in one specification. We also show that
equivalence is undecidable for a simple extension of the zip-mix format with
projections like even and odd. However, it remains open whether zip-mix
specifications have a decidable equivalence problem.

characterizations as well as several equivalent characterizations in terms of
the dynamics of the corresponding circle rotations. In this paper we
investigate how to generalize Roth-like Diophantine conditions to interval
exchange maps. If one considers the dynamics in parameter space one can
introduce two nonequivalent Roth-type conditions, the first (condition (Z)) by
means of the Zorich cocyle, the second (condition (A)) by means of a further
acceleration of the continued fraction algorithm introduced in [10]. A third
very natural condition (condition (D)) arises by considering the distance
between the discontinuity points of the iterates of the map. If one considers
the dynamics of an interval exchange map in phase space then one can introduce
the notion of Diophantine type by considering the asymptotic scaling of return
times pointwise or w.r.t. uniform convergence (resp. condition (R) and (U)). In
the case of circle rotations all the above conditions are equivalent. For
interval exchange maps of three intervals we show that (D) and (A) are
equivalent and imply (Z), (U) and (R) which are equivalent among them. For maps
of four intervals or more we prove several results, the only relation which we
cannot decide is whether (Z) implies (R) or not.

fourth\,-\,order gravity theories, where the acceleration of the Universe is a
consequence of departures from Einstein General Relativity, rather than the
sign of the existence of a fluid with negative pressure. In the
fourth\,-\,order gravity theories, the gravity Lagrangian is described by an
analytic function $f(R)$ of the scalar curvature $R$ subject to the demanding
conditions that no detectable deviations from standard GR is observed on the
Solar System scale. Here we consider two classes of $f(R)$ theories able to
pass Solar System tests and investigate their viability on cosmological scales.
To this end, we fit the theories to a large dataset including the combined
Hubble diagram of Type Ia Supernovae and Gamma Ray Bursts, the Hubble parameter
$H(z)$ data from passively evolving red galaxies, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
extracted from the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
and the distance priors from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe seven
years (WMAP7) data. We find that both classes of $f(R)$ fit very well this
large dataset with the present\,-\,day values of the matter density, Hubble
constant and deceleration parameter in agreement with previous estimates;
however, the strong degeneracy among the $f(R)$ parameters prevents us from
strongly constraining their values. We also derive the growth factor $g =
d\ln{\delta}/d\ln{a}$, with $\delta = \delta \rho_M/\rho_M$ the matter density
perturbation, and show that it can still be well approximated by $g(z) \propto
\Omega_M(z)^{\gamma}$. We finally constrain $\gamma$ (on some representative
scales) and investigate its redshift dependence to see whether future data can
discriminate between these classes of $f(R)$ theories and standard dark energy
models.

deformation and flow of amorphous materials. One such description, based on the
Shear Transformation Zone (STZ) theory, has recently been re-formulated within
a non-equilibrium thermodynamics framework, and found to be consistent with it.
We show here that a similar interpretation can be made for the Soft Glassy
Rheology (SGR) model. Conceptually this means that the ""noise temperature"" x,
proposed phenomenologically in the SGR model to control the dynamics of a set
of slow mesoscopic degrees of freedom, can consistently be interpreted as their
actual thermodynamic temperature. (Because such modes are slow to equilibrate,
this generally does not coincide with the temperature of the fast degrees of
freedom and/or heat bath.) If one chooses to make this interpretation, the
thermodynamic framework significantly constrains extensions of the SGR approach
to models in which x is a dynamical variable. We assess in this light some such
extensions recently proposed in the context of shear banding.

of this communication model in both discrete memoryless (DM) and memoryless
Gaussian cases. In particular the capacity region analysis demonstrates the
utility of the knowledge of the states only strictly causally at the encoder
that sends only the common message in general. More specifically, in the DM
setting we show that such a knowledge is beneficial and increases the capacity
region in general. In the Gaussian setting, we show that such a knowledge does
not help, and the capacity is same as if the states were completely unknown at
the encoder that sends only the common message. The analysis also reveals
optimal ways of exploiting the knowledge of the state only strictly causally at
the encoder that sends only the common message when such a knowledge is
beneficial. The encoders collaborate to convey to the decoder a lossy version
of the state, in addition to transmitting the information messages through a
generalized Gel'fand-Pinsker binning. Particularly important in this problem
are the questions of 1) optimal ways of performing the state compression and 2)
whether or not the compression indices should be decoded uniquely. We show that
both compression \`a-la noisy network coding, i.e., with no binning and
non-unique decoding, and compression using Wyner-Ziv binning with backward
decoding and non-unique or unique decoding are optimal.

dex) bolometric luminosities in combination with the light-curve analysis. Our
approach allows more precise comparisons with evolutionary theory than
previously possible. To our considerable surprise, we find a small, but
significant, systematic discrepancy: all of the stars are slightly
under-massive, by typically 11% (or over-luminous by 0.2 dex) compared to that

To characterize the information encoded in the fast dynamics of social

analysing a large dataset of phone-call interactions we show evidence that the
dynamical social network has an entropy that depends on the time of the day in
a typical week-day. Moreover we show evidence for adaptability of human social
behavior showing data on duration of phone-call interactions that significantly
deviates from the statistics of duration of face-to-face interactions. This
adaptability of behavior corresponds to a different information content of the
dynamics of social human interactions. We quantify this information by the use
of the entropy of dynamical networks on realistic models of social
interactions.

multiplets of fields may be identified at the functorial level. It is shown
that locally covariant theories that obey standard assumptions in Minkowski

Further, it is shown how the endomorphisms and automorphisms of a locally

an example, the endomorphisms and automorphisms of a system of finitely many

A well-known Boolean model of genetic regulatory networks is extended to
include changes in node connectivity based upon the current cell state, e.g.,
via transposable elements. The underlying behaviour of the resulting dynamical
networks is investigated before their evolvability is explored using a version
of the NK model of fitness landscapes. Structural dynamism is found to be
selected for in non-stationary environments and subsequently shown capable of
providing a mechanism for evolutionary innovation when such reorganizations are

survey of the region in search of the compact radio emission associated with
ultra-compact (UC) HII regions. Observations presented here encompass the
entire complex and have a maximum resolution of ~1.5x1.4"" and sensitivity of
~0.07 mJy beam^-1. By applying a data reduction method that emphasises
small-scale structure, we are able to detect 71 compact radio sources
distributed throughout the observed field. To explore the nature of these
compact radio sources we compare to mid-infrared data and in this way identify
56 background sources, eight stellar radio sources, a single bright-rimmed
cloud and six candidate UCHII regions. The physical properties of these
candidate UCHII regions are determined and reveal five candidates have peak
properties consistent with known UCHII regions with source radii ranging from
0.04-0.1 pc, emission measures from 2.56--10.3x10^-6 pc cm^-6 and electron
densities of 0.34--1.03x10^4 cm^-3. We comment on these sites of recent massive
star formation within G305 and by comparing to other star formation tracers
(masers, NH3, YSOs) build a picture of the star formation history of the
region. Using these results we estimate a lower limit to the star formation
rate for the region of ~0.003 Msun yr^-1.

terms of a quantum metalanguage. We suggest that, besides human ordinary
thought, which can be formalized in a computable, logical language, there is
another important kind of human thought, which is Turing-non-computable. This
is methatought, the process of thinking about ordinary thought. Metathought can
be formalized as a metalanguage, which speaks about and controls the logical
language of ordinary thought. Ordinary thought has two computational modes, the
quantum mode and the classical mode, the latter deriving from decoherence of
the former. In order to control the logical language of the quantum mode, one
needs to introduce a quantum metalanguage, which in turn requires a quantum
version of Tarski Convention T.
