heavy-ion collisions at the CERN LHC. Improvements of ALICE sub-detectors are
envisaged for the upgrade plans of year 2017. The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) is
a proposal in view of this upgrade, motivated both by the possibility to
overcome the intrinsic limitations of the Muon Spectrometer, and by the
possibility to perform new measurements of general interest for the whole ALICE
physics. The measurement of the offset of single muons and dimuons will permit
to disentangle open charm ($c\tau \sim 150 \mu$m) and beauty ($c\tau \sim 500
\mu$m) production. The MFT, thanks to its tracking capabilities, will allow to
improve the mass resolution of the resonances for a better separation between
$\rho/\omega$ and $\phi$, $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$, and $-$ to a lesser extent $-$
$\Upsilon$ family resonances. In addition, it will help to reject a large
fraction of muons coming from pion and kaon decays, improving the signal over
background ratio. In order to evaluate the feasibility of this upgrade, a setup
composed by five silicon planes was simulated within the AliRoot framework. In
this report, we present preliminary results on the MFT performances in a
low-multiplicity environment.

synchronous (TDS)-OFDM employs a known pseudo noise (PN) sequence as guard
interval (GI). Conventional channel estimation methods for TDS-OFDM are based
on the exploitation of the PN sequence and consequently suffer from intersymbol
interference (ISI). This paper proposes a novel dataaided channel estimation
method which combines the channel estimates obtained from the PN sequence and,
most importantly, additional channel estimates extracted from OFDM data
symbols. Data-aided channel estimation is carried out using the rebuilt OFDM
data symbols as virtual training sequences. In contrast to the classical turbo
channel estimation, interleaving and decoding functions are not included in the
feedback loop when rebuilding OFDM data symbols thereby reducing the
complexity. Several improved techniques are proposed to refine the data-aided
channel estimates, namely one-dimensional (1-D)/two-dimensional (2-D) moving
average and Wiener filtering. Finally, the MMSE criteria is used to obtain the
best combination results and an iterative process is proposed to progressively
refine the estimation. Both MSE and BER simulations using specifications of the
DTMB system are carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm even in very harsh channel conditions such as in the single frequency
network (SFN) case.

number changing processes can counteract Bose condensation, and there is a
considerable debate about the relevance of this phenomenon in this context. We
show that the involved question of Bose condensation from initial
over-population can be answered for the example of scalar field theories.
Condensate formation occurs as a consequence of an inverse particle cascade
with a universal power-law spectrum. This particle transport towards low
momenta is part of a dual cascade, in which energy is also transfered by weak
wave turbulence towards higher momenta. To highlight the importance of number
changing processes for the subsequent decay of the condensate, we also compare
to non-relativistic theories with exact number conservation. We discuss the
relevance of these results for nonabelian gauge theories.

Recently, vortex-like topological defects with six interlocked structural
antiphase and ferroelectric domains merging into a vortex core were revealed in
multiferroic hexagonal manganites. Numerous vortices are found to form an
intriguing self-organized network. Thus, it is imperative to find out the
magnetic nature of these vortices. Using cryogenic magnetic force microscopy,
we discovered unprecedented alternating net moments at domain walls around
vortices that can correlate over the entire vortex network in hexagonal ErMnO3
The collective nature of domain wall magnetism originates from the
uncompensated Er3+ moments and the correlated organization of the vortex
network. Furthermore, our proposed model indicates a fascinating phenomenon of
field-controllable spin chirality. Our results demonstrate a new route to
achieving magnetoelectric coupling at domain walls in single-phase
multiferroics, which may be harnessed for nanoscale multifunctional devices.

generalize a recently developed cellular automaton model for invasive tumor
growth in heterogeneous microenvironments [Y. Jiao and S. Torquato, PLoS

Specifically, we explicitly model the pressure exerted on the growing tumor due
to the deformation of the microenvironment and its effect on the local
tumor-host interface instability. Both noninvasive-proliferative growth and
invasive growth with individual cells that detach themselves from the primary
tumor and migrate into the surrounding microenvironment are investigated. We
find that while noninvasive tumors growing in ""soft"" homogeneous
microenvironments develop almost isotropic shapes, both high pressure and host
heterogeneity can strongly enhance malignant behavior, leading to finger-like
protrusions of the tumor surface. Moreover, we show that individual invasive
cells of an invasive tumor degrade the local extracellular matrix at the
tumor-host interface, which diminishes the fingering growth of the primary
tumor. The implications of our results for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and
therapy are discussed.

higher-order structural information about the textures? We present a novel
solution to this question by probing the information content of the widest

known to lead to the Bogoliubov- de Gennes equations. Here, we derive linear
response for fragmented Bose-Einstein condensates, i.e., for the case where the
many-body wave function is not a product of one, but of several single-particle
states (orbitals). Our approach is based on the number-conserving variational
time-dependent mean field theory [O. E. Alon, A. I. Streltsov, and L. S.
Cederbaum, Phys. Lett. A 362, 453 (2007)], which describes the time evolution
of best-mean field states. Correspondingly, we call our linear response theory
for fragmented states LR-BMF. In the derivation it follows naturally that
excitations are orthogonal to the ground-state orbitals. As applications
excitation spectra of Bose-Einstein condensates in double-well potentials are
calculated. Both symmetric and asymmetric double-wells are studied for several
interaction strengths and barrier heights. The cases of condensed and two-fold
fragmented ground states are compared. Interestingly, even in such situations
where the response frequencies of the two cases are computed to be close to
each other, which is the situation for the excitations well below the barrier,
striking differences in the density response in momentum space are found. For
excitations with an energy of the order of the barrier height, both the
energies and the density response of condensed and fragmented systems are very
different. In fragmented systems there is a class of ""swapped"" excitations
where an atom is transfered to the neighboring well. The mechanism of its
origin is discussed. In asymmetric wells, the response of a fragmented system
is purely local (i.e., finite in either one or the other well) with different
frequencies for the left and right fragments.

decode low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over discrete memoryless channels

used with any exponential family distribution over the cliques in the graph.
Second, it can impose additional constraints on the marginal distributions. We
use this second property to impose pair-wise marginal constraints over pairs of
variables connected to a check node of the LDPC code's Tanner graph. Thanks to
these additional constraints, the Tree-EP marginal estimates for each variable
in the graph are more accurate than those provided by BP. We also reformulate
the Tree-EP algorithm for the binary erasure channel (BEC) as a peeling-type
algorithm (TEP) and we show that the algorithm has the same computational
complexity as BP and it decodes a higher fraction of errors. We describe the
TEP decoding process by a set of differential equations that represents the
expected residual graph evolution as a function of the code parameters. The
solution of these equations is used to predict the TEP decoder performance in
both the asymptotic regime and the finite-length regime over the BEC. While the
asymptotic threshold of the TEP decoder is the same as the BP decoder for
regular and optimized codes, we propose a scaling law (SL) for finite-length
LDPC codes, which accurately approximates the TEP improved performance and
facilitates its optimization.

conventional ferromagnetic regime. We also point out that the spin gap in both
the nematic and conventional ferromagnetic phases is of the order of

realized and detected in cold atomic systems with present technology.

as many vertices as possible.
  The surviving rate $\rho(G)$ of $G$ is defined as the expected percentage of

Let $\tau_k = k+2-\frac {1}{k+2}$. We show that for any $\epsilon >0$ and $k

$\sim$13.2 kpc (previously 5 to 9 kpc) based on: 1) it has an absorption
feature at -10$\pm$5 km s$^{-1}$ from the far 3-kpc arm, so CTB 37B is behind
it; 2) there is absorption at -30 km s$^{-1}$ but not at -26 km s$^{-1}$, which
yields the distance value; 3) the HI column density towards CTB 37B
($\sim8.3\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) is larger than CTB 37A. In summary, CTB 37A,
CTB 37B and G348.5+0.0 are all at different distances and are only by chance

based on Transfer Entropy to reconstruct approximations to network structural
connectivities from network activity monitored through calcium fluorescence
imaging. Based on information theory, our method requires no prior assumptions
on the statistics of neuronal firing and neuronal connections. The performance
of our algorithm is benchmarked on surrogate time-series of calcium
fluorescence generated by the simulated dynamics of a network with known
ground-truth topology. We find that the effective network topology revealed by
Transfer Entropy depends qualitatively on the time-dependent dynamic state of
the network (e.g., bursting or non-bursting). We thus demonstrate how
conditioning with respect to the global mean activity improves the performance
of our method. [...] Compared to other reconstruction strategies such as
cross-correlation or Granger Causality methods, our method based on improved
Transfer Entropy is remarkably more accurate. In particular, it provides a good
reconstruction of the network clustering coefficient, allowing to discriminate
between weakly or strongly clustered topologies, whereas on the other hand an
approach based on cross-correlations would invariantly detect artificially high
levels of clustering. Finally, we present the applicability of our method to
real recordings of in vitro cortical cultures. We demonstrate that these
networks are characterized by an elevated level of clustering compared to a
random graph (although not extreme) and by a markedly non-local connectivity.

deflects the hair bundles atop hair cells. As hair bundles move, the viscous
friction between stereocilia and the surrounding liquid poses a fundamental
challenge to the ear's high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. Part
of the solution to this problem lies in the active process that uses energy for
frequency-selective sound amplification. Here we demonstrate that a
complementary part involves the fluid-structure interaction between the liquid
within the hair bundle and the stereocilia. Using force measurement on a
dynamically scaled model, finite-element analysis, analytical estimation of
hydrodynamic forces, stochastic simulation and high-resolution interferometric
measurement of hair bundles, we characterize the origin and magnitude of the
forces between individual stereocilia during small hair-bundle deflections. We
find that the close apposition of stereocilia effectively immobilizes the
liquid between them, which reduces the drag and suppresses the relative
squeezing but not the sliding mode of stereociliary motion. The obliquely
oriented tip links couple the mechanotransduction channels to this least
dissipative coherent mode, whereas the elastic horizontal top connectors
stabilize the structure, further reducing the drag. As measured from the
distortion products associated with channel gating at physiological stimulation
amplitudes of tens of nanometres, the balance of forces in a hair bundle
permits a relative mode of motion between adjacent stereocilia that encompasses
only a fraction of a nanometre. A combination of high-resolution experiments
and detailed numerical modelling of fluid-structure interactions reveals the
physical principles behind the basic structural features of hair bundles and
shows quantitatively how these organelles are adapted to the needs of sensitive
mechanotransduction.

networks. Communities, also known as clusters or modules, are typically
considered to be densely interconnected groups of nodes that are only sparsely
connected to other groups in the network. Discovering high quality communities
is a difficult and important problem in a number of areas. The most popular
approach is the objective function known as modularity, used both to discover
communities and to measure their strength. To understand the modular structure
of networks it is then crucial to know how such functions evaluate different
topologies, what features they account for, and what implicit assumptions they
may make. We show that trees and treelike networks can have unexpectedly and
often arbitrarily high values of modularity. This is surprising since trees are
maximally sparse connected graphs and are not typically considered to possess
modular structure, yet the nonlocal null model used by modularity assigns low
probabilities, and thus high significance, to the densities of these sparse
tree communities. We further study the practical performance of popular methods
on model trees and on a genealogical data set and find that the discovered
communities also have very high modularity, often approaching its maximum
value. Statistical tests reveal the communities in trees to be significant, in
contrast with known results for partitions of sparse, random graphs.

Using flux upper limits, we show that the Fornax cluster provides the most
stringent constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section. Stacking a
large sample of nearby clusters does not help improve the limit for most dark

important for setting robust limits on the dark matter annihilation cross

predict the expected dark matter annihilation signals from the Fornax cluster,
by taking into account effects of dark matter contraction and substructures. By
modeling the mass distribution of baryons (stars and gas) around a central
bright elliptical galaxy, NGC 1399, and using a modified contraction model
motivated by numerical simulations, we show that the dark matter contraction
boosts the annihilation signatures by a factor of 4. For dark matter masses
around 10 GeV, the upper limit obtained on the annihilation cross section times

global simulations of the magnetothermal instability (MTI) and the
heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and assess the effects of viscosity
on their saturation and astrophysical implications. We find that viscosity has
only a modest effect on the saturation of the MTI. As in previous calculations,
we find that the MTI can generate nearly sonic turbulent velocities in the
outer parts of galaxy clusters, although viscosity somewhat suppresses the
magnetic field amplification. At smaller radii in cool-core clusters, viscosity
can decrease the linear growth rates of the HBI. However, it has less of an
effect on the HBI's nonlinear saturation, in part because three-dimensional
interchange motions (magnetic flux tubes slipping past each other) are not
damped by anisotropic viscosity. In global simulations of cool core clusters,
we show that the HBI robustly inhibits radial thermal conduction and thus
precipitates a cooling catastrophe. The effects of viscosity are, however, more
important for higher entropy clusters. We argue that viscosity can contribute
to the global transition of cluster cores from cool-core to non cool-core
states: additional sources of intracluster turbulence, such as can be produced
by AGN feedback or galactic wakes, suppress the HBI, heating the cluster core
by thermal conduction; this makes the ICM more viscous, which slows the growth
of the HBI, allowing further conductive heating of the cluster core and a
transition to a non cool-core state.

and DZ) and white dwarfs with dusty disks possess planetary systems, but a
specific physical mechanism by which planetesimals are perturbed close to a
white dwarf has not yet been fully posited. In this paper we demonstrate that
mass loss from a central star during post main sequence evolution can sweep
planetesimals into interior mean motion resonances with a single giant planet.
These planetesimals are slowly removed through chaotic excursions of
eccentricity that in time create radial orbits capable of tidally disrupting
the planetesimal. Numerical N-body simulations of the Solar System show that a
sufficient number of planetesimals are perturbed to explain white dwarfs with
both dust and metal pollution, provided other white dwarfs have more massive
relic asteroid belts. Our scenario requires only one Jupiter-sized planet and a
sufficient number of asteroids near its 2:1 interior mean motion resonance.
Finally, we show that once a planetesimal is perturbed into a tidal crossing
orbit, it will become disrupted after the first pass of the white dwarf, where
a highly eccentric stream of debris forms the main reservoir for dust producing
collisions. These simulations, in concert with observations of white dwarfs,
place interesting limits on the frequency of planetary systems around main
sequence stars, the frequency of planetesimal belts, and the probability that
dust may obscure future terrestrial planet finding missions.

scenarios due to uncertainties in the abundance of faint galaxies and the
escape fraction of ionizing photons. We show that requiring continuity with
post-reionization (z<6) measurements, where the Lya forest provides a complete
probe of the cosmological emissivity of ionizing photons, significantly reduces
the permitted parameter space. Models that are simultaneously consistent with
the measured UV luminosity function, the Thomson optical depth to the CMB, and
the Lya forest data require either: 1) extrapolation of the galaxy luminosity
function down to very faint UV magnitudes M_lim ~ -10, corresponding roughly to
the UV background suppression scale; 2) an increase of f_esc by a factor > ~10
from z=4 (where the best fit is 4%) to z=9; or 3) more likely, a hybrid
solution in which undetected galaxies contribute significantly and f_esc
increases more modestly. Models in which star formation is strongly suppressed
in low-mass, reionization-epoch haloes of mass up to ~10^10 M_sun (e.g., owing
to a metallicity dependence) are only allowed for extreme assumptions for the
evolution of f_esc. However, variants of such models in which the suppression
mass is reduced (e.g., assuming an earlier or higher metallicity floor) are in
better agreement with the data. Concordance scenarios satisfying the available
data predict a consistent redshift of 50% ionized fraction z_reion(50%) ~ 10.
On the other hand, the duration of reionization is sensitive to the relative
contribution of bright versus faint galaxies, with scenarios dominated by faint
galaxies predicting a more extended reionization event. Scenarios relying too
heavily on high-z dwarfs are disfavored by kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich
measurements, which prefer a short reionization history.

systems with long-range interactions. Equilibrium properties of simple models
with long-range interactions are well understood and exhibit exotic behaviors :
negative specific heat and inequivalence of statistical ensembles for instance.
  The understanding of the dynamical evolution in the case of long-range
interacting systems still represents a theoretical challenge. Phenomena such as
out-of-equilibrium phase transitions or quasi-stationary states have been found
even in simple models.
  The purpose of the present thesis is to investigate the dynamical properties
of systems with long-range interactions, specializing on one-dimensional
models. The appropriate kinetic description for these systems is the Vlasov
equation. A numerical simulation tool for the Vlasov equation is developed.
  A detailed study of the out-of-equilibrium phase transition occuring in the
Free-Electron Laser is performed and the transition is analyzed with the help
of Lynden-Bell's theory.
  Then, the presence of stretching and folding in phase space for the
Hamiltonian Mean-Field model is studied and quantified from the point of view
of fluid dynamics. Finally, a system of uncoupled pendula for which the
asymptotic states are similar to the ones of the Hamiltonian Mean-Field model
is introduced. Its asymptotic evolution is predicted via both Lynden-Bell's
theory and an exact computation. This system displays a fast initial evolution
similar to the violent relaxation found for interacting systems. Moreover, an
out-of-equilibrium phase transition is found if one imposes a self-consistent
condition on the system.
  In summary, the present thesis discusses original results related to the
occurence of quasi-stationary states and out-of-equilibrium phase transitions

main-sample galaxies in the redshift range 0.003<z<0.05. We have fit each
galaxy with either a de Vaucouleurs ('classical') or an exponential ('pseudo-')
bulge and an exponential disk. Two dimensional Sersic fits are performed when
the 2-component fits are not statistically significant or when the fits are
poor, even in the presence of high signal-to-noise. We study the robustness of
our 2-component fits by studying a bright subsample of galaxies and we study
the systematics of these fits with decreasing resolution and S/N. Only 30% of
our sample have been fit with two-component fits in which both components are
non-zero. The g-r and g-i colours of each component for the two-component
models are determined using linear templates derived from the r-band model. We
attempt a physical classification of types of fits into disk galaxies,
pseudo-bulges, classical bulges, and ellipticals. Our classification of
galaxies agrees well with previous large B+D decomposed samples. Using our
galaxy classifications, we find that Petrosian concentration is a good
indicator of B/T, while overall Sersic index is not. Additionally, we find that
the majority of green valley galaxies are bulge+disk galaxies. Furthermore, in
the transition from green to red B+D galaxies, the total galaxy colour is most
strongly correlated with the disk colour.

regarded as a confined analogue of electron stars. Depending on the parameters
such as the mass and charge of the bulk fermion field, we found three different
phase structures when we change the values of total charge density at zero
temperature. In one of the three cases, our confined solution (called soliton
star) is always stable and this solution approaches to the electron star away
from the tip. In both the second and third case, we find a
confinement/deconfinement phase transition. Moreover, in the third one, there
is a strong indication that the soliton star decays into an inhomogeneous
solution. We also analyze the probe fermion equations (in the WKB

presence of many fermi-surfaces in the system.

supernova 2011dh, performed over the first 100 days of its evolution and
spanning 1-40 GHz in frequency. The radio emission is well-described by the
self-similar propagation of a spherical shockwave, generated as the supernova
ejecta interact with the local circumstellar environment. Modeling this
emission with a standard synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) model gives an
average expansion velocity of v \approx 0.1c, supporting the classification of
the progenitor as a compact star (R_* \approx 10^11 cm). We find that the
circumstellar density is consistent with a {\rho} \propto r^-2 profile. We
determine that the progenitor shed mass at a constant rate of \approx 3 \times
10^-5 M_\odot / yr, assuming a wind velocity of 1000 km / s (values appropriate
for a Wolf-Rayet star), or \approx 7 \times 10^-7 M_\odot / yr assuming 20 km /
s (appropriate for a yellow supergiant [YSG] star). Both values of the
mass-loss rate assume a converted fraction of kinetic to magnetic energy
density of {\epsilon}_B = 0.1. Although optical imaging shows the presence of a
YSG, the rapid optical evolution and fast expansion argue that the progenitor
is a more compact star - perhaps a companion to the YSG. Furthermore, the
excellent agreement of the radio properties of SN 2011dh with the SSA model
implies that any YSG companion is likely in a wide, non-interacting orbit.

radio emission to be 0.25 +- 0.08 mas by fitting a spherical shell model
directly to the visibility measurements. At a distance of 8.4 Mpc this angular
radius corresponds to a time-averaged (since t=0) expansion velocity of the
forward shock of 21000 +- 7000 km/s. Our measured values of the radius of the

synchrotron self-absorbed models to the radio spectral energy distribution,
providing strong confirmation for the latter method of estimating the radius.

combined interpretation of stellar and nebular emission in wide ranges of
observations. This approach relies on the Bayesian analysis of any type of
galaxy spectral energy distribution using a comprehensive library of synthetic
spectra assembled using state-of-the-art models of star formation and chemical
enrichment histories, stellar population synthesis, nebular emission and
attenuation by dust. We focus on the constraints set by 5-band photometry and
low- and medium-resolution spectroscopy at optical rest wavelengths on a set of
physical parameters characterizing the stars and the interstellar medium. Since
these parameters cannot be known a priori for any galaxy sample, we assess the
accuracy to which they can be retrieved by simulating `pseudo-observations'
using models with known parameters. Assuming that these models are good
approximations of true galaxies, we find that the combined analysis of stellar
and nebular emission in low-resolution galaxy spectra provides valuable
constraints on all physical parameters. At higher resolution, the analysis of
the combined stellar and nebular emission in 12,660 SDSS star-forming galaxies
using our approach yields likelihood distributions of stellar mass, gas-phase
oxygen abundance, optical depth of the dust and specific star formation rate
similar to those obtained in previous separate analyses of the stellar and
nebular emission at the original (twice higher) SDSS spectral resolution. We
show that the constraints derived on galaxy physical parameters from these
different types of observations depend sensitively on signal-to-noise ratio.
Our approach can be extended to the analysis of any type of observation across
the wavelength range covered by spectral evolution models. [abridged]

has yielded 37,000 high quality redshifts in our first 5.3 sq.degs of the SWIRE
XMM-LSS field. We use three different approaches to estimate our redshift
errors and find robust agreement. Over the full range of 3.6micron fluxes of
our selection, we find typical uncertainties of sigma_z/(1+z) < 0.015. In
comparisons with previously published VVDS redshifts, for example, we find a
scatter of sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.012 for galaxies at 0.8< z< 1.2. For galaxies
brighter and fainter than i=23 mag, we find sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.009 and
sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.025, respectively. Notably, our low-dispersion spectroscopy
and analysis yields comparable redshift uncertainties and success rates for
both red and blue galaxies, largely eliminating color-based systematics that
can seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolution on environment.

Cabibbo-suppressed two-body hadronic decays of charmed mesons using the
topological-diagram approach. In this approach, the magnitude and the phase of
topological weak annihilation amplitudes which arise mainly from final-state
rescattering can be extracted from the data. Consequently, direct CP asymmetry
$a_{dir}^{\rm (tree)}$ at tree level can be reliably estimated. In general, it
lies in the range $10^{-4}<a_{dir}^{\rm (tree)}<10^{-3}$. Short-distance QCD
penguins and penguin annihilation are calculated using QCD factorization. Their
effects are generally small, especially for $D\to VP$ modes. Since weak penguin
annihilation receives long-distance contributions from the color-allowed tree
amplitude followed by final-state rescattering, it is expected to give the
dominant contribution to the direct CP violation in the decays $D^0\to K^+K^-$
and $D^0\to \pi^+\pi^-$ in which $a_{dir}^{\rm (tree)}$ is absent. The maximal
$\Delta a_{CP}^{\rm dir}$, the direct CP asymmetry difference between the
above-mentioned two modes, allowed in the SM is around -0.25%, more than
$2\sigma$ away from the current world average of $-(0.645\pm 0.180)%$.

impact on the structure and properties of, for example, organic molecules is
well-established. Here, we demonstrate that hybridization also dramatically
impacts the shapes of small alkali metal clusters. The seemingly similar and
valence-iso-electronic LiNa4- and LiK4- clusters adopt very different global
minimum structures: LiNa4- is a planar C2v (1A1) species distorted from the
perfect pentagon due to the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect, and LiK4- is a planar
square D4h (1A1g) species with Li being in the centre. This effect is rooted in
the different degrees of the 2s-2p hybridization in Li in response to binding
to Na versus K. Li inside the Na cluster exhibits a strong 2s-2p mixing, to
achieve stronger covalent bonding. In contrast, Li inside of the K cluster does
not show any hybridization, and the LiK4- cluster is reminiscent of an ionic
salt. These differences are tied to the relative electronegativities of Li, Na,
and K, and overlap of the valence atomic orbitals of Li with those of Na versus
those of K. Atomic orbital hybridization is thus a pronounced effect in
clusters, the understanding of which is important for the use of clusters in
material science or catalysis, and designing clusters of desired shapes.

operators intrinsically associated to a parabolic geometry on a manifold. The
corresponding equations include those controlling infinitesimal automorphisms,
higher symmetries, and many other widely studied PDE of geometric origin. The
machinery of BGG sequences also singles out a subclass of solutions called
normal solutions. These correspond to parallel tractor fields and hence to
(certain) holonomy reductions of the canonical normal Cartan connection. Using
the normal Cartan connection, we define a special class of local frames for any
natural vector bundle associated to a parabolic geometry. We then prove that
the coefficient functions of any normal solution of a first BGG operator with
respect to such a frame are polynomials in the normal coordinates of the
parabolic geometry. A bound on the degree of these polynomials in terms of
representation theory data is derived. For geometries locally isomorphic to the
homogeneous model of the geometry we explicitly compute the local frames
mentioned above. Together with the fact that on such structures all solutions
are normal, we obtain a complete description of all first BGG solutions in this
case. Finally, we prove that in the general case the polynominal system coming
from a normal solution is the pull-back of a polynomial system that solves the
corresponding problem on the homogeneous model. Thus we can derive a complete
list of potential normal solutions on curved geometries. Morover, questions
concerning the zero locus of solutions, as well as related finer geometric and
smooth data, are reduced to a study of polynomial systems and real algebraic

saturation of LSDs seen in simulations. For the simplest so called ""{\alpha}2""
LSDs in periodic boxes, the electromotive force driving LSD growth depends on
the difference between the time-integrated kinetic and current helicity
associated with fluctuations. When the system is helically kinetically forced
(KF), the growth of the large scale helical field is accompanied by growth of
small scale magnetic (and current) helicity which ultimately quench the LSD.
Here, using both simulations and theory, we study the complementary
magnetically forced(MF) case in which the system is forced with an electric
field that supplies magnetic helicity. For this MF case, the kinetic helicity
becomes the back-reactor that saturates the LSD. Simulations of both MF and KF
cases can be approximately modeled with the same equations of magnetic helicity
evolution, but with complementary initial conditions. A key difference between
KF and MF cases is that the helical large scale field in the MF case grows with
the same sign of injected magnetic helicity, whereas the large and small scale
magnetic helicities grow with opposite sign for the KF case. The MF case can
arise even when the thermal pressure is approximately smaller than the magnetic
pressure, and requires only that helical small scale magnetic fluctuations
dominate helical velocity fluctuations in LSD driving. We suggest that LSDs in
accretion discs and Babcock models of the solar dynamo are actually MF LSDs.

superimposed on which are multiple sharp fronts that have slow and fast
components. The disturbance originates in front of erupting coronal loops and
some sharp fronts undergo accelerations, both effects implying that the
disturbance is driven by a CME. The diffuse pulse, propagating at a uniform
velocity of 204-238 km/s with very little angular dependence within its extent
in the south, maintains its coherence and stable profile for ~30 minutes. Its
arrival at increasing distances coincides with the onsets of loop expansions
and the slow sharp front. The fast sharp front overtakes the slow front,
producing multiple ""ripples"" and steepening the local pulse, and both fronts
propagate independently afterwards. This behavior resembles the nature of real
waves. Unexpectedly, the amplitude and FWHM of the diffuse pulse decrease
linearly with distance. A hybrid model, combining both wave and non-wave
components, can explain many, but not all, of the observations. Discoveries of
the two-component fronts and multiple ripples were made possible for the first

the point mass. The simulations for this study avoid complications arising from
boundary conditions by keeping the boundaries far from the accreting object.
Our simulations leverage adaptive refinement methodology to attain high spatial
fidelity close to the accreting object. Our results are particularly relevant
to the problem of star formation from a magnetized molecular cloud in which
thermal energy is radiated away on time scales much shorter than the dynamical
time scale. Contrary to the adiabatic case, our simulations show convergence
toward a finite accretion rate in the limit in which the radius of the
accreting object vanishes, regardless of magnetic field strength. For very weak
magnetic fields, the accretion rate first approaches the Bondi value and then
drops by a factor ~ 2 as magnetic flux builds up near the point mass. For
strong magnetic fields, the steady-state accretion rate is reduced by a factor
~ 0.2 \beta^{1/2} compared to the Bondi value, where \beta is the ratio of the
gas pressure to the magnetic pressure. We give a simple expression for the
accretion rate as a function of the magnetic field strength. Approximate
analytic results are given in the Appendixes for both time-dependent accretion

ferromagnetic rare-earth orthochromites, RCrO3 (R=rare-earth) only when the
rare-earth ion is magnetic. Intriguingly, the ferroelectricity in ErCrO3 (TC =
133 K) disappears at a spin-reorientation (Morin) transition (TSR ~ 22 K) below
which the weak ferromagnetism associated with the Cr-sublattice also
disappears, demonstrating the crucial role of weak ferromagnetism in inducing
ferroelectricity. Further, the ferroelectric polarization (P) could be reversed
by reversing the spontaneous magnetization (M) by changing the polarity of
magnetic field, indicating a strong magnetoelectric effect. We suggest that the
ferroelectricity occurs in RCrO3, due to the combined effect of poling field
that breaks the symmetry and the exchange field on R-ion from Cr-sublattice
stabilizes the polar state. We propose that a similar mechanism could work in
the isostructural rare-earth orthoferrites, RFeO3 as well.

wireless relaying scenario is considered. It was observed by Koike-Akino et al.
for the two way relaying scenario, that adaptively changing the network coding
map used at the relay according to the channel conditions greatly reduces the
impact of multiple access interference which occurs at the relay during the MA
Phase and all these network coding maps should satisfy a requirement called
exclusive law. We extend this approach to an Accumulate-Compute and Forward
protocol which employs two phases: Multiple Access (MA) phase consisting of two
channel uses with independent messages in each channel use, and Broadcast (BC)
phase having one channel use. Assuming that the two users transmit points from
the same 4-PSK constellation, every such network coding map that satisfies the
exclusive law can be represented by a Latin Square with side 16, and
conversely, this relationship can be used to get the network coding maps
satisfying the exclusive law. Two methods of obtaining this network coding map
to be used at the relay are discussed. Using the structural properties of the
Latin Squares for a given set of parameters, the problem of finding all the
required maps is reduced to finding a small set of maps. Having obtained all
the Latin Squares, the set of all possible channel realizations is quantized,
depending on which one of the Latin Squares obtained optimizes the performance.
The quantization thus obtained, is shown to be the same as the one obtained in
[7] for the 2-stage bidirectional relaying.

the NGC 6357 complex, concentrating on the most massive star cluster within the
complex: Pismis 24. We discover two new young clusters in the NGC 6357 complex.
We give a revised distance estimate for Pismis 24 of 1.7+-0.2 kpc. We find that
the massive star Pis 24-18 is a binary system, with the secondary being the
main X-ray source of the pair. We derive the cluster mass function and find
that up to the completeness limit at low masses it agrees well with the IMF of
the Trapezium cluster. We derive a median age of 1 Myr for the Pismis 24
cluster members. We find five proplyds in HST archival imaging of the cluster,
four of which are newly found. In all cases the proplyd tails are pointing
directly away from the massive star system Pis 24-1. One proplyd shows a second
tail, pointing away from Pis 24-2, suggesting this object is being
photoevaporated from two directions simultaneously. We find that the global
disk frequency (~30%) in Pismis 24 is much lower than some other clusters of
similar age, such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. When comparing the disk
frequencies in 19 clusters/star-forming regions of various ages and different
(massive) star content, we find that the disks in clusters harboring extremely
massive stars (typically earlier than O5), like Pismis 24, are dissipated
roughly twice as quickly as in clusters/star-forming regions without extremely
massive stars. Within Pismis 24, we find that the disk frequency within a
projected distance of 0.6 pc from Pis 24-1 is substantially lower than at
larger radii (~19% vs. ~37%). We argue for a combination of photoevaporation
and irradiation with ionizing UV photons from nearby massive stars, causing
increased MRI-induced turbulence and associated accretion activity, to play an
important role in the dissipation of low-mass star disks in Pismis 24.

  In this paper we take a first look at the evolving connectivity of large

study trends in the connectivity of the networks, neighbor diversity and
geographical spread, their hierarchy, the adoption of IXPs as a convenient

content providers gradually increase and diversify their connectivity, enabling
them to improve their centrality in the graph, and as a result, tier-1 networks
lose dominance over time.

magnetic field are investigated by using exact Bethe-ansatz solutions. We argue
that not only quasiparticles called psinon and antipsinon but also a
quasiparticle representing a 2-string in the Bethe ansatz plays an important
role for dynamical properties in a magnetic field. Combined with psinon and
antipsinon, the quasiparticle for a 2-string forms a continuum in the
high-energy regime for transverse dynamical structure factor
$S^{+-}(k,\omega)$. In the zero-field limit, the continuum is located on the
mode of the lowest excited states in zero field called the des
Cloizeaux-Pearson mode. In a magnetic field, the continuum separates from other
low-energy continua, and reduces to the mode of bound states of overturned
spins from the fully polarized state near the saturation field. We confirm the
relevance through comparisons with available experimental results on the
quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet CuCl$_2\cdot$2N(C$_5$D$_5$).

input consists of a finite set of variables and a finite set of constraints,
and where the task is to decide whether there exists a satisfying assignment of
values to the variables. Depending on the type of constraints that we allow in
the input, a CSP might be tractable, or computationally hard. In recent years,
general criteria have been discovered that imply that a CSP is polynomial-time
tractable, or that it is NP-hard. Finite-domain CSPs have become a major common
research focus of graph theory, artificial intelligence, and finite model
theory. It turned out that the key questions for complexity classification of
CSPs are closely linked to central questions in universal algebra.
  This thesis studies CSPs where the variables can take values from an infinite
domain. This generalization enhances dramatically the range of computational
problems that can be modeled as a CSP. Many problems from areas that have so
far seen no interaction with constraint satisfaction theory can be formulated
using infinite domains, e.g. problems from temporal and spatial reasoning,
phylogenetic reconstruction, and operations research.
  It turns out that the universal-algebraic approach can also be applied to
study large classes of infinite-domain CSPs, yielding elegant complexity
classification results. A new tool in this thesis that becomes relevant
particularly for infinite domains is Ramsey theory. We demonstrate the
feasibility of our approach with two complete complexity classification
results: one on CSPs in temporal reasoning, the other on a generalization of
Schaefer's theorem for propositional logic to logic over graphs. We also study
the limits of complexity classification, and present classes of computational
problems provably do not exhibit a complexity dichotomy into hard and easy
problems.

from the viewpoint of the Wilsonian renormalization group and argue that
quadratic divergences, which can always be absorbed into a position of the
critical surface, should be simply subtracted in model constructions. Such a
picture gives another justification to the argument that the scale invariance
of the SM, except for the soft-breaking terms, is an alternative solution to
the naturalness problem. It also largely broadens possibilities of model
constructions beyond the SM since we just need to take care of logarithmic
divergences, which cause mixings of various physical scales and runnings of

and statistical mechanics. The problems in continuum mechanics concern
mathematical modelling of viscoelastic bodies (Sect. 1), and unsteady motion of
a particle in a viscous fluid, i.e. the Basset problem (Sect. 2). In the former
analysis fractional calculus leads us to introduce intermediate models of
viscoelasticity which generalize the classical spring-dashpot models. The
latter analysis induces us to introduce a hydrodynamic model suitable to
revisit in Sect. 3 the classical theory of the Brownian motion, which is a
relevant topic in statistical mechanics. By the tools of fractional calculus we
explain the long tails in the velocity correlation and in the displacement

is obtained from the classical diffusion equation by replacing the first-order

analysis we express the fundamental solutions (the Green functions) in terms of
two interrelated auxiliary functions in the similarity variable, which turn out
to be of Wright type (see Appendix), and to distinguish slow-diffusion
processes ($0 < \beta < 1$) from intermediate processes ($1 < \beta < 2$).

and dynamics of characteristic types of dunes emerging under unidirectional
steady wind. Using this model, we study the dependency of the morphodynamics of
transverse dunes on the initial random perturbations and the lateral field
size. It was found that i) an increase of the lateral field size destabilizes
the transverse dune to cause deformation of a barchan, ii) the initial random
perturbations decay with time by the power function until a certain time;
thereafter, the dune shapes change into three phases according to the amount of
sand and sand diffusion coefficient, iii) the duration time, until the
transverse dune is broken, increases exponentially with increasing the amount
of sand and sand diffusion coefficient. Moreover, under the condition without
the sand supply from windward ground, the destabilization of transverse dune in
this model qualitatively corresponds to the subaqueous dunes in water tank
experiments.

Large-scale AGN-driven outflows should have kinetic luminosities $\sim
\eta\le/2 \sim 0.05\le$ and momentum rates $\sim 20\le/c$, where $\le$ is the
Eddington luminosity of the central black hole and $\eta\sim 0.1$ its radiative
accretion efficiency. This creates an expanding two-phase medium in which
molecular species coexist with hot gas, which can persist after the central AGN
has switched off. This picture predicts outflow velocities $\sim 1000 - 1500$
km\,s$^{-1}$ and mass outflow rates up to $4000 \msun\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ on kpc
scales, fixed mainly by the host galaxy velocity dispersion (or equivalently
black hole mass). All these features agree with those of outflows observed in
galaxies such as Mrk231. This strongly suggests that AGN activity is what
sweeps galaxies clear of their gas on a dynamical timescale and makes them red
and dead. We suggest future observational tests of this picture.

By regarding the size of a jump as the birth site of a particle, we construct a
branching particle system in which the particles undergo nonlocal branchings
and deterministic spatial motions to the left on the positive half line. A
particle is removed from the system as soon as it reaches the origin. Then a
measure-valued Borel right Markov process can be defined as the counting
measures of the particle system. Its total mass evolves according to a
Crump-Mode-Jagers branching process and its support represents the residual
life times of those existing particles. A similar result for spectrally

the measure-valued processes can be studied via the excursions for the

in which a quantum program consists of a finite set of quantum processes. These
processes are represented by quantum Markov chains over the common state space.
An execution of a nondeterministic quantum program is modeled by a sequence of
actions of individual processes. These actions are described by super-operators
on the state Hilbert space. At each step of an execution, a process is chosen
nondeterministically to perform the next action. A characterization of
reachable space and a characterization of diverging states of a
nondeterministic quantum program are presented. We establish a zero-one law for
termination probability of the states in the reachable space of a
nondeterministic quantum program. A combination of these results leads to a
necessary and sufficient condition for termination of nondeterministic quantum
programs. Based on this condition, an algorithm is found for checking
termination of nondeterministic quantum programs within a fixed
finite-dimensional state space. A striking difference between nondeterministic
classical and quantum programs is shown by example: it is possible that each of
several quantum programs simulates the same classical program which terminates
with probability 1, but the nondeterministic program consisting of them
terminates with probability 0 due to the interference carried in the execution
of them.

Asteroseismology of cluster stars is simplified by the common distance, age and

to 34 frequencies per star with most amplitudes in the submillimag range. In BS

A plane flow is a function F(X,t): R^2*R->R^2 such that
F(F(X,s),t)=F(X,s+t) for (almost) all real numbers x,y,s,t (the function F
might not be well-defined for certain x,y,t). In this paper we investigate
rational plane flows which are of the form F(X,t)=f(Xt)/t; here f is a pair of
rational functions in 2 real variables. These may be called projective flows,
and for a description of such flows only the knowledge of Cremona group in
dimension 1 is needed. Thus, the aim of this work is to completely describe
over R all rational solutions of the two dimensional translation equation
(1-z)f(X)=f(f(Xz)(1-z)/z). We show that, up to conjugation with a 1-homogenic
birational plane transformation (1-BIR), all solutions are as follows: a zero
flow, two singular flows, an identity flow, and one non-singular flow for each
non-negative integer N, called the level of the flow. The case N=0 stands
apart, while the case N=1 has special features as well. Conjugation of these
canonical solutions with 1-BIR produce a variety of flows with different
properties and invariants, depending on the level and on the conjugation
itself. We explore many more features of these flows; for example, there are 1,
4, and 2 essentially different symmetric flows in cases N=0, N=1, and N>=2,
respectively. Many more questions will be treated in the second part of this

form of a stable cofibration category. The precise statements use the 'n-order'
of a triangulated category, for a natural number n. The n-order is a
non-negative integer (or infinity) and measures `how strongly' n annihilates
objects of the form Y/n. We show the following results: the n-order of an
algebraic triangulated category is infinite; for every prime p, the p-order of
a topological triangulated category is at least p-1; the p-order of the p-local
stable homotopy category is exactly p-1. In particular, the p-local stable
homotopy category is not algebraic for any prime p. As a tool we develop
certain foundations about enrichments of cofibration categories by Delta-sets;
in particular we generalize the theory of `framings' (or `cosimplicial

orthogonality constraints, referred to as orthogonal nonnegative matrix
factorization (ONMF), have been recently introduced and shown to work
remarkably well for clustering tasks such as document classification. In this
paper, we introduce two new methods to solve ONMF. First, we show athematical
equivalence between ONMF and a weighted variant of spherical k-means, from
which we derive our first method, a simple EM-like algorithm. This also allows
us to determine when ONMF should be preferred to k-means and spherical k-means.
Our second method is based on an augmented Lagrangian approach. Standard ONMF
algorithms typically enforce nonnegativity for their iterates while trying to
achieve orthogonality at the limit (e.g., using a proper penalization term or a
suitably chosen search direction). Our method works the opposite way:
orthogonality is strictly imposed at each step while nonnegativity is
asymptotically obtained, using a quadratic penalty. Finally, we show that the
two proposed approaches compare favorably with standard ONMF algorithms on
synthetic, text and image data sets.

in the analysis of circular accelerators. If certain symmetries - like midplane
symmetrie - are present, then it is possible to treat the betatron motion in
the horizontal, the vertical plane and (under certain circumstances) the
longitudinal motion separately using the well-known Courant-Snyder theory, or
to apply transformations that have been described previously as for instance
the method of Teng and Edwards. In a preceeding paper it has been shown that
this method requires a modification for the treatment of isochronous cyclotrons
with non-negligible space charge forces. Unfortunately the modification was
numerically not as stable as desired and it was still unclear, if the extension
would work for all thinkable cases. Hence a systematic derivation of a more
general treatment seemed advisable.
  In a second paper the author suggested the use of real Dirac matrices as
basic tools to coupled linear optics and gave a straightforward recipe to
decouple positive definite Hamiltonians with imaginary eigenvalues. In this
article this method is generalized and simplified in order to formulate a
straightforward method to decouple Hamiltonian matrices with eigenvalues on the
real and the imaginary axis. It is shown that this algebraic decoupling is
closely related to a geometric ""decoupling"" by the orthogonalization of the
vectors $\vec E$, $\vec B$ and $\vec P$, that were introduced with the
so-called ""electromechanical equivalence"". We present a structure-preserving
block-diagonalization of symplectic or Hamiltonian matrices, respectively. When
used iteratively, the decoupling algorithm can also be applied to n-dimensional

LTE models, while providing greater consistency between \log g values, and, for
Arcturus, Teff values, fitted separately to the blue and red spectral regions.
There is marginal evidence that NLTE models give more consistent best fit Teff

concentrations have to be determined instead of long term mean values. This is
also the case for the perception of odour. Regulatory dispersion models like
AUSTAL2000 calculate long term mean concentration values (one-hour), but
provide no information on the fluctuation from this mean. The ratio between a
short term mean value (relevant for odour perception) and the long term mean
value (calculated by the dispersion model), called the peak-to-mean value, is
usually used to describe these fluctuations. In general, this ratio can be
defined in different ways. M\""uller et al. (2012), in a comment to Schauberger
et al. (2012) which includes a statement that AUSTAL2000 uses a constant factor
of 4, argue that AUSTAL2000 does not apply a peak-to-mean factor and does not
calculate odour exceedance probabilities. Instead it calculates the frequency
of so-called odour-hours by applying the relation between the 90-percentile of
the instantaneous concentration and the hourly mean (Janicke and Janicke,
2007a), not between some peak value and the mean. According to Janicke and
Janicke (2007a), the 90-percentile of the instantaneous concentration can in
practice be estimated with sufficient accuracy from the hourly mean by using a
factor of 4. Having so far replied to M\""uller et al. (2012) we take
additionally the opportunity to elaborate a little more on the peak-to-mean
concept, especially pointing out that a constant factor independent of the
stability of the atmosphere, the distance from and the geometry of the source,
is not appropriate. On the contrary it shows a sophisticated structure which

behavior under high-strain-rate tensile loads. We refer this apparatus as a
Split Flying Bar. The method is based on using the inertia of a working mass
attached to a specimen. The specimen is placed between the working mass (front
part of the bar) and backing part of the bar, which is captured in flight by
special brake. When the back part of the flying split bar is stopped, the
working mass continues the flight by inertia, creating specimen tension with
strain rate depending on the length of specimen and velocity of flying bar.
Properly choosing the working mass and the speed of the flying bar, one can
tune maximal stress and strain rate over a wide range. The method is highly
scalable and can be used for investigation of specimens from single filament up
to reasonable macroscopic size. Contrary to tensile SHPB, the method provides a
way to investigate materials with practically arbitrary strain to failure. For
example, polyuria, whose strain to failure reaches hundreds of percent. Also,
the method can be used for high-strain rate pull-out tests or to measure the
quality of adhesion layers under high-stress rates, e.t.c. In this paper I
introduce the basics of the method and interpretation of the data.

diffuse radio components on one side of the galaxy while the opposite component
appears edge-brightened with a prominent hot-spot. Although the absence of a
hot-spot is reminiscent of FRI radio galaxies, suggesting a hybrid morphology,
the radio jet facing the diffuse lobe in J1211+743 is similar to those in FRII
radio sources, and it is important to consider these aspects as well while
classifying these sources in the FR scheme. The observed asymmetries in these
Mpc-scale sources are likely to be largely intrinsic rather than being due to
the effects of orientation and relativistic motion. The formation of a diffuse
lobe facing the radio jet in J1211+743 is possibly due to the jet being highly
dissipative. The low-frequency spectral indices of the lobes are in the range
of approximately -0.8 to -1, while at the outer edges these vary from
approximately -0.65 to -1.05 suggesting steep injection spectral indices, which

effect, is today a reality that many experiments in ultracold quantum gases
have successfully observed and continued to explore [2-14]. Whereas theory was
the driving force behind our understanding of Efimov physics for decades,
recent experiments have contributed an unexpected discovery. Specifically,
measurements have found that the so-called three-body parameter determining
several properties of the system is universal, even though fundamental
assumptions in the theory of the Efimov effect suggest that it should be a
variable property that depends on the precise details of the short-range two-
and three-body interactions. The present Letter resolves this apparent
contradiction by elucidating unanticipated implications of the two-body
interactions. Our study shows that the three-body parameter universality
emerges because a universal effective barrier in the three-body potentials
prevents the three particles from simultaneously getting close to each other.
Our results also show limitations on this universality, as it is more likely to
occur for neutral atoms and less likely to extend to light nuclei.

finite-difference time-domain simulations. For the single slot ring CSRR, two
transmission dips are observed for the direction parallel to aperture at
resonance whereas two enhanced transmission for the direction normal to the
aperture. For double slot ring CSRR, the transmission coefficients appear more
anisotropic. The results provided considerable insight into the electromagnetic
response of CSRR and would be very helpful for developing new electronic
devices such as filters.

measuring the energy dependence of the speed of light by considering the time
delay in the arrival of gamma ray bursts emitted simultaneously from very
distant sources.The expected time delay between the arrival of gamma rays of
significantly different energies as predicted by the framework of relative
locality has already been calculated in Riemann normal coordinates. In the
following, we calculate the time delay in more generality and then specialize
to the connection normal coordinate system as a check that the results are
coordinate independent. We also show that this result does not depend on the
presence of torsion.

inner syntax, the relational logic of C. S. Peirce. Along this line of thought
we consider the relations represented by spinors. Spinor composition leads to
the emergence of Minkowski spacetime. Inversely the Minkowski spacetime is
istantiated by the Weyl spinors, while the merge of two Weyl spinors gives rise
to a Dirac spinor. Our analysis is applied also to the string geometry. The
string constraints are represented by real spinors, which create a
parametrization of the string worldsheet identical to the Enneper-Weierstass
representation of minimal surfaces. Further, a spinorial study of the AdS3
spacetime reveals a Hopf fibration AdS3 \rightarrow AdS2. The conformal
symmetry inherent in AdS3 is pointed out. Our work indicates the hidden ties
between logic-quantum mechanics-string theory-geometry and vindicates the
Wheeler's proposal of pregeometry as a large network of logical propositions.
