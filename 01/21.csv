forbidden subgraphs, we define $\ex_{H}(n, \mathcal{F})$ to be the maximum
number of induced copies of $H$ in an $\mathcal{F}$-free $r$-graph on $n$
vertices.
  Then the \emph{Tur\'an $H$-density} of $\mathcal{F}$ is the limit
\[\pi_{H}(\mathcal{F})= \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\ex_{H}(n,
\mathcal{F})/\binom{n}{h}. \]
  This generalises the notions of \emph{Tur\'an density} (when $H$ is an
$r$-edge), and \emph{inducibility} (when $\mathcal{F}$ is empty). Although
problems of this kind have received some attention, very few results are known.
  We use Razborov's semi-definite method to investigate Tur\'an $H$-densities
for 3-graphs. In particular, we show that \[\pi_{K_4^-}(K_4) = 16/27,\] with
Tur\'an's construction being optimal. We prove a result in a similar flavour
for $K_5$ and make a general conjecture on the value of $\pi_{K_t^-}(K_t)$. We
also establish that \[\pi_{4.2}(\emptyset)=3/4,\] where 4.2 denotes the 3-graph
on 4 vertices with exactly 2 edges. The lower bound in this case comes from a
random geometric construction strikingly different from previous known extremal
examples in 3-graph theory. We give a number of other results and conjectures
for 3-graphs, and in addition consider the inducibility of certain directed
graphs. Let $\vec{S}_k$ be the \emph{out-star} on $k$ vertices; i.e{.} the star
on $k$ vertices with all $k-1$ edges oriented away from the centre. We show
that \[\pi_{\vec{S}_3}(\emptyset)=2\sqrt3-3,\] with an iterated blow-up
construction being extremal. This is related to a conjecture of Mubayi and
R\""odl on the Tur\'an density of the 3-graph $C_5$. We also determine
$\pi_{\vec{S}_k}(\emptyset)$ when $k=4$, and conjecture its value for general
$k$.

counting scheme, which takes into account the relatively large momentum of the
initial nucleons inherent in pion-production reactions. We show that the
significant cancellations between the loops found at next-to-leading order
(NLO) in the earlier studies are also operative at N$^2$LO. In particular, the
$1/m_N$ corrections (with $m_N$ being the nucleon mass) to loop diagrams cancel
at N$^2$LO, as do the contributions of the pion loops involving the low-energy
constants $c_i$, i=1...4. In contrast to the NLO calculation however, the
cancellation of loops at N$^2$LO is incomplete, yielding a non-vanishing
contribution to the transition amplitude. Together with the one-pion exchange
tree-level operators, the loop contributions provide the long-range part of the
production operator. Finally, we discuss the phenomenological implications of
these findings. In particular, we find that the amplitudes generated by the
N$^2$LO pion loops yield contributions comparable in size with the most
important phenomenological heavy-meson exchange amplitudes.

large insulating particles, which forbid the much smaller conducting fillers
from occupying uniformly the three-dimensional volume of the composite. By
considering both colloidal-like and granular-like dispersions of the conducting
phase, modeled respectively by dispersions in the continuum and in the lattice,
we evaluate by Monte Carlo simulations the effect of segregation on the
composite conductivity {\sigma}, and show that an effective-medium theory
applied to the tunneling network reproduces accurately the Monte Carlo results.
The theory clarifies that the main effect of segregation in the continuum is
that of reducing the mean interparticle distances, leading to a strong
enhancement of the conductivity. In the lattice-segregation case the
conductivity enhancement is instead given by the lowering of the percolation
thresholds for first and beyond-first nearest neighbors. Our results generalize
to segregated composites the tunneling-based description of both the
percolation and hopping regimes introduced previously for homogeneous
disordered systems.

neuroscience and machine learning applications. In an RNN, each neuron computes
its output as a nonlinear function of its integrated input. While the
importance of RNNs, especially as models of brain processing, is undisputed, it
is also widely acknowledged that the computations in standard RNN models may be
an over-simplification of what real neuronal networks compute. Here, we suggest
that the RNN approach may be made both neurobiologically more plausible and
computationally more powerful by its fusion with Bayesian inference techniques
for nonlinear dynamical systems. In this scheme, we use an RNN as a generative
model of dynamic input caused by the environment, e.g. of speech or kinematics.
Given this generative RNN model, we derive Bayesian update equations that can
decode its output. Critically, these updates define a 'recognizing RNN' (rRNN),
in which neurons compute and exchange prediction and prediction error messages.
The rRNN has several desirable features that a conventional RNN does not have,
for example, fast decoding of dynamic stimuli and robustness to initial
conditions and noise. Furthermore, it implements a predictive coding scheme for
dynamic inputs. We suggest that the Bayesian inversion of recurrent neural
networks may be useful both as a model of brain function and as a machine
learning tool. We illustrate the use of the rRNN by an application to the
online decoding (i.e. recognition) of human kinematics.

the model in the most general case, in which there is mixing between the SM
U(1) and the anomalous U(1). This is followed by the calculation of all the
vertices and the amplitudes that are of interest for the phenomenology that we
are going to study.
  After describing in details how the Boltzmann Equation gives the relic
density of particle species, we use it and the amplitudes of our model already
calculated to study if the neutralinos introduced by our model can be viable
candidates to describe the Dark Matter relic density. We have found that this
is the case only if the anomalous candidate coannihilates with a MSSM
neutralino.
  In the case of no mixing between the U(1)s we have obtained this results
performing analytical calculations, whom results we show for many mass gaps.

package. This has also permitted us to obtain more precise informations about
the dependence of the relic density on the various free parameters of the
model. We show many plots containing these results.

to vertical velocity dispersion of a tracer population in spherical and
flattened dark haloes. This gives sequences of physical models in the plane of
global anisotropy and flattening. The tracer may have any density, though there
are particularly simple results for power-laws and exponentials. We prove the
flattening theorem: for a spheroidally stratified tracer density with axis
ratio q in a dark density potential with axis ratio g, the ratio of globally
averaged equatorial to vertical velocity dispersion depends only on q/g. As the
stellar halo density and velocity dispersion of the Milky Way are accessible to
observations, this provides a new method for measuring the flattening of the
dark matter. If the kinematics of the local halo subdwarfs are representative,
then the Milky Way's dark halo is oblate with a flattening in the potential of
g ~ 0.85, corresponding to a flattening in the dark matter density of ~ 0.7.
The fractional pressure excess for power-law populations is roughly
proportional to both the ellipticity and the fall-off exponent. Given the same
pressure excess, if the density profile of one stellar population declines more
quickly than that of another, then it must be rounder. This implies that the
dual halo structure claimed by Carollo et al. (2007) for the Galaxy, a flatter
inner halo and a rounder outer halo, is inconsistent with the virial theorem.
For the thick disc, we provide formulae for the virial sequences of
double-exponential discs in logarithmic and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) haloes.
There are good matches to the observational data on the flattening and
anisotropy of the thick disc if the thin disc is exponential with a short

the current instruments capable of observations in several sub-millimetre bands
(e.g., Herschel and Planck). However, some controversy remains even on the
basic effects resulting from the mixing of temperatures along the
line-of-sight.
  Studies have suggested either a positive or a negative correlation between
the colour temperature T_C and the observed spectral index beta_Obs. Our aim is
to show that both cases are possible and to determine the factors leading to
either behaviour. We start by studying the sum of two or three modified black
bodies of different temperature. With radiative transfer modelling, we examine
the probability distributions of the dust mass as a function of the physical
dust temperature. With these results as a guideline, we examine the (T_C,
beta_Obs) relations for different sets of clouds.
  Even in the case of modified blackbodies at temperatures T_0 and T_0+ Delta
T_0, the correlation between T_C and beta_Obs can be either positive or
negative. If one compares models where Delta T_0 is varied, the correlation is
negative. If the models differ in their mean temperature T_0 rather than in
Delta T_0, the correlation remains positive. Radiative transfer models show
that externally heated clouds have different mean temperatures but the widths
of their temperature distributions are rather similar. Thus, the correlation
between T_C and beta_Obs is expected to be positive. The same result applies to
clouds illuminated by external radiation fields of different intensity. For
internally heated clouds a negative correlation is the more likely alternative.
  If the signal-to-noise ratio is high, the observed negative correlation could
be explained by the temperature dependence of the dust optical properties but
that intrinsic dependence could be even steeper than the observed one.

transmission of quantum information with high rates over long distances in the
presence of unavoidable losses. Thereby the achievable quantum communication
rate is fundamentally limited by the amount of energy that can be transmitted
per use of the channel. It is hence vital to develop quantum communication
protocols that encode quantum information as energy efficiently as possible. To
this aim we investigate continuous-variable quantum teleportation as a method
of distributing quantum information. We explore the possibility to encode
information on multiple optical modes and derive upper and lower bounds on the
achievable quantum channel capacities. This analysis enables us to benchmark
single-mode versus multi-mode entanglement resources. Our research reveals that
multiplexing does not only feature an enhanced energy efficiency, leading to an
exponential increase in the achievable quantum communication rates in
comparison to single-mode coding, but also yields an improved loss resilience.
However, as reliable quantum information transfer is only achieved for
entanglement values above a certain threshold, a careful optimization of the
number of coding modes is needed to obtain the optimal quantum channel
capacity.

think about the center of mass and relative separation, we obtained from the
Dirac model a new fundamental Hamiltonian in which the lattice couples to
different states within the composite nuclei within the lattice. In this
description the different nuclear states have different mass energies and
kinetic energies, as we had expected. In addition there appear new terms which
provide for nuclear excitation as a result of coupling to the composite

component from the accretion disk varying on significantly longer timescales
than the jet synchrotron emission. In BL Lac objects, variability is mainly
constant across wavelengths, consistent with a weak or radiatively inefficient
disk. FSRQs have redder optical-infrared colors when they are brighter, while
BL Lac objects show no such trend. Several objects show complicated

prograde BHs trap more magnetic flux, leading to about 3 times higher eta than

consequence of turbulent density fluctuations, using an argument similar to
Press & Schechter 1974 for Gaussian random fields. Like that example, however,
this solution does not resolve the 'cloud in cloud' problem; it also does not
extend to large scales that dominate the velocity/density fluctuations. In
principle, these can change the results at the order-of-magnitude level. Here,
we use the results from Hopkins 2011 (H11) to generalize the excursion set
formalism and derive the exact solution in this regime. We argue that the
stellar IMF and core mass function (CMF) should be associated with the
last-crossing distribution, i.e. the mass spectrum of bound objects defined on
the smallest scale on which they are self-gravitating. This differs from the
first-crossing distribution (mass function on the largest self-gravitating
scale) which is defined cosmologically and which H11 show corresponds to the
GMC mass function in disks. We derive an analytic equation for the
last-crossing distribution that can be used for an arbitrary collapse threshold
in ISM and cosmological studies. With this, we show that the same model that
predicts the GMC mass function and large-scale structure of galaxy disks also
predicts the CMF (and by extrapolation IMF) in good agreement with
observations. The only adjustable parameter in the model is the turbulent
velocity power spectrum, which in the range p~5/3-2 gives similar results. We
also use this to justify why the approximate solution in HC08 is reasonable (up
to a normalization) over the CMF/IMF mass range; however there are significant
corrections at intermediate and high masses. We discuss how the exact solutions
here can be embedded into time-dependent models that follow density
fluctuations, fragmentation, successive generations of star formation.

eccentric ring, which is thought to be caused by dynamical influence from a
giant planet companion. In 2008, a detection of a point-source inside the inner
edge of the ring was reported and was interpreted as a direct image of the
planet, named Fomalhaut b. The detection was made at ~600--800 nm, but no
corresponding signatures were found in the near-infrared range, where the bulk
emission of such a planet should be expected. Here we present deep observations
of Fomalhaut with Spitzer/IRAC at 4.5 um, using a novel PSF subtraction
technique based on ADI and LOCI, in order to substantially improve the Spitzer
contrast at small separations. The results provide more than an order of
magnitude improvement in the upper flux limit of Fomalhaut b and exclude the
possibility that any flux from a giant planet surface contributes to the
observed flux at visible wavelengths. This renders any direct connection
between the observed light source and the dynamically inferred giant planet
highly unlikely. We discuss several possible interpretations of the total body

from ultra-close encounters with a spinning, intermediate mass black hole.
These encounters require a full general relativistic treatment of gravity. We
show that the disruption process and prompt accretion of the debris strongly
depend on the magnitude and orientation of the black hole spin. However, the
late-time accretion onto the black hole follows the same decay, $\dot{M}$ ~
t^{-5/3}, estimated from Newtonian gravity disruption studies. We compute the
spectrum of the disk formed from the fallback material using a slim disk model.
The disk spectrum peaks in the soft X-rays and sustains Eddington luminosity
for 1-3 yrs after the disruption. For arbitrary black hole spin orientations,
the disrupted material is scattered away from the orbital plane by relativistic
frame dragging, which often leads to obscuration of the inner fallback disk by
the outflowing debris. The disruption events also yield bursts of gravitational
radiation with characteristic frequencies of ~3.2 Hz and strain amplitudes of
~10^{-18} for galactic intermediate mass black holes. The optimistic rate of
considered ultra-close disruptions is consistent with no sources found in ROSAT
all-sky survey. The future missions like Wide-Field X-ray Telescope (WFXT)
could observe dozens of events.

quantum systems can pass between them. We regard each use of an apparatus,
along with some given outcome on the apparatus (a certain detector click or a
certain meter reading for example), as an operation. An operation can have zero
or more quantum systems inputted into it and zero or more quantum systems
outputted from it. We can wire together operations to form circuits. In the
standard framework of quantum theory we must foliate the circuit then calculate
the probability by evolving a state through it. This approach has three
problems. First, we must introduce an arbitrary foliation of the circuit (such
foliations are not unique). Second, we have to pad our expressions with
identities every time two or more foliation hypersurfaces intersect a given
wire. And third, we treat operations corresponding to preparations,
transformations, and results in different ways. In this paper we present the
operator tensor formulation of quantum theory which solves all these problems.
Corresponding to every operation is an operator tensor. The probability for a
circuit is given by simply replacing the operations in the circuit with the
corresponding operator tensors. Wires between operator tensors correspond to
multiplying the tensors in the associated subspace and then taking the partial
trace over that subspace. Operator tensors must be physical (namely, they must
have positive input transpose and satisfy a certain normalization condition).

been highly effective at selecting active galactic nuclei (AGN). However,
cosmologically distant low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) have remained a challenge to
identify due to significant contribution from the host galaxy. We identify
long-term X-ray variability (~month-years, observed frame) in 20 of 92 CDF-S
galaxies spanning redshifts z~0.08-1.02 that do not meet other AGN selection
criteria. We show that the observed variability cannot be explained by X-ray
binary populations or ultraluminous X-ray sources, so the variability is most
likely caused by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. The variable
galaxies are not heavily obscured in general, with a stacked effective
power-law photon index of Gamma_stack~1.93+/-0.13, and are therefore likely
LLAGN. The LLAGN tend to lie a factor of ~6-80 below the extrapolated linear
variability-luminosity relation measured for luminous AGN. This may be
explained by their lower accretion rates. Variability-independent black-hole
mass and accretion-rate estimates for variable galaxies show that they sample a
significantly different black-hole mass-accretion rate space, with masses a
factor of 2.4 lower and accretion rates a factor of 22.5 lower than variable
luminous AGN at the same redshift. We find that an empirical model based on a
universal broken power-law PSD function, where the break frequency depends on
SMBH mass and accretion rate, roughly reproduces the shape, but not the
normalization, of the variability-luminosity trends measured for variable
galaxies and more luminous AGN.

hosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming and
quiescent sources, at 0.5<z<2.5. Recent observations carried out by PACS, the
60-210um Herschel photometric camera, in GOODS-S, GOODS-N and COSMOS allow us
to unbiasedly estimate the far-IR luminosity, and hence the SF properties, of
the two samples. Accurate AGN host stellar masses are measured by decomposing
their total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. We find a higher
average SF activity in AGN hosts with respect to non-AGNs. The level of SF
enhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low X-ray luminosities
(Lx<~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at >10sigma) for bright AGNs.
However, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, AGN hosts are broadly
consistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. We investigate the relative
far-IR luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find a
higher fraction of PACS detected, hence normal and highly star forming systems
among AGN hosts. Although different interpretations are possible, we explain
our findings as a consequence of a twofold AGN growth path: faint AGNs evolve
through secular processes, with instantaneous AGN accretion not tightly linked
to the current total SF in the host, while luminous AGNs co-evolve with their
hosts through periods of enhanced AGN activity and SF, possibly through major
mergers. While an increased SF with respect to non-AGNs of similar mass is
expected in the latter, we interpret the modest SF offsets measured in low-Lx
AGN hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and SF histories
in a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous SF
and accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)
mechanisms. Far-IR luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

compare best-fit Schechter parameters across the literature and find clear
indication of evolution with redshift. Providing fitting formulae for the
multi-band evolution of the LFs out to z~5, we calculate the total emission
redshifted into the near-IR bands in the observer frame and recover the
observed optical and near-IR galaxy counts to a good accuracy. Our empirical
approach, in conjunction with a halo model describing the clustering of
galaxies, allows us to compute the fluctuations of the unresolved CIB and
compare the models to current measurements. We find that fluctuations from
known galaxy populations are unable to account for the large scale CIB
clustering signal seen by Spitzer/IRAC and AKARI/IRC and continue to diverge
out to larger angular scales. This holds true even if the LFs are extrapolated
out to faint magnitudes with a steep faint-end slope all the way to z=8. We
also show that removing resolved sources to progressively fainter magnitude
limits, isolates CIB fluctuations to increasingly higher redshifts. Our
empirical approach suggests that known galaxy populations are not responsible
for the bulk of the fluctuation signal seen in the measurements and favors a
very faint population of highly clustered sources.

clustering and classification are useful tools for this task. Classification of
triggers based on a handful of discrete properties has been done in the past. A
rich information content is available in the waveform or 'shape' of the
triggers that has had a rather restricted exploration so far. This paper
presents a new way to classify triggers deriving information from both trigger

Fast Time Series Evaluation (FTSE) for waveform classification and the

Bayesian nonparametric regression. Specified through a set of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs), the nGP imposes a Gaussian process prior for the
function's $m$th-order derivative. The nesting comes in through including a
local instantaneous mean function, which is drawn from another Gaussian process
inducing adaptivity to locally-varying smoothness. We discuss the support of
the nGP prior in terms of the closure of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space,
and consider theoretical properties of the posterior. The posterior mean under
the nGP prior is shown to be equivalent to the minimizer of a nested penalized
sum-of-squares involving penalties for both the global and local roughness of
the function. Using highly-efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo for posterior
inference, the proposed method performs well in simulation studies compared to
several alternatives, and is scalable to massive data, illustrated through a
proteomics application.

users based only on the output statistics of any components used, and without
the need to verify their internal functionality. Since this would protect users
against untrustworthy or incompetent manufacturers, sabotage or device
degradation, this idea has excited much interest, and many device-independent
schemes have been proposed. Here we identify a critical weakness of
device-independent protocols that rely on public communication between secure
laboratories. Untrusted devices may record their inputs and outputs and reveal
information about them via publicly discussed outputs during later runs.
Reusing devices thus compromises the security of a protocol and risks leaking
secret data. Possible defences include securely destroying or isolating used
devices. However, these are costly and often impractical. We propose other more
practical partial defences as well as a new protocol structure for
device-independent quantum key distribution that aims to achieve composable
security in the case of two parties using a small number of devices to
repeatedly share keys with each another (and no other party).

to the mixed formulation of the Stokes problem in terms of vorticity, velocity
and pressure. The mimetic discretization presented in this paper and in [50] is
a higher-order method for curvilinear quadrilaterals and hexahedrals.
Fundamental is the underlying structure of oriented geometric objects, the
relation between these objects through the boundary operator and how this
defines the exterior derivative, representing the grad, curl and div, through
the generalized Stokes theorem. The mimetic method presented here uses the
language of differential $k$-forms with $k$-cochains as their discrete
counterpart, and the relations between them in terms of the mimetic operators:
reduction, reconstruction and projection. The reconstruction consists of the
recently developed mimetic spectral interpolation functions. The most important
result of the mimetic framework is the commutation between differentiation at
the continuous level with that on the finite dimensional and discrete level. As
a result operators like gradient, curl and divergence are discretized exactly.
For Stokes flow, this implies a pointwise divergence-free solution. This is
confirmed using a set of test cases on both Cartesian and curvilinear meshes.
It will be shown that the method converges optimally for all admissible
boundary conditions.

break down into two classes. Solutions with low tan\beta ~3-11 are

with mass <123 GeV and so may be excluded should the LHC Higgs hint persist.
The second class of solutions occurs at large tan\beta ~35-60, and are a subset
of $t-b-\tau$ unified solutions. Constraining only $b-\tau$ unification to ~5%
favors a rather light gluino with mass ~0.5-2 TeV, which should ultimately be
accessible to LHC searches. While our $b-\tau$ unified solutions can be
consistent with a picture of neutralino-only cold dark matter, invoking
additional moduli or Peccei-Quinn superfields can allow for all of our

associated with GRB 051103, a short-duration hard-spectrum gamma-ray burst
(GRB) whose electromagnetically determined sky position is coincident with the
spiral galaxy M81, which is 3.6 Mpc from Earth. Possible progenitors for
short-hard GRBs include compact object mergers and soft gamma repeater (SGR)
giant flares. A merger progenitor would produce a characteristic GW signal that
should be detectable at the distance of M81, while GW emission from an SGR is
not expected to be detectable at that distance. We found no evidence of a GW
signal associated with GRB 051103. Assuming weakly beamed gamma-ray emission
with a jet semi-angle of 30 deg we exclude a binary neutron star merger in M81
as the progenitor with a confidence of 98%. Neutron star-black hole mergers are
excluded with > 99% confidence. If the event occurred in M81 our findings
support the the hypothesis that GRB 051103 was due to an SGR giant flare,
making it the most distant extragalactic magnetar observed to date.

instability responsible for structure formation. In the present work the

both the adimensionalized scale of the heterogeneities $\alpha$ and the
adimensionalized mean-free path $\eps$ converge to 0. When $\alpha=\eps$, it is
well known that the heterogeneous transport solution converges to a homogenized
diffusion solution. We are interested here in the situation where
$0<\eps\ll\alpha\ll1$ and in the respective rates of convergences to the
homogenized limit and to the diffusive limit. Our main result is an
approximation to the transport solution with an error term that is negligible
compared to the maximum of $\alpha$ and $\frac\eps\alpha$. After establishing
the diffusion-homogenization limit to the transport solution, we show that the
corrector is dominated by an error to homogenization when $\alpha^2\ll\eps$ and
by an an error to diffusion when $\eps\ll\alpha^2$.
  Our regime of interest involves singular perturbations in the small parameter
$\eta=\frac\eps\alpha$. Disconnected local equilibria at $\eta=0$ need to be
reconnected to provide a global equilibrium on the cell of periodicity when
$\eta>0$. This reconnection between local and global equilibria is shown to
hold when sufficient {\em no-drift} conditions are satisfied. The Hilbert
expansion methodology followed in this paper builds on corrector theories for
the result developed in \cite{NBAPuVo}.

and insulating state, probably of Wigner-crystal-type. Moreover, the fractional
quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in graphene has been observed at a low carrier
density where the interaction is reduced as a result of particles dilution.
This suggests that the interaction may not be as important in the triggering of
FQHE as expected based on the standard formulation of the composite fermions
model. Here, the topological arguments are presented to explain these novel
features of the FQHE in graphene and, the triggering role of carriers mobility
in particular.

CS term, and study their effects on the CMB polarization power spectra in
detail. By combining current CMB polarization measurements, the seven-year
WMAP, BOOMERanG 2003 and BICEP observations, we obtain a tight constraint on
the rotation angle $\Delta\alpha=-2.28\pm1.02$ deg ($1\,\sigma$), indicating a
$2.2\,\sigma$ detection of the CPT violation. Here, we particularly take the
systematic errors of CMB measurements into account. After adding the QUaD
polarization data, the constraint becomes $-1.34<\Delta\alpha<0.82$ deg at 95%
confidence level. When comparing with the effect of electromagnetic CS term,
the gravitational CS term could only generate TB and EB power spectra with much
smaller amplitude. Therefore, the induced parameter $\epsilon$ can not be
constrained from the current polarization data. Furthermore, we study the
capabilities of future CMB measurements, Planck and CMBPol, on the constraints
of $\Delta\alpha$ and $\epsilon$. We find that the constraint of $\Delta\alpha$
can be significantly improved by a factor of 15. Therefore, if this rotation
angle effect can not be taken into account properly, the constraints of
cosmological parameters will be biased obviously. For the gravitational CS
term, the future Planck data still can not constrain $\epsilon$ very well, if
the primordial tensor perturbations are small, $r <0.1$. We need the more

languages where the notion of legal observable behaviour of a term is defined
combinatorially, by means of rules of a game between the term (the ""Proponent"")
and its context (the ""Opponent""). In general, the richer the computational
features a language has, the less constrained the rules of the semantic game.
In this paper we consider the consequences of taking this relaxation of rules
to the limit, by granting the Opponent omnipotence, that is, permission to play
any move without combinatorial restrictions. However, we impose an epistemic
restriction by not granting Opponent omniscience, so that Proponent can have
undisclosed secret moves. We introduce a basic C-like programming language and
we define such a semantic model for it. We argue that the resulting semantics
is an appealingly simple combination of operational and game semantics and we
show how certain traces explain system-level attacks, i.e. plausible attacks
that are realizable outside of the programming language itself. We also show
how allowing Proponent to have secrets ensures that some desirable equivalences
in the programming language are preserved.

X-ray sources (ULXs) that are associated with large-scale nebulae. We report
the discovery of a radio nebula associated with the ULX IC342 X-1 using the
Very Large Array (VLA). Complementary VLA observations of the nebula around
Holmberg II X-1, and high-frequency Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)
and Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic observations of NGC5408 X-1 are
also presented. We study the morphology, ionization processes, and the
energetics of the optical/radio nebulae of IC342 X-1, Holmberg II X-1 and
NGC5408 X-1. The energetics of the optical nebula of IC342 X-1 is discussed in
the framework of standard bubble theory. The total energy content of the
optical nebula is 6 x 10^52 erg. The minimum energy needed to supply the
associated radio nebula is 9.2 x 10^50 erg. In addition, we detected an
unresolved radio source at the location of IC342 X-1 at VLA scales. However,
our Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations using the European
VLBI Network likely rule out the presence of any compact radio source at
milli-arcsecond (mas) scales. Using a simultaneous Swift X-ray Telescope
measurement, we estimate an upper limit on the mass of the black hole in IC342
X-1 using the ""fundamental plane"" of accreting black holes and obtain M_BH <
(1.0\pm0.3) x 10^3 M_Sun. Arguing that the nebula of IC342 X-1 is possibly
inflated by a jet, we estimate accretion rates and efficiencies for the jet of
IC342 X-1 and compare with sources like S26, SS433, IC10 X-1.

MIMO relaying scenario is considered, with $n_R$ antennas at the relay R, $n_A$

denoise-and-forward (DNF) protocol which employs two phases: Multiple access
(MA) phase and Broadcast (BC) phase. It is known for the network-coded SISO
two-way relaying that adaptively changing the networking coding map used at the
relay, also known as the denoising map, according to the channel conditions
greatly reduces the impact of multiple access interference which occurs at the
relay during the MA phase and all these network coding maps should satisfy a
requirement called the {\it exclusive law}. The network coding maps which
satisfy exclusive law can be viewed equivalently as Latin Rectangles. In this
paper, it is shown that for MIMO two-way relaying, deep fade occurs at the
relay when the row space of the channel fade coefficient matrix is a subspace
of a finite number of vector subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^{n_A+n_B}$ which are
referred to as the singular fade subspaces. It is shown that proper choice of
network coding map can remove most of the singular fade subspaces, referred to
as the removable singular fade subspaces. For $2^{\lambda}$-PSK signal set, it
is shown that the number of non-removable singular fade subspaces is a small
fraction of the total number of singular fade subspaces. The Latin Rectangles
for the case when the end nodes use different number of antennas are shown to
be obtainable from the Latin Squares for the case when they use the same number
of antennas. Also, the network coding maps which remove all the removable

sense the phenomenon and produced ? information packets. Due to usually
hazardous environment and limited resources, e.g. energy, sensors in the
network are vulnerable. Also due to the large size of the network, gathering
information from a few central hopes is not feasible. Flooding is not a desired
option either due to limited memory of each node. Therefore the best approach
to increase data persistency is propagating data throughout the network by
random walks. The algorithm proposed here is based on distributed LT (Luby
Transform) codes and it benefits from the low complexity of encoding and
decoding of LT codes. In previous algorithms the essential global information
(e.g., n and k) are estimated based on graph statistics, which requires
excessive transmissions. In our proposed algorithm, these values are obtained
without additional transmissions. Also the mixing time of random walk is
enhanced by proposing a new scheme for generating the probabilistic forwarding
table of random walk. The proposed method uses only local information and it is
scalable to any network topology. By simulations the improved performance of
developed algorithm compared to previous ones has been verified.

rate of distributed average consensus algorithm depends on the choice of
weights. This paper studies the weight optimization problem in distributed

network where the branches have different lengths. Closed-form formulas of
optimal weights and convergence rate of algorithm are determined in terms of
the network's topological parameters. Furthermore generic K-cored star topology

benefits from faster convergence rate compared to star topology. By simulation
better performance of optimal weights compared to other common weighting

simultaneous EEG-fMRI that employs the EEG array as a sensitive motion
detector. EEG motion artifacts are used to generate motion regressors
describing rotational head movements with millisecond temporal resolution.
These regressors are utilized for slice-specific motion correction of
unprocessed fMRI data. Performance of the method is demonstrated by correction
of fMRI data from five patients with major depressive disorder, who exhibited
head movements by 1-3 mm during a resting EEG-fMRI run. The fMRI datasets,
corrected using eight to ten EEG-based motion regressors, show significant
improvements in temporal SNR (TSNR) of fMRI time series, particularly in the
frontal brain regions and near the surface of the brain. The TSNR improvements
are as high as 50% for large brain areas in single-subject analysis and as high
as 25% when the results are averaged across the subjects. Simultaneous
application of the EEG-based motion correction and physiological noise
correction by means of RETROICOR leads to average TSNR enhancements as high as
35% for large brain regions. These TSNR improvements are largely preserved
after the subsequent fMRI volume registration and regression of fMRI motion
parameters. The proposed EEG-assisted method of retrospective fMRI motion
correction (referred to as E-REMCOR) can be used to improve quality of fMRI
data with severe motion artifacts and to reduce spurious correlations between
the EEG and fMRI data caused by head movements. It does not require any
specialized equipment beyond the standard EEG-fMRI instrumentation and can be
applied retrospectively to any existing EEG-fMRI data set.

simplistic assumption of a solid core surrounded by a homogeneous gaseous
envelope, we derive new models with an inhomogeneous distribution of heavy
elements, i.e. a gradient of composition, within these planets. Such a
compositional stratification hampers large scale convection which turns into
double-diffusive convection, yielding an inner thermal profile which departs
from the traditionally assumed adiabatic interior, affecting these planet heat
content and cooling history.
  To address this problem, we develop an analytical approach of layered
double-diffusive convection and apply this formalism to Solar System gaseous
giant planet interiors. These models satisfy all observational constraints and
yield a metal enrichment for our gaseous giants up to 30 to 60% larger than
previously thought. The models also constrain the size of the convective layers
within the planets. As the heavy elements tend to be redistributed within the
gaseous envelope, the models predict smaller than usual central cores inside
Saturn and Jupiter, with possibly no core for this latter.
  These models open a new window and raise new challenges on our understanding
of the internal structure of giant (solar and extrasolar) planets, in
particular on the determination of their heavy material content, a key
diagnostic for planet formation theories.
