2.76 ATeV Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) indicate that the
jet-medium coupling in a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is reduced at LHC energies
and not compatible with the coupling deduced from data at the Relativistic
Hadron Collider (RHIC). We estimate the reduction factor from a combined fit to
the available data on $R_{AA}(\sqrt{s},p_T,b)$ and the elliptic flow
$v_2(\sqrt{s},p_T,b)$ at $\sqrt{s}=0.2,2.76$ ATeV over a transverse momentum
range $p_T$ 10-100 GeV and a broad impact parameter, b, range. We use a simple
analytic ""polytrope"" model ($dE/dx=- \kappa E^{a} x^z T^{c}$) to investigate
the dynamical jet-energy loss model dependence. Varying a=0-1 interpolates
between weakly-coupled and strongly-coupled models of jet-energy dependence
while z=0-2 covers a wide range of possible jet-path dependencies from elastic
and radiative to holographic string mechanisms. Our fit to LHC data indicates
an approximate 40% reduction of the coupling $\kappa$ from RHIC to LHC and
excludes energy-loss models characterized by a jet-energy exponent with a>1/3.
In particular, the rapid rise of $R_{AA}$ with $p_T$>10 GeV combined with the
slow variation of the asymptotic $v_2(p_T)$ at the LHC rules out popular
exponential geometric optics models (a=1). The LHC data are compatible with
$0\leq a\leq 1/3$ pQCD-like energy-loss models where the jet-medium coupling is
reduced by approximately 10% between RHIC and LHC.

select variable AGNs based on an optimal criterion for selecting the variable

light originates by optical or NIR emission in the rest frame; and we examine
the correlations of the ensemble variability with the rest-frame wavelength,
redshift, luminosity, and rest-frame time lag. In addition, we also examine the
correlations of variability amplitude with optical variability, radio
intensity, and radio-to-optical flux ratio. The rest-frame optical variability
of our samples shows known negative correlations with luminosity and positive
correlations with rest-frame time lag (i.e., the structure function, SF).
However, no well-known negative correlation exists between the rest wavelength
and optical variability. This inconsistency might be due to a biased sampling
of high-redshift AGNs. NIR variability in the rest frame is anticorrelated with
the rest wavelength, which is consistent with previous suggestions. However,
correlations of NIR variability with luminosity and rest-frame time lag are the
opposite of these correlations of the optical variability; that is, the NIR
variability is positively correlated with luminosity but negatively correlated
with the rest-frame time lag. Because these trends are qualitatively consistent
with the properties of radio-loud quasars reported by some previous studies,
most of our sample objects are probably radio-loud quasars. Finally, we also
discuss the negative correlations seen in the NIR SFs.

swarming system where peers have heterogeneous upload capacities. A coalition
is a set of peers that explicitly cooperate with other peers inside the
coalition via choking, data replication, and capacity allocation strategies.
Further, each peer interacts with other peers outside its coalition via
potentially distinct choking, data replication, and capacity allocation
strategies. Following on our preliminary work in IEEE ICNP 2011 that
demonstrated significant performance benefits of coalitions, we present here a
comprehensive analysis of the choking and data replication strategies for
coalitions.
  We first develop an analytical model to understand a simple random choking
strategy as a within-coalition strategy and show that it accurately predicts a
coalition's performance. Our analysis formally shows that the random choking
strategy can help a coalition achieve near-optimal performance by optimally
choosing the re-choking interval lengths and the number unchoke slots. Further,
our analytical model can be easily adapted to model a BitTorrent-like swarm. We
also introduce a simple data replication strategy which significantly improves
data availability within a coalition as compared to the rarest-first piece
replication strategy employed in BitTorrent systems. We further propose a
cooperation-aware better response strategy that achieves convergence of the
dynamic coalition formation process when peers freely join or leave any
coalition. Finally, using extensive simulations, we demonstrate improvements in
the performance of a swarming system due to coalition formation.

reduced magnetohydrodynamic equations. For a Harris equilibrium with guide
field, represented by $\vc{B}_o = B_{po} \tanh (x/\lambda) \hat{y} + B_{zo}
\hat{z}$, a spectrum of modes are unstable at multiple resonant surfaces in the
current sheet, rather than just the null surface of the polodial field $B_{yo}
(x) = B_{po} \tanh (x/\lambda)$, which is the only resonant surface in 2D or in
the absence of a guide field. Here $B_{po}$ is the asymptotic value of the
equilibrium poloidal field, $B_{zo}$ is the constant equilibrium guide field,
and $\lambda$ is the current sheet width. Plasmoids on each resonant surface
have a unique angle of obliquity $\theta \equiv \arctan(k_z/k_y)$. The resonant
surface location for angle $\theta$ is $x_s = - \lambda \arctanh (\tan \theta
B_{zo}/B_{po})$, and the existence of a resonant surface requires $|\theta| <
\arctan (B_{po} / B_{zo})$. The most unstable angle is oblique, i.e. $\theta

$\theta = 0$ and $x_s = 0$, in the nonconstant-$\psi$ regime. For a fixed angle
of obliquity, the most unstable wavenumber lies at the intersection of the
constant-$\psi$ and nonconstant-$\psi$ regimes. The growth rate of this mode is
$\gamma_{\textrm{max}}/\Gamma_o \simeq S_L^{1/4} (1-\mu^4)^{1/2}$, in which

an estimate of each player's contribution to his team, independent of the
strength of his teammates, the strength of his opponents, and other variables
that are out of his control. One of the main downsides of the ordinary least
squares regression models is that the estimates have large error bounds. Since
certain pairs of teammates play together frequently, collinearity is present in
the data and is one reason for the large errors. In hockey, the relative lack
of scoring compared to basketball is another reason. To deal with these issues,
we use ridge regression, a method that is commonly used in lieu of ordinary
least squares regression when collinearity is present in the data. We also
create models that use not only goals, but also shots, Fenwick rating (shots
plus missed shots), and Corsi rating (shots, missed shots, and blocked shots).
One benefit of using these statistics is that there are roughly ten times as
many shots as goals, so there is much more data when using these statistics and
the resulting estimates have smaller error bounds. The results of our ridge
regression models are estimates of the offensive and defensive contributions of
forwards and defensemen during even strength, power play, and short handed
situations, in terms of goals per 60 minutes. The estimates are independent of
strength of teammates, strength of opponents, and the zone in which a player's

dynamical chaos. We find a clear correlation between the behavior of the

manifestation of chaoticity of the fundamental atom-light interaction in the

approaches, which can significantly slow down the speed of convergence. To
address this key weakness, we devise a fast algorithm without the need for this
additional layer of iterations, which converges to the optimal solution. Our
algorithm only needs local information exchange, and can easily adapt to
variations of network size and topology. We prove that our distributed resource
allocation algorithm converges to the optimal solution. A channel resource
adjustment method is further developed to provide more channel resources to the
bottleneck links and realize traffic load balance. Numerical results are
provided to illustrate the benefits of our algorithm.

formalized as dimensionality reduction: in a stimulus space of very high
dimensions, neurons respond only to variations within some smaller, relevant
subspace. But if neural responses exhibit invariances, then the relevant
subspace typically cannot be reached by a Euclidean projection of the original
stimulus. We argue that, in several cases, we can make progress by appealing to
the simplest nonlinear construction, identifying the relevant variables as
quadratic forms, or ""stimulus energies."" Natural examples include
non-phase-locked cells in the auditory system, complex cells in visual cortex,
and motion-sensitive neurons in the visual system. Generalizing the idea of
maximally informative dimensions, we show that one can search for the kernels
of the relevant quadratic forms by maximizing the mutual information between
the stimulus energy and the arrival times of action potentials. Simple
implementations of this idea successfully recover the underlying properties of
model neurons even when the number of parameters in the kernel is comparable to
the number of action potentials and stimuli are completely natural. We explore
several generalizations that allow us to incorporate plausible structure into
the kernel and thereby restrict the number of parameters. We hope that this
approach will add significantly to the set of tools available for the analysis
of neural responses to complex, naturalistic stimuli.

have been variable selection and dimension reduction. In practice, it occurs
often that the variables are located on an unknown, lower-dimensional nonlinear
manifold. Under this manifold assumption, one purpose of this paper is
regression and gradient estimation on the manifold, and another is developing a
new tool for manifold learning. To the first aim, we suggest directly reducing
the dimensionality to the intrinsic dimension $d$ of the manifold, and
performing the popular local linear regression (LLR) on a tangent plane
estimate. An immediate consequence is a dramatic reduction in the computation
time when the ambient space dimension $p\gg d$. We provide rigorous theoretical
justification of the convergence of the proposed regression and gradient
estimators by carefully analyzing the curvature, boundary, and non-uniform
sampling effects. A bandwidth selector that can handle heteroscedastic errors
is proposed. To the second aim, we analyze carefully the behavior of our
regression estimator both in the interior and near the boundary of the
manifold, and make explicit its relationship with manifold learning, in
particular estimating the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the manifold. In this
context, we also make clear that it is important to use a smaller bandwidth in
the tangent plane estimation than in the LLR. Simulation studies and the Isomap

exciton dissociation occurs almost exclusively at the interface between the
donor and acceptor, following one-electron initial excitation from the HOMO to
the LUMO levels of the donor, and charge transfer to the acceptor to make a
charge-transfer exciton. After exciton breakup, and neglecting the trapping of
individual carriers, the electron may undergo two processes for decay: one
process involves the electron and/or hole leaving the interface, and migrating
to the electrode. This is treated here as the electron moving on a set of
acceptor sites. The second loss process is radiationless decay following
recombination of the acceptor electron with the donor cation; this is treated
by adding a relaxation term. These two processes compete with one another. We
model both the exciton breakup and the subsequent electron motion. Results
depend on tunneling amplitude, energetics, disorder, Coulomb barriers, and

low density emission in the nuclear region. We detect and resolve the
individual compact giant molecular cloud associations (GMAs) in the 1.4 kpc
circumnuclear starburst ring and within the 350 pc nuclear region. The nucleus
is brighter than the ring in both lines, and contributes to ~20% and ~30% to
the total detected HCO+(J = 3-2) and HCN(J = 3-2) flux, within the central 1.4
kpc. The intensity ratios of HCN(J = 3-2)/HCO+(J = 3-2) are roughly unity in
the GMAs of the starburst ring. However, this ratio is up to ~2 in the nuclear
region. From the HCN(J = 3-2)/HCN(J = 1-0) ratio of <0.2 in the nucleus, we
infer that the nuclear HCN(J = 3-2) emission might be optically thin. The
HCO+(J = 3-2) and HCN(J = 3-2) show correlations with 12CO(J = 3-2) and the
24{\mu}m emission. The tight correlations of HCN(J = 3-2), HCO+(J = 3-2) and
24{\mu}m emission in the starburst ring suggest that the dense molecular gas
and the dust are from the same origins of star forming regions. On the other
hand, the HCN(J = 3-2) emission of the nucleus is significantly enhanced,
indicating mechanisms other than star formation, such as AGN activities. A
self-consistent check of the fractional abundance enhanced by X-ray ionization

onsite Coulomb repulsion, however, prohibits electron hopping between
neighboring sites and leads to a Mott insulator ground state with
antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering. Charge carriers doped into the CuO2 plane
destroy the insulating phase and superconductivity emerges as the carrier

insulator and the behavior of a single doped charge. Here we use a scanning
tunneling microscope to investigate the atomic scale electronic structure of
the Ca2CuO2Cl2 parent Mott insulator of the cuprates. The full electronic
spectrum across the Mott-Hubbard gap is uncovered for the first time, which
reveals the particle-hole symmetric and spatially uniform Hubbard bands. A
single electron donated by surface defect is found to create a broad in-gap
electronic state that is strongly localized in space with spatial
characteristics intimately related to the AF spin background. The unprecedented
real space electronic structure of the parent cuprate sheds important new light
on the origion of high Tc superconductivity from the doped Mott insulator
perspective.

Computational Complexity aims at studying computational complexity without
referring to external measuring conditions or particular machine models, but
instead by considering restrictions on programming languages or logical
principles implying complexity properties. The aim of this workshop was to
bring together researchers working on implicit computational complexity, from
its logical and semantics aspects to those related to the static analysis of
programs, so as to foster their interaction and to give newcomers an overview
of the current trends in this area.

used to describe spectral fluctuations of chaotic systems. By considering the
Kaniadakis non-Gaussian statistics, characterized by the index {\kappa}
(Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy is recovered in the limit {\kappa}\rightarrow0), we
propose the non-Gaussian deformations ({\kappa} \neq 0) of the conventional
orthogonal and unitary ensembles of random matrices. The joint eigenvalue
distributions for the {\kappa}-deformed ensembles are derived by applying the
principle maximum entropy to Kaniadakis entropy. The resulting distribution
functions are base invarient as they depend on the matrix elements in a trace
form. Using these expressions, we introduce a new generalized form of the
Wigner surmise valid for nearly-chaotic mixed systems, where a
basis-independent description is still expected to hold. We motivate the
necessity of such generalization by the need to describe the transition of the
spacing distribution from chaos to order, at least in the initial stage. We
show several examples about the use of the generalized Wigner surmise to the
analysis of the results of a number of previous experiments and numerical
experiments. Our results suggest the entropic index {\kappa} as a measure for
deviation from the state of chaos. We also introduce a {\kappa}-deformed
Porter-Thomas distribution of transition intensities, which fits the
experimental data for mixed systems better than the commonly-used
gamma-distribution.

stable periodic waves, ranging from almost uniform to very fragmented chains of
weakly interacting and equally spaced solitons, is demonstrated. We show that
these waves may support persistent atomic currents and sound waves with spectra
of Bogoliubov type. Fragmented condensates can be viewed as arrays of Josephson
junctions and the current as a BEC manifestation of the dc-Josephson effect.
The influence of linear defects on BEC superfluidity has been also
investigated. We found that for subcritical velocities, linear defects that are
static with respect to the lattice (while the condensate moves in respect to
both the optical lattice and the defect) preserve the BEC superfluidity.

complex reinterpretation principle for quantum processes. Another unsolved
question concerns the treatment of subluminal components of a tachyonic wave

needs to be formulated such as to allow for localizable tachyonic particles,

that once these choices have been made, the propagator for the neutrino field
