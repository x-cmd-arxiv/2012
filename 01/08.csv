regular lattice. Each agent has an independent opinion (among an arbitrary, but
fixed, number of choices) and its own degree of conviction. The latter changes
every time it interacts with another agent who has a different opinion. The
dynamics leads to size distributions of clusters (made up of agents which have
the same opinion and are located at contiguous spatial positions) which follow
a power law, as long as the range of the interaction between the agents is not
too short, i.e. the system self-organizes into a critical state. Short range
interactions lead to an exponential cut off in the size distribution and to
spatial correlations which cause agents which have the same opinion to be
closely grouped. When the diversity of opinions is restricted to two,
non-consensus dynamic is observed, with unequal population fractions, whereas
consensus is reached if the agents are also allowed to interact with those
which are located far from them.

give an inductive procedure for computing the vanishing topology of the matrix
singularities. The inductive procedure we use is an extension of that
introduced by L\^{e}-Greuel for computing the Milnor number of an ICIS. Instead
of linear subspaces, we use free divisors arising from the geometric
configuration and which correspond to subgroups of the solvable groups.
  Here the vanishing topology involves a singular version of the Milnor fiber;
however, it still has the good connectivity properties and is homotopy
equivalent to a bouquet of spheres, whose number is called the singular Milnor
number. We give formulas for this singular Milnor number in terms of singular
Milnor numbers of various free divisors on smooth subspaces, which can be
computed as lengths of determinantal modules. In addition to being applied to
symmetric, general and skew-symmetric matrix singularities, the results are
also applied to Cohen--Macaulay singularities defined as 2 x 3 matrix

discovered through radial velocity and transit surveys. Regardless of their
formation mechanism, a key evolution issue is the efficiency of their retention
near their host stars. If these planets attained their present-day orbits
during or shortly after the T Tauri phase of their host stars, a large fraction
would have encountered intense stellar magnetic field. Since these planets have
a higher conductivity than the atmosphere of their stars, the magnetic flux
tube connecting the planet and host star would slip though the envelope of the
star faster than across the planet. The induced electro-motive force across the
planet's diameter leads to a potential drop which propagates along a flux tube
away from the planet with an Alfven speed. The foot of the flux tube sweeps
across the stellar surface and the potential drop drives a DC current analogous
to that proposed for the Io-Jupiter electrodynamic interaction. The ohmic
dissipation of this current produces potentially observable hot spots in the
star envelope. The current heats the planet and leads to a Lorrentz torque
which drives the planet's orbit to evolve toward circularization and
synchronization with the star's spin. The net effect is the damping of the
planet's orbital eccentricity. Around slowly (rapidly) spinning stars, this
process also causes rocky planets with periods less than a few days to undergo
orbital decay (expansion/stagnation) within a few Myr. In principle, this
effect can determine the retention efficiency of short-period hot Earths. We
also estimate the ohmic dissipation in these planets and show that it can lead
to severe structure evolution and potential loss of volatile material. However,
these effects may be significantly weakened by the reconnection of the induced
field [Slightly shortened abstract].

peers. This effect is stronger the higher the student performance is. Indeed,
low performance students tend to initiate many transient interactions
independently of the performance of their target. In other words, low
performing students act disassortatively with respect to their social network,

  Dec 2011",,"10.1098/rsta.2012.0004",,"physics.ao-ph astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ultimate climate emergency is a ""runaway greenhouse"": a hot and water
vapour rich atmosphere limits the emission of thermal radiation to space,
causing runaway warming. Warming ceases only once the surface reaches ~1400K
and emits radiation in the near-infrared, where water is not a good greenhouse
gas. This would evaporate the entire ocean and exterminate all planetary life.
Venus experienced a runaway greenhouse in the past, and we expect that Earth
will in around 2 billion years as solar luminosity increases. But could we
bring on such a catastrophe prematurely, by our current climate-altering
activities? Here we review what is known about the runaway greenhouse to answer
this question, describing the various limits on outgoing radiation and how
climate will evolve between these. The good news is that almost all lines of
evidence lead us to believe that is unlikely to be possible, even in principle,
to trigger full a runaway greenhouse by addition of non-condensible greenhouse
gases such as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. However, our understanding of
the dynamics, thermodynamics, radiative transfer and cloud physics of hot and
steamy atmospheres is weak. We cannot therefore completely rule out the
possibility that human actions might cause a transition, if not to full
runaway, then at least to a much warmer climate state than the present one.
High climate sensitivity might provide a warning. If we, or more likely our
remote descendants, are threatened with a runaway greenhouse then
geoengineering to reflect sunlight might be life's only hope. ...[2 sentences

in planetary sciences and astrobiology: as extrasolar planets smaller and
nearer to their stars are detected, some will be in a runaway greenhouse state.

media are investigated in the nonretarded limit. The main focus is the effect
of nonzero tilt between the optical axis and the surface normal on the strength
of van der Waals attraction. General expressions for the van der Waals free
energy are derived using the surface mode method and the transfer-matrix
formalism. To facilitate numerical calculations a temperature-dependent
three-band parameterization of the dielectric tensor of the liquid crystal 5CB
is developed. A solid slab immersed in a liquid crystal experiences a van der
Waals torque that aligns the surface normal relative to the optical axis of the
medium. The preferred orientation is different for different materials. Two
solid slabs in close proximity experience a van der Waals attraction that is
strongest for homeotropic alignment of the intervening liquid crystal for all
the materials studied. The results have implications for the stability of
colloids in liquid crystal hosts.

previously, implying a formation time in agreement with {\Lambda}CDM

HST imaging obtained as part of the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with
Hubble (CLASH). Combining this with revised weak lensing analyses of Subaru
wide field imaging with 5-band Subaru + KPNO photometry, we place tight new
constraints on the halo virial mass M_vir = 2.2\pm0.2\times10^15 M\odot/h70
(within r \approx 3 Mpc/h70) and concentration c = 6.2 \pm 0.3 when assuming a
spherical halo. This agrees broadly with average c(M,z) predictions from recent
{\Lambda}CDM simulations which span 5 <~ <c> <~ 8. Our most significant
systematic uncertainty is halo elongation along the line of sight. To estimate
this, we also derive a mass profile based on archival Chandra X-ray
observations and find it to be ~35% lower than our lensing-derived profile at
r2500 ~ 600 kpc. Agreement can be achieved by a halo elongated with a ~2:1 axis
ratio along our line of sight. For this elongated halo model, we find M_vir =
1.7\pm0.2\times10^15 M\odot/h70 and c_vir = 4.6\pm0.2, placing rough lower
limits on these values. The need for halo elongation can be partially obviated
by non-thermal pressure support and, perhaps entirely, by systematic errors in
the X-ray mass measurements. We estimate the effect of background structures
based on MMT/Hectospec spectroscopic redshifts and find these tend to lower
Mvir further by ~7% and increase cvir by ~5%.

power spectrum on the statistical properties of galaxies using a semi-analytic
model of galaxy formation. The WDM spectrum we adopt as a reference case is
suppressed - compared to the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) case - below a
cut-off scale ~ 1 Mpc corresponding (for thermal relic WDM particles) to a mass
m_X=0.75 keV. This ensures consistency with present bounds provided by the
microwave background WMAP data and by the comparison of hydrodynamical N-body
simulations with observed Lyman-{\alpha} forest. We run our fiducial
semi-analytic model with such a WDM spectrum to derive galaxy luminosity
functions (in B, UV, and K bands) and the stellar mass distributions over a
wide range of cosmic epochs, to compare with recent observations and with the
results in the CDM case. The predicted color distribution of galaxies in the
WDM model is also checked against the data. When compared with the standard CDM
case, the luminosity and stellar mass distributions we obtain assuming a WDM
spectrum are characterized by: i) a flattening of the faint end slope and ii) a
sharpening of the cutoff at the bright end for z \lesssim 0.8. We discuss how
the former result is directly related to the smaller number of low-mass haloes
collapsing in the WDM scenario, while the latter is related to the smaller
number of satellite galaxies accumulating in massive haloes at low redshift,
thus suppressing the accretion of small lumps on the central, massive galaxies.
These results shows how a adopting a WDM power spectrum may contribute to solve
two major problems of CDM galaxy formation scenarios, namely, the excess of
predicted faint (low mass) galaxies at low and - most of all - high redshifts,
and the excess of bright (massive) galaxies at low redshifts.

in the singlet state of graphene. Due to the correlation, the chemical
modification of graphene can be considered following a certain algorithmic
computational procedure. Originated due to the correlation and distributed over
the carbon atoms of graphene membrane with fraction numbers NDA, effectively
unpaired electrons lay the algorithm foundation. The highest NDA value points
to the target atom that enters a chemical reaction at the considered step.
Following the pointers, a stepwise design of polyderivatives can be performed.
Applied to the hydrogenation, the algorithmic design has exhibited that
graphene hydrogenation should be attributed to a highly complicated event,
whose final hydride products depend on a number of factors such as: 1) the
manner of the graphene membrane fixation; 2) the accessibility of the membrane
both sides to hydrogen; 3) the composition (molecular or atomic) of the
hydrogen. In general, the hydride formation is multimode in regards composition
and structure. Thus, the formation of 100% hydride with regular chairlike
hexagonal packing of CH units which can be attributed to graphane is possible
if only the graphene membrane is fixed over perimeter while its basal plane is
accessible to hydrogen atoms from both sides.

(which is strictly valid for two point charges at rest), commonly used in the
study of energy levels of hydrogen atom is not the correct one, because the
electron in the hydrogen atom moves with relativistic speeds with respect to
the nucleus. Retardation effect has to be considered in accordance with
Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert (or retarded) potential of a moving charge or the
relativistic electrodynamics. However, such a consideration introduces a
correction to the Coulomb potential, whose quantum mechanical expectation value
is estimated at $E_{ret} = - \frac{mc^2\alpha ^4}{2n^3(l+1/2)}$, which is of
the same order as the fine structure of hydrogen atom and hence added to the
standard energy eigenvalue values of H-atom. This correction lifts the
$l$-degeneracy in the spectra of H-atom and hence modifies the standard result.
The result disturbs the existing agreement between the theory and experiments
on H-atom and hence requires further theoretical and experimental
re-examination. The implications of this result for the Kepler-problem in
general is also discussed in the context of Heaviside's gravity, which seems to
offer an alternative explanation for the non-Newtonian perihelion advance of
Mercury without invoking the space-time curvature formalism of Einstein's

reflecting angular momentum, circularity, and thickness as function of

[Fe/H]$\simeq$-0.6 the orbital angular momentum decreases, and the orbits
become significantly non-circular and thicker. Radial migration of stars into
the Solar neighborhood would naturally result in a smooth variation in the
orbital properties, but the latter old metal-poor stars form a clear challenge,
in particular because a basic feature of radial migration is that stars remain
on near-circular orbits. When we next select stars on near-circular orbits, we
indeed find besides the \alpha-young 'thin-disk' stars a significant
contribution to the \alpha-old 'thick-disk' metal-rich stars. However, the
remaining \alpha-old 'thick-disk' stars on eccentric orbits, including nearly
all old metal-poor stars, are difficult to explain with radial migration alone,
but might have formed through early-on gas-rich mergers. We thus find
chemo-orbital evidence that the thicker component of the Milky Way disk is not
distinct from the thin component as expected from smooth internal evolution
through radial migration, except for the old metal-poor stars with different

photonic superlattices. In a kind of infinite bichromatic superlattices
satisfying some specific conditions, we obtain a finite portion of their in-gap
states, which are superpositions of finite numbers of their unstable Bloch
waves. By using these unstable in-gap states, we construct exactly several
stable surface states near various interfaces in photonic superlattices. We
analytically explore the parametric dependence of these exact surface states.
Our analysis provides an exact demonstration for the existence of surface
states and would be also helpful to understand surface states in other lattice
systems.

astrophysical exposure. We begin with neutrinos as an energy-loss channel in
ordinary stars and conversely, how stars provide information on neutrinos and
possible other low-mass particles. Next we turn to the Sun as a measurable
source of neutrinos and other particles. Finally we discuss supernova (SN)
neutrinos, the SN 1987A measurements, and the quest for a high-statistics
neutrino measurement from the next nearby SN. We also touch on the subject of
neutrino oscillations in the high-density SN context.

predicted by General Relativity, as these objects cannot be explained otherwise
without introducing new physics. However, there is no observational evidence
that the space-time around them is really described by the Kerr solution. The
Kerr black hole hypothesis can be tested with the already available X-ray data
by extending the continuum-fitting method, a technique currently used by
astronomers to estimate the spins of stellar-mass black hole candidates. In
general, we cannot put a constraint on possible deviations from the Kerr
geometry, but only on some combination between these deviations and the spin.
The measurement of the radio power of transient jets in black hole binaries can
potentially break this degeneracy, thus allowing for testing the Kerr-nature of
these objects.

empirical spectral distribution of eigenvalues converges in probability to a
uniform distribution on the ellipse. The axis of the ellipse are determined by
correlation between $X_{12}$ and $X_{21}$. This result is called Elliptic Law.
Limit distribution doesn't depend on distribution of matrix elements and the

on a system composed of two coupled qubits (two-level systems). Using the
rotating wave approximation (RWA) makes it possible to find simple conditions
for resonant excitation of the four-level system. We find that the resonance
conditions include the coupling strength between the qubits. Numerical
simulations confirm the qualitative conclusions following from the RWA. To
reveal the peculiarities of resonant transitions caused by the quasi-level
motion and crossing in a periodic driving field, we use Floquet states, which
determine the precise intermediate states of the system. Calculating the
quasi-energy states of the multi-level system makes it possible to find the
transition probabilities and build interference patterns for the transition
probabilities. The interference patterns demonstrate the possibility of
obtaining various pieces of information about the qubits, since the positions
of transition-probability maxima depend on various system parameters, including
the coupling strength between the qubits.
