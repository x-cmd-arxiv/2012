particles subject to non-local electromagnetic (EM) interactions arising in the
EM radiation-reaction (RR) phenomena is due to the definition of the related
non-local Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems. The lack of a standard
Lagrangian/Hamiltonian formulation in the customary asymptotic approximation
for the RR equation may inhibit the construction of consistent kinetic and
fluid theories. In this paper the issue is investigated in the framework of
Special Relativity. It is shown that, for finite-size spherically-symmetric
classical charged particles, non-perturbative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
formulations in standard form can be obtained, which describe particle dynamics
in the presence of the exact EM RR self-force. As a remarkable consequence,
based on axiomatic formulation of classical statistical mechanics, the
covariant kinetic theory for systems of charged particles subject to the EM RR
self-force is formulated in Hamiltonian form. A fundamental feature is that the
non-local effects enter the kinetic equation only through the retarded particle
4-position, which permits the construction of the related non-local fluid
equations. In particular, the moment equations obtained in this way do not
contain higher-order moments, allowing as a consequence the adoption of
standard closure conditions. A remarkable aspect of the theory concerns the
short delay-time asymptotic expansions. Here it is shown that two possible
expansions are permitted. Both can be implemented for the single-particle
dynamics as well as for the corresponding kinetic and fluid treatments. In the
last case, they are performed a posteriori on the relevant moment equations
obtained after integration of the kinetic equation over the velocity space.

of the dynamics of classical $N$-body systems of mutually-interacting

interactions, including both binary and self interactions (EM-interacting
$N$-body systems). In this paper it is shown that such a description can be

of a $N$-body system of classical finite-size charged particles. A variational

Hamiltonian equations of motion for the dynamics of the interacting $N$-body
system are derived, which are proved to be delay-type ODEs. Then, a

developed retains both the covariance with respect to the Lorentz group and the
exact Hamiltonian structure of the problem, which is shown to be intrinsically
non-local. Different applications of the theory are investigated. The first one
concerns the development of a suitable Hamiltonian approximation of the exact

become inadequate and one needs to revert to the more fundamental underlying
kinetic theory. This occurs when the plasma becomes effectively collisionless

accretion flows onto black holes. In this paper, we lay down the basics of
kinetic theory in these contexts. In particular, we formulate the kinetic

the determination of consistent equilibrium configurations for accretion-disk
plasmas and investigation of their stability properties. In the case of
collisionless plasmas kinetic theory provides the appropriate theoretical
framework. This paper presents a kinetic description of low-frequency and
long-wavelength axisymmetric electromagnetic perturbations in non-relativistic,
strongly-magnetized and gravitationally-bound axisymmetric accretion-disk
plasmas in the collisionless regime. The analysis, carried out within the
framework of the Vlasov-Maxwell description, relies on stationary kinetic
solutions of the Vlasov equation which allow for the simultaneous treatment of
non-uniform fluid fields, stationary accretion flows and temperature
anisotropies. It is demonstrated that, for such solutions, no axisymmetric
unstable perturbations can exist occurring on characteristic time and space
scales which are long compared with the Larmor gyration time and radius. Hence,
these stationary configurations are actually stable against axisymmetric
kinetic instabilities of this type. As a fundamental consequence, this rules
out the possibility of having the axisymmetric magneto-rotational or thermal
instabilities to arise in these systems.

the emergence of order in large disordered structures. Ramsey numbers mark the
threshold at which order first appears and are extremely difficult to calculate
due to their explosive rate of growth. Recently, an algorithm that can be
implemented using adiabatic quantum evolution has been proposed that calculates
the two-color Ramsey numbers $R(m,n)$. Here we present results of an
experimental implementation of this algorithm and show that it correctly
determines the Ramsey numbers R(3,3) and $R(m,2)$ for $4\leq m\leq 8$. The
R(8,2) computation used 84 qubits of which 28 were computational qubits. This
computation is the largest experimental implementation of a scientifically

increase in proportion in the different experiments, especially in the forward
regions like, for instance, the muons chambers of the ATLAS detector. Detectors
based on the Micromegas principle should be good alternatives for the detector
upgrade in the HL-LHC framework because of a good spatial (<100 \mum) and time
(few ns) resolutions, high-rate capability, radiation hardness, good robustness
and the possibility to build large areas. The aim of this study is to
demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the discharge probability and protect
the electronics by using a resistive anode plane in a high flux hadrons
environment. Several prototypes of 10x10 cm2, with different pitches (0.5 to 2
mm) and different resistive layers have been tested at CERN (pi+@SPS). Several
tests have been performed with a telescope at different voltages to assess the
performances of the detectors in terms of position resolution and efficiency.
The spark behaviour in these conditions has also been evaluated. Resistive
coating has been shown to be a successful method to reduce the effect of sparks
on the efficiency of micromegas. A good spatial resolution (~80 \mum) can be
reached with a resistive strip coating detector of 1mm pitch and a high
efficiency (> 98%) can be achieved with resistive-anode micromegas detector. An
X-rays irradiation has been also performed, showing no ageing effect after more
than 21 days exposure and an integrated charge of almost 1C.

theory and to characterising exoplanetary systems. Asteroseismology offers a
promising way to estimate stellar mean density. When combined with accurate
radii determinations, such as is expected from GAIA, this yields accurate
stellar masses. The main difficulty is finding the best way to extract the mean
density from a set of observed frequencies.
  We seek to establish a new method for estimating stellar mean density, which
combines the simplicity of a scaling law while providing the accuracy of an
inversion technique.
  We provide a framework in which to construct and evaluate kernel-based linear
inversions which yield directly the mean density of a star. We then describe
three different inversion techniques (SOLA and two scaling laws) and apply them
to the sun, several test cases and three stars.
  The SOLA approach and the scaling law based on the surface correcting
technique described by Kjeldsen et al. (2008) yield comparable results which
can reach an accuracy of 0.5 % and are better than scaling the large frequency
separation. The reason for this is that the averaging kernels from the two
first methods are comparable in quality and are better than what is obtained
with the large frequency separation. It is also shown that scaling the large
frequency separation is more sensitive to near-surface effects, but is much
less affected by an incorrect mode identification. As a result, one can
identify pulsation modes by looking for an l and n assignment which provides
the best agreement between the results from the large frequency separation and
those from one of the two other methods. Non-linear effects are also discussed
as is the effects of mixed modes. In particular, it is shown that mixed modes
bring little improvement as a result of their poorly adapted kernels.

density enhancements in the circumstellar matter have been reported. CO is
ubiquitous in the CSE, while CCH emission comes from a spatially confined
shell. With the IRAM 30m telescope and Herschel/HIFI, we recently detected
unexpectedly strong emission from the CCH N=4-3, 6-5, 7-6, 8-7, and 9-8
transitions, challenging the available chemical and physical models. We aim to
constrain the physical properties of IRC+10216's CSE, including the effect of
episodic mass loss on the observed emission. In particular, we aim to determine
the excitation region and conditions of CCH and to reconcile these with
interferometric maps of the N=1-0 transition. Via radiative-transfer modelling,
we provide a physical description of the CSE, constrained by the SED and a
sample of 20 high-resolution and 29 low-resolution CO lines. We further present
detailed radiative-transfer analysis of CCH. Assuming a distance of 150pc, the
SED is modelled with a stellar luminosity of 11300Lsun and a dust-mass-loss
rate of 4.0\times10^{-8}Msun/yr. Based on the analysis of 20 high resolution CO
observations, an average gas-mass-loss rate for the last 1000yrs of
1.5\times10^{-5}Msun/yr is derived. This gives a gas-to-dust-mass ratio of 375,
typical for an AGB star. The gas kinetic temperature throughout the CSE is
described by 3 powerlaws: it goes as r^{-0.58} for r<9R*, as r^{-0.40} for
9<=r<=65R*, and as r^{-1.20} for r>65R*. This model successfully describes all
49 CO lines. We show the effect of wind-density enhancements on the
CCH-abundance profile, and the good agreement of the model with the CCH N=1-0
transition and with the lines observed with the 30m telescope and HIFI. We
report on the importance of radiative pumping to the vibrationally excited
levels of CCH and the significant effect this has on the excitation of all
levels of the CCH-molecule.

detected in the time-averaged spectrum taken with the RGS. Using the ratio of
fluxed EPIC and RGS spectra, we put tight constraints on the variability of the
absorbers. Monitoring with the Swift satellite started 6 weeks before the
XMM-Newton observations, allowing to use the ionising flux history and to
develop a model for the time-dependent photoionisation. Components A and B are
too weak for variability studies, but the distance for component A is known
from optical imaging of the [O III] line to be ~3 kpc. During the 5 weeks of
the XMM-Newton observations we found no evidence of changes in the 3 X-ray
dominant ionisation components C-E, despite a huge soft X-ray intensity
increase of 60% in the middle of our campaign. This excludes high-density gas
close to the black hole. Instead, using our time-dependent modelling, we find
low density and derive firm lower limits to the distance of these components.
Component D shows evidence for variability on longer time scales, yielding an
upper limit to the distance. For component E we derive an upper limit to the
distance based on the argument that the thickness of the absorbing layer must
be less than its distance to the black hole. Combining these results, at the
90% confidence level, component C has a distance of >70 pc, component D between
5-33 pc, and component E >5 pc but smaller than 21-400 pc, depending upon
modelling details. These results are consistent with the upper limits from the
HST/COS observations of our campaign and point to an origin of the dominant,
slow (v<1000 km/s) outflow components in the NLR or torus-region of Mrk 509.

solution to this deficiency: the observation process $Y$ is ""lifted"" to the
process $\mathbf{Y}$ that consists of $Y$ and its corresponding L\'{e}vy area
process, and we show that there exists a continuous map $\theta_t^f$, defined
on a suitably chosen space of H\""{o}lder continuous paths such that
$\pi_t(f)=\theta_t^f(\mathbf{Y})$, almost surely.

effectively lower-dimensional superconducting systems even at zero temperature
due to enhanced topological quantum phase fluctuations. In quasi-1D wires,
these fluctuations are described in terms of ""quantum phase-slip"" (QPS):
tunneling of the superconducting order parameter for the wire between states
differing by $\pm2\pi$ in their relative phase between the wire's ends. Over
the last several decades, many deviations from conventional bulk
superconducting behavior have been observed in ultra-narrow superconducting
nanowires, some of which have been identified with QPS. While at least some of
the observations are consistent with existing theories for QPS, other
observations in many cases point to contradictory conclusions or cannot be
explained by these theories. Hence, a unified understanding of the nature of
QPS, and its relationship to the various observations has yet to be achieved.
In this paper we present a new model for QPS which takes as its starting point
an idea originally postulated by Mooij and Nazarov [Nature Physics {\bf 2}, 169
(2006)]: that \textit{flux-charge duality}, a classical symmetry of Maxwell's
equations, can be used to relate QPS to the well-known Josephson tunneling of
Cooper pairs. Our model provides an alternative, and qualitatively different,
conceptual basis for QPS and the phenomena which arise from it in experiments,
and it appears to permit for the first time a unified understanding of
observations across several different types of experiments and materials
systems.

where secondary users collect local energy statistics and report their findings

probability is quantitively analyzed to capture the dynamic nature of both
observation and fusion channels, assuming fixed amplifier gains for relaying
local statistics to the fusion center. Second, the system level overhead of
cooperative spectrum sensing is addressed by considering both the local
processing cost and the transmission cost. Local processing cost incorporates
the overhead of sample collection and energy calculation that must be conducted
by each secondary user; the transmission cost accounts for the overhead of
forwarding the energy statistic computed at each secondary user to the fusion
center. Results show that when jointly designing the number of collected energy
samples and transmission amplifier gains, only one secondary user needs to be
actively engaged in spectrum sensing. Furthermore, when number of energy
samples or amplifier gains are fixed, closed form expressions for optimal
solutions are derived and a generalized water-filling algorithm is provided.

increase the oscillation frequency by storing most of the mechanical energy in
a lossless optical potential, thereby strongly diluting the effect of material
dissipation. By using a 130 nm thick SiO$_2$ disk as a suspended pendulum, we
achieve an increase in the pendulum center-of-mass frequency from 6.2 kHz to
145 kHz. The corresponding quality factor increases 50-fold from its intrinsic
value to a final value of $Q=5.8(1.1)\times 10^5$, representing more than an
order of magnitude improvement over the conventional limits of SiO$_2$ for this

minus sign, are commonly used to model relationships in social networks.
Recently, Kermarrec and Thraves initiated the study of the problem of
appropriately visualising the network: They asked whether any signed graph can
be embedded into the metric space R^l in such a manner that every vertex is
closer to all its friends (neighbours via positive edges) than to all its
enemies (neighbours via negative edges). Interestingly, embeddability into R^1
can be expressed as a purely combinatorial problem. In this paper we pursue a
deeper study of this particular case, answering several questions posed by
Kermarrec and Thraves.
  First, we refine the approach of Kermarrec and Thraves for the case of
complete signed graphs by showing that the problem is closely related to the
recognition of proper interval graphs. Second, we prove that the general case,
whose polynomial-time tractability remained open, is in fact NP-complete.
Finally, we provide lower and upper bounds for the time complexity of the
general case: we prove that the existence of a subexponential time (in the
number of vertices and edges of the input signed graph) algorithm would violate
the Exponential Time Hypothesis, whereas a simple dynamic programming approach
gives a running time single-exponential in the number of vertices.

attention and study, since through them, a natural explanation can be offered
to current questions such as the big differences in the values of the masses of
the quarks (hierarchy of masses), the possible generation of flavor changing
neutral currents (inspired by the evidence about the oscillations of
neutrinos), besides the possibility that some models, with more complicated
symmetries than those of the standard model, have a non standard low energy
limit. The simplest extension of the standard model known as the
two-Higgs-doublet-model (2HDM) involves a second Higgs doublet. The 2HDM
predicts the existence of five scalar particles: three neutral ($A^{0}$),
($h^{0}$, $H^{0}$) and two charged ($H^{\pm}$). The purpose of this work is to
determine in a natural and easy way the mass eigenstates and masses of these
five particles, in terms of the parameters $\lambda_{i}$ introduced in the
minimal extended Higgs sector potential that preserves the CP symmetry. We
discuss several cases of Higgs mixings and the one in which two neutral states
are degenerate. As the values of the quartic interactions between the scalar
doublets are not theoretically determined, it is of great interest to explore
and constrain their values, therefore we analize the stability and triviality
bounds using the Lagrange multipliers method and numerically solving the
renormalization group equations. Through the former results one can establish
the region of validity of the model under several circumstances considered in

this quantization scheme is equivalent to a holomorphic quantization scheme
proposed earlier and based on geometric quantization. We proceed to include
observables into the scheme, quantized also through the path integral. We show
that the quantized observables satisfy the canonical commutation relations, a
feature shared with other quantization schemes also discussed. However, in
contrast to other schemes the presented quantization also satisfies a
correspondence between the composition of classical observables through their
product and the composition of their quantized counterparts through spacetime
gluing. In the special case of quantum field theory in Minkowski space this
reproduces the operationally correct composition of observables encoded in the
time-ordered product. We show that the quantization scheme also generalizes
other features of quantum field theory such as the generating function of the

particle hydrodynamics (SPH) in order to study the effects of discrete jets on
the processes of plasma liner formation, implosion on vacuum, and expansion.
The pressure history of the inner portion of the liner was qualitatively and
quantitatively similar from peak compression through the complete stagnation of
the liner among simulation results from two one dimensional
radiationhydrodynamic codes, 3D SPH with a uniform liner, and 3D SPH with 30
discrete plasma jets. Two dimensional slices of the pressure show that the
discrete jet SPH case evolves towards a profile that is almost
indistinguishable from the SPH case with a uniform liner, showing that
non-uniformities due to discrete jets are smeared out by late stages of the
implosion. Liner formation and implosion on vacuum was also shown to be robust
to Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth. Interparticle mixing for a liner
imploding on vacuum was investigated. The mixing rate was very small until
after peak compression for the 30 jet simulation.

that the quark gluon plasma behaves almost like an ideal fluid. Due to its
short lifetime, many QGP properties can only be inferred indirectly through a
comparison of the final state measurements with transport model calculations.
Among the current phenomena of interest are the interdependencies between two
collective flow phenomena, elliptic and triangular flow. The former is mostly
related to the initial geometry and collective expansion of the system whereas
the latter is sensitive to the fluctuations of the initial state. For our
investigation we use a hybrid transport model based on the Ultra-relativistic
Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach using an ideal
hydrodynamic expansion for the hot and dense stage. Using UrQMD initial
conditions for an Au-Au collision, particles resulting from a collision are
mapped into an energy density distribution that is evolved event-by-event with
a hydrodynamic calculation. By averaging these distributions over different
numbers of events, we have studied how the granularity/smoothness of the
distribution affects the initial eccentricity, the initial triangularity, and
the resulting flow components. The average elliptic flow in non central
collisions is not sensitive to the granularity, while triangular flow is. The
triangularity might thus provide a good measure of the amount of initial state
fluctuations that is necessary to reproduce the experimental data.

Imperial College London, we explore the applicability of Yangian symmetry to
various integrable models, in particular, in relation with S-matrices. One of
the main themes in this work is that, after a careful study of the mathematics
of the symmetry algebras one finds that in an integrable model, one can
directly reconstruct S-matrices just from the algebra. It has been known for a
long time that S-matrices in integrable models are fixed by symmetry. However,
Lie algebra symmetry, the Yang-Baxter equation, crossing and unitarity, which
are what constrains the S-matrix in integrable models, are often taken to be
separate, independent properties of the S-matrix. Here, we construct scattering
matrices purely from the Yangian, showing that the Yangian is the right
algebraic object to unify all required symmetries of many integrable models. In
particular, we reconstruct the S-matrix of the principal chiral field, and, up
to a CDD factor, of other integrable field theories with su(n) symmetry.
Furthermore, we study the AdS/CFT correspondence, which is also believed to be
integrable in the planar limit. We reconstruct the S-matrices at weak and at
strong coupling from the Yangian or its classical limit. We give a pedagogical
introduction into the subject, presenting a unified perspective of Yangians and
their applications in physics. This paper should hence be accessible to
mathematicians who would like to explore the application of algebraic objects
to physics as well as to physicists interested in a deeper understanding of the
mathematical origin of physical quantities.

the central black hole, consistent with what is expected for accretion disk
winds/outflows. The mass outflow rates are constrained between ~0.01-1

lower-upper limits on the mechanical power are log\dot{E}_K~42.6-44.6 erg

for the description of quasi-relaxed rotating stellar systems are presented.
The first extends the spherical King models to the case of solid-body rotation.
The second is characterized by differential rotation, designed to be rigid in
the central regions and to vanish in the outer parts, where the energy
truncation becomes effective. The models are constructed by solving the
nonlinear Poisson equation for the self-consistent mean-field potential. For
rigidly rotating configurations, the solutions are obtained by an asymptotic
expansion on the rotation strength parameter. The differentially rotating
models are constructed by means of an iterative approach based on a Legendre
series expansion of the density and the potential. The two classes of models
exhibit complementary properties. The rigidly rotating configurations are
flattened toward the equatorial plane, with deviations from spherical symmetry
that increase with the distance from the center. For models of the second
family, the deviations from spherical symmetry are strongest in the central
region, whereas the outer parts tend to be quasi-spherical. The relevant
parameter spaces are explored and the intrinsic and projected structural
properties are described. Special attention is given to the effect of different
options for the truncation of the distribution function in phase space. Models
in the moderate rotation regime are best suited to applications to globular
clusters. For general interest in stellar dynamics, at high values of the
rotation strength the differentially rotating models exhibit a toroidal core
embedded in a quasi-spherical configuration. Physically simple analytical
models of the kind presented here provide insights into dynamical mechanisms
and may be a basis for more realistic investigations with the help of N-body
simulations.

positive effect of biased utility functions is due to the suppressed feedback
of individual success, which leads to a spontaneous separation of

technique has revealed the presence of unexpected small-scale magnetic fields
on the surfaces of Ap stars. These studies were recently criticisied by Stift
et al. (2012), who claimed that magnetic inversions are not robust and are
undermined by neglecting a feedback on the Stokes line profiles from the local
atmospheric structure in the regions of enhanced metal abundance. We show that
Stift et al. misinterpreted published magnetic Doppler imaging results and
neglected some of the most fundamental principles behind magnetic mapping. We
demonstrate that the variation of atmospheric structure across the surface of a
star with chemical spots affects the local continuum intensity but is
negligible for the normalised local Stokes profiles. For the disk-integrated
spectra of an Ap star with extreme abundance variations, we find that the
assumption of a mean model atmosphere leads to moderate errors in Stokes I but
is negligible for polarisation spectra. Employing a new magnetic inversion
code, which incorporates the horizontal variation of atmospheric structure, we
reconstructed new maps of magnetic field and Fe abundance for the Ap star
alpha^2 CVn. The resulting distribution of chemical spots changes
insignificantly compared to the previous modelling based on a single model
atmosphere, while the magnetic field geometry does not change at all. This
shows that the assertions by Stift et al. are exaggerated as a consequence of
unreasonable assumptions and extrapolations, as well as methodological flaws
and inconsistencies of their analysis. Our discussion proves that published
magnetic inversions based on a mean stellar atmosphere are robust and reliable,
and that the presence of small-scale magnetic field structures on the surfaces
of Ap stars is real.

galactic nuclei (AGN) in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers, using a
novel physical prescription. This model is used to determine the origin of
double-peaked NL (dNL) AGN in merging galaxies and their connection to
supermassive black hole (SMBH) pairs, motivated by recent observations of such
objects. We find that dNL AGN induced by the relative motion of SMBH pairs are
a generic but short-lived feature of gaseous major mergers. dNL AGN should
often be observed in late-stage mergers, during the kpc-scale phase of SMBH
inspiral or soon after the SMBH merger. However, even within the kpc-scale
phase, only a minority of dNL AGN are directly induced by SMBH motion; their
lifetimes are typically a few Myr. Most double peaks arise from gas kinematics
near the SMBH, although prior to the SMBH merger up to 80% of all dNL profiles
may be influenced by SMBH motion via altered peak ratios or velocity offsets.
The total lifetimes of dNL AGN depend strongly on viewing angle and on
properties of the merging galaxies. Also, in a typical merger, at least 10-40%
of the double peaks induced by SMBH motion have small projected separations,
0.1-1 kpc, such that dual peaks of stellar surface brightness are not easily
resolved. Diffuse tidal features can indicate late-stage galaxy mergers,
although they do not distinguish SMBH pairs from merged SMBHs. We show that dNL
profiles with peak velocity splittings > 500 km s^-1 or with measurable overall
velocity shifts are often associated with SMBH pairs. Our results support the
notion that selection of dNL AGN is a promising method for identifying dual
SMBH candidates, but demonstrate the critical importance of high-resolution,
multi-wavelength follow-up observations, and the use of multiple lines of
evidence, for confirming the dual nature of candidate SMBH pairs. (Abridged)

two-point functions become power-law, with a universal form for $\theta > 0$.
Next, the calculation of the holographic entanglement entropy reveals the
existence of novel phases which violate the area law. The entropy in these

that exhibited by systems with extensive entanglement entropy. Finally, we
describe microscopic embeddings of some $\theta \neq 0$ metrics into full

revolutionized our knowledge of the hard X-ray sky thanks to its unprecedented
imaging capabilities and source detection positional accuracy above 20 keV.
Nevertheless, many of the newly-detected sources in the INTEGRAL sky surveys
are of unknown nature. The combined use of available information at longer
wavelengths (mainly soft X-rays and radio) and of optical spectroscopy on the
putative counterparts of these new hard X-ray objects allows us to pinpoint
their exact nature. Continuing our long-standing program that has been running
since 2004, and using 6 different telescopes of various sizes, we report the
classification through optical spectroscopy of 22 more unidentified or poorly
studied high-energy sources detected with the IBIS instrument onboard INTEGRAL.
We found that 16 of them are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), while the remaining
6 objects are within our Galaxy. Among the identified extragalactic sources, 14
are Type 1 AGNs; of these, 6 lie at redshift larger than 0.5 and one has z =
3.12, which makes it the second farthest object detected in the INTEGRAL
surveys up to now. The remaining AGNs are of type 2, and one of them is a pair
of interacting Seyfert 2 galaxies. The Galactic objects are identified as two
cataclysmic variables, one high-mass X-ray binary, one symbiotic binary and two
chromospherically active stars. We thus still find that AGNs are the most
abundant population among hard X-ray objects identified through optical
spectroscopy. Moreover, we note that the higher sensitivity of the more recent
INTEGRAL surveys is now enabling the detection of high-redshift AGNs, thus
allowing the exploration of the most distant hard X-ray emitting sources and
possibly of the most extreme blazars.

focus on the colours FUV-i, NUV-i, FUV-NUV, u*-g and g-i. We find that all of
these colours are correlated with both luminosity and velocity dispersion at
the >5 sigma level, with FUV-i and FUV-NUV becoming bluer with increasing
`mass' while the other colours become redder. We perform an empirical analysis
to assess what fraction of the variation in each colour can be accounted for by
variations in the average stellar populations, as traced by the optical
spectra. For u*-g and g-i, most of the observed scatter (~80% after allowing
for measurement errors and for systematic errors in u*-g) is attributable to
stellar population variations, with colours becoming redder with increasing age
and metallicity (Mg/H). The FUV-i colour becomes bluer with increasing age and
with increasing Mg/H, favouring a `metal-rich single-star' origin for the UV
upturn. However, correlations with the optically-dominant stellar populations
account for only about half of the large observed scatter. We propose that the
excess scatter in FUV-i may be due to a varying proportion of ancient stars in
galaxies with younger average ages. The NUV-i colour is sensitive to age and
Mg/H, but exhibits excess scatter that can be attributed to `leakage' of the
FUV upturn. Applying a correction based on the FUV-i colour we account for ~80%
of the variance in NUV-i, as for the optical colours. The FUV-NUV colour shows
strong correlations with age and Mg/H, and little residual scatter.
Interpreting this colour is complicated however, since it mixes the effects
from the main-sequence turn-off with those from the hot evolved stars.

3$h^{-3}$Gpc$^3$, enabling tight constraints to be derived on the amount of
dark matter in the form of massive neutrinos. A new bound on the sum of
neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu < 0.26$ eV, at 95% confidence level (CL), is
obtained after combining our sample of galaxies, which we call ""CMASS"", with
WMAP 7 year Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the most recent
measurement of the Hubble parameter from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This
constraint is obtained with a conservative multipole range choice of $30 < \ell
< 200$ in order to minimize non-linearities, and a free bias parameter in each
of the four redshift bins. We study the impact of assuming this linear galaxy
bias model using mock catalogs, and find that this model causes a small ($\sim
1-1.5 \sigma$) bias in $\Omega_{\rm DM} h^2$. For this reason, we also quote
neutrino bounds based on a conservative galaxy bias model containing
additional, shot noise-like free parameters. In this conservative case, the
bounds are significantly weakened, e.g. $\sum m_\nu < 0.36$ eV (95% confidence
level) for WMAP+HST+CMASS ($\ell_{\rm max}=200$). We also study the dependence
of the neutrino bound on multipole range ($\ell_{\rm max}=150$ vs $\ell_{\rm
max}=200$) and on which combination of data sets is included as a prior. The
addition of supernova and/or Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data does not
significantly improve the neutrino mass bound once the HST prior is included.

Numerical simulations, however, show that about 5-30% of the pressure in a
cluster is provided by turbulence induced by, for example, the central AGN and
merger activity. We aim to put constraints on the turbulent velocities and
turbulent pressure in the ICM of the giant elliptical galaxies NGC 5044 and NGC
5813 using XMM-Newton RGS observations. The magnitude of the turbulence is
estimated using the Fe XVII lines at 15.01 A, 17.05 A, and 17.10 A in the RGS
spectra. At low turbulent velocities, the gas becomes optically thick in the
15.01 A line due to resonant scattering, while the 17 A lines remain optically
thin. By comparing the (I(17.05)+I(17.10))/I(15.01) line ratio from RGS with
simulated line ratios for different Mach numbers, the level of turbulence is
constrained. The measurement is limited by systematic uncertainties in the
atomic data, which are at the 20-30% level. We find that the line ratio in NGC
5813 is significantly higher than in NGC 5044. This difference can be explained
by a higher level of turbulence in NGC 5044. The high turbulent velocities and
the fraction of the turbulent pressure support of >40% in NGC 5044, assuming
isotropic turbulence, confirm that it is a highly disturbed system, probably
due to an off-axis merger. The turbulent pressure support in NGC 5813 is more
modest at 15-45%. The (I(17.05)+I(17.10))/I(15.01) line ratio in an optically
thin plasma, calculated using AtomDB v2.0.1, is 2 sigma above the ratio
measured in NGC 5044, which cannot be explained by resonant scattering. This
shows that the discrepancies between theoretical, laboratory, and astrophysical
data on Fe XVII lines need to be reduced to improve the accuracy of the
determination of turbulent velocities using resonant scattering.

is a ring of polar orbits that move in a plane perpendicular to the binary
pericenter direction. We favour this interpretation because it includes the
effect of secular perturbations and the disk can survive for Gyr timescales.
The second model is a misaligned ring. Because there is an ambiguity in the
orientation of the ring, which could be reflected in the sky plane, this ring
either has near-polar orbits similar to the first model, or has a 30 degree
misalignment. The misaligned ring, interpreted as the result of a recent
collision, is shown to be implausible from constraints on the collisional and
dynamical evolution. Because disk+star systems with separations similar to 99
Herculis should form coplanar, possible formation scenarios involve either a
close stellar encounter or binary exchange in the presence of circumstellar

young substellar candidates uncovered in our previous photometric survey. The
spectral types and extinction were derived for a newly found population of
substellar objects, and its masses estimated by comparison to evolutionary
models. A thoroughly literature search was conducted to provide an up-to-date

functions, as well as the ratio of brown dwarfs to stars in the cluster. These
results were then compared to other young clusters. It is shown that the study

only by the high extinction in the cluster ruling out an apparent paucity of
brown dwarfs. The discovery of 16 new members of rho Ophiuchi, 13 of them in

success of our photometric candidate selection with the WIRCam survey. The

velocity dispersion (>75 km/s). Using this sample we show that at fixed
velocity dispersion there is no dependence of the clustering amplitude on
stellar or dynamical mass. Conversely when stellar or dynamical mass are fixed
there is a clear dependence of the clustering amplitude on velocity dispersion
with higher dispersion galaxies showing a higher clustering amplitude. We also
show that whilst when stellar or dynamical mass are fixed there remains a
dependence of clustering amplitude on morphology, there is no such dependency
when dispersion is fixed. However, we do see a dependence of the clustering
amplitude on color when both mass and dispersion are fixed. Despite this, even
when we restrict our samples to only elliptical or red galaxies the
relationship between dispersion and clustering amplitude at fixed mass remains.
It seems likely that the residual correlation with color is driven by satellite
galaxies in massive halos being redder at fixed dispersion. The lack of a
similar morphology dependence implies that the mechanism turning satellites red
is not changing their morphology. Our central result is that velocity
dispersion is more closely related to the clustering amplitude of galaxies than
either stellar or dynamical mass. This implies that velocity dispersion is more
tightly correlated with the halo properties that determine clustering, either
halo mass or age, and supports the notion that the star formation history of a
galaxy is more closely related to its halo properties than its overall mass.

kT, which arrange the jets' constituents into trees. Instead of considering a
single tree per jet, we propose that multiple trees should be considered,
weighted by an appropriate metric. Then each jet in each event produces a
distribution for an observable, rather than a single value. Advantages of this
approach include: 1) observables have significantly increased statistical
stability; and, 2) new observables, such as the variance of the distribution,
provide new handles for signal and background discrimination. For example, we
find that employing a set of trees substantially reduces the observed
fluctuations in the pruned mass distribution, enhancing the likelihood of new
particle discovery for a given integrated luminosity. Furthermore, the
resulting pruned mass distributions for (background) QCD jets are found to be
substantially wider than that for (signal) jets with intrinsic mass scales,
e.g. jets containing a W decay. A cut on this width yields a substantial
enhancement in significance relative to a cut on the standard pruned jet mass
alone. In particular the luminosity needed for a given significance requirement
decreases by a factor of two relative to standard pruning.

multiple lines of evidence and supported by stellar wind theory. The purpose of
this paper is to bridge the gap between detailed models of inhomogeneous
stellar winds in single stars and the phenomenological description of donor
winds in supergiant high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We use results from
time-dependent hydrodynamical models of the instability in the line-driven wind
of a massive supergiant star to derive the time-dependent accretion rate onto a
compact object in the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton approximation. The strong density
and velocity fluctuations in the wind result in strong variability of the
synthetic X-ray light curves. The model predicts a large scale X-ray
variability, up to eight orders of magnitude, on relatively short timescales.
The apparent lack of evidence for such strong variability in the observed HMXBs
indicates that the details of accretion process act to reduce the variability
due to the stellar wind velocity and density jumps. We, also, study the
absorption of X-rays in the clumped stellar wind by means of a 2-D stochastic
wind model and find that absorption of X-rays changes strongly at different
orbital phases. Furthermore, we address the photoionization in the clumped
wind, and show that the degree of ionization is affected by the wind clumping.
A correction factor for the photoionization parameter is derived. It is shown
that the photoionization parameter is reduced by a factor Xi compared to the
smooth wind models with the same mass-loss rate, where Xi is the wind
inhomogeneity parameter. We conclude that wind clumping must also be taken into
account when comparing the observed and model spectra of the photoionized
stellar wind.

imaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dust
emission from galaxies at z < 0.35. We find that low redshift galaxies account
for 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),
of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies
(rest-frame g - r). We compare the dust properties of different galaxy
populations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellar
mass, colour and redshift. In blue galaxies we find that dust temperature and
luminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but red
galaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminosities
and temperatures. We make reasonable assumptions to account for the
contaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude that
galaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dust
emission properties. Results indicate that while blue galaxies are more
luminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of the
two samples are relatively similar. Dust mass is shown to correlate with
stellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for low
stellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having the
highest specific star formation rates. We stack the 250{\mu}m/NUV luminosity
ratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation at
lower stellar mass and higher redshift. Submm luminosities and dust masses of
all galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall in
the amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last four

sampling when studying hidden populations, such as injecting drug users or men
who have sex with men, for which no sampling frame is known. The method is an
extension of the snowball sample method and can, given that some assumptions
are met, generate unbiased population estimates. One key assumption, not likely
to be met, is that the acquaintance network in which the recruitment process
takes place is undirected, meaning that all recruiters should have the
potential to be recruited by the person they recruit. Here we investigate the
potential bias of directedness by simulating RDS on real and artificial network
structures. We show that directedness is likely to generate bias that cannot be
compensated for unless the sampled individuals know how many that potentially
may have recruited them (i.e. their indegree), which is unlikely in most
situations. Based on one known parameter, we propose an estimator for RDS on
directed networks when only outdegrees are observed.
  By comparison of current RDS estimators' performances on networks with
varying structures, we find that our new estimator, together with a recent
estimator, which requires the population size as a known quantity, have
relatively low level of estimate error and bias. Based on our new estimator,
sensitivity analysis can be made by varying values of the known parameter to
take uncertainty of network directedness and error in reporting degrees into
account. Finally, we have developed a bootstrap procedure for the new estimator
to construct confidence intervals.

observations of fields that were observed multiple times (>=10) per night, for
several nights, to find asteroids, construct their lightcurves and measure
their rotation periods. Here we describe the pipeline we use to achieve these
goals and present the results from the first four (overlapping) PTF fields
analyzed as part of this program. These fields, which cover an area of 21
deg^2, were observed on four nights with a cadence of ~20 min. Our pipeline was
able to detect 624 asteroids, of which 145 (~20%) were previously unknown. We
present high quality rotation periods for 88 main-belt asteroids and possible
period or lower limit on the period for an additional 85 asteroids. For the
remaining 451 asteroids, we present lower limits on their photometric
amplitudes. Three of the asteroids have lightcurves that are characteristic of
binary asteroids. We estimate that implementing our search for all existing
high-cadence PTF data will provide rotation periods for about 10,000 asteroids
mainly in the magnitude range ~14 to ~20.

problem introduced by Roche (1992) and Yeung (1995). In this setting, a simple
separate coding strategy known as superposition coding was shown to be optimal
in terms of achieving the minimum sum rate (Roche, Yeung, and Hau, 1997) and
the entire admissible rate region (Yeung and Zhang, 1999) of the problem. This
paper considers a natural generalization of SMDC to the secure communication
setting with an additional eavesdropper. It is required that all sources need
to be kept perfectly secret from the eavesdropper as long as the number of
encoder outputs available at the eavesdropper is no more than a given
threshold. First, the problem of encoding individual sources is studied. A
precise characterization of the entire admissible rate region is established
via a connection to the problem of secure coding over a three-layer wiretap
network and utilizing some basic polyhedral structure of the admissible rate
region. Building on this result, it is then shown that superposition coding
remains optimal in terms of achieving the minimum sum rate for the general
secure SMDC problem.

simulations of the dark matter component of nine rich galaxy clusters. Each
cluster is simulated at least at two different numerical resolutions. For eight
of them, the highest resolution corresponds to $\sim 130$ million particles
within the virial radius, while for one this number is over one billion. We
study the structure and substructure of these systems and contrast them with
six galaxy-sized dark matter haloes from the Aquarius Project, simulated at
comparable resolution. This comparison highlights the approximate mass
invariance of CDM halo structure and substructure. We find little difference in
the spherically-averaged mass, pseudo-phase-space density, and velocity
anisotropy profiles of Aquarius and Phoenix haloes. When scaled to the virial
properties of the host halo, the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloes
are also very similar, despite the fact that Aquarius and Phoenix haloes differ
by roughly three decades in virial mass. The most notable difference is that
cluster haloes have been assembled more recently and are thus significantly
less relaxed than galaxy haloes, which leads to decreased regularity, increased
halo-to-halo scatter and sizable deviations from the mean trends. This
accentuates the effects of the strong asphericity of individual clusters on
surface density profiles, which may vary by up to a factor of three at a given
radius, depending on projection. The high apparent concentration reported for
some strong-lensing clusters might very well reflect these effects. A more
recent assembly also explains why substructure in some Phoenix haloes is
slightly more abundant than in Aquarius, especially in the inner regions.
Resolved subhaloes nevertheless contribute only $11 \pm 3%$ of the virial mass
in Phoenix clusters. .

the relay has no access to the codebooks used by the transmitters. The relay is
called oblivious for this reason. Of particular interest is the generalized
compress-and-forward (GCF) strategy, where the destinations jointly decode the
compression indices and the transmitted messages, and their optimality in this
setting. The relay-to-destination links are assumed to be out-of-band with
finite capacity. Two models are investigated: the multiple access relay channel
(MARC) and the interference relay channel (IFRC). For the MARC with an
oblivious relay, a new outerbound is derived and it is shown to be tight by
means of achievability of the capacity region using GCF scheme. For the IFRC
with an oblivious relay, a new strong interference condition is established,
under which the capacity region is found by deriving a new outerbound and
showing that it is achievable using GCF scheme. The result is further extended
to establish the capacity region of M-user MARC with an oblivious relay, and
multicast networks containing M sources and K destinations with an oblivious
relay.

magneto-electric properties, is a remarkable new development in solid state

invariance, with the Fermi velocity playing the role of the velocity of light
($c$). In a crossed electric and magnetic field the single particle states form
Landau levels whose energies can be changed by varying the applied
\emph{in-plane electric} field. The degeneracy remains constant and is
determined by the magnetic field. In the letter we study the nature of the

electromagnetic waves to generate a new optical frequency, which plays a
central role in a variety of applications, such as ultrafast laser systems,
rectifiers, modulators, and optical imaging. However, progress is limited in
the mid-infrared (MIR) region due to the lack of suitable nonlinear materials.
It is desirable to develop a robust system with a strong, electrically tunable
second order optical nonlinearity. Here we demonstrate theoretically that
AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) can exhibit a giant and tunable second order
nonlinear susceptibility \chi ^(2) once an in-plane electric field is applied.
\chi^(2) can be electrically tuned from 0 to ~ {10^5 pm/V}, three orders of
magnitude larger than the widely used nonlinear crystal AgGaSe2. We show that
the unusually large \chi^(2) arises from two different quantum enhanced
two-photon processes thanks to the unique electronic spectrum of BLG. The
tunable electronic bandgap of BLG adds additional tunability on the resonance
of \chi^(2), which corresponds to a tunable wavelength ranging from ~2.6 {\mu}m
to ~3.1 {\mu}m for the up-converted photon. Combined with the high electron
mobility and optical transparency of the atomically thin BLG, our scheme
suggests a new regime of nonlinear photonics based on BLG.

the disk with a 1+1D radiative transfer and determine the distribution of water
ice particles in the disk by the balance between condensation, sublimation, and
photodesorption. We find that photodesorption induced by the far-ultraviolet
radiation from the central star depresses the ice-condensation front toward the
mid-plane and pushes the surface snow line outward significantly when the
stellar effective temperature exceeds a certain critical value. This critical
effective temperature depends on the stellar luminosity and mass, the water
abundance in the disk, and the yield of photodesorption. We present an
approximate analytic formula for the critical temperature. We separate Herbig
Ae/Be stars into two groups on the HR diagram according to the critical
temperature; one is the disks where photodesorption is effective and from which
we may not find ice particles at the surface, and the other is the disks where
photodesorption is not effective. We estimate the snow line position at the
surface of the disk around HD142527 to be 100--300 AU which is consistent with
the water ice detection at >140 AU in the disk. All results depend on the dust
grain size by a complex way and this point requires more work in future.

slices that are diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^3.$ We assume that the fluid
verifies the equation of state $p = c_s^2 \rho,$ where $0 \leq c_s \leq
\sqrt{1/3}$ is the speed of sound. We also assume that the inverse of the scale
factor associated to the expanding spacetime metric verifies a $c_s-$dependent
time-integrability condition. Under these assumptions, we use the vectorfield
energy method to prove that an explicit family of physically motivated,
spatially homogeneous, and spatially isotropic fluid solutions is globally
future-stable under small perturbations of their initial conditions. The
explicit solutions corresponding to each scale factor are analogs of the
well-known spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker family. Our
nonlinear analysis, which exploits dissipative terms generated by the
expansion, shows that the perturbed solutions exist for all future times and
remain close to the explicit solutions. This work is an extension of previous
results, which showed that an analogous stability result holds when the
spacetime is exponentially expanding. In the case of the radiation equation of
state $p = (1/3)\rho,$ we also show that if the time-integrability condition
for the inverse of the scale factor fails to hold, then the explicit fluid
solutions are unstable. More precisely, we show that arbitrarily small smooth
perturbations of the explicit solutions' initial conditions can launch
perturbed solutions that form shocks in finite time. The shock formation proof
is based on the conformal invariance of the relativistic Euler equations when
$c_s^2 = 1/3,$ which allows for a reduction to a well-known result of
Christodoulou.

ultralong-range molecules that emerge from the interaction of a ground state
polar molecule with a Rydberg atom. The external field mixes the Rydberg
electronic states and therefore strongly alters the electric field seen by the
polar diatomic molecule due to the Rydberg electron. As a consequence, the
adiabatic potential energy curves responsible for the molecular binding can be
tuned in such a way that an intersection with neighboring curves occurs. The
latter leads to admixture of s-wave character in the Rydberg wave function and
will substantially facilitate the experimental preparation and realization of
this particular class of Rydberg molecule species.

estimation for LTE Downlink systems under the effect of the channel length. As
LTE Downlink system is a MIMO-OFDMA based system, a cyclic prefix (CP) is
inserted at the beginning of each transmitted OFDM symbol in order to mitigate
both inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI). The
inserted CP is usually equal to or longer than the channel length. However, the
cyclic prefix can be shorter because of some unforeseen channel behaviour.
Previous works have shown that in the case where the cyclic prefix is equal to
or longer than the channel length, LMMSE performs better than LSE but at the
cost of computational complexity .In the other case, LMMSE performs also better
than LS only for low SNR values. However, LS shows better performance for LTE
Downlink systems for high SNR values. Therefore, we propose a hybrid LS-LMMSE
channel estimation technique robust to the channel length effect. MATLAB
Monte-Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed
estimator in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Bit Error Rate (BER) for 2x2
LTE Downlink systems.

the stoichiometric surface implies the inertia of water unless up to a high

For the reduced surface, we find that the oxygen vacancy obviously enhances the

surface with the production of hydrogen gas. In addition, the molecular
dynamics simulations at low temperature 100 K confirm the dissociation process.

Almost no propagating waves with periods less than 140s and 110s are detected

of power are found in highly magnetised regions, such as magnetic bright points

replicate our observational results, confirming that the current breed of
magneto-hydrodynamic simulations are able to accurately represent the lower

naturally occurring magnetoconvective processes, with no specific input driver
present. Using contribution functions extracted from our numerical simulations,
we estimate minimum G-band and 4170 Angstrom continuum formation heights of 100
km and 25 km, respectively. Detected magneto-acoustic oscillations exhibit a
dominant phase delay of -8 degrees between the G-band and 4170 Angstrom

More than 73% of MBPs (73% from observations, 96% from simulations) display

(DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks are treated as a congestion-control problem, but
because most such congestion is caused by malicious hosts not obeying
traditional end-to-end congestion control, the problem must be handled by the
routers. Functionality is added to each router to detect and preferentially
drop packets that probably belong to an attack. Upstream routers are also
notified to drop such packets in order that the router's resources be used to
route legitimate traffic hence term pushback. Client puzzles have been
advocated as a promising countermeasure to DoS attacks in the recent years. In
order to identify the attackers, the victim server issues a puzzle to the
client that sent the traffic. When the client is able to solve the puzzle, it
is assumed to be authentic and the traffic from it is allowed into the server.
If the victim suspects that the puzzles are solved by most of the clients, it
increases the complexity of the puzzles. This puzzle solving technique allows
the traversal of the attack traffic throughout the intermediate routers before
reaching the destination. In order to attain the advantages of both pushback
and puzzle solving techniques, a hybrid scheme called Router based Pushback
technique, which involves both the techniques to solve the problem of DDoS
attacks is proposed. In this proposal, the puzzle solving mechanism is pushed
back to the core routers rather than having at the victim. The router based
client puzzle mechanism checks the host system whether it is legitimate or not
by providing a puzzle to be solved by the suspected host.

tracking readout in NEXT, a neutrinoless {\beta}{\beta} decay experiment which
uses a high pressure gaseous xenon time projection chamber (TPC). The
reconstruction of event track and topology in this gaseous detector is a key
handle for background rejection. Among the commercially available sensors that
can be used for tracking, SiPMs offer important advantages, mainly high gain,
ruggedness, cost-effectiveness and radio-purity. Their main drawback, however,
is their non sensitivity in the emission spectrum of the xenon scintillation
(peak at 175 nm). This is overcome by coating these sensors with the organic
wavelength shifter tetraphenyl butadienne (TPB). In this paper we describe the

is controlled by a Feshbach resonance, is explored throughout the BCS and BEC

action, we first recreate the known result that for a broad resonance the
amplitude of the condensate decays as $t^{-1/2}$ at late times in the BCS
regime whereas it decays as $t^{-3/2}$ in the BEC regime. We then examine the
case of an idealized narrow resonance, and find that this collective mode
decays as $t^{-3/2}$ throughout both the BCS and BEC regimes. Although this
seems to contradict earlier results that damping is identical for both broad
and narrow resonances, the breakdown of the narrow resonance limit restores
this universal behaviour. More measureably, the phase perturbation may give a
shift on the saturated value to which the collective amplitude mode decays,
which vanishes only in the deep BCS regime when the phase and amplitude modes
are decoupled.

chains with bond alternation (explicit dimerization) are studied using a
combination of analytical and numerical methods. The system undergoes a
dimerization transition at a critical bond alternation parameter
$\delta=\delta_{\rm c}$, where $\delta_{\rm c} = 0$ for the S=1/2 chain. The
SU(2)-symmetric sine-Gordon theory is known to be an effective field theory of
the system except at the transition point. The sine-Gordon theory has a
SU(2)-triplet and a SU(2)-singlet of elementary excitation, and the mass ratio
$r$ of the singlet to the triplet is $\sqrt{3}$. However, our numerical
calculation with the infinite time-evolving block decimation method shows that
$r$ depends on the frustration (next-nearest-neighbor coupling) and is
generally different from $\sqrt{3}$. This can be understood as an effect of
marginal perturbation to the sine-Gordon theory. In fact, at the critical
frustration separating the second-order and first-order dimerization
transitions, the marginal operator vanishes and $r=\sqrt{3}$ holds. We derive
the mass ratio $r$ analytically using form-factor perturbation theory combined
with a renormalization-group analysis. Our formula agrees well with the
numerical results, confirming the theoretical picture. The present theory also
implies that, even in the presence of a marginally irrelevant operator, the
mass ratio approaches $\sqrt{3}$ in the very vicinity of the second-order
dimerization critical point $\delta \sim \delta_c$. However, such a region is
extremely small and would be difficult to observe numerically.

complex networks theory. The validity of the modular structure obtained is
essential to confront the problem of the topology-functionality relationship.
Recently, several authors have worked on the limit of resolution that different
community detection algorithms have, making impossible the detection of natural
modules when very different topological scales coexist in the network. Existing
multiresolution methods are not the panacea for solving the problem in extreme
situations, and also fail. Here, we present a new hierarchical multiresolution
scheme that works even when the network decomposition is very close to the
resolution limit. The idea is to split the multiresolution method for optimal
subgraphs of the network, focusing the analysis on each part independently. We
also propose a new algorithm to speed up the computational cost of screening
the mesoscale looking for the resolution parameter that best splits every
subgraph. The hierarchical algorithm is able to solve a difficult benchmark
proposed in [Lancichinetti & Fortunato, 2011], encouraging the further analysis
of hierarchical methods based on the modularity quality function.

bodies, (4)Vesta and (1)Ceres, the two most massive asteroids. Due to the low
thrust propulsion, Dawn will slowly cross and transit through ground-track
resonances, where the perturbations on Dawn orbit may be significant. In this
context, to safety go the Dawn mission from the approach orbit to the lowest
science orbit, it is essential to know the properties of the crossed
resonances. This paper analytically investigates the properties of the major
ground-track resonances (1:1, 1:2, 2:3 and 3:2) appearing for Vesta orbiters:
location of the equilibria, aperture of the resonances and period at the stable
equilibria. We develop a general method using an averaged Hamiltonian
formulation with a spherical harmonic approximation of the gravity field. If
the values of the gravity field coefficient change, our method stays correct
and applicable. We also discuss the effect of one uncertainty on the C20 and
C22 coefficients on the properties of the 1:1 resonance. These results are
checked by numerical tests. We determine that the increase of the eccentricity
appearing in the 2:3 resonance is due to the C22 and S22 coefficients.
  Our method can be easily adapted to missions similar to Dawn because,
contrarily to the numerical results, the analytical formalism stays the same
and is valid for a wide range of physical parameters of the asteroid (namely
the shape and the mass) as well as for different spacecraft orbits.
  Finally we numerically study the probability of the capture in resonance 1:1.
Our paper reproduces, explains and supplements the results of Tricarico and
Sykes (2010).

to assess the influence of the evolution through a common-envelope phase of the
binary system of NGC 6778 on its formation and shaping, we have used
narrow-band images and high-dispersion long-slit spectra of the nebula to
investigate its detailed morphology and kinematics. We find that the overall
structure of NGC 6778 can be described as a bipolar PN. The equatorial ring is
highly disrupted and many radial features (filamentary wisps and cometary
knots) also evidence strong dynamical effects. There are clear connections
between the bipolar lobes and the fast collimated outflows: the collimated
outflows seem to arise from bright knots at the tips of the bipolar lobes,
whereas the kinematics of the bipolar lobes is distorted. We suggest that the
interaction of the fast collimated outflows of NGC 6778 with its nebular
envelope has resulted in the disruption of the nebular shell and equatorial
ring.

roots affect transmission efficiencies, and hence the invasion criterion, for a
soil-borne pathogen as it spreads through ensembles of morphologically complex
hosts. We conclude that the inherent heterogeneities in transmissibilities
arising from correlations in the degrees of overlap between neighbouring
plants, render a population of root systems less susceptible to epidemic
invasion than a corresponding homogeneous system. Several components of
morphological complexity are analysed that contribute to disorder and
heterogeneities in transmissibility of infection. Anisotropy in root shape is
shown to increase resilience to epidemic invasion, while increasing the degree
of branching enhances the spread of epidemics in the population of roots. Some
extension of the methods for other epidemiological systems are discussed.

perceived as a prerequisite for socio-economic development. The efficiency of
creating new knowledge is considered to have a geographical component, i.e.
some regions are more capable in scientific knowledge production than others.
This article shows a method to use a network representation of scientific
interaction to assess the relative efficiency of regions with diverse
boundaries in channeling knowledge through a science system. In a first step, a
weighted aggregate of the betweenness centrality is produced from empirical
data (aggregation). The subsequent randomization of this empirical network
produces the necessary Null-model for significance testing and normalization
(randomization). This step is repeated to yield higher confidence about the
results (re-sampling). The results are robust estimates for the relative
regional efficiency to broker knowledge, which is discussed along with
cross-sectional and longitudinal empirical examples. The network representation
acts as a straight-forward metaphor of conceptual ideas from economic geography
and neighboring disciplines. However, the procedure is not limited to
centrality measures, nor is it limited to spatial aggregates. Therefore, it
offers a wide range of application for scientometrics and beyond.

broad range of momentum transfers Q^2. The uncertainties induced by the
approximations inherent to this local-duality approach are estimated by
studying, in parallel to QCD, quantum-mechanical potential models, where the
exact form factors, obtained by solving the Schr\""odinger equation, may be
compared with the corresponding local-duality sum-rule results. For Q^2 larger
than 5-6 GeV^2, we judge the predictions of the simplest local-duality model to
be reliable and expect their accuracy to improve very fast with increasing Q^2.
The large-Q^2 prediction for the pion elastic form factor should be approached
already at moderate momentum transfer squared of approximately 4-8 GeV^2; large
deviations from its local-duality behaviour for Q^2 = 20-50 GeV^2, predicted by
some hadron-structure models, seem rather unlikely. The (eta, eta') to gamma +
gamma* form factors deduced from the simplest local-duality approach exhibit
excellent agreement with experiment. In startling contrast, BaBar measurements
of the pi^0 to gamma + gamma* form factor imply local-duality violations which
even rise with Q^2.

caused by evolutionary properties. We aim to review the properties of these
rotational velocity distributions in some detail as a function of stellar mass
and age. We have gathered v sin i for a sample of 2014 B6- to F2-type stars. We
have determined the masses and ages for these objects with stellar evolution
models. The (Teff, log L/Lsun)-parameters were determined from the uvby-\beta
photometry and the HIPPARCOS parallaxes. The velocity distributions show two
regimes that depend on the stellar mass. Stars less massive than 2.5 Msun have
a unimodal equatorial velocity distribution and show a monotonical acceleration
with age on the main sequence (MS). Stars more massive have a bimodal
equatorial velocity distribution. Contrarily to theoretical predictions, the
equatorial velocities of stars from about 1.7 Msun to 3.2 Msun undergo a strong
acceleration in the first third of the MS evolutionary phase, while in the last
third of the MS they evolve roughly as if there were no angular momentum
redistribution in the external stellar layers. The studied stars might start in
the ZAMS not necessarily as rigid rotators, but with a total angular momentum
lower than the critical one of rigid rotators. The stars seem to evolve as
differential rotators all the way of their MS life span and the variation of
the observed rotational velocities proceeds with characteristic time scales
\delta(t)\sim 0.2 t_MS, where t_MS is the time spent by a star in the MS.

mushy-layer growth with no flow is unstable to the onset of convection,
resulting in the formation of chimneys. We present regime diagrams to quantify
the state of the flow as a function of the initial liquid concentration, the
porous-medium Rayleigh number, and the sample width. For a given liquid
concentration, increasing both the porous-medium Rayleigh number and the sample
width caused the system to change from a stable state of no flow to a different
state with the formation of chimneys. Decreasing the concentration ratio
destabilized the system and promoted the formation of chimneys. As the initial
liquid concentration increased, onset of convection and formation of chimneys
occurred at larger values of the porous-medium Rayleigh number, but the
critical cell widths for chimney formation are far less sensitive to the liquid
concentration. At the highest liquid concentration, the mushy-layer mode of
convection did not occur in the experiment. The formation of multiple chimneys
and the morphological transitions between these states are discussed. The
experimental results are interpreted in terms of a previous theoretical
analysis of finite amplitude convection with chimneys, with a single value of

excess of positron events that cannot be explained by conventional cosmology
and particle physics, and are usually ascribed to the dark matter presence (in
particular, weak interacting massive particles). The dark matter interpretation
of PAMELA data has motivated the study of alternative cosmological models (with
respect to the standard cosmology) owing to the fact that they predict an
enhancement of the Hubble expansion rate, giving rise, in such a way, to
thermal relics with a larger relic abundance. Our analysis shows that $f(R)$
cosmology allows to explain the PAMELA puzzle for dark matter relic particles
with masses of the order or lesser than $10^2$ GeV in the regime $\rho^c

$n\simeq 1$ and small corrections with respect to General Relativity could lead
indeed to address the experimental results. However other interesting
cosmological models can be considered during the pre-BBN epoch as soon as the

creation and sharing. Now Researchers have growing interest in text mining
methods for discovering knowledge. Text mining researchers come from variety of
areas like: Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistic, Machine
Learning, and Statistics. A typical text mining application involves
preprocessing of text, stemming and lemmatization, tagging and annotation,
deriving knowledge patterns, evaluating and interpreting the results. There are
numerous approaches for performing text mining tasks, like: clustering,
categorization, sentimental analysis, and summarization. There is a growing
need to standardize the evaluation of these tasks. One major component of
establishing standardization is to provide standard datasets for these tasks.
Although there are various standard datasets available for traditional text
mining tasks, but there are very few and expensive datasets for blog-mining
task. Blogs, a new genre in web 2.0 is a digital diary of web user, which has
chronological entries and contains a lot of useful knowledge, thus offers a lot
of challenges and opportunities for text mining. In this paper, we report a new
indigenous dataset for Pakistani Political Blogosphere. The paper describes the
process of data collection, organization, and standardization. We have used
this dataset for carrying out various text mining tasks for blogosphere, like:
blog-search, political sentiments analysis and tracking, identification of
influential blogger, and clustering of the blog-posts. We wish to offer this
dataset free for others who aspire to pursue further in this domain.

exploited as a side channel through which protected information leaks to an
off-path attacker. The attacker sends to a victim a sequence of identical
spoofed segments. The victim responds to each segment in the sequence (the
sequence is reflected by the victim) if the segments satisfy a certain
condition tested by the attacker. The responses do not reach the attacker
directly, but induce extra load on a routing queue shared between the victim
and the attacker. Increased processing time of packets traversing the queue
reveal that the tested condition was true. The paper concentrates on the TCP,
but the approach is generic and can be effective against other protocols that
allow to construct requests which are conditionally answered by the victim. A
proof of concept was created to assess applicability of the method in real-life
scenarios.

reported 22 GHz H2O maser emission and luminosity distance D > 0.5 Mpc are
studied. For the total of 55 targets for which both 6 cm and 20 cm measurements
exist and for the subsample of 42 sources with masers related to active
galactic nuclei (AGN), a spectral index could be determined from an assumed
power-law dependence. The mean value of the resulting spectral index is in both
cases 0.66+-0.07. Comparing radio properties of the maser galaxies with a
sample of Seyferts without detected H2O maser, we find that (1) the spectral
indices agree within the error limits, and (2) maser host galaxies have higher
nuclear radio continuum luminosities, exceeding those of the comparison sample
by factors of order 5. Only considering the subsample of galaxies with masers
associated with AGN, there seems to be a trend toward rising maser luminosity
with nuclear radio luminosity (both at 6 cm and 20 cm). However, when
accounting for the Malmquist effect, the correlation weakens to a level, which
is barely significant. Overall, the study indicates that nuclear radio
luminosity is a suitable indicator to guide future AGN maser searches and to
enhance detection rates, which are otherwise quite low (<10%).

non-transiting planets through their gravitational perturbations. Since TTVs
are strongly enhanced in systems close to mean-motion resonances (MMR), even a
low mass planet can produce an observable signal. This technique has thus been
proposed to detect terrestrial planets. In this letter, we analyse TTV signals
for systems in or close to MMR in order to illustrate the difficulties arising
in the determination of planetary parameters. TTVs are computed numerically
with an n-body integrator for a variety of systems close to MMR. The main
features of these TTVs are also derived analytically. Systems deeply inside MMR
do not produce particularly strong TTVs, while those close to MMR generate
quasiperiodic TTVs characterised by a dominant long period term and a low
amplitude remainder. If the remainder is too weak to be detected, then the
signal is strongly degenerate and this prevents the determination of the
planetary parameters. Even though an Earth mass planet can be detected by the
TTV method if it is close to a MMR, it may not be possible to assert that this
planet is actually an Earth mass planet. On the other hand, if the system is
right in the center of a MMR, the high amplitude oscillation of the TTV signal
vanishes and the detection of the perturber becomes as difficult as it is far
from MMR.

simulations there are, fundamentally, two choices: either maximizing the
correspondence of the initial density field to the assumed fourier-space
clustering or, instead, matching to real-space statistics and allowing the DC
mode (i.e. overdensity) to vary from box to box as it would in the real
universe. As a stringent test of both approaches, I perform ensembles of
simulations using power law and a ""powerlaw times a bump"" model inspired by
baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), exploiting the self-similarity of these
initial conditions to quantify the accuracy of the matter-matter two-point
correlation results. The real-space method, which was originally proposed by
Pen 1997 and implemented by Sirko 2005, performed well in producing the
expected self-similar behavior and corroborated the non-linear evolution of the
BAO feature observed in conventional simulations, even in the
strongly-clustered regime (sigma8 >= 1). In revisiting the real-space method
championed by Sirko 2005, it was also noticed that this earlier study
overlooked an important integral constraint correction to the correlation
function in results from the conventional approach that can be important in
LambdaCDM simulations with Lbox =< 1 Gpc/h and on scales r >= Lbox / 10.
Rectifying this shows that the fourier space and real space methods are about
equally accurate and efficient for modeling the evolution and growth of the
correlation function, contrary to previous claims. An appendix provides a
useful independent-of-epoch analytic formula for estimating the importance of
the integral constraint bias on correlation function measurements in LambdaCDM
simulations.

multiwavelength spectra observed from these sources. A less studied property of
such systems is that they can exhibit a variety of temporal behaviours due to
the operation of different feedback mechanisms. We investigate the effects of
one possible feedback loop, where \gamma-rays produced by photopion processes
are being quenched whenever their compactness increases above a critical level.
This causes a spontaneous creation of soft photons in the system that result in
further proton cooling and more production of \gamma-rays, thus making the loop
operate. We perform an analytical study of a simplified set of equations
describing the system, in order to investigate the connection of its temporal
behaviour with key physical parameters. We also perform numerical integration
of the full set of kinetic equations verifying not only our analytical results
but also those of previous numerical studies. We find that once the system
becomes `supercritical', it can exhibit either a periodic behaviour or a damped
oscillatory one leading to a steady state. We briefly point out possible
implications of such a supercriticality on the parameter values used in Active
Galactic Nuclei spectral modelling, through an indicative fitting of the VHE

Of such challenges, evolved user demands on personalized applications.
Telecommunications industry as well as research community have paid enormous
attention to Next Generation Networks (NGN) to address this challenge. NGN is
perceived as a sophisticated platform where both application developers and
mobile operators cooperate to develop user applications with enhanced quality
of experience. The objective of this paper is twofold: first we present an
introduction to state-of-the-art NGN testbed to be developed at KAU, and second
we provide initial analysis for deploying a mobile application on top of the
testbed.
