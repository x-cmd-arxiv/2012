Our goal in this paper is to study the invisible Cost of Drunkenness (iCOD),
which is defined as the ratio ct_i(G)/dct_i(G), with ct_i(G) and dct_i(G) being
the expected capture times in the adversarial and drunk CiR variants,

arbitrarily close to any value in [2,infinty). Finally, we briefly examine one

the hadronic phase of QCD governed by confinement and spontaneously broken
chiral symmetry, in-medium chiral effective field theory is the appropriate
framework, with pions and nucleons as active degrees of freedom. Nuclear chiral
thermodynamics is outlined and the liquid-gas phase transition is described.
The density and temperature dependence of the chiral condensate is deduced. As
a consequence of two- and three-body correlations in the nuclear medium, no
tendency towards a first-order chiral phase transition is found at least up to
twice the baryon density of normal nuclear matter and up to temperatures of
about 100 MeV. Isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter are also
discussed. An outlook is given on new tightened constraints for the
equation-of-state of cold and highly compressed matter as implied by a recently
observed two-solar-mass neutron star.

at first glance there is an apparent dilemma posed by these data: high Tc

indicates that the sample may well consist of two phases with the minority
superconducting phase (that does not exhibit magnetic order) being finely

the possibility to devise hybrid imaging techniques that combine the high
electrical or optical contrast observed in many settings of interest with the
high resolution of ultrasound. Mathematically, these modalities require that we
reconstruct a diffusion coefficient $\sigma(x)$ for $x\in X$, a bounded domain
in $\Rm^n$, from knowledge of $\sigma(x)|\nabla u|^2(x)$ for $x\in X$, where
$u$ is the solution to the elliptic equation $-\nabla\cdot\sigma\nabla u=0$ in
$X$ with $u=f$ on $\partial X$.
  This inverse problem may be recast as a nonlinear equation, which formally
takes the form of a 0-Laplacian. Whereas $p-$Laplacians with $p>1$ are
well-studied variational elliptic non-linear equations, $p=1$ is a limiting
case with a convex but not strictly convex functional, and the case $p<1$
admits a variational formulation with a functional that is not convex. In this
paper, we augment the equation for the 0-Laplacian with full Cauchy data at the
domain's boundary, which results in a, formally overdetermined, nonlinear
hyperbolic equation.
  The paper presents existence, uniqueness, and stability results for the
Cauchy problem of the 0-Laplacian. In general, the diffusion coefficient
$\sigma(x)$ can be stably reconstructed only on a subset of $X$ described as
the domain of influence of the space-like part of the boundary $\partial X$ for
an appropriate Lorentzian metric. Global reconstructions for specific
geometries or based on the construction of appropriate complex geometric optics

(localized) surface plasmon resonance, the electron cloud makes the transition
between in- and out-of-phase oscillation with respect to the incident wave.
Here we show that this information can experimentally be extracted by
performing phase-sensitive measurements, which result in linewidths that are
almost one order of magnitude smaller than those for intensity based
measurements. As this phase transition is an intrinsic property of a plasmon
resonance, this opens up many possibilities for boosting the figure of merit
(FOM) of refractive index sensing by taking into account the phase of the
plasmon resonance. We experimentally investigated this for two model systems:
randomly distributed gold nanodisks and gold nanorings on top of a continuous
gold layer and a dielectric spacer and observed FOM values up to 8.3 and 16.5
for the respective nanoparticles.

  Verification and Synthesis",,,,,"cs.LO cs.AI cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Even with impressive advances in automated formal methods, certain problems
in system verification and synthesis remain challenging. Examples include the
verification of quantitative properties of software involving constraints on
timing and energy consumption, and the automatic synthesis of systems from
specifications. The major challenges include environment modeling,
incompleteness in specifications, and the complexity of underlying decision
problems.
  This position paper proposes sciduction, an approach to tackle these
challenges by integrating inductive inference, deductive reasoning, and
structure hypotheses. Deductive reasoning, which leads from general rules or
concepts to conclusions about specific problem instances, includes techniques
such as logical inference and constraint solving. Inductive inference, which
generalizes from specific instances to yield a concept, includes algorithmic
learning from examples. Structure hypotheses are used to define the class of
artifacts, such as invariants or program fragments, generated during
verification or synthesis. Sciduction constrains inductive and deductive
reasoning using structure hypotheses, and actively combines inductive and
deductive reasoning: for instance, deductive techniques generate examples for
learning, and inductive reasoning is used to guide the deductive engines.
  We illustrate this approach with three applications: (i) timing analysis of
software; (ii) synthesis of loop-free programs, and (iii) controller synthesis
for hybrid systems. Some future applications are also discussed.

consists of 16 massive clusters detected with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope

spectroscopic observations were taken to secure intermediate-resolution
(R~700-800) spectra and redshifts for ~60 member galaxies on average per
cluster. The dynamical masses M_200c of the clusters have been calculated using
simulation-based scaling relations between velocity dispersion and mass. The
sample has a median redshift z=0.50 and a median mass M_200c~12e14 Msun/h70
with a lower limit M_200c~6e14 Msun/h70, consistent with the expectations for
the ACT southern sky survey. These masses are compared to the ACT SZE
properties of the sample, specifically, the match-filtered central SZE
amplitude y, the central Compton parameter y0, and the integrated Compton
signal Y_200c, which we use to derive SZE-Mass scaling relations. All SZE
estimators correlate with dynamical mass with low intrinsic scatter (<~20%), in
agreement with numerical simulations. We explore the effects of various
systematic effects on these scaling relations, including the correlation
between observables and the influence of dynamically disturbed clusters. Using
the 3-dimensional information available, we divide the sample into relaxed and
disturbed clusters and find that ~50% of the clusters are disturbed. There are
hints that disturbed systems might bias the scaling relations but given the
current sample sizes these differences are not significant; further studies
including more clusters are required to assess the impact of these clusters on
the scaling relations.

on the accurate estimation of photometric redshifts of very large samples of
galaxies. This in turn depends on both the quality of the photometric data and
the photo-z estimators. In a previous study, (Bordoloi et al. 2010) we focussed
primarily on the impact of photometric quality on photo-z estimates and on the
development of novel techniques to construct the N(z) of tomographic bins at
the high level of precision required for precision cosmology, as well as the
correction of issues such as imprecise corrections for Galactic reddening. We
used the same set of templates to generate the simulated photometry as were
then used in the photo-z code, thereby removing any effects of ""template
error"". In this work we now include the effects of ""template error"" by
generating simulated photometric data set from actual COSMOS photometry. We use
the trick of simulating redder photometry of galaxies at higher redshifts by
using a bluer set of passbands on low z galaxies with known redshifts. We find
that ""template error"" is a rather small factor in photo-z performance, at the
photometric precision and filter complement expected for all-sky surveys. With
only a small sub-set of training galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, it is
in principle possible to construct tomographic redshift bins whose mean
redshift is known, from photo-z alone, to the required accuracy of 0.002(1+z).

observations made with the GMOS instrument on the Gemini South telescope, an
additional 50 GC and Ultra Compact Dwarf (UCD) candidates have been
spectroscopically confirmed as members of the NGC 3923 system. When the
recessional velocities of these GCs are combined with the 29 GC velocities
reported previously, a total sample of 79 GC/UCD velocities is produced. This
sample extends to over 6 arcmin (>6 Re \sim30 kpc) from the centre of NGC 3923,
and is used to study the dynamics of the GC system and the dark matter content
of NGC 3923. It is found that the GC system of NGC 3923 displays no appreciable
rotation, and that the projected velocity dispersion is constant with radius
within the uncertainties. The velocity dispersion profiles of the integrated
light and GC system of NGC 3923 are indistinguishable over the region in which
they overlap. We find some evidence that the diffuse light and GCs of NGC 3923
have radially biased orbits within \sim130"". The application of axisymmetric
orbit-based models to the GC and integrated light velocity dispersion profiles
demonstrates that a significant increase in the mass-to-light ratio (from M/Lv
= 8 to 26) at large galactocentric radii is required to explain these
observations. We therefore confirm the presence of a dark matter halo in NGC
3923. We find that dark matter comprises 17.5% of the mass within 1 Re, 41.2%
within 2 Re, and 75.6% within the radius of our last kinematic tracer at 6.9

solar masses. In common with other studies of large ellipticals, we find that
our derived dynamical mass profile is consistently higher than that derived by

variable system using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical model.
The model includes the stellar corona, the stellar wind, and the WD mass and
magnetic field. The existence of the WD modifies the system spin-down by
physically blocking the stellar wind, restructuring the wind, channeling the
wind towards the WD surface, and by modifying the shape and size of the
Alfv\'en surface. The combination of these processes differs among a set of
simple test cases, and the resulting angular momentum loss rates vary by
factors of 2-3, and by factors of two relative to a test model with a single M
dwarf. While the model employs some simplifications, the results suggest
angular momentum loss schemes currently employed in cataclysmic variable
studies do not require drastic revision. Insights are also gained on wind
accretion. We find that efficient accretion switches on quite rapidly with
decreasing orbital separation. Accretion rates depend on magnetic field
alignment and should be modulated by magnetic cycles on the M dwarf. For
particular values of white dwarf magnetic field strength, an efficient
syphoning of coronal plasma from the inward facing M dwarf hemisphere occurs.
Wind accretion rates are expected to vary by factors of 10 or more between
fairly similar close binaries, depending on magnetic field strengths and
orbital separation.

The observations resolve the inner gap in the dust emission and reveal an
asymmetric dust distribution in the outer disk. (Abridge) We calculate that 90%
of the dust emission arises from an azimuthally symmetric ring that contains
about 5x10^{-4} M_sun of dust. A low surface-brightness tail that extends to
the northwest out to a radius of about 300 AU contains the remaining 10% of the
observed continuum emission. The ring is modeled with a rather flat surface
density profile between 40 and 120 AU, while the inner cavity is consistent
with either a sharp drop of the 1.3 mm dust optical depth at about 42 AU or a
smooth inward decrease between 3 and 85 AU. (Abridge). Within 40 AU, the
observations constrain the amount of dust between 10^{-6} and 7 Earth masses,
where the minimum and maximum limits are set by the near-IR SED modeling and by
the mm-wave observations of the dust emission respectively. In addition, we
confirm the discrepancy in the outer disk radius inferred from the dust and
gas, which corresponds to 150 AU and 900 AU respectively. We cannot reconcile
this difference by adopting an exponentially tapered surface density profile as
suggested for other systems, but we instead suggest that the gas surface
density in the outer disk decreases less steeply than that predicted by model
fits to the dust continuum emission. The lack of continuum emission at radii
lager than 120 AU suggests a drop of at least a factor of 5 in the dust-to-gas
ratio, or in the dust opacity. We show that a sharp dust opacity drop of this
magnitude is consistent with a radial variation of the grain size distribution

planets. MOA-2011-BLG-293Lb is the first planet to be published from the new

robustly detected in survey+followup data (Delta chi^2 ~ 5400). The planet/host
mass ratio is q=5.3+/- 0.2*10^{-3}. The best fit projected separation is
s=0.548+/- 0.005 Einstein radii. However, due to the s-->s^{-1} degeneracy,
projected separations of s^{-1} are only marginally disfavored at Delta
chi^2=3. A Bayesian estimate of the host mass gives M_L = 0.43^{+0.27}_{-0.17}
M_Sun, with a sharp upper limit of M_L < 1.2 M_Sun from upper limits on the

characterize the planet, but the Delta chi^2 is much smaller (Delta chi^2~500)

smaller than for any other securely detected planet. This event suggests a

by known Fermi sources or by the galactic and extragalactic backgrounds. If
interpreted as annihilation emission from supersymmetric dark matter (DM)
particles, the data prefer models with a particle mass in the range 20-60 GeV
annihilating into the b-bbar channel, or 2-10 GeV and >1 TeV annihilating into
mu-mu final states. Our results are consistent with those obtained by Hooper
and Linden from a recent analysis of Fermi-LAT data in the region of the
Galactic Centre. An extended DM annihilation profile dominated by emission from
substructures is preferred over a simple point source model. The significance
of DM detection is 4.4 sigma in Virgo and lower in the other two clusters. We
also consider the possibility that the excess emission arises from cosmic ray
(CR) induced gamma-rays, and infer a CR level within a factor of three of that
expected from analytical models. However, the significance of a CR component is
lower than the significance of a DM component, and there is no need for such a
CR component in the presence of a DM component in the preferred DM mass range.

of hierarchical structure formation. Given the factor 3-10 increase in the
number density of groups and clusters with M*>10^12 Msun since z=1 and the
strong anticorrelation between star formation activity and environmental

physics, but it can only be observed on the CMB after it has been
gravitationally lensed. We give a new simple non-perturbative prescription for
accurately calculating the effect of lensing on any squeezed primordial
bispectrum shape, and test it with simulations. We give the generalization to
polarization bispectra, and discuss the effect of lensing on the trispectrum.
We explain why neglecting the lensing smoothing effect does not significantly
bias estimators of local primordial non-Gaussianity, even though the change in
shape can be >~10%. We also show how tau_NL trispectrum estimators can be well
approximated by much simpler CMB temperature modulation estimators, and hence
that there is potentially a ~10-30% bias due to very large-scale lensing modes,
depending on the range of modulation scales included. Including dipole sky
modulations can halve the tau_NL error bar if kinematic effects can be
subtracted using known properties of the CMB temperature dipole. Lensing
effects on the g_NL trispectrum are small compared to the error bar. In
appendices we give the general result for lensing of any primordial bispectrum,

the galaxy's physical properties, and multi-wavelength observations are needed
in order to measure these properties via SED fitting. In planning these
surveys, optimization of the resources is essential. The Fisher Matrix
formalism can be used to quickly determine the best possible experimental setup
to achieve the desired constraints on the SED fitting parameters. However,
because it relies on the assumption of a Gaussian likelihood function, it is in
general less accurate than other slower techniques that reconstruct the
probability distribution function (PDF) from the direct comparison between
models and data. We compare the uncertainties on SED fitting parameters
predicted by the Fisher Matrix to the ones obtained using the more thorough PDF
fitting techniques. We use both simulated spectra and real data, and consider a
large variety of target galaxies differing in redshift, mass, age, star
formation history, dust content, and wavelength coverage. We find that the
uncertainties reported by the two methods agree within a factor of two in the
vast majority (~ 90%) of cases. If the age determination is uncertain, the
top-hat prior in age used in PDF fitting to prevent each galaxy from being
older than the Universe needs to be incorporated in the Fisher Matrix, at least
approximately, before the two methods can be properly compared. We conclude
that the Fisher Matrix is a useful tool for astronomical survey design.

that the marker galaxies and their neighbors are located at the same redshift,

NGC 1097 and NGC 4559, obtained with the PACS spectrometer onboard {\it

the total emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We confirm at
small scales in these galaxies that the canonical measure of photoelectric
heating efficiency, ([C \ii] + [O \one])/TIR, decreases as the far-infrared

the ratio of far-infrared (far-IR) cooling to total PAH emission, ([C \ii] + [O

We derived representative values of the local UV radiation density, $G_0$, and
the gas density, $n_H$, by comparing our observations to models of
photodissociation regions. The ratio $G_0/n_H$, derived from fine-structure
lines, is found to correlate with the mean dust-weighted starlight intensity,
$<U>$ derived from models of the IR SED. Emission from regions that exhibit a
line deficit is characterized by an intense radiation field, indicating that
small grains are susceptible to ionization effects. We note that there is a
shift in the 7.7 / 11.3 $\mu$m PAH ratio in regions that exhibit a deficit in
([C \ii] + [O \one])/PAH, suggesting that small grains are ionized in these

mixed with a gas flow from the disk outside the bulge, a metal-rich component

a too-narrow slit on one night -- which observers could avoid in the future --

UV absorption troughs from a variety of sources in Mrk 509, including the
outflow from the active nucleus, the ISM and halo of the host galaxy, and
infalling clouds or stripped gas from a merger that are illuminated by the AGN.
The UV absorption only partially covers the emission from the AGN nucleus with
covering fractions lower than those previously seen with STIS, and are
comparable to those seen with FUSE. Given the larger apertures of COS and FUSE
compared to STIS, we favor scattered light from an extended region near the AGN
as the explanation for the partial covering. As observed in prior X-ray and UV
spectra, the UV absorption has velocities comparable to the X-ray absorption,
but the bulk of the ultraviolet absorption is in a lower ionization state with
lower total column density than the gas responsible for the X-ray absorption.
Variability compared to prior UV spectra lets us set limits on the location,
density, mass flux, and kinetic energy of the outflowing gas. For component 1
at $-400 \rm km s^{-1}$, the kinetic energy flux of both the UV and the X-ray
outflow is insufficient to have a significant impact on further evolution of

the bacteria to double in faster times than the time required to copy the
genome. The precise timing of initiation of DNA replication is determined by a
regulatory circuit that depends on the binding of a critical number of
ATP-bound DnaA proteins at the origin of replication. The synthesis of DnaA in
the cell is controlled by a growth-rate dependent, negatively autoregulated
gene found near the origin of replication. Both the regulatory and initiation
activity of DnaA depend on its nucleotide bound state and its availability.
  Results: In order to investigate the contributions of the different
regulatory processes to the timing of initiation of DNA replication at varying
growth rates, we formulate a minimal quantitative model of the initiator
circuit that includes the key ingredients known to regulate the activity of the
DnaA protein. This model describes the average-cell oscillations in
DnaA-ATP/DNA during the cell cycle, for varying growth rates. We evaluate the
conditions under which this ratio attains the same threshold value at the time
of initiation, independently of the growth rate.
  Conclusions: We find that a quantitative description of replication
initiation by DnaA must rely on the dependency of the basic parameters on
growth rate, in order to account for the timing of initiation of DNA
replication at different cell doubling times. We isolate two main possible
scenarios for this. One possibility is that the basal rate of regulatory
inactivation by ATP hydrolysis must vary with growth rate. Alternatively, some
parameters defining promoter activity need to be a function of the growth rate.
In either case, the basal rate of gene expression needs to increase with the
growth rate, in accordance with the known characteristics of the dnaA promoter.

rich globular cluster (GC) system exhibit clear bimodality, at least for
magnitudes $I_814 > 21.5$. The optical-IR I-H color distribution appears
unimodal, and this impression is confirmed by mixture modeling analysis. The
V-H colors show marginal evidence for bimodality, consistent with bimodality in
V-I and unimodality in I-H. If bimodality is imposed for I-H with a double
Gaussian model, the preferred blue/red split differs from that for optical
colors; these ""differing bimodalities"" mean that the optical and optical-IR
colors cannot both be linearly proportional to metallicity. Consistent with the
differing color distributions, the dependence of I-H on g-I for the matched GC
sample is significantly nonlinear, with an inflection point near the trough in
the g-I color distribution; the result is similar for the I-H dependence on g-z
colors taken from the ACS Fornax Cluster Survey. These g-z colors have been
calibrated empirically against metallicity; applying this calibration yields a
continuous, skewed, but single-peaked metallicity distribution. Taken together,
these results indicate that nonlinear color-metallicity relations play an
important role in shaping the observed bimodal distributions of optical colors
in extragalactic GC systems.

population synthesis calculations.
  Aims. Our goal in this paper is to systematically study the effects of
important disk properties, namely disk metallicity, mass and lifetime on
fundamental planetary properties.
  Methods. For a large number of protoplanetary disks we calculate a population
of planets with our core accretion formation model including planet migration
and disk evolution.
  Results. We find a large number of correlations: Regarding the planetary
initial mass function, metallicity, disk mass and disk lifetime have different
roles: For high [Fe/H], giant planets are more frequent. For high disk masses,
giant planets are more massive. For long disk lifetimes, giant planets are both
more frequent and massive. At low metallicities, very massive giant planets
cannot form, but otherwise giant planet mass and metallicity are uncorrelated.
In contrast, planet masses and disk gas masses are correlated. The sweet spot
for giant planet formation is at 5 AU. In- and outside this distance, higher
planetesimals surface densities are necessary. Low metallicities can be
compensated by high disk masses, and vice versa, but not ad infinitum. At low
metallicities, giant planets only form outside the ice line, while at high
metallicities, giant planet formation occurs throughout the disk. The extent of
migration increases with disk mass and lifetime and usually decreases with
metallicity. No clear correlation of metallicity and the semimajor axis of
giant planets exists because in low [Fe/H] disks, planets start further out,
but migrate more, whereas for high [Fe/H] they start further in, but migrate
less. Close-in low mass planets have a lower mean metallicity than Hot
Jupiters.
  Conclusions. The properties of protoplanetary disks are decisive for the
properties of planets, and leave many imprints.

quantum field theory. This paper explores the idea that quantum mechanics and
in particular unitarity are fundamental principles, but at the price of
familiar locality. Thus, one should seek to parameterize unitary evolution,
extending the field theory description of black holes, such that their quantum
information is transferred to the external state. This discussion is set in a
broader framework of unitary evolution acting on Hilbert spaces comprising
subsystems. Here, various constraints can be placed on the dynamics, based on
quantum information-theoretic and other general physical considerations, and
one can seek to describe dynamics with ""minimal"" departure from field theory.
While usual spacetime locality may not be a precise concept in quantum gravity,
approximate locality seems an important ingredient in physics. In such a
Hilbert space approach an apparently ""coarser"" form of localization can be
described in terms of tensor decompositions of the Hilbert space of the
complete system. This suggests a general framework in which to seek a
consistent description of quantum gravity, and approximate emergence of
spacetime. Other possible aspects of such a framework -- in particular
symmetries -- are briefly discussed.

determined by their masses and by the gravitational potential of their host
galaxy. To explore the relationship between observed and expected radii, we
utilize the globular cluster population of the Virgo giant M87. Unusually deep,
high signal-to-noise images of M87 are used to measure the effective and
limiting radii of approximately 2000 globular clusters. To compare with these
observations, we simulate a globular cluster population that has the same
characteristics as the observed M87 cluster population. Placing these simulated
clusters in the well-studied tidal field of M87, the orbit of each cluster is
solved and the theoretical tidal radius of each cluster is determined. We
compare the predicted relationship between cluster size and projected
galactocentric distance to observations. We find that for an isotropic
distribution of cluster velocities, theoretical tidal radii are approximately
equal to observed limiting radii for Rgc < 10 kpc. However, the isotropic
simulation predicts a steep increase in cluster size at larger radii, which is
not observed in large galaxies beyond the Milky Way. To minimize the
discrepancy between theory and observations, we explore the effects of orbital
anisotropy on cluster sizes, and suggest a possible orbital anisotropy profile
for M87 which yields a better match between theory and observations. Finally,
we suggest future studies which will establish a stronger link between
theoretical tidal radii and observed radii.

calculation with low Mach number, such as stellar internal convection. This
approximation requires frequent global communication, because of an elliptic
partial differential equation. Frequent global communication is negative factor
for the parallel computing with a large number of CPUs.
  Aims. The main purpose of this paper is to test the validity of a method that
artificially reduces the speed of sound for the compressible fluid equations in
the context of stellar internal convection. The reduction of speed of sound
allows for larger time steps in spite of low Mach number, while the numerical
scheme remains fully explicit and the mathematical system is hyperbolic and
thus does not require frequent global communication.
  Methods. Two and three dimensional compressible hydrodynamic equations are
solved numerically. Some statistical quantities of solutions computed with
different effective Mach numbers (due to reduction of speed of sound) are
compared to test the validity of our approach.
  Results. Numerical simulations with artificially reduced speed of sound are a
valid approach as long as the effective Mach number (based on the reduced speed
of sound) remains less than 0.7.

observe no change in ferromagnetism with gate voltage, and detect
ferromagnetism in a non-conducting p-type sample, indicating that the carriers

stringent tests of stellar models and can provide accurate radii, masses and
ages for individual stars. Of particular interest are the mixed modes that
occur in subgiant solar-like stars since they can place very strong constraints
on stellar ages. Here we measure the characteristics of the mixed modes,
particularly the coupling strength, using a grid of stellar models for stars
with masses between 0.9 and 1.5 M_{\odot}. We show that the coupling strength
of the $\ell = 1$ mixed modes is predominantly a function of stellar mass and
appears to be independent of metallicity. This should allow an accurate mass
evaluation, further increasing the usefulness of mixed modes in subgiants as
asteroseismic tools.

properties and the composition of dense nuclear matter for astrophysical
applications. Bound states of light nuclei and two-nucleon scattering
correlations are considered as explicit degrees of freedom in the
thermodynamical potential. They are represented by quasiparticles with
medium-dependent properties. The model describes the correct low-density limit
given by the virial equation of state (VEoS) and reproduces RMF results around
nuclear saturation density where clusters are dissolved. A comparison between
the fugacity expansions of the VEoS and the gRMF model provides consistency
relations between the quasiparticles properties, the nucleon-nucleon scattering
phase shifts and the meson-nucleon couplings of the gRMF model at zero density.
Relativistic effects are found to be important at temperatures that are typical

with XMM-Newton, to determine its nature. We investigated the XMM-Newton data
along with new radio-continuum, near infrared and optical data. In particular,
spectral and morphological studies of the X-ray and radio data were performed.
The X-ray images obtained in different energy bands reveal two different
structures. Below 1.0 keV the X-ray emission shows the shell-like morphology of
an SNR with a diameter of ~73 pc, one of the largest known in the LMC. For its
thermal spectrum we estimate an electron temperature of (0.49 +/- 0.12)keV
assuming non-equilibrium ionisation. The X-ray images above 1.0 keV reveal a
less extended source within the SNR emission, located ~1' west of the centre of
the SNR and coincident with bright point sources detected in radio-continuum.
This hard component has an extent of 0.9' (i.e. ~13 pc at a distance of ~50
kpc) and a non-thermal spectrum. The hard source coincides in position with the
ROSAT source [HP99] 456 and shows an indication for substructure. We firmly
identify a new SNR in the LMC with a shell-like morphology and a thermal
spectrum. Assuming the SNR to be in the Sedov phase yields an age of ~23 kyr.
We explore possible associations of the hard non-thermal emitting component
with a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or background active galactic nuclei (AGN).

research on tagged networks, hypergraphs, ontologies, folksonomies and other

actuality and relevance for practical applications. In most collaborative
tagging systems the tagging by the users is completely ""flat"", while in some
cases they are allowed to define a shallow hierarchy for their own tags.
However, usually no overall hierarchical organisation of the tags is given, and
one of the interesting challenges of this area is to provide an algorithm
generating the ontology of the tags from the available data. In contrast, there
are also other type of tagged networks available for research, where the tags
are already organised into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), encapsulating the
""is a sub-category of"" type of hierarchy between each other. In this paper we
study how this DAG affects the statistical distribution of tags on the nodes
marked by the tags in various real networks. We analyse the relation between
the tag-frequency and the position of the tag in the DAG in two large
sub-networks of the English Wikipedia and a protein-protein interaction
network. We also study the tag co-occurrence statistics by introducing a 2d
tag-distance distribution preserving both the difference in the levels and the
absolute distance in the DAG for the co-occurring pairs of tags. Our most
interesting finding is that the local relevance of tags in the DAG, (i.e.,
their rank or significance as characterised by, e.g., the length of the
branches starting from them) is much more important than their global distance
from the root. Furthermore, we also introduce a simple tagging model based on
random walks on the DAG, capable of reproducing the main statistical features
of tag co-occurrence.

starburst processes in the host galaxy, or by interaction with cosmic rays. The
second model describes the high-energy spectrum by two independent components:
a thermal inverse Compton process of photons in the non-beamed AGN and a
non-thermal emission of the gamma-rays. These components are represented by an
absorbed cut-off power law for the thermal component in the X-ray energy range
and a simple power law for the non-thermal component in the gamma-rays. For the
thermal process, we obtain a photon index of Gamma=1.6, a cut-off energy of Ec
~ 150 keV and a hydrogen column density of NH = 6e24 1/cm**2. The non-thermal
process has a photon index of Gamma=2.0 and a flux of F(0.1-100 GeV) = 1.4e-11
erg/cm**2/sec. The spectral energy distribution gives a total unabsorbed flux
of F(2 keV - 100 GeV) = 5e-10 erg/cm**2/sec and a luminosity of L(2 keV - 100
GeV) = 9e41 erg/sec at a distance of 3.7 Mpc. It appears more reasonable that
the gamma-ray emission is independent from the AGN and could be caused e.g. by
shock processes in the starburst regions of the host galaxy.

result types) defined originally in type systems for the lambda-calculus with
intersection types in order to obtain principal (i.e., most informative,
strongest) typings. In a type inference scenario, expansion allows postponing
choices for whether and how to use non-syntax-driven typing rules (e.g.,
intersection introduction) until enough information has been gathered to make
the right decision. Furthermore, these choices can be equivalent to inserting
uses of such typing rules at deeply nested positions in a typing derivation,
without needing to actually inspect or modify (or even have) the typing
derivation. Expansion has in recent years become simpler due to the use of
expansion variables (e.g., in System E).
  This paper extends expansion and expansion variables to systems with
forall-quantifiers. We present System Fs, an extension of System F with
expansion, and prove its main properties. This system turns type inference into

and AGN heat and enrich diffuse gas in galaxy clusters. We assess how different
implementations of these processes affect the thermal and chemical properties
of the intracluster medium (ICM), using high-quality X-ray observations of
local clusters to constrain our models. For the purposes of this study we have
resimulated a sample of 25 massive galaxy clusters extracted from the

of galaxy formation, thus guaranteeing that the source of feedback in our

supernova feedback has no effect on the entropy and metallicity structure of
the ICM, regardless of the method used to inject energy and metals into the
diffuse gas. By including AGN feedback, we are able to explain the observed
entropy and metallicity profiles of clusters, as well as the X-ray

technologies (particularly dealing with the fiber glass compositions and
luminescent ion doping, and transparent glass ceramic optical fibers), and
applications such as fiber lasers and amplifiers. We propose to present a
review of research activities on rare-earth (RE) and transition metals (TM)
doped silica-based optical fibers, aiming at understanding theier spectral
properties, and particularly some of their optical transitions that will allow
interesting and alternative applications. Silica, as opposed to alternative,
low temperature materials, is chosen for practical and economical reasons.
Selected RE and TM ions are studied both as probes of their local environment
and for their application potentials. In this chapter, we will focus on erbium
(Er) ions for the potential spectral 'tailoring' of its gain curve at 1.55
$\mu$m, thulium (Tm) as local environment probe along both near infrared
transitions around 0.8 and 1.47 $\mu$m, and chromium (Cr) for the sensitivity
of valency and spectroscopy to the glass composition and its potential as
saturable absorber in lasers. We will present some extensive studies on the
influence of the local environment on dopants: such as (but not limited to)
energy transfer mechanisms between rare-earth ions of same nature (Tm-Tm) or
different nature (Yb-Tm), effect of the local phonon energy on Tm ions emission
efficiency, broadening of Er ions emission induced by oxide nanoparticles grown
in situ during the fabrication process, etc. Knowledge of these effects is
essential for photonics applications, and many studies are under progress or
are still needed in this field. The potential of some applications which could
benefit from the basic studies on materials are also numerically studied :
0.8-$\mu$m thulium-doped fiber laser, so-called S-band (1.47 $\mu$m)
thulium-doped amplifier for telecommunications and laser applications,
sensitisation of Tm-based devices using ytterbium sensitized ions.

of a stable law of parameter $0<\alpha <2$, the appropriately trimmed CUSUM
process converges weakly to a Brownian bridge. Thus, after moderate trimming,
the classical method for detecting change points remains valid also for
populations with infinite variance. We note that according to the classical
theory, the partial sums of trimmed variables are generally not asymptotically
normal and using random centering in the test statistics is crucial in the
infinite variance case. We also show that the partial sums of truncated and

collaborative platforms with a cryptographically robust solution to classical
security issues. Namely, we focus on the secrecy and authenticity properties
while keeping a high usability. In this sense, users are forced to blindly
trust the system administrators and developers. Moreover, as far as we know,
the use of formal methodologies for the verification of security properties of
communication protocols isn't yet a common practice. We propose here a
methodology to fill this gap, i.e., to analyse both the security of the
proposed protocol and the pertinence of the underlying premises. In this
concern, we propose the definition and formal evaluation of a protocol for the
distribution of digital identities. Once distributed, these identities can be
used to verify integrity and source of information. We base our security
analysis on tools for automatic verification of security protocols widely
accepted by the scientific community, and on the principles they are based
upon. In addition, it is assumed perfect cryptographic primitives in order to
focus the analysis on the exchange of protocol messages. The main property of
our protocol is the incorporation of tickets, created using digests of chaos
based nonces (numbers used only once) and users' personal data. Combined with a
multichannel authentication scheme with some previous knowledge, these tickets
provide security during the whole protocol by univocally linking each
registering user with a single request. [..]

Lattice QCD problem of particle physics being one that has attracted the most

number of parameters from a finite number of equations, each equation being an
infinite sum of exponential functions. By introducing a latent parameter into
the QCD system, we are able to identify a pattern which tantamounts to reducing
the system to a telescopic series. A statistical model is then endowed on the
series, and inference about the unknown parameters done via a Bayesian
approach. A computationally intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
is invoked to implement the approach. The algorithm shares some parallels with
that used in the particle Kalman filter. The approach is validated against
simulated as well as data generated by a physics code pertaining to the quark
masses of protons. The value of our approach is that we are now able to answer
questions that could not be readily answered using some standard approaches in
particle physics. The structure of the Lattice QCD equations is not unique to
physics. Such architectures also appear in mathematical biology, nuclear
magnetic imaging, network analysis, ultracentrifuge, and a host of other
relaxation and time decay phenomena. Thus, the methodology of this paper should
have an appeal that transcends the Lattice QCD scenario which motivated us.

shows a gapless band structure analogous to the band structure of graphene with
charge carriers behaving like mass-less Dirac fermions, while the structurally

actual band gap would be larger than this as LDA is known to underestimate the
gap. The average Fermi velocity of the Dirac fermions in silicene was estimated
at about half the value experimentally measured in graphene. These properties
of silicene are attractive for some of the applications one envisages for

applications. As active probing of all pairwise distances is infeasible in
large-scale networks, a natural idea is to measure a few pairs and to predict
the other ones without actually measuring them. This paper formulates the
distance prediction problem as matrix completion where unknown entries of an
incomplete matrix of pairwise distances are to be predicted. The problem is
solvable because strong correlations among network distances exist and cause
the constructed distance matrix to be low rank. The new formulation circumvents
the well-known drawbacks of existing approaches based on Euclidean embedding.
  A new algorithm, so-called Decentralized Matrix Factorization by Stochastic
Gradient Descent (DMFSGD), is proposed to solve the network distance prediction
problem. By letting network nodes exchange messages with each other, the
algorithm is fully decentralized and only requires each node to collect and to
process local measurements, with neither explicit matrix constructions nor
special nodes such as landmarks and central servers. In addition, we compared
comprehensively matrix factorization and Euclidean embedding to demonstrate the
suitability of the former on network distance prediction. We further studied
the incorporation of a robust loss function and of non-negativity constraints.
Extensive experiments on various publicly-available datasets of network delays
show not only the scalability and the accuracy of our approach but also its
usability in real Internet applications.

capacity: it cannot host more bikes than its capacity. We propose a stochastic
model of an homogeneous bike-sharing system and study the effect of users
random choices on the number of problematic stations, i.e., stations that, at a
given time, have no bikes available or no available spots for bikes to be
returned to. We quantify the influence of the station capacities, and we
compute the fleet size that is optimal in terms of minimizing the proportion of
problematic stations. Even in a homogeneous city, the system exhibits a poor
performance: the minimal proportion of problematic stations is of the order of
(but not lower than) the inverse of the capacity. We show that simple
incentives, such as suggesting users to return to the least loaded station
among two stations, improve the situation by an exponential factor. We also
compute the rate at which bikes have to be redistributed by trucks to insure a
given quality of service. This rate is of the order of the inverse of the
station capacity. For all cases considered, the fleet size that corresponds to
the best performance is half of the total number of spots plus a few more, the

solutions in which groups of monomers are mapped onto a single atom (a blob)
and effective blob-blob interactions are obtained by requiring the
coarse-grained model to reproduce some coarse-grained features of the
zero-density isolated-chain structure. By tuning the level of coarse graining,
i.e. the number of monomers to be mapped onto a single blob, the model should
be adequate to explore the semidilute regime above the collapse transition,
since in this case the monomer density is very small if chains are long enough.
The implementation of these ideas has been previously based on a
transferability hypothesis, which was not completely tested against
full-monomer results (Pierleoni et al., J. Chem. Phys, 127, 171102 (2007)). We
study different models proposed in the past and we compare their predictions to
full-monomer results for the chain structure and the thermodynamics in the
range of polymer volume fractions \Phi between 0 and 8. We find that the
transferability assumption has a limited predictive power if a
thermodynamically consistent model is required. We introduce a new tetramer
model parametrized in such a way to reproduce not only zero-density
intramolecular and intermolecular two-body probabilities, but also some
intramolecular three-body and four-body distributions. We find that such a
model correctly predicts three-chain effects, the structure and the
thermodynamics up to \Phi ~ 2, a range considerably larger than that obtained
with previous simpler models using zero-density potentials. Our results show
the correctness of the ideas behind the multiblob approach but also that more
work is needed to understand how to develop models with more effective monomers
which would allow us to explore the semidilute regime at larger chain volume
fractions.

  syst\`emes de Garnier","22 pages",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we classify all (complete) non elementary algebraic solutions
of Garnier systems that can be constructed by Kitaev's method: they are deduced
from isomonodromic deformations defined by pulling back a given fuchsian
equation E by a family of ramified covers. We first introduce orbifold
structures associated to a fuchsian equation. This allow to get a refined
version of Riemann-Hurwitz formula and then to promtly deduce that E is
hypergeometric. Then, we can bound exponents and degree of the pull-back maps
and further list all possible ramification cases. This generalizes a result due
to C. Doran for the Painleve VI case. We explicitely construct one of these
solutions.

  experiment in classical physics of spacetimes with time machines","18 pages, 5 figures",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is theoretically revealed that, in classical physics of spacetimes with
wormholes, there are analogs of wave function reduction events, quantum
entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) experiment. Within the suggested
approach, wormholes are specified by a typical microscopic radius of their
mouths, and this causes the size effect in operation of wormhole-based time
machines (closed timelike curves; CTCs). For geometric reasons, classical solid
balls in a spacetime with a wormhole are divided into the two categories: small
and large balls whose traverse through wormholes is permitted and forbidden,
respectively. Evolutions of small balls on CTCs can be self-inconsistent (or,
in other terms, inconsistent with conventional causality), in which case there
is an uncertainty in their behaviors. In contrast, evolutions of large solid
balls are always unambiguous. In the situation where small balls can be
absorbed by large balls, uncertain behaviors of small balls transform into
unambiguous evolutions of large balls in the logical way analogous to that of a
quantum measurement - wave function reduction - event. Also, within the
suggested approach operating with classical balls in spacetimes with wormholes,
analogs of quantum entanglement and EPR experiment are defined and
theoretically described.

equation is obtained for them. For the two kinds of eigenvalues in the
differential and corresponding integral equations, the relation between them
are given explicitly. Though there are already some integral equations for the
spheroidal equations, the relation between their two kinds of eigenvalues is
not known till now. This is the great advantage of our integral equation, which
will provide useful information through the study of the integral equation.
Also an example is given for the special case, which shows another way to study
the eigenvalue problem.

the possibility of the experimental study of a probability which is beyond
