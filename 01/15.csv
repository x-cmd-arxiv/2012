Based on its orbital elements, it is considered that the asteroid belongs to
the Flora collisional family, where S-type asteroids are common, whilst showing
a comet-like dust tail. Although analysis of images taken by the Hubble Space
Telescope and Rosetta spacecraft suggested that the dust tail resulted from a
recent head-on collision between asteroids (Jewitt et al. 2010; Snodgrass et
al. 2010), an alternative idea of ice sublimation was suggested based on the
morphological fitting of ground-based images (Moreno et al. 2010). Here, we
report a multiband observation of P/2010 A2 made on January 2010 with a 105 cm
telescope at the Ishigakijima Astronomical Observatory. Three broadband
filters, $g'$, $R_c$, and $I_c$, were employed for the observation. The unique
multiband data reveals that the reflectance spectrum of the P/2010 A2 dust tail
resembles that of an Sq-type asteroid or that of ordinary chondrites rather
than that of an S-type asteroid. Due to the large error of the measurement, the
reflectance spectrum also resembles the spectra of C-type asteroids, even
though C-type asteroids are uncommon in the Flora family. The reflectances
relative to the $g'$-band (470 nm) are 1.096$\pm$0.046 at the $R_c$-band (650
nm) and 1.131$\pm$0.061 at the $I_c$-band (800 nm). We hypothesize that the
parent body of P/2010 A2 was originally S-type but was then shattered upon
collision into scaterring fresh chondritic particles from the interior, thus
forming the dust tail.

the easy-magnetization axis (c-axis) is relatively small in value. However, the
initial slope of Hc2, namely dHc2/dT (H -> 0) both in UCoGe and in URhGe

problems, and model the interaction between the users and the relay as a
two-level Stackelberg game. In this game, the relay, modeled as the service
provider and the leader of the game, sets the relay price to maximize its
revenue; while the users are modeled as customers and the followers who buy
power from the relay for higher transmission rates. We use a bargaining game to
model the negotiation among users to achieve a fair allocation of the relay
power. Based on the proposed fair relay power allocation rule, the optimal
relay power price that maximizes the relay revenue is derived analytically.
Simulation shows that the proposed power allocation scheme achieves higher
network sum-rate and relay revenue than the even power allocation. Furthermore,
compared with the sum-rate-optimal solution, simulation shows that the proposed
scheme achieves better fairness with comparable network sum-rate for a wide
range of network scenarios. The proposed pricing and power allocation solutions

properties of dense cores of interstellar clouds and their evolution to star
formation. The chemistry and the dust properties are temperature dependent and
the interpretation of observation requires the knowledge of the temperature and
its variations. Measurement of the gas kinetic temperature is possible with
molecular line spectroscopy, the ammonia molecule, NH3, being the most commonly
used tracer. We want to determine the accuracy of the temperature estimates
derived from ammonia spectra. The normal interpretation of NH3 observations
assumes that all the hyperfine line components are tracing the same gas volume.
In the case of temperature gradients they may be sensitive to different layers
and cause errors in the optical depth and gas temperature estimates. We examine
a series of spherical cloud models, 1.0 and 0.5 M_Sun Bonnor-Ebert spheres,
with different radial temperature profiles. We calculate synthetic NH3 spectra
and compare the derived column densities and temperatures to the true values.
For high signal-to-noise observations, the estimated gas kinetic temperatures
are within ~0.3 K of the real mass averaged temperature and the column
densities are correct to within ~10%. When the S/N ratio of the (2,2) spectrum
decreases below 10, the temperature errors are of the order of 1K but without a
significant bias. When the density of the models is increased by a factor of a
few, the results begin to show significant bias because of the saturation of
the (1,1) main group. The ammonia spectra are found to be a reliable tracer of
the mass averaged gas temperature. Because the radial temperature profiles of
the cores are not well constrained, the central temperature could still differ
from this value. If the cores are optically very thick, there are no guarantees
of the accuracy.

low-mobility samples with the electron mean free path being smaller than the

in wireless networks under an adversarial model. This protocol has received a
significant amount of attention dating back to the papers of Tassiulas and
Ephremides. In particular, this protocol is known to be throughput-optimal
whenever the traffic patterns and propagation conditions are governed by a
stationary stochastic process.
  However, the standard proof of throughput optimality (which is based on the
negative drift of a quadratic potential function) does not hold when the
traffic patterns and the edge capacity changes over time are governed by an
arbitrary adversarial process. Such an environment appears frequently in many
practical wireless scenarios when the assumption that channel conditions are
governed by a stationary stochastic process does not readily apply.
  In this paper we prove that even in the above adversarial setting, the
Max-Weight protocol keeps the queues in the network stable (i.e. keeps the
queue sizes bounded) whenever this is feasible by some routing and scheduling
algorithm. However, the proof is somewhat more complex than the negative
potential drift argument that applied in the stationary case. Our proof holds
for any arbitrary interference relationships among edges. We also prove the
stability of $\ep$-approximate Max-Weight under the adversarial model. We
conclude the paper with a discussion of queue sizes in the adversarial model as

originally devised for tracking the real-time dynamics of quantum-impurity
systems following a single quantum quench, is extended to multiple switching
events. This generalization of the TD-NRG encompasses the possibility of
periodic switching, allowing for coherent control of strongly correlated
systems by an external time-dependent field. To this end, we have embedded the
TD-NRG in a hybrid framework that combines the outstanding capabilities of the
numerical renormalization group to systematically construct the effective
low-energy Hamiltonian of the system with the prowess of complementary
approaches for calculating the real-time dynamics derived from this
Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the power of our approach by hybridizing the TD-NRG
with the Chebyshev expansion technique in order to investigate periodic
switching in the interacting resonant-level model. Although the interacting
model shares the same low-energy fixed point as its noninteracting counterpart,
we surprisingly find the gradual emergence of damped oscillations as the
interaction strength is increased. Focusing on a single quantum quench and
using a strong-coupling analysis, we reveal the origin of these
interaction-induced oscillations and provide an analytical estimate for their
frequency. The latter agrees well with the numerical results.

identified with HST/ACS camera in the region. We show that apart from the
central cluster, low-mass PMS stars are congregated in thirteen additional
small compact sub-clusters at the periphery of NGC602. We find that the spatial
distribution of the PMS stars is bimodal, with an unusually large fraction
(~60%) of the total population being clustered, while the remaining is
diffusely distributed in the inter-cluster area. From the corresponding
color-magnitude diagrams we disentangle an age-difference of ~2.5Myr between
NGC602 and the compact sub-clusters which appear younger. The diffuse PMS
population appears to host stars as old as those in NGC602. Almost all detected
PMS sub-clusters appear to be centrally concentrated. When the complete PMS
stellar sample, including both clustered and diffused stars, is considered in
our cluster analysis, it appears as a single centrally concentrated stellar
agglomeration, covering the whole central area of the region. Considering also
the hot massive stars of the system, we find evidence that this agglomeration
is hierarchically structured. Based on our findings we propose a scenario,
according to which the region NGC602/N90 experiences an active clustered star
formation for the last ~5Myr. The central cluster NGC602 was formed first and
rapidly started dissolving into its immediate ambient environment, possibly
ejecting also massive stars found away from its center. Star formation
continued in sub-clusters of a larger stellar agglomeration, introducing an
age-spread of the order of 2.5Myr among the PMS populations.

be regarded as large-scale social experiments, where people are grouped into

consequences for the polling results which can be used to identify election
irregularities. Using a suitable data collapse, we find that vote distributions
of elections with alleged fraud show a kurtosis of hundred times more than
normal elections on certain levels of data aggregation. As an example we show
that reported irregularities in recent Russian elections are indeed well
explained by systematic ballot stuffing and develop a parametric model
quantifying to which extent fraudulent mechanisms are present. We show that if
specific statistical properties are present in an election, the results do not
represent the will of the people. We formulate a parametric test detecting

produces similar outcomes irrespective of the data resolution and thus allows

efficient because error rates will be high when the channel conditions are
poor. However, perfect CSI at the users is an unrealistic assumption in the
wireless scenario, as it would involve massive feedback overheads. In this
paper we propose a scheme which uses only quantized knowledge of CSI at the
transmitters with the overhead being nominal. The users rotate their
constellation without varying their transmit power to adapt to the existing
channel conditions, in order to meet certain pre-determined minimum Euclidean
distance requirement in the equivalent constellation at the destination. The
optimal modulation scheme has been described for the case when both the users
use symmetric M-PSK constellations at the input, where $ M=2^\lambda $, $
\lambda $ being a positive integer. The strategy has been illustrated by
considering examples where both users use QPSK or 8-PSK signal sets at the
input. It is shown that the proposed scheme has better throughput and error
performance compared to the conventional non-adaptive scheme, at the cost of a
feedback overhead of just $\lceil \log_2(\frac{M^2}{8}-\frac{M}{4}+2)\rceil + 1

noise simultaneously converges to 0 at a sufficiently fast rate, then the
solutions converge to those of the deterministic equation. At the critical
rate, the limiting solution is still deterministic, but it exhibits an
additional damping term.

  Model of Urban Crime",,,,,"nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The existence and stability of localized patterns of criminal activity are
studied for the reaction-diffusion model of urban crime that was introduced by
Short et. al. [Math. Models. Meth. Appl. Sci., 18, Suppl. (2008), pp.
1249--1267]. Such patterns, characterized by the concentration of criminal
activity in localized spatial regions, are referred to as hot-spot patterns and
they occur in a parameter regime far from the Turing point associated with the
bifurcation of spatially uniform solutions. Singular perturbation techniques
are used to construct steady-state hot-spot patterns in one and two-dimensional
spatial domains, and new types of nonlocal eigenvalue problems are derived that
determine the stability of these hot-spot patterns to ${\mathcal O}(1)$
time-scale instabilities. From an analysis of these nonlocal eigenvalue
problems, a critical threshold $K_c$ is determined such that a pattern
consisting of $K$ hot-spots is unstable to a competition instability if
$K>K_c$. This instability, due to a positive real eigenvalue, triggers the
collapse of some of the hot-spots in the pattern. Furthermore, in contrast to
the well-known stability results for spike patterns of the Gierer-Meinhardt
reaction-diffusion model, it is shown for the crime model that there is only a
relatively narrow parameter range where oscillatory instabilities in the
hot-spot amplitudes occur. Such an instability, due to a Hopf bifurcation, is
studied explicitly for a single hot-spot in the shadow system limit, for which
the diffusivity of criminals is asymptotically large. Finally, the parameter
regime where localized hot-spots occur is compared with the parameter regime,
studied in previous works, where Turing instabilities from a spatially uniform
steady-state occur.

problems on graphs. Yet, to properly utilize parameterized algorithms it is
necessary to choose the right parameter based on the type of problem and
properties of the target graph class. Tree-width is an example of a very
successful graph parameter, however it cannot be used on dense graph classes
and there also exist problems which are hard even on graphs of bounded
tree-width. Such problems can be tackled by using vertex cover as a parameter,
however this places severe restrictions on admissible graph classes.
  Michael Lampis has recently introduced neighborhood diversity, a new graph
parameter which generalizes vertex cover to dense graphs. Among other results,
he has shown that simple parameterized algorithms exist for a few problems on
graphs of bounded neighborhood diversity. Our article further studies this area
and provides new algorithms parameterized by neighborhood diversity for the
p-Vertex-Disjoint Paths, Graph Motif and Precoloring Extension problems -- the
latter two being hard even on graphs of bounded tree-width.

consists of two conducting plates(thin foil) separated by copper rods and are

in front of the pendulum such that it serves to attract the pendulum plates and
makes electrical contact with them enabling charge transfer between the

prove certain universality structures about the 3-pointed genus-0 extremal
Gromov-Witten invariants of the Hilbert schemes by using the indexing

localization from [KL1, KL2, LL]. We then reduce Ruan's Conjecture from the
case of an arbitrary surface to the case of smooth projective toric surfaces
which has already been proved in [Che].

replication density, whose performance is of the same order as the original.
Assuming a Zipf popularity law, and letting the size of content and network

obtained the fractal dimension. The method is compared to other classical
fractal dimension estimation methods in the literature, e. g.,
