dispersion relation is linear. The scaling behavior of the imaginal part of the
Green function relative to $k_{\perp}=k-k_F$ is also discussed. We find,
although the system has linear dispersion relation and quadratic quasi-particle
width, it does not satisfy Luttinger's theorem. We also find that the variation
of the scaling parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is small as the charge $q$
varies. Furthermore, we also discuss the effect of the dynamical exponent $z$
by considering the cases $z=4$ and $z=6$ and show that $ImG_{ii}$ become smooth
when the dynamical exponent $z$ increases.

somewhere between the AGB and PN phase. The cause of this change of morphology

massive companion to the AGB star. Therefore, further detections of the
magnetic field around evolved stars (in particular those thought to be part of
a binary system) are crucial to improve our understanding of the origin and
role of magnetism on evolved stars. One such binaries is the pre-PN OH231.8,
around which a magnetic field was detected in the OH maser region of the outer
circumstellar envelope. We aim to detect and infer the properties of the
magnetic field of this source in the water maser region.
  We observed the 6_{1,6}-5_{2,3} water maser rotational transition to
determine its linear and circular polarization. These emissions are located
within the inner regions of OH231.8 (at few tens of AU). We detected 30 water
maser features, which occur in two distinct regions that are moving apart with
a velocity on the sky of 2.3 mas/year. Taking into account the inclination
angle of the source, this corresponds to an average separation velocity of 21
km/s. Based on the velocity gradient of the maser emission, the masers appear
to be dragged along the direction of the nebula jet. Linear polarization is
present in 3 of the features, and circular polarization was detected in the 2
brightest ones. We found that the strength of the magnetic field is |B_{||}|~45
mG which, when assuming a toroidal magnetic field, implies B~2.5 G on the

carrier concentrations for a given temperature and chemical environment and
eventually the electrial conductivity. The calculations are in excellent
agreement with experimental data if an accidental acceptor dopant level of
$10^{17}\,\cm^{-3}$ is assumed. It is shown that doubly charged oxygen
vacancies are accountable for the high-temperature $n$-type conduction under
oxygen-poor conditions. The high-temperature $p$-type conduction observed at
large oxygen pressures is due to barium vacancies and titanium-oxygen
di-vacancies under Ti and Ba-rich conditions, respectively. Finally, the
connection between the present approach and the mass-action law approach to
point defect thermodynamics is discussed.

powerful way of modeling the structure and function of molecular systems like
proteins. Unfortunately, MSMs with sufficiently many states to make a
quantitative connection with experiments (often tens of thousands of states
even for small systems) are generally too complicated to understand. Here, I
present a Bayesian agglomerative clustering engine (BACE) for coarse-graining
such Markov models, thereby reducing their complexity and making them more
comprehensible. An important feature of this algorithm is its ability to
explicitly account for statistical uncertainty in model parameters that arises
from finite sampling. This advance builds on a number of recent works
highlighting the importance of accounting for uncertainty in the analysis of
MSMs and provides significant advantages over existing methods for
coarse-graining Markov state models. The closed-form expression I derive here
for determining which states to merge is equivalent to the generalized
Jensen-Shannon divergence, an important measure from information theory that is
related to the relative entropy. Therefore, the method has an appealing
information theoretic interpretation in terms of minimizing information loss.
The bottom-up nature of the algorithm likely makes it particularly well suited
for constructing mesoscale models. I also present an extremely efficient
expression for Bayesian model comparison that can be used to identify the most
meaningful levels of the hierarchy of models from BACE.

that it is based on a modified form of the orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing based multiple access (OFDMA) which enables channel dependent
frequency selective scheduling, and that it allows for multi-user (MU)
scheduling wherein multiple users can be assigned the same time-frequency
resource. In addition to the considerable spectral efficiency improvements that
are possible by exploiting these two features, the LTE UL allows for transmit
antenna selection together with the possibility to employ advanced receivers at
the base-station, which promise further gains. However, several practical
constraints that seek to maintain a low signaling overhead, are also imposed.
In this paper, we show that the resulting resource allocation problem is
APX-hard and then propose a local ratio test (LRT) based constant-factor
polynomial-time approximation algorithm. We then propose two enhancements to
this algorithm as well as a sequential LRT based MU scheduling algorithm that
offers a constant-factor approximation and is another useful choice in the
complexity versus performance tradeoff. Further, user pre-selection, wherein a
smaller pool of good users is pre-selected and a sophisticated scheduling
algorithm is then employed on the selected pool, is also examined. We suggest
several such user pre-selection algorithms, some of which are shown to offer
constant-factor approximations to the pre-selection problem. Detailed

two complementary techniques for producing spectral analysis of these TEC

wavelengths of about half the size of the array (~20 km) or more. This
technique was successful in detecting and characterizing many medium-scale
traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) seen intermittently throughout the
night and has been partially validated using concurrent GPS measurements.
Smaller waves are also seen with this technique at nearly all times, many of
which move in similar directions as the detected MSTIDs. The second technique
allows for the detection and statistical description of the properties of
groups of waves moving in similar directions with wavelengths as small as 5 km.
Combining the results of both spectral techniques, we found a class of
intermediate and small scale waves which are likely the quasi-periodic (QP)
echoes that have been observed to occur within sporadic-E (Es) layers. We find
two distinct populations of these waves. The members of one population are
coincident in time with MSTIDs and are consistent with being generated within
Es layers by the E-F coupling instability. The other population seems more
influenced by the neutral wind, similar to the predominant types of QP echoes

mainly because it had a bright optical afterglow and it is among the most
energetic events detected so far within the entire GRB population. The
afterglow was observed with swift/UVOT and swift/XRT and evidence of a jet
break around 1.5 ks after the burst has been reported in the literature,
implying that after this break the optical and X-ray light curve should fade
with the same decay slope. As noted by several authors, the post-break decay
slope seen in the UVOT data is much shallower than the steep decay in the X-ray
band, pointing to an excess of optical flux at late times. We reduced and
analyzed new afterglow light-curve data obtained with the multichannel imager
GROND. Based on the densely sampled data set obtained with GROND, we find that
the optical afterglow of GRB 090510 did indeed enter a steep decay phase
starting around 22 ks after the burst. During this time the GROND optical light
curve is achromatic, and its slope is identical to the slope of the X-ray data.
In combination with the UVOT data this implies that a second break must have
occurred in the optical light curve around 22 ks post burst, which, however,
has no obvious counterpart in the X-ray band, contradicting the interpretation
that this could be another jet break. The GROND data provide the missing piece
of evidence that the optical afterglow of GRB 090510 did follow a post-jet
break evolution at late times.

(ii) the mean time of reaching given level of purity, (1-\epsilon). Under ideal
measurements (detector efficiency \eta=1), we show in the first case an
asymptotic mean purification speed-up of 4 as compared to a standard
(classical) single-detector measurement. However by the second measure --- the
mean time of first passage T(\epsilon) of the purity --- the corresponding
speed-up is only 2. We explain these speed-ups using the isotropy of the qubit
evolution that provides an equivalence between the original measurement
directions and three simultaneous measurements, one with an axis aligned along
the Bloch vector and the other with axes in the two complementary directions.

T(\delta,\epsilon) increases since qubit purification competes with an
isotropic qubit dephasing. In the asymptotic high-purity limit (\epsilon,

T(\delta,\epsilon) is a function only of the ratio {\delta}/{\epsilon}. The

this formulation can also be interpreted as coherent states over an infinite

and coherent states over a finite periodic chain where the quantum phase space

known as the entropy dispersion matrix, which is analogous to the scalar
dispersions that have gained interest recently. We prove a global dispersion
result that can be expressed in terms of this entropy dispersion matrix and
provides intuition on the approximate rate losses at a given blocklength and
error probability. To gain better intuition about the rate at which the
non-asymptotic rate region converges to the Slepian-Wolf boundary, we define
and characterize two operational dispersions: the local dispersion and the
weighted sum-rate dispersion. The former represents the rate of convergence to
a point on the Slepian-Wolf boundary while the latter represents the fastest
rate for which a weighted sum of the two rates converges to its asymptotic
fundamental limit. Interestingly, when we approach either of the two corner
points, the local dispersion is characterized not by a univariate Gaussian but
a bivariate one as well as a subset of off-diagonal elements of the
aforementioned entropy dispersion matrix. Finally, we demonstrate the
versatility of our achievability proof technique by providing inner bounds for
the multiple-access channel and the asymmetric broadcast channel in terms of
dispersion matrices. All our proofs are unified a so-called vector rate
redundancy theorem which is proved using the multidimensional Berry-Esseen

is a pole of the transmission coefficient (and hence of the resolvent) in the

non-baryonic dark matter can accumulate enough on the scales of UCDs for
influencing their dynamics significantly. UCDs in the Virgo galaxy cluster
apparently also have an over-abundance of neutron stars, strongly suggesting a
top-heavy IMF, which would explain both findings. This is because a top-heavy
IMF can provide the unseen mass through an abundance of stellar remnants. The
suggested variation of the IMF can be understood if UCDs represent a case of
rapid star-formation in an extremely dense environment. While top-heavy IMFs

Five systems have z > 5, with a maximum of z = 5.33 - the most distant MgII
system now known. The comoving MgII line density for weaker systems (Wr < 1.0A)
is statistically consistent with no evolution from z = 0.4 to z = 5.5, while
that for stronger systems increases three-fold until z \sim 3 before declining
again towards higher redshifts. The equivalent width distribution, which fits
an exponential, reflects this evolution by flattening as z approaches 3 before
steepening again. The rise and fall of the strong absorbers suggests a
connection to the star formation rate density, as though they trace galactic
outflows or other byproducts of star formation. The weaker systems' lack of
evolution does not fit within this interpretation, but may be reproduced by
extrapolating low redshift scaling relations between host galaxy luminosity and
absorbing halo radius to earlier epochs. For the weak systems,
luminosity-scaled models match the evolution better than similar models based
on MgII occupation of evolving CDM halo masses, which greatly underpredict
dN/dz at early times unless the absorption efficiency of small haloes is
significantly larger in the early universe. Taken together, these observations
suggest that the general structure of MgII-bearing haloes was put into place
early in the process of galaxy assembly. Except for a transient appearance of
stronger systems near the peak epoch of cosmic star formation, the basic
properties of MgII absorbers have evolved fairly little even as the
(presumably) associated galaxy population grew substantially in stellar mass

the uncertainty typically assigned when using a single model grid. Fits to a
single wavelength band can vary by up to 1000K using the different models.
Since the overall shape of these spectra is governed more by the temperature
than surface gravity, unconstrained model fits did not find matches with low
surface gravity or a trend in log(g) with age. This suggests that empirical
comparison with spectra of unambiguously young objects targets (such as these
SINFONI data) may be the most reliable method to search for indications of low
surface gravity and youth. For two targets, the SINFONI data are a second epoch
and the data show no variations in morphology over time. The analysis of two
other targets, AB Pic B and CT Cha B, suggests that these objects may have
lower temperatures, and consequently lower masses, than previously estimated.

much younger radio age is determined, <2e3yr, similar to those of GPS/CSS

\frac{1}{\pi^2}\log{t}$. Since the static charge variance for a length $l$

exponent $z \ne 1$, and also a model for entanglement entropy based upon
dynamical scaling at the Infinite Disorder Fixed Point (IDFP). The latter
scaling, which predicts $<\delta N^2> \propto \log\log{t}$, appears to better
describe the charge variance of disordered 1-d fermions. When a bias voltage is
introduced, the behavior changes dramatically and the charge and variance
become proportional to $(\log{t})^{1/\psi}$ and $\log{t}$, respectively. The
exponent $\psi$ may be related to the critical exponent characterizing

allows the analyst to minimize some cost function while ensuring some minimal
performances cast as admissible probabilities of failure for a set of
performance functions. In order to address real-world problems in which the
performance is assessed through computational models (e.g. large scale finite
element models) meta-modelling techniques have been developed in the past

RBDO problem. The latter is cast in an augmented space that ""sums up"" the range
of the design space and the aleatory uncertainty in the design parameters and
the environmental conditions. Thus the surrogate model is used (i) for
evaluating robust estimates of the probabilities of failure (and for enhancing
the computational experimental design by adaptive sampling) in order to achieve
the requested accuracy and (ii) for applying the gradient-based optimization
algorithm. The approach is applied to the optimal design of imperfect stiffened
cylinder shells used in submarine engineering. For this application the
performance of the structure is related to buckling which is addressed here by
means of the asymptotic numerical method.

the Globular Cluster Luminosity Function as distance indicator. I discuss here
recent results based on observational and theoretical studies, which show that
this distance indicator depends on complex physics of the cluster formation and
dynamical evolution, and thus can have dependencies on Hubble type, environment
and dynamical history of the host galaxy. While the corrections are often
relatively small, they can amount to important systematic differences that make
the Globular Cluster Luminosity Function a less accurate distance indicator

(minimum-B) trap formed by superconducting octupole and mirror magnet coils.
The trapped antiatoms were detected by rapidly turning off these magnets,
thereby eliminating the magnetic minimum and releasing any antiatoms contained
in the trap. Once released, these antiatoms quickly hit the trap wall,
whereupon the positrons and antiprotons in the antiatoms annihilated. The
antiproton annihilations produce easily detected signals; we used these signals
to prove that we trapped antihydrogen. However, our technique could be
confounded by mirror-trapped antiprotons, which would produce
seemingly-identical annihilation signals upon hitting the trap wall. In this
paper, we discuss possible sources of mirror-trapped antiprotons and show that
antihydrogen and antiprotons can be readily distinguished, often with the aid
of applied electric fields, by analyzing the annihilation locations and times.
We further discuss the general properties of antiproton and antihydrogen
trajectories in this magnetic geometry, and reconstruct the antihydrogen energy
distribution from the measured annihilation time history.

limits in the 0.1-10 GeV range during the prompt emission phase as well as for

extrapolations of spectral fits presented in the first GBM spectral catalog and
infer that roughly half of the GBM-detected bursts either require spectral
breaks between the GBM and LAT energy bands or have intrinsically steeper
spectra above the peak of the {\nu}F{\nu} spectra (Epk). In order to
distinguish between these two scenarios, we perform joint GBM and LAT spectral
fits to the 30 brightest GBM-detected bursts and find that a majority of these
bursts are indeed softer above Epk than would be inferred from fitting the GBM
data alone. Approximately 20% of this spectroscopic subsample show
statistically significant evidence for a cut-off in their high-energy spectra,
which if assumed to be due to {\gamma}{\gamma} attenuation, places limits on
the maximum Lorentz factor associated with the relativistic outflow producing
this emission. All of these latter bursts have maximum Lorentz factor estimates
that are well below the minimum Lorentz factors calculated for LAT- detected
GRBs, revealing a wide distribution in the bulk Lorentz factor of GRB outflows

colloidal spheres stick irreversibly to -- or ""park"" on -- smaller spheres. We
use either oppositely charged particles or particles labeled with complementary
DNA sequences, and we vary the ratio $\alpha$ of large to small sphere radii.
Once bound, the large spheres cannot rearrange, and thus the clusters do not
form dense or symmetric packings. Nevertheless, this stochastic aggregation
process yields a remarkably narrow distribution of clusters with nearly 90%
tetrahedra at $\alpha=2.45$. The high yield of tetrahedra, which reaches 100%
in simulations at $\alpha=2.41$, arises not simply because of packing
constraints, but also because of the existence of a long-time lower bound that
we call the ""minimum parking"" number. We derive this lower bound from solutions
to the classic mathematical problem of spherical covering, and we show that
there is a critical size ratio $\alpha_c=(1+\sqrt{2})\approx 2.41$, close to
the observed point of maximum yield, where the lower bound equals the upper
bound set by packing constraints. The emergence of a critical value in a random
aggregation process offers a robust method to assemble uniform clusters for a
variety of applications, including metamaterials.

routing and rate control algorithms in wireless, mobile communication networks.
Congestion control and routing algorithms upto now have been designed and
optimized for wired or wireless mesh networks. In those networks, optimal
algorithms (optimal in the sense that either the throughput is maximized or
delay is minimized, or the network operation cost is minimized) can be
engineered based on the classic time scale decomposition assumption that the
dynamics of the network are either fast enough so that these algorithms
essentially see the average or slow enough that any changes can be tracked to
allow the algorithms to adapt over time. However, as technological advancements
enable integration of ever more mobile nodes into communication networks, any
rate control or routing algorithms based, for example, on averaging out the
capacity of the wireless mobile link or tracking the instantaneous capacity
will perform poorly. The common element in our solution to engineering
efficient routing and rate control algorithms for mobile wireless networks is
to make the wireless mobile links seem as if they are wired or wireless links
to all but few nodes that directly see the mobile links (either the mobiles or
nodes that can transmit to or receive from the mobiles) through an appropriate
use of queuing structures at these selected nodes. This approach allows us to
design end-to-end rate control or routing algorithms for wireless mobile
networks so that neither averaging nor instantaneous tracking is necessary.

Namely, the odd higher genus sigma-function $\sigma_{\chi}(u)$ (for $u\in

characteristic $\beta^{\chi}$, associated with a spin line bundle $\chi$, an
exponent of a certain bilinear form, the determinant of a period matrix and a
power of the product of all even theta-constants which are non-vanishing on a
given Riemann surface.
  We also define an even sigma-function corresponding to an arbitrary even spin
structure. Even sigma-functions are constructed as a straightforward analog of
a classical formula relating even and odd sigma-functions. In higher genus the
even sigma-functions are well-defined on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces

ellipsoidal particles in 2D and 3D over a range of aspect ratio and compression
$\Delta \phi$. While amorphous packings of spherical particles at jamming onset
($\Delta \phi=0$) are isostatic and possess the minimum contact number $z_{\rm
iso}$ required for them to be collectively jammed, amorphous packings of
ellipsoidal particles generally possess fewer contacts than expected for
collective jamming ($z < z_{\rm iso}$) from naive counting arguments, which
assume that all contacts give rise to linearly independent constraints on
interparticle separations. To understand this behavior, we decompose the
dynamical matrix $M=H-S$ for static packings of ellipsoidal particles into two
important components: the stiffness $H$ and stress $S$ matrices. We find that
the stiffness matrix possesses $N(z_{\rm iso} - z)$ eigenmodes ${\hat e}_0$
with zero eigenvalues even at finite compression, where $N$ is the number of
particles. In addition, these modes ${\hat e}_0$ are nearly eigenvectors of the
dynamical matrix with eigenvalues that scale as $\Delta \phi$, and thus finite
compression stabilizes packings of ellipsoidal particles. At jamming onset, the
harmonic response of static packings of ellipsoidal particles vanishes, and the
total potential energy scales as $\delta^4$ for perturbations by amplitude
$\delta$ along these `quartic' modes, ${\hat e}_0$. These findings illustrate
the significant differences between static packings of spherical and
ellipsoidal particles.

In previous protocols, Alice needs to have a device which generates quantum
states, such as single-photon states. Here we propose another type of blind
computing protocol where Alice does only measurements, such as the polarization
measurements with a threshold detector. In several experimental setups, such as
optical systems, the measurement of a state is much easier than the generation
of a single-qubit state. Therefore our protocols ease Alice's burden.
Furthermore, the security of our protocol is based on the no-signaling
principle, which is more fundamental than quantum physics. Finally, our
protocols are device independent in the sense that Alice does not need to trust
her measurement device in order to guarantee the security.

the negative log density (i.e., the energy function) of the distribution of

solved analytically. The overall energy function U is then written as U0 + U1,
where U1 is the approximation error. The Hamiltonian is then split into two
parts; one part is based on U0 is handled analytically, the other part is based
on U1 for which we approximate Hamiltonian's equations by discretizing time. We
use simulated and real data to compare the performance of our method to the
standard HMC. We find that splitting the Hamiltonian for GP models could lead
to substantial improvement (up to 10 folds) of sampling efficiency, which is
measured in terms of the amount of time required for producing an independent

construction is enhanced by Program Dependence Graph (PDG). PDG is achieved by
the Control Flow Graph (CFG). The PPDG construction augments the structural
dependences represented by a program dependence graph with estimates of
statistical dependences between node states, which are computed from the test
set. The PPDG is based on the established framework of probabilistic graphical
models. This work presents algorithms for constructing PPDGs and applying fault
localization.

SNe Ia in the GOODS fields, we search for correlations between the properties
of SNe and their host galaxies at high redshift. We use galaxy color and
quantitative morphology to determine the red sequence in 25 clusters and
develop a model to distinguish passively evolving early-type galaxies from
star-forming galaxies in both clusters and the field. With this approach, we
identify six SN Ia hosts that are early-type cluster members and eleven SN Ia
hosts that are early-type field galaxies. We confirm for the first time at
z>0.9 that SNe Ia hosted by early-type galaxies brighten and fade more quickly
than SNe Ia hosted by late-type galaxies. We also show that the two samples of
hosts produce SNe Ia with similar color distributions. The relatively simple
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) expected for passive galaxies enable us to
measure stellar masses of early-type SN hosts. In combination with stellar mass
estimates of late-type GOODS SN hosts from Thomson & Chary (2011), we
investigate the correlation of host mass with Hubble residual observed at lower
redshifts. Although the sample is small and the uncertainties are large, a hint
of this relation is found at z>0.9. By simultaneously fitting the average
cluster galaxy formation history and dust content to the red-sequence scatters,
we show that the reddening of early-type cluster SN hosts is likely E(B-V) <~
0.06. The similarity of the field and cluster early-type host samples suggests
that field early-type galaxies that lie on the red sequence may also be
minimally affected by dust. Hence, the early-type hosted SNe Ia studied here
occupy a more favorable environment to use as well-characterized high-redshift
standard candles than other SNe Ia.

of `gene families'. A gene family includes instances of the same gene in
different species (orthologs) and duplicate genes in the same species
(paralogs). Genes are gained and lost during evolution. With advances in
sequencing technology, researchers are able to investigate the important roles
of gene duplications and losses in adaptive evolution. Because of gene complex
evolution, ortholog identification is a basic but difficult task in comparative
genomics. A key method for the task is to use an explicit model of the
evolutionary history of the genes being studied, called the gene (family) tree.
It compares the gene tree with the evolutionary history of the species in which
the genes reside, called the species tree, using the procedure known as tree
reconciliation. Reconciling binary gene and specific trees is simple. However,
both gene and species trees may be non-binary in practice and thus tree
reconciliation presents challenging problems. Here, non-binary gene and species
tree reconciliation is studied in a binary refinement model.
  Results: The problem of reconciling arbitrary gene and species trees is
proved NP-hard even for the duplication cost. We then present the first
efficient method for reconciling a non-binary gene tree and a non-binary
species tree. It attempts to find binary refinements of the given gene and
species trees that minimize reconciliation cost. Our algorithms have been
implemented into a software to support quick automated analysis of large data
sets.

submanifold $M$ most of the results proved by Alekseevsky and Marchiafava,
2001, where Hermitian and K\""ahler submanifolds of a quaternionic K\""ahler
manifold have been studied.
  Conditions for the integrability of an almost (para-)Hermitian structure on

Considering totally (para-)complex submanifolds of maximal dimension $2n$, we

\in TM\otimes S^2T^*M$ where $J_2 \in Q$ is a compatible para-complex structure
anticommuting with $J_1$. When $\widetilde M^{4n}$ is a symmetric manifold the
condition for a (para-)K\""ahler submanifold $M^{2n}$ to be locally symmetric is

shown, by using Gauss and Ricci equations, that a (para-)K\""ahler submanifold
$M^{2n}$ is curvature invariant. Moreover it is a locally symmetric Hermitian
submanifold iff the $\mathfrak u(n)$-valued 2-form $[C,C]$ is parallel.

verification of their proper motions as well as the calculation of the centroid
shift of the source resulting from the astrometric microlensing effect. The
assembled microlensing catalog comprises 1118 candidates for the years 2012 to

astrometric microlensing during the expected Gaia mission. For most of them the
light centroid shift is below ~100 microarcsec (assuming a dark lens) or the
astrometric deviation is considerably reduced by the brightness of the lens.
Due to this the astrometric microlensing effect can potentially be measured for
9 candidates that have a centroid shift between 100 and 4000 microarcsec. For 2
of these astrometric microlensing candidates we predict a strong centroid shift
of about 1000 and 4000 microarcsec, respectively, that should be observable

relativity that assumes the spacetime connection to be generated by an

connection into a fundamental field, the new variational principle results in a
physically distinct theory since the potential for the connection carries new
degrees of freedom. The connection-generating metric naturally allows also an
antisymmetric component. This sets torsion propagating! It is also shown here
that while in the most straightforward generalization of the Einstein-Hilbert
action the nonmetric degrees of freedom become ghosts, there exist very simple
actions which give rise to viable theories at the linearised level when
subjected to the bimetric variational principle. However, the non linear
interactions might bring unpleasant features like the Boulware-Deser ghost.
This remains to be explored since this new type of bimetric theories does not,
in principle, lie in the class of usual bimetric theories where non-linear
interactions inevitably come in with new ghost-like degrees of freedom.

star, two key factors are expected to come into play side by side: the lack of
self-stabilization against shutting into black hole (BH) and forthcoming phase
transition - color deconfinement and QCD-vacuum reconstruction - within the
nuclear matter the star is composed of. These phenomena bring the star to
evolve in the quite different (opposite) ways and should be taken into account
at once, as the gravitational compression is considered. Under the above
transition, which is expected to occur within any supermassive neutron star
(NS), the hadronic-phase (HPh) vacuum - a coherent state of gluon- and chiral
$q\bar q$-condensates - turns, first near the star center, into the ""empty""
(perturbation) subhadronic-phase (SHPh) one and, thus, pre-existing (very high)
vacuum pressure falls there down rather abruptly; as a result, the ""cold"" star
starts collapsing almost freely into the new vacuum. If the stellar mass is
sufficiently large, then this implosion is shown to result in an enormous
heating within the star central domain (up to a temperature about 100-200 MeV
or, maybe, even higher), what makes the pressure from within to grow up,
predominantly due to degeneracy breaking and multiple $q\bar q$-pair
production. Thus, a ""flaming wall"" could arise, which withstands the further
collapsing and brings the star off the irrevocable shutting into BH. Instead,
the star either forms a transient quasi-steady state (just the case of
relatively low star mass) and, losing its mass, evolves gradually into the
""normal"" steady NS, or is doomed for self-liquidation in full (at higher

embedding, then the operator is narrow.
  (Here $L_1(A) = \bigl\{x \in L_1: \,\, {\rm supp} \, x \subseteq A \bigr\}$.)
This leads to a natural question of finding mildest possible assumptions for
operators on a given space $X$, which will imply that the operator is narrow.
We find a partial answer to this question for operators on $L_p(0,1)$ with
$1<p<2$. Namely we define a notion of a ""gentle"" growth of a function and we
prove that for $1 < p < 2$ every operator $T$ on $L_p$ which is unbounded from

trapped modes of the system. This weakness of the model is overcome by the
inclusion of wave propagation in the ignorable direction. The inclusion of
perpendicular propagation produces two main results. First, damping by wave
leakage is less efficient because the loop is able to act as a wave trap of
vertical oscillations. Second, the consideration of an inhomogeneous corona
enables the resonant damping of vertical oscillations and the energy transfer

the fluorescence light emitted by the extensive air showers induced by them. To
reconstruct a shower cascade curve from measurements of the number of photons
arriving from the subsequent shower track elements it is necessary to take into
account the multiple scatterings that photons undergo on their way from the
shower to the detector. In contrast to the earlier Monte-Carlo work, we present
here an analytical method to treat the Rayleigh and Mie scatterings in the
atmosphere. The method consists in considering separately the consecutive
'generations' of the scattered light. Starting with a point light source in a
uniform medium, we then examine a source in a real atmosphere and finally - a
moving source (shower) in it. We calculate the angular distributions of the
scattered light superimposed on the not scattered light registered from a
shower at a given time. The analytical solutions (although approximate) show
how the exact numerical results should be parametrised what we do for the first
two generations (the contribution of the higher ones being small). Not allowing
for the considered effect may lead to an overestimation of shower primary
energy by ~15% and to an underestimation of the primary particle mass.

NGC2808, a massive globular cluster with a large population of ""blue-hook""
(BHk) stars. The BHk stars are found in UV color-magnitude diagrams of the most
massive globular clusters, where they fall at luminosities immediately below
the hot end of the horizontal branch (HB), in a region of the HR diagram
unexplained by canonical stellar evolution theory. Using new evolutionary and
atmospheric models, we have shown that these subluminous HB stars are very
likely the progeny of stars that undergo extensive internal mixing during a
late He-core flash on the white dwarf cooling curve. This flash mixing leads to
hotter temperatures and an enormous enhancement of the surface He and C; these
hotter temperatures, together with the decrease in H opacity shortward of the
Lyman limit, make the BHk stars brighter in the EUV while appearing subluminous
in the UV and optical. Our FUV spectroscopy demonstrates that, relative to
normal HB stars at the same color, the BHk stars of NGC2808 are hotter and
greatly enhanced in He and C, thus providing unambiguous evidence of flash
mixing. Although the C abundance in the BHk stars is orders of magnitude larger
than that in the normal HB stars, the C abundance in both the BHk and normal HB
stars appears to be affected by gravitational settling. The variations seen in
Si and the Fe-peak elements also indicate that atmospheric diffusion is at play
in our sample, with all of our hot subdwarfs at 25,000 to 50,000 K exhibiting
large enhancements of the Fe-peak elements. The hottest subdwarfs in our BHk
sample may be pulsators, given that they fall in the temperature range of
newly-discovered pulsating subdwarfs in omega Cen. In addition to the normal
hot HB and BHk stars, we obtain spectra of 5 blue HB stars, a post-HB star, and
3 unclassified stars with unusually blue UV colors.

coupling between excitons and photons, which have recently demonstrated
exceptional properties like huge non-linearities, long range coherence and
suppression of scattering. Here we demonstrate a switching scheme for
polaritons moving in the plane of a microcavity which satisfy all the
requirements for an all-optical transistor. Under resonant excitation, the
power threshold for the nonlinear increase of the polariton density is varied
by a weak control beam, obtaining up to 19 times amplification with switching
energies in the range of attojoule per square micron. Polariton propagation in
the plane of the microcavity is then used to control the switching of a second,
spatially separated transistor, opening the way to the implementation of
polariton integrated circuits.

subvariety $V$ of the unit ball $\mathbb{B}_d$.
  We find that $\mathcal M_V$ is completely isometrically isomorphic to
$\mathcal M_W$ if and only if $W$ is the image of $V$ under a biholomorphic
automorphism of the ball. In this case, the isomorphism is unitarily
implemented. This is then strengthend to show that, when $d<\infty$, every
isometric isomorphism is completely isometric.
  The problem of characterizing when two such algebras are (algebraically)
isomorphic is also studied. When $V$ and $W$ are each a finite union of
irreducible varieties and a discrete variety in $\mathbb{B}_d$ with $d<\infty$,
then an isomorphism between $\mathcal M_V$ and $\mathcal M_W$ determines a
biholomorphism (with multiplier coordinates) between the varieties; and the
isomorphism is composition with this function. These maps are automatically
weak-$*$ continuous.
  We present a number of examples showing that the converse fails in several
ways. We discuss several special cases in which the converse does
hold---particularly, smooth curves and Blaschke sequences.

with the molecular clouds in the star forming region W51B. In addition, a
possible pulsar wind nebula CXO J192318.5+140305 was found likely associated
with the supernova remnant. Gamma-ray emission from this region was discovered
by Fermi/LAT (between 0.2 and 50 GeV) and H.E.S.S. (>1 TeV). The spatial
distribution of the events could not be used to pinpoint the location of the
emission among the pulsar wind nebula, the supernova remnant shell and/or the
molecular cloud. However, the modeling of the spectral energy distribution
presented by the Fermi/LAT collaboration suggests a hadronic emission
mechanism. We performed observations of the W51 complex with the MAGIC
telescopes for more than 50 hours. The good angular resolution in the medium
(few hundred GeV) to high (above 1 TeV) energies allow us to perform
morphological studies. We detect an extended emission of very-high-energy gamma
rays, with a significance of 11 standard deviations. We extend the spectrum
from the highest Fermi/LAT energies to \sim 5 TeV and find that it follows a
single power law with an index of 2.58 \pm 0.07stat \pm 0.22syst . The main
part of the emission coincides with the shocked cloud region, while we find a
feature extending towards the pulsar wind nebula. The possible contribution of
the pulsar wind nebula, assuming a point-like source, shows no dependence on
energy and it is about 20% of the overall emission. The broad band spectral
energy distribution can be explained with a hadronic model that implies proton
acceleration above 100 TeV. This result, together with the morphology of the
source, tentatively suggests that we observe ongoing acceleration of ions in
the interaction zone between supernova remnant and cloud. These results shed
light on the long-standing problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays.

intermetallic using results from uniaxial low-cycle fatigue tests. Both
assessments are based on dissipated energy but one of them considers a
hydrostatic pressure correction. This work allows to confirm, on this kind of
material, the linear nature, already noticed on silicon molybdenum cast iron,
TiNi shape memory alloy and 304L stainless steel, of dissipated energy,
corrected or not with hydrostatic pressure, according to the number of cycles
to failure. This study also highlights that, firstly, the dissipated energy
model is here more adequate to estimate low-cycle fatigue life and that,
secondly, intrinsic parameters like microstructure as well as extrinsic
parameters like temperature or strain ratio have an impact on prediction
results.

the junctions' dynamics and creates a superconducting artificial atom with two
internal degrees of freedom. In addition to the usual symmetric plasma mode
({\it s}-mode) which gives rise to the phase qubit, an anti-symmetric mode
({\it a}-mode) appears. These two modes can be described by two anharmonic
oscillators with eigenstates $\ket{n_{s}}$ and $\ket{n_{a}}$ for the {\it s}
and {\it a}-mode, respectively. We show that a strong nonlinear coupling
between the modes leads to a large energy splitting between states
$\ket{0_{s},1_{a}}$ and $\ket{2_{s},0_{a}}$. Finally, coherent frequency
conversion is observed via free oscillations between the states
$\ket{0_{s},1_{a}}$ and $\ket{2_{s},0_{a}}$.

  includes proof corrections",,,,"math.CV math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this note, we prove a sharp lower bound for the log canonical threshold of
a plurisubharmonic function $\varphi$ with an isolated singularity at $0$ in an
open subset of ${\mathbb C}^n$. This threshold is defined as the supremum of
constants $c>0$ such that $e^{-2c\varphi}$ is integrable on a neighborhood of
$0$. We relate $c(\varphi)$ with the intermediate multiplicity numbers
$e_j(\varphi)$, defined as the Lelong numbers of $(dd^c\varphi)^j$ at $0$ (so
that in particular $e_0(\varphi)=1$). Our main result is that
$c(\varphi)\ge\sum e_j(\varphi)/e_{j+1}(\varphi)$, $0\le j\le n-1$. This
inequality is shown to be sharp; it simultaneously improves the classical
result $c(\varphi)\ge 1/e_1(\varphi)$ due to Skoda, as well as the lower
estimate $c(\varphi)\ge n/e_n(\varphi)^{1/n}$ which has received crucial
applications to birational geometry in recent years. The proof consists in a
reduction to the toric case, i.e. singularities arising from monomial ideals.

controlled temperature and pressure, are confronted to various models that take
into account Dicke narrowing or speed-dependent effects. Our results show clear
evidence for speed-dependent broadening and shifting, which had never been
demonstrated so far in NH3. Accurate lineshape parameters of the nu2 saQ(6,3)

constant, kB, by laser spectroscopy will straight away benefit from such
knowledge. We anticipate that a first optical determination of kB with a
competitive uncertainty of a few ppm is now reachable.

with adaptive anisotropic meshes is not as bad as generally assumed.

are reported for magnetic fields up to 140 kOe, applied parallel and
perpendicular to the crystallographic b-axis. The magnetic susceptibility has
an approximately temperature independent behavior and reveals an anisotropy
between ac-plane and b-axis. Clear de Haas-van Alphen oscillations in fields as
low as 5 kOe and at temperatures as high as 30 K were detected in magnetization
isotherms. The thermoelectric power and resistivity of PtSn4 show the strong
temperature and magnetic field dependencies. A change of the thermoelectric
power at H = 140 kOe is observed as high as ~ 50 mu-V/K. Single crystals of
PtSn4 exhibit very large transverse magnetoresistance of ~ 5x10^5% for the
ac-plane and of ~ 1.4x10^5% for the b-axis resistivity at 1.8 K and 140 kOe, as
well as pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. The magnetoresistance of
PtSn4 appears to obey Kohler's rule in the temperature and field range
measured. The Hall resistivity shows a linear temperature dependence at high
temperatures followed by a sign reversal around 25 K which is consistent with
thermoelectric power measurements. The observed quantum oscillations and band
structure calculations indicate that PtSn4 has three dimensional Fermi
surfaces.

suggested. Using Schr\""odinger equation for complete orthonormal sets of
-exponential type orbitals (-ETO) introduced by the author, it is shown that
the origin of these polynomials is the centrally symmetric potential which
contains the core attraction potential and the quantum frictional potential of
the field produced by the particle itself. The quantum frictional forces are
the analog of radiation damping or frictional forces suggested by Lorentz in
classical electrodynamics. The new -LTP are complete without the inclusion of
the continuum states of hydrogen like atoms. It is shown that the nonstandard
and standard conventions of -LTP and their weight functions are the same. As an
application, the sets of infinite expansion formulas in terms of -LTP and
L-Generalized Laguerre polynomials (L-GLP) for atomic nuclear attraction
integrals of Slater type orbitals (STO) and Coulomb-Yukawa like correlated
interaction potentials (CIP) with integer and noninteger indices are obtained.
The arrange and rearranged power series of a general power function are also
investigated. The convergence of these series is tested by calculating concrete
cases for arbitrary values of parameters of orbitals and power function.

is motivated by recent experiments on the compound
$\mathrm{(C_5H_{12}N)_2CuBr_4}$ (BPCB). We use a combination of numerical and
analytical methods, in particular the density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) technique, to explore the phase diagram and the excitation spectra of
such a system. We give detailed results on the temperature dependence of the
magnetization and the specific heat, and the magnetic field dependence of the
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate of single ladders. For coupled
ladders, treating the weak interladder coupling within a mean field approach,
we compute the transition temperature of triplet condensation and its
corresponding antiferromagnetic order parameter. Existing experimental
measurements are discussed and compared to our theoretical results. Furthermore
we compute, using time dependent DMRG, the dynamical correlations of a single
spin ladder. Our results allow to directly describe the inelastic neutron
scattering cross section up to high energies. We focus on the evolution of the
spectra with the magnetic field and compare their behavior for different
couplings. The characteristic features of the spectra are interpreted using
different analytical approaches such as the mapping onto a spin chain, a
Luttinger liquid (LL) or onto a t-J model. For values of parameters for which
such measurements exist, we compare our results to inelastic neutron scattering
experiments on the compound BPCB and find excellent agreement. We make
additional predictions for the high energy part of the spectrum that are
potentially testable in future experiments.
