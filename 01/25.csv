molecular semiconductors have led to breakthrough carrier mobilities and to the
observation of band-like transport. These results represent the limit in our
quest for the ultimate OFET performance. However, band-like transport has not
been reported for n-channel OFETs and, for p-channel transistors, it is not
understood why it occurs only for certain molecular materials. Here we report
band-like electron transport for n-channel OFETs based on PDIF-CN2
single-crystals. Devices with different gate dielectrics - vacuum, Cytop, PMMA
- are compared and we find that the performance is suppressed for those with
larger dielectric constant. This phenomenon parallels that observed for holes
in p-channel OFETs, however, the magnitude of the suppression is smaller, an
effect that can be rationalized by the semiconductor molecular structure and
crystal packing. A quantitative analysis of our findings, together with results
on different high-quality p-channel transistors, indicates the importance of
the interplay between the semiconductor molecular polarizability and the
structure of the charge transport layers in the crystal, as a key factor
enabling band-like transport. Based on these considerations, we suggest
unprecedented structure-property relationships useful for performance
optimization of high-mobility organic transistors.

determining the aggregate mass distribution function. Differences between
turbulent and laminar flows are discussed. A novel definition of the
fragmentation rate is proposed in terms of the typical frequency at which the
hydrodynamic stress becomes sufficiently high to cause breakup along each
Lagrangian path. We also define an Eulerian proxy of the real fragmentation
rate, based on the joint statistics of the stress and its time derivative,
which should be easier to measure in any experimental set-up. Both our Eulerian

deficiencies. These are discussed by investigating the evolution of an ensemble

examined more than 100 optical depth templates, derived from both observations
of Galactic and extragalactic sources and laboratory measurements, in order to
constrain the chemical structure of the silicate dust. We find that the best
fit to the observed absorption profile is produced by laboratory crystalline
olivine, with a corresponding peak optical depth of tau_10=0.27+/-0.05. The fit
is slightly improved upon by including small contributions from additional
materials such as silica, enstatite, or serpentine, which suggests that the
dust composition may consist of a blend of crystalline silicates. Combining
templates for amorphous and crystalline silicates, we find that the fraction of
crystalline silicates needs to be at least 95%. Given the rarity of
extragalactic sources with such a high degree of silicate crystallinity, we
also explore the possibility that the observed spectral features are produced
by amorphous silicates in combination with other molecular or atomic
transitions, or by foreground source contamination. While we cannot rule out
these latter possibilities, they lead to much poorer profile fits than for the
crystalline olivine templates. If the presence of crystalline interstellar
silicates in this distant galaxy is real, it would be highly unusual, given
that the Milky Way interstellar matter contains essentially only amorphous
silicates. It is possible that the z=0.886 absorber towards PKS 1830-211, well

well as the H_alpha lines which are activity indicators. In order to
reconstruct the magnetic field geometry of V390 Aur, we applied the Zeeman
Doppler Imaging (ZDI) inversion method and present a map for the magnetic
field. Based on the obtained spectra, we also refined the fundamental
parameters of the star and the Li abundance. The ZDI revealed a structure in
the radial magnetic field consisting of a polar magnetic spot of positive
polarity and several negative spots at lower latitude. A high latitude belt is
present on the azimuthal field map, indicative of a toroidal field close to the

slower rotation compared to the photosphere, but our dataset is too short to be

  Studies",,,,,"stat.AP q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Assessing the statistical power to detect susceptibility variants plays a
critical role in GWA studies both from the prospective and retrospective points
of view. Power is empirically estimated by simulating phenotypes under a
disease model H1. For this purpose, the ""gold"" standard consists in simulating
genotypes given the phenotypes (e.g. Hapgen). We introduce here an alternative
approach for simulating phenotypes under H1 that does not require generating
new genotypes for each simulation. In order to simulate phenotypes with a fixed
total number of cases and under a given disease model, we suggest three
algorithms: i) a simple rejection algorithm; ii) a numerical Markov Chain
Monte-Carlo (MCMC) approach; iii) and an exact and efficient backward sampling
algorithm. In our study, we validated the three algorithms both on a
toy-dataset and by comparing them with Hapgen on a more realistic dataset. As
an application, we then conducted a simulation study on a 1000 Genomes Project
dataset consisting of 629 individuals (314 cases) and 8,048 SNPs from
Chromosome X. We arbitrarily defined an additive disease model with two
susceptibility SNPs and an epistatic effect. The three algorithms are
consistent, but backward sampling is dramatically faster than the other two.
Our approach also gives consistent results with Hapgen. Using our application
data, we showed that our limited design requires a biological a priori to limit
the investigated region. We also proved that epistatic effects can play a
significant role even when simple marker statistics (e.g. trend) are used. We
finally showed that the overall performance of a GWA study strongly depends on
the prevalence of the disease: the larger the prevalence, the better the power.

  A non-zero value of a specific quartic coupling in the scalar potential
removes this degeneracy, and positive values of this coupling would give rise
to the mass hierarchy m_{A^0,H^0} > m_{H^+} > m_{H^++}.
  In this scenario the decays H^0-> H^+ W^* and A^0-> H^+ W^*, followed by H^+

splittings among the triplet scalars.
  Such a cascade process would lead to production of H^{++}H^{--} accompanied
by several virtual W bosons, and would provide a way of observing H^0 and A^0

underlying atmospheric model is based on subjective reasons. In other cases,
complex models are chosen based on objective reasons (for instance, the
necessity to explain asymmetries in the Stokes profiles) but it is not clear
what degree of complexity is needed. The lack of an objective way of comparing
models has, sometimes, led to opposing views of the solar magnetism because the
inferred physical scenarios are essentially different. We present the first
quantitative model comparison based on the computation of the Bayesian evidence
ratios for spectropolarimetric observations. Our results show that there is not
a single model appropriate for all profiles simultaneously. Data with moderate
signal-to-noise ratios favor models without gradients along the line-of-sight.
If the observations shows clear circular and linear polarization signals above
the noise level, models with gradients along the line are preferred. As a
general rule, observations with large signal-to-noise ratios favor more complex
models. We demonstrate that the evidence ratios correlate well with simple
proxies. Therefore, we propose to calculate these proxies when carrying out
standard least-squares inversions to allow for model comparison in the future.

of damping and energy losses experienced by the network. This suggests, among

Light partons off-shell by $k_T^2$ are considered in the quark diagrams, in the

is explicitly demonstrated that the infrared logarithms $\ln k_T^2$ cancel

express $\omega$-regular conditions. While in general, the winning strategies
in such games may require infinite memory, for synthesis the most relevant
problem is the construction of a finite-memory winning strategy (if one

exponential bound (matching upper and lower bounds) on the memory required for
finite-memory winning strategies in both multi-dimensional mean-payoff and
energy games along with parity objectives. This significantly improves the
triple exponential upper bound for multi energy games (without parity) that
could be derived from results in literature for games on VASS (vector addition
systems with states). Second, we present an optimal symbolic and incremental
algorithm to compute a finite-memory winning strategy (if one exists) in such
games. Finally, we give a complete characterization of when finite memory of

pair correlations of the protein expression levels to produce a small numbers
(<10) of principal components, each a linear combination of the concentrations,
to successfully model how cells respond to different stimuli. However, it is
not understood if this reduction is specific to a particular biological system
or to nature of the stimuli used in these experiments. We study temporal
changes in pair correlations described by the covariance matrix between
different molecular species that evolve following deterministic mass action
kinetics in large biologically relevant reaction networks and show that this
dramatic reduction of dimensions (from hundreds to <5) arises from the strong

study of gas dynamics and thermodynamics in the interstellar and intergalactic
medium. As such, they have been studied extensively in the past under the
assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium. However, for a wide range of
applications, the local radiation field introduces a non-negligible, often
dominant, modification to the cooling and heating functions. In the most
general case, these modifications cannot be described in simple terms, and
would require a detailed calculation with a large set of chemical species using
a radiative transfer code (the well-known code Cloudy, for example). We show,
however, that for a sufficiently general variation in the spectral shape and
intensity of the incident radiation field, the cooling and heating functions
can be approximated as depending only on several photoionization rates, which
can be thought of as representative samples of the overall radiation field.
This dependence is easy to tabulate and implement in cosmological or
galactic-scale simulations, thus economically accounting for an important but
rarely-included factor in the evolution of cosmic gas. We also show a few
examples where the radiation environment has a large effect, the most
spectacular of which is a quasar that suppresses gas cooling in its host halo

dynamical model developed for synchrotron emission from a slightly decelerated
shockwave, we estimate the velocity and energy of the fastest ejecta and the
density profile of the circumstellar medium. The shockwaves of all three
supernovae are characterized by non-relativistic velocities of v ~ (0.1-25)c
and associated energies of E ~ (2-10) * 1e47 erg, in line with the expectations
for a typical homologous explosion. Smooth circumstellar density profiles are
indicated by the early radio data and we estimate the progenitor mass loss
rates to be ~ (0.6-13) * 1e-5 M_sun/yr (wind velocity 10^3 km/s). These
estimates approach the saturation limit (~1e-4 M_sun/yr) for line-driven winds
from Wolf-Rayet stars, the favored progenitors of SNe Ibc including those
associated with long-duration GRBs. Intriguingly, at later epochs all three
supernovae show evidence for abrupt radio variability that we attribute to
large density modulations (factor of ~3-6) at circumstellar radii of r ~ (1-50)
* 1e16 cm. If due to variable mass loss, these modulations are associated with
progenitor activity on a timescale of ~ 10-100 years before explosion. We
consider these results in the context of variable mass loss mechanisms
including wind clumping, metallicity-independent continuum-driven ejections,
and binary-induced modulations. It may also be possible that the SN shockwaves
are dynamically interacting with wind termination shocks, however, this
requires the environment to be highly pressurized and/or the progenitor to be
rapidly rotating prior to explosion. The proximity of the density modulations
to the explosion sites may suggest a synchronization between unusual progenitor
mass loss and the SN explosion, reminiscent of Type IIn supernovae. [ABRIDGED]

lines which are blended with Lyman alpha absorption lines toward higher

intergalactic medium with increasing lookback time. We also provide a new
measurement of the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth, tau_eff,

white dwarfs with masses of $0.9 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $1.1 \mathrm{M_\odot}$
combining very high resolution and exact initial conditions. A well-tested
combination of codes is used to study the system. We start with the dynamical

perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and radiative transfer

Line velocities in synthetic spectra around maximum light also agree well with

Here we use observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows, which are weakly
magnetized relativistic collisionless shocks in ion-electron plasma, to
constrain the rate of particle acceleration in such shocks. We find, based on
X-ray and GeV afterglows, an acceleration rate that is most likely very fast,
approaching the Bohm limit, when the shock Lorentz factor is in the range of
10-100. In that case X-ray observations may be consistent with no amplification
of the magnetic field in the shock upstream region. We examine the X-ray
afterglow of GRB 060729, which is observed for 642 days showing a sharp decay
in the flux starting about 400 days after the burst, when the shock Lorentz
factor is about 5. We find that inability to accelerate X-ray emitting
electrons at late time provides a natural explanation for the sharp decay, and
that also in that case acceleration must be rather fast, and cannot be more
than a 100 times slower than the Bohm limit. We conclude that particle
acceleration is most likely fast in GRB afterglows, at least as long as the

surface of a central sphere. This assembly process forms self-limiting, or
terminal, anisotropic clusters (N-clusters) with well defined structures. We
use Brownian dynamics to model the assembly of N-clusters varying in size from
two to twelve outer spheres, and free energy calculations to predict the
expected cluster sizes and shapes as a function of temperature and inner
particle diameter. We show that the arrangements of outer spheres at finite
temperatures are related to spherical codes, an ideal mathematical sequence of
points corresponding to densest possible sphere packings. We demonstrate that
temperature and the ratio of the diameters of the inner and outer spheres
dictate cluster morphology and dynamics. We find that some N-clusters exhibit
collective particle rearrangements, and these collective modes are unique to a
given cluster size N. We present a surprising result for the equilibrium
structure of a 5-cluster, which prefers an asymmetric square pyramid
arrangement over a more symmetric arrangement. Our results suggest a promising
way to assemble anisotropic building blocks from constituent colloidal spheres.

naturally leads to the notion of quasi self-dual processes. The focus of our
study is to give new characterizations of quasi self-duality for exponential
L\'evy processes such that the resulting market does not admit arbitrage
opportunities. We derive a set of equivalent conditions for the stochastic
logarithm of quasi self-dual martingale models and derive a further
characterization of these models not depending on the L\'evy-Khintchine
parametrization. Since for non-vanishing order parameter two martingale
properties have to be satisfied simultaneously, there is a non-trivial relation
between the order and shift parameter representing carrying costs in financial
applications. This leads to an equation containing an integral term which has
to be inverted in applications. We first discuss several important properties
of this equation and, for some well-known models, we derive a family of
closed-form inversion formulae leading to parameterizations of sets of possible
combinations in the corresponding parameter spaces of well-known L\'evy driven

simplified non-spatial models of proliferation are claimed to accurately
reproduce these statistics. Using a systematic critical analysis, we show that
non-spatial models are not capable of robustly describing the universal
statistics observed in proliferating epithelia, indicating strong spatial
correlations between cells. Furthermore we show that spatial simulations using
the Subcellular Element Model are able to robustly reproduce the universal

in early stages of chick embryo development in which cell behaviors other than
proliferation are important. We find from experimental observation that cell
neighbor statistics in the primitive streak region, where cell motility and
ingression are also important, show a much broader distribution. A non-spatial
Markov process model provides excellent agreement with this broader histogram
indicating that cells in the primitive streak may have significantly weaker

potentially powerful constraint on the reionisation history due to the thermal
imprint left by the photo-ionisation of neutral hydrogen. However, until
recently IGM temperature measurements were limited to redshifts 2 < z < 4.8,
restricting the ability of these data to probe the reionisation history at z >
6. In this work, we use recent measurements of the IGM temperature in the
near-zones of seven quasars at z ~ 5.8 - 6.4, combined with a semi-numerical
model for inhomogeneous reionisation, to establish new constraints on the
redshift at which hydrogen reionisation completed. We calibrate the model to
reproduce observational constraints on the electron scattering optical depth
and the HI photo-ionisation rate, and compute the resulting spatially
inhomogeneous temperature distribution at z ~ 6 for a variety of reionisation
scenarios. Under standard assumptions for the ionising spectra of population-II
sources, the near-zone temperature measurements constrain the redshift by which
hydrogen reionisation was complete to be z > 7.9 (6.5) at 68 (95) per cent
confidence. We conclude that future temperature measurements around other high
redshift quasars will significantly increase the power of this technique,
enabling these results to be tightened and generalised.

125 Myr), high mass (\sim 2\times10^6 M\odot) and position in the extreme outer
end of the young tidal tail. This cluster appears to be quite extended (Reff

true. However for the limit cases, which appear naturally both in averaging and
bifurcation theories, we encounter that, generically, $K$ and $\beta$ are not
well predicted by Melnikov theory.

spectrum are essential to the study of a range of astrophysical phenomena
including Active Galactic Nuclei. A key tool of such studies is the ability to
observe an object when it flares i.e. exhibits a rapid and significant increase
in its flux density.
  Aims. We describe the specific observational procedures and the calibration
techniques that have been developed and tested to create a single baseline
radio interferometer that can rapidly observe a flaring object. This is the
only facility that is dedicated to rapid high resolution radio observations of
an object south of -30 degrees declination. An immediate application is to
provide rapid contemporaneous radio coverage of AGN flaring at {\gamma}-ray
frequencies detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
  Methods. A single baseline interferometer was formed with radio telescopes in
Hobart, Tasmania and Ceduna, South Australia. A software correlator was set up
at the University of Tasmania to correlate these data.
  Results. Measurements of the flux densities of flaring objects can be made
using our observing strategy within half an hour of a triggering event. These
observations can be calibrated with amplitude errors better than 15%. Lower
limits to the brightness temperatures of the sources can also be calculated
using CHI.

gauginos and the Higgsinos while the remaining scalars are heavy. This spectrum
is naturally driven by renormalization group evolution starting from a heavy

supersymmetry-breaking mix of gauge mediation, which provides the scalars
masses by new gauge interactions, and gravity mediation, which generates
gaugino and Higgsino masses. This supersymmetry breaking also explains the \mu\

codes with syndrome accumulation (SA-LDPC-IED) is proposed and investigated.
Assume that the source alphabet is $\mathbf{GF}(2)$, and the side information
alphabet is finite. It is first demonstrated how to convert any classical
universal lossless code $\mathcal{C}_n$ (with block length $n$ and side
information available to both the encoder and decoder) into a universal
SA-LDPC-IED scheme. It is then shown that with the word error probability
approaching 0 sub-exponentially with $n$, the compression rate (including both
the forward and backward rates) of the resulting SA-LDPC-IED scheme is upper
bounded by a functional of that of $\mathcal{C}_n$, which in turn approaches
the compression rate of $\mathcal{C}_n$ for each and every individual sequence
pair $(x^n,y^n)$ and the conditional entropy rate $\mathrm{H}(X |Y)$ for any
stationary, ergodic source and side information $(X, Y)$ as the average
variable node degree $\bar{l}$ of the underlying LDPC code increases without
bound. When applied to the class of binary source and side information $(X, Y)$
correlated through a binary symmetrical channel with cross-over probability
unknown to both the encoder and decoder, the resulting SA-LDPC-IED scheme can
be further simplified, yielding even improved rate performance versus the bit
error probability when $\bar{l}$ is not large. Simulation results (coupled with
linear time belief propagation decoding) on binary source-side information
pairs confirm the theoretic analysis, and further show that the SA-LDPC-IED
scheme consistently outperforms the Slepian-Wolf coding scheme based on the
same underlying LDPC code. As a by-product, probability bounds involving LDPC
established in the course are also interesting on their own and expected to
have implications on the performance of LDPC for channel coding as well.

supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) realising an old field theory

reduction of couplings. Based on this theoretical framework phenomenologically
consistent FUTs have been constructed. Here we review two FUT models based on
the SU(5) gauge group, which can be seen as special, restricted and thus very
predictive versions of the MSSM. We show that from the requirement of correct
prediction of quark masses and other experimental constraints a light
Higgs-boson mass in the range M_h ~ 121 - 126 GeV is predicted, in striking
agreement with recent experimental results from ATLAS and CMS. The model
furthermore naturally predicts a relatively heavy spectrum with colored
supersymmetric particles above ~ 1.5 TeV in agreement with the non-observation
of those particles at the LHC.

  and Algorithms","46 pages, submitted to IEEE Trans. on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The proliferation of different wireless access technologies, together with
the growing number of multi-radio wireless devices suggest that the
opportunistic utilization of multiple connections at the users can be an
effective solution to the phenomenal growth of traffic demand in wireless
networks. In this paper we consider the downlink of a wireless network with $N$
Access Points (AP's) and $M$ clients, where each client is connected to several
out-of-band AP's, and requests delay-sensitive traffic (e.g., real-time video).
We adopt the framework of Hou, Borkar, and Kumar, and study the maximum total
timely throughput of the network, denoted by $C_{T^3}$, which is the maximum
average number of packets delivered successfully before their deadline. Solving
this problem is challenging since even the number of different ways of
assigning packets to the AP's is $N^M$. We overcome the challenge by proposing
a deterministic relaxation of the problem, which converts the problem to a
network with deterministic delays in each link. We show that the additive gap
between the capacity of the relaxed problem, denoted by $C_{det}$, and
$C_{T^3}$ is bounded by $2\sqrt{N(C_{det}+N/4)}$, which is asymptotically
negligible compared to $C_{det}$, when the network is operating at
high-throughput regime.
  In addition, our numerical results show that the actual gap between $C_{T^3}$
and $C_{det}$ is in most cases much less than the worst-case gap proven
analytically. Moreover, using LP rounding methods we prove that the relaxed
problem can be approximated within additive gap of $N$. We extend the
analytical results to the case of time-varying channel states, real-time
traffic, prioritized traffic, and optimal online policies. Finally, we
generalize the model for deterministic relaxation to consider fading, rate
adaptation, and multiple simultaneous transmissions.

gas-dominated protoplanetary disk, and were susceptible to gas-driven migration
of their orbits on timescales of only ~100,000 years (Armitage 2007).
Hydrodynamic simulations show that these giant planets can undergo a two-stage,
inward-then-outward, migration (Masset & Snellgrove 2001, Morbidelli & Crida
2007, Pierens & Nelson 2008). The terrestrial planets finished accreting much
later (Klein et al. 2009), and their characteristics, including Mars' small
mass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outer
edge at about one astronomical unit from the Sun (Wetherill 1978, Hansen 2009)
(1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance). Here we report simulations of the early Solar
System that show how the inward migration of Jupiter to 1.5 AU, and its
subsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1 AU;
the terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 million
years, with an Earth/Mars mass ratio consistent with observations. Scattering
by Jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, with
inner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3 AU and outer-belt bodies
originating between and beyond the giant planets. This explains the significant
compositional differences across the asteroid belt. The key aspect missing from
previous models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radial
migration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is more
similar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought.

by the puzzling signal of alignment of polarizations from distant quasars at
optical frequencies. We explore several different cuts on the polarization flux
for our analysis. We find that the entire data shows a very significant signal
of alignment on very large distance scales of order 500 Mpc. The alignment
starts to decay only at much larger distances of order Gpc. If we only consider
data with polarization flux greater than 1 mJy, we find alignment at distance
scales less than 150 Mpc. We also find that data with polarization flux less
than 0.5 mJy does not show significant alignment. Similar results are seen for
data with degree of polarization less than 0.01, although here a mild signal of
alignment is observed for a narrow range of angular separations. We argue that
the signal cannot be explained in terms of bias due to systematic errors in
removal of instrumental polarization. We also find that the degree of
polarization shows a strong negative correlation with the total flux. The data
appears to fall into two classes, one of which shows such a correlation. The
remaining set, which has total flux greater than 100 mJy and degree of
polarization lying between 0.01 and 0.1, shows a more random behaviour. The
latter set is also found to show no alignment whereas the first set shows a
very strong polarization alignment.

where the information in encoded and received. The lattice plays the role of a
communication channel along which the exciton propagates and interacts with a
phonon bath. Special attention is paid for describing the system involving an
exciton dressed by a single phonon mode. The Hamiltonian is thus solved exactly
so that the relevance of the perturbation theory is checked. Within the
nonadiabatic weak-coupling limit, it is shown that the system supports three
quasi-degenerate states that define the relevant paths followed by the exciton
to tunnel between the computers. When the model parameters are judiciously
chosen, constructive interferences take place between these paths.
Phonon-induced decoherence is minimized and a high-fidelity quantum state
transfer occurs over a broad temperature range.

and for their further acceleration to ultrahigh energies. Once accelerated in
the pulsar wind, nuclei have to escape from the surrounding supernova envelope.
We examine this escape analytically and numerically, and discuss the pulsar
source scenario in light of the latest ultrahigh energy cosmic ray (UHECR)
data. Our calculations show that, at early times, when protons can be
accelerated to energies E>10^20 eV, the young supernova shell tends to prevent
their escape. In contrast, because of their higher charge, iron-peaked nuclei
are still accelerated to the highest observed energies at later times, when the
envelope has become thin enough to allow their escape. Ultrahigh energy iron
nuclei escape newly-born pulsars with millisecond periods and dipole magnetic
fields of ~10^(12-13) G, embedded in core-collapse supernovae. Due to the
production of secondary nucleons, the envelope crossing leads to a transition
of composition from light to heavy elements at a few EeV, as observed by the
Auger Observatory. The escape also results in a softer spectral slope than that
initially injected via unipolar induction, which allows for a good fit to the
observed UHECR spectrum. We conclude that the acceleration of iron-peaked
elements in a reasonably small fraction (< 0.01%) of extragalactic
rotation-powered young pulsars would reproduce satisfactorily the current UHECR
data. Possible signatures of this scenario are also discussed.

many orbitals participate in the electronic states near the Fermi energy. Using
a two-orbital band model the electronic excitations near the Dirac node and the
anti-node are found to have different symmetries. Applying the symmetry
difference to Raman scattering the nodal and anti-nodal electronic excitations
are separately obtained. The low-energy spectra from the anti-nodal region have
critical fluctuation just above TSDW and change into the gap structure by the
first order transition at TSDW, while those from the nodal region gradually
change into the SDW state. The selection rule for two-magnon scattering from
the stripe spin structure was obtained. Applying it to the two-magnon Raman
spectra it is found that the magnetic exchange interaction energies are not
presented by the short-range superexchange model, but the second derivative of
the total energy of the stripe spin structure with respect to the moment
directions. The selection rule and the peak energy are expressed by the
two-magnon scattering process in an insulator, but the large spectral weight
above twice the maximum spin wave energy is difficult to explain by the decayed
spin wave. It may be explained by the electronic scattering of itinerant
carriers with the magnetic self-energy in the localized spin picture or the

problem of theoretical ecology. In this article I analyze competition between
two phytoplankton species in a deep water column, where the distributions of
main resources (light and a limiting nutrient) have opposing gradients and
co-limitation by both resources causes a deep biomass maximum. Assuming that
the species have a trade-off in resource requirements and the water column is
weakly mixed, I apply the invasion threshold analysis (Ryabov and Blasius 2011)
to determine relations between environmental conditions and phytoplankton
composition. Although species deplete resources in the interior of the water
column, the resource levels at the bottom and surface remain high. As a result,
the slope of resources gradients becomes a new crucial factor which, rather
than the local resource values, determines the outcome of competition. The
value of resource gradients nonlinearly depend on the density of consumers.
This leads to complex relationships between environmental parameters and
species composition. In particular, it is shown that an increase of both the
incident light intensity or bottom nutrient concentrations favors the best
light competitors, while an increase of the turbulent mixing or background
turbidity favors the best nutrient competitors. These results might be
important for prediction of species composition in deep ocean.

initial state. In order to uniquely define the system dynamics, one has to
construct a representative statistical ensemble. From the principle of least
action it follows that the role of the evolution generator is played by a grand
Hamiltonian, but not merely by its energy part. A theorem is proved expressing
the commutators of field operators with operator products through variational
derivatives of these products. A consequence of this theorem is the equivalence
of the variational equations for field operators with the Heisenberg equations
for the latter. A finite quantum system cannot equilibrate in the strict sense.
But it can tend to a quasi-stationary state characterized by ergodic averages
and the appropriate representative ensemble depending on initial conditions.
Microcanonical ensemble, arising in the eigenstate thermalization, is just a
particular case of representative ensembles. Quasi-stationary representative

groups, white as background and black as foreground. Thresholding plays a major
in binarization of images. Thresholding can be categorized into global
thresholding and local thresholding. In images with uniform contrast
distribution of background and foreground like document images, global
thresholding is more appropriate. In degraded document images, where
considerable background noise or variation in contrast and illumination exists,
there exists many pixels that cannot be easily classified as foreground or
background. In such cases, binarization with local thresholding is more
appropriate. This paper describes a locally adaptive thresholding technique
that removes background by using local mean and mean deviation. Normally the
local mean computational time depends on the window size. Our technique uses
integral sum image as a prior processing to calculate local mean. It does not
involve calculations of standard deviations as in other local adaptive
techniques. This along with the fact that calculations of mean is independent
of window size speed up the process as compared to other local thresholding
techniques.

with probabilistic model checking by estimating properties from multiple
executions of a system and by giving results within confidence bounds. Rare
properties are often very important but pose a particular challenge for
simulation-based approaches, hence a key objective under these circumstances is
to reduce the number and length of simulations necessary to produce a given
level of confidence. Importance sampling is a well-established technique that
achieves this, however to maintain the advantages of statistical model checking
it is necessary to find good importance sampling distributions without
considering the entire state space.
  Motivated by the above, we present a simple algorithm that uses the notion of
cross-entropy to find the optimal parameters for an importance sampling
distribution. In contrast to previous work, our algorithm uses a low
dimensional vector of parameters to define this distribution and thus avoids
the often intractable explicit representation of a transition matrix. We show
that our parametrisation leads to a unique optimum and can produce many orders
of magnitude improvement in simulation efficiency. We demonstrate the efficacy
of our methodology by applying it to models from reliability engineering and
biochemistry.

the two leading jets only. Aiming at applying the method to the search for the

  to the equivalence between many-sorted clones and algebraic theories)",,,,,"math.CT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For single-sorted algebras, Fujiwara defined, through the concept of family
of basic mapping-formulas, a notion of morphism which generalizes the ordinary
notion of homomorphism between algebras and an equivalence relation, the
conjugation, on the families of basic mapping-formulas, which corresponds to
the relation of inner isomorphism for algebras. In this paper we extend the
theory of Fujiwara about morphisms to the many-sorted algebras, by defining the
concept of polyderivor between many-sorted signatures, which assigns to basic
sorts, words and to formal operations, families of derived terms, and under
which the standard signature morphisms, the basic mapping-formulas of Fujiwara,
and the derivors of Goguen-Thatcher-Wagner are subsumed. Then, by means of the
homomorphisms between B\'enabou algebras, which are the algebraic counterpart
of the finitary many-sorted algebraic theories of B\'enabou, we define the
composition of polyderivors from which we get a corresponding category,
isomorphic to the category of Kleisli for a monad on the standard category of
many-sorted signatures. Next, by defining the notion of transformation between
polyderivors, we endow the category of many-sorted signatures and polyderivors
with a structure of 2-category. From this we get a derived 2-category of
many-sorted specifications in which we prove the equivalence of the many-sorted
specifications of Hall and B\'enabou, and deduce the equivalence of the
categories of Hall and B\'enabou algebras. Besides, by defining corresponding
categories of generalized many-sorted terms, we prove that the realization of
these terms in the many-sorted algebras is invariant under polyderivors and
compatible with the transformations between polyderivors, and from this we get
an example, among others, of the new concept of 2-institution, itself an strict
generalization of that of institution by Goguen and Burstall.

angle neutron scattering measurements. Biological samples contain hydrogen
which is a strong incoherent scatterer thus creating an intrinsic source of
background that makes determination of the coherent scattering parameters
difficult in special situations. This can especially be true for the Q-range
from around 0.1-0.5 {\AA}-1 where improper knowledge of the background level
can lead to ambiguity in determination of the samples structure parameters.
Polarization analysis is a way of removing this ambiguity by allowing one to
distinguish the coherent from incoherent scattering, even when the coherent
scattering is only a small fraction of the total scattered intensity. 3He spin
filters are ideal for accomplishing this task because they permit the analysis
of large area and large divergence scattered neutron beams without adding to
detector background or changing the prorogation of the scatter neutron beam.
This rapid note describes a design for a new ultra compact SEOP based 3He
polarized that can be used for this application. This is a work in progress,
the magnetic system has been completed and tested. We are in the process of
constructing the mechanical components for online polarization, such as a

theory (DFT) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). Weak interaction
between graphene and the underlying gold surface leaves unperturbed Dirac cones
in the band-structure, but they can be shifted with respect to the Fermi level
of the whole system, which results in effective doping of graphene. DFT
calculations revealed that the interface is extremely sensitive to the
adsorption distance and to the structure of metal's surface, in particular
strong variation in doping can be attributed to the specific rearrangements of
substrate's atoms, such as the change in the crystallographic orientation,
relaxation or other modifications of the surface. On the other hand, STS
experiments have shown the presence of energetic heterogeneity in terms of the
changes in the local density of states (LDOS) measured at different places on
the sample. Randomly repeated regions of zero-doping and p-type doping have
been identified from parabolic shape characteristics and from well defined
Dirac points, respectively. The doping domains of graphene on gold seem to be
related to the presence of various types of the surface structure across the
sample. DFT simulations for graphene interacting with Au have shown large
differences in doping induced by considered structures of substrate, in
agreement with experimental findings. All these results demonstrate the
possibility of engineering the electronic properties of graphene, especially
tuning the doping across one flake which can be useful for applications of

with non-axisymmetric deformations. A network of interferometric detectors
(LIGO, Virgo and GEO600) is looking for these signals. They are predicted to be
very weak and retrievable only by integration over long observation times. One
of the standard methods of CW data analysis is the multi-detector F-statistic.
In a typical search, the F-statistic is computed over a range in frequency,
spin-down and sky position, and the candidates with highest F values are kept
for further analysis. However, this detection statistic is susceptible to a
class of noise artifacts, strong monochromatic lines in a single detector. By
assuming an extended noise model - standard Gaussian noise plus single-detector
lines - we can use a Bayesian odds ratio to derive a generalized detection
statistic, the line veto (LV-) statistic. In the absence of lines, it behaves
similarly to the F-statistic, but it is more robust against line artifacts. In
the past, ad-hoc post-processing vetoes have been implemented in searches to
remove these artifacts. Here we provide a systematic framework to develop and
benchmark this class of vetoes. We present our results from testing this
LV-statistic on simulated data.

HKZ-bases by J. Bloemer. The technique is based on the transference theorems
given by Banaszczyk which imply some necessary conditions on the coefficients
of the closest vectors with respect to a basis whose dual is HKZ reduced.
Recursively, starting with the last coefficient, intervals of length i can be
derived for the i-th coefficient of any closest vector. This leads to n!
candidates for closest vectors. In this paper we refine the necessary
conditions derived from the transference theorems, giving an exponential
reduction of the number of candidates. The improvement is due to the fact that
the lengths of the intervals are not independent. In the original algorithm the
candidates for a coefficient pair (a_i,a_{i+1}) correspond to the integer
points in a rectangle of volume i(i+1). In our analysis we show that the
candidates for (a_i,a_{i+1}) in fact lie in an ellipse with transverse and
conjugate diameter i+1, respectively i. This reduces the overall number of
points to be enumerated by an exponential factor of about 0.886^n. We further
show how a choice of the coefficients (a_n,...,a_{i+1}) influences the interval
from which a_i can be chosen. Numerical computations show that these
considerations allow to bound the number of points to be enumerated by n^{0.75
n} for 10 <= n <= 2000. Under the assumption that the Gaussian heuristic for
the length of the shortest nonzero vector in a lattice is tight, this number

raison-d'etre of the LHC. Flavor questions, it would seem, are of minor
relevance for this quest, apart from their role in constraining the possible
structure of EWSB physics. In this short review article, we outline, using
flavor-dependent sleptons as an example, how flavor can affect both searches
for supersymmetry, and future measurements aimed at understanding the nature of
any new discoveries. If the production cross-sections for supersymmetry are
relatively low, as indicated by the fact that it has not revealed itself yet in
standard searches, the usual assumptions about the superpartner spectra need
re-thinking. Furthermore, one must consider more intricate searches, such as
lepton-based searches, which could be susceptible to flavor effects. We start
by reviewing the flavor structure of existing frameworks for mediating
supersymmetry breaking, emphasizing flavor-dependent models proposed recently.
We use the kinematic endpoints of invariant mass distributions to demonstrate
how flavor dependence can impact both searches for supersymmetry and the
Inverse Problem. We also discuss methods for measuring small-mass splittings
and mixings at the LHC, both in models with a neutralino LSP and in models with
a charged slepton (N)LSP.

of galaxies. Large amounts of gas, dust, and stars cluster in the galaxy
nucleus, and interactions between this ambient material and the jet base should
be frequent, having dynamical as well as radiative consequences. This work
studies the dynamical interaction of an obstacle, a clump of matter or the
atmosphere of an evolved star, with the innermost region of an extragalactic
jet. Jet mass-loading and the high-energy outcome of this interaction are
briefly discussed. Relativistic hydrodynamical simulations with axial symmetry
have been carried out for homogeneous and inhomogeneous obstacles inside a
relativistic jet. These obstacles may represent a medium inhomogeneity or the
disrupted atmosphere of a red giant star. Once inside the jet, an homogeneous
obstacle expands and gets disrupted after few dynamical timescales, whereas in
the inhomogeneous case, a solid core can smoothen the process, with the
obstacle mass-loss dominated by a dense and narrow tail pointing in the
direction of the jet. In either case, matter is expected to accelerate and
eventually get incorporated to the jet. Particles can be accelerated in the
interaction region, and produce variable gamma-rays in the ambient matter,
magnetic and photon fields. The presence of matter clumps or red giants into
the base of an extragalactic jet likely implies significant jet mass-loading
and slowing down. Fast flare-like gamma-ray events, and some level of
persistent emission, are expected due to these interactions.

clouds in stellar nebulas and Bose-Einstein condensates. Here we show the first
absorption imaging of a single atom isolated in vacuum. The optical properties
of atoms are thoroughly understood, so a single atom is an ideal system for
testing the limits of absorption imaging. A single atomic ion was confined in
an RF Paul trap and the absorption imaged at near wavelength resolution with a
phase Fresnel lens. The observed image contrast of 3.1(3)% is the maximum
theoretically allowed for the imaging resolution of our setup. The absorption
of photons by single atoms is of immediate interest for quantum information
processing (QIP). Our results also point out new opportunities in imaging of
light-sensitive samples both in the optical and x-ray regimes.

homopolar and intervalley longitudinal optical phonons given by 4.1 x 10^8

homopolar mode which is likely to occur in top-gated samples, boosts the
mobility with 70 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1 and can be observed as a decrease in the

been extensively tested in this wavelength range. In a comparison of the
predictions of several recent population synthesis models, the integrated
colors are found to cover approximately the same range but to disagree in
detail, for example on the effects of metallicity. To test against
observational data, globular clusters are used as the closest objects to
idealized groups of stars with a single age and single metallicity. Using
recent mass estimates, we have compiled a sample of massive, old globular
clusters in M31 which contain enough stars to guard against the stochastic
effects of small-number statistics, and measured their integrated colors in the
Spitzer/IRAC bands. Comparison of the cluster photometry in the IRAC bands with

reasonably well, except for a small (not statistically significant) offset in

bluer values than are observed. Model predictions of colors formed from the V
band and the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands are redder than the observed data at
high metallicities and we discuss several possible explanations. In agreement
with model predictions, V-[3.6] and V-[4.5] colors are found to have

Ergodic Theory. In a certain class of problems we consider questions in Ergodic
Transport which are generalizations of the ones in Ergodic Optimization.
  Another class of problems is the following: suppose $\sigma$ is the shift
acting on Bernoulli space $X=\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$, and, consider a fixed
continuous cost function $c:X \times X\to \mathbb{R}$. Denote by $\Pi$ the set
of all Borel probabilities $\pi$ on $X\times X$, such that, both its $x$ and
$y$ marginal are $\sigma$-invariant probabilities. We are interested in the
optimal plan $\pi$ which minimizes $\int c d \pi$ among the probabilities on
$\Pi$.
  We show, among other things, the analogous Kantorovich Duality Theorem. We
also analyze uniqueness of the optimal plan under generic assumptions on $c$.
We investigate the existence of a dual pair of Lipschitz functions which
realizes the present dual Kantorovich problem under the assumption that the
cost is Lipschitz continuous. For continuous costs $c$ the corresponding
results in the Classical Transport Theory and in Ergodic Transport Theory can
be, eventually, different.
  We also consider the problem of approximating the optimal plan $\pi$ by
convex combinations of plans such that the support projects in periodic orbits.

threaded by a strong magnetic field. During the initial collapse phase
filaments are generated which fragment quickly and form several protostars.
Around these protostars Keplerian discs with typical sizes of up to 100 AU
build up in contrast to previous simulations neglecting turbulence. We examine
three mechanisms potentially responsible for lowering the magnetic braking
efficiency and therefore allowing for the formation of Keplerian discs.
Analysing the condensations in which the discs form, we show that the build-up
of Keplerian discs is neither caused by magnetic flux loss due to turbulent
reconnection nor by the misalignment of the magnetic field and the angular
momentum. It is rather a consequence of the turbulent surroundings of the disc
which exhibit no coherent rotation structure while strong local shear flows
carry large amounts of angular momentum. We suggest that the ""magnetic braking
catastrophe"", i.e. the formation of sub-Keplerian discs only, is an artefact of
the idealised non-turbulent initial conditions and that turbulence provides a
natural mechanism to circumvent this problem.

Assuming the light stops, the LHC gluino search implies that the degree of fine
tuning in both models is less than 2.5%. Taking the LHC hints for the SM-like
Higgs boson mass m_h\sim125 GeV seriously, we find that naturalness will favor
the NMSSM. We study the Higgs boson mass for several scenarios in the NMSSM:
(1) A large \lambda and the doublet-singlet Higgs boson mixing effect pushing
upward or pulling downward m_h. The former case can readily give the di-photon
excess of the Higgs boson decay whereas the latter case can not. However, we
point out that the former case has a new large fine-tuning related to strong
\lambda-RGE running effect and vacuum stability. (2) A small \lambda and the
mixing effect pushing m_h upward. Naturalness status becomes worse and no
significant di-photon excess can be obtained. In these scenarios, the lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP) as a dark matter candidate is strongly disfavored
by the XENON100 experiment. Even if the LSP can be a viable dark matter
candidate, there does exist fine-tuning. The above naturalness evaluation is
based on a high mediation scale for supersymmetry breaking, whereas for a low
mediation scale, fine-tuning can be improved by about one order.

interacting particles systems. This approach assumes that the inherent noise,
associated with the discreteness of the elementary constituents, may be
neglected when the number of particles $N$ is large. Accordingly, it fails
close to the extinction transition, when the amplitude of stochastic
fluctuations is comparable with the size of the population. Here we present a
general scaling theory of the transition regime for spatially extended systems.
Two fundamental models for out-of-equilibrium phase transitions are considered:
the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) that belongs to the directed
percolation equivalence class, and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
model belonging to the dynamic percolation class. Implementing the Ginzburg
criteria we show that the width of the fluctuation-dominated region scales like
$N^{-\kappa}$, where $N$ is the number of individuals per site and $\kappa =
2/(d_u-d)$, $d_u$ is the upper critical dimension. Other exponents that control
the approach to the deterministic limit are shown to depend on $\kappa$. The
theory is supported by the results of extensive numerical simulations for
systems of various dimensionalities.

viscoelastic fluid-like media with very large but finite macroscopic viscosity

the medium are characterized by a power-law viscoelastic memory kernel which
ultra slow decays in time on the time scale \tau of strong viscoelastic
correlations. The subdiffusive transport regime emerges transiently for t<\tau.
However, the transport becomes asymptotically normal for t>>\tau. It is shown
that even though transiently the mean displacement and the variance both scale
sublinearly, i.e. anomalously slow, in time, <\delta x(t)> ~ F t^\alpha,
<\delta x^2(t)> ~ t^\alpha, 0<\alpha<1, the mean displacement at each instant
of time is nevertheless always larger than one obtained for normal transport in
a purely viscous medium with the same macroscopic viscosity obtained in the
Markovian approximation. This can have profound implications for the
subdiffusive transport in biological cells as the notion of ""ultra-slowness""
can be misleading in the context of anomalous diffusion-limited transport and
reaction processes occurring on nano- and mesoscales.

relationships among entities and identifying malicious entities. A popular
