based on astronomical harmonics against all available general circulation
climate models (GCM) used by the IPCC (2007) to interpret the 20th century
global surface temperature. The proposed model assumes that the climate is
resonating with, or synchronized to a set of natural harmonics that have been
associated to the solar system planetary motion, mostly determined by Jupiter
and Saturn. We show that the GCMs fail to reproduce the major decadal and
multidecadal oscillations found in the global surface temperature record from
1850 to 2011. On the contrary, the proposed harmonic model is found to well
reconstruct the observed climate oscillations from 1850 to 2011, and it is able
to forecast the climate oscillations from 1950 to 2011 using the data covering
the period 1850-1950, and vice versa. The 9.1-year cycle is shown to be likely
related to a decadal Soli/Lunar tidal oscillation, while the 10-10.5, 20-21 and
60-62 year cycles are synchronous to solar and heliospheric planetary
oscillations. Finally, we show how the presence of these large natural cycles
can be used to correct the IPCC projected anthropogenic warming trend for the
21st century. By combining this corrected trend with the natural cycles, we
show that the temperature may not significantly increase during the next 30
years mostly because of the negative phase of the 60-year cycle. The same IPCC
projected anthropogenic emissions would imply a global warming by about 0.3-1.2
K by 2100, contrary to the IPCC 1.0-3.6 K projected warming. The results of
this paper reinforce previous claims that the relevant physical mechanisms that
explain the detected climatic cycles are still missing in the current GCMs and
that climate variations at the multidecadal scales are astronomically induced
and, in first approximation, can be forecast.

the hierarchy of correlation functions to describe a correlated lognormal

This explicitly demonstrates the little studied though known fact that the
correlation function hierarchy never provides a complete description of a
lognormal field, and that it fails to capture information in the non-linear
regime, where other simple observables are left totally unconstrained. We
discuss why perturbative, Edgeworth-like approaches to statistics in the
non-linear regime, common in cosmology, can never reproduce or predict that
effect, and why it is however generic for tailed fields, hinting at a breakdown
of the perturbation theory based on the field fluctuations. We make a rough but
successful quantitative connection to N-body simulations results, that showed
that the spectrum of the log-density field carries more information than the
spectrum of the field entering the non-linear regime.

discretization - in this case the entropy-based method CAIM (Class-Attribute
Interdependence Maximization) - was undertaken to evaluate the impact and
potential bias introduced into data mining performance metrics due to variation
in sample size as it impacts the discretization process. Of particular interest
was the effect of discretizing within cross-validation folds averse to outside
discretization folds. Previous publications have suggested that discretizing
externally can bias performance results; however, a thorough review of the
literature found no empirical evidence to support such an assertion. This
investigation involved construction of over 117,000 models on seven distinct
datasets from the UCI (University of California-Irvine) Machine Learning
Library and multiple modeling methods across a variety of configurations of
sample size and discretization, with each unique ""setup"" being independently
replicated ten times. The analysis revealed a significant optimistic bias as
sample sizes decreased and discretization was employed. The study also revealed
that there may be a relationship between the interaction that produces such
bias and the numbers and types of predictor attributes, extending the ""curse of
dimensionality"" concept from feature selection into the discretization realm.
Directions for further exploration are laid out, as well some general
guidelines about the proper application of discretization in light of these
results.

scattering at the Ir L3 edge has been used to determine that Sr3Ir2O7 is a
long-range ordered antiferromagnet below TN 230K with an ordering wavevector,
q=(1/2,1/2,0). The energy resonance at the L3 edge was found to be a factor of
~30 times larger than that at the L2. This remarkable effect has been seen in
the single layer compound Sr2IrO4 and has been linked to the observation of a
Jeff=1/2 spin-orbit insulator. Our result shows that despite the modified
electronic structure of the bilayer compound, caused by the larger bandwidth,
the effect of strong spin-orbit coupling on the resonant magnetic scattering
persists. Using the programme SARAh, we have determined that the magnetic order
consists of two domains with propagation vectors k1=(1/2,1/2,0) and
k2=(1/2,-1/2,0), respectively. A raster measurement of a focussed x-ray beam

process in protoplanetary disks. These disks are observed around stars with
different spectral types, and there are indications that the disks around lower
mass stars are significantly flatter, which could indicate that they settle and
evolve faster, or in a different way.
  We aim to test this assumption by modeling the median spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of three samples of protoplanetary disks: around Herbig
stars, T Tauri stars and brown dwarfs. We focus on the turbulent mixing
strength to avoid a strong observational bias from disk and stellar properties
that depend on stellar mass.
  We generated SEDs with the radiative transfer code MCMax, using a hydrostatic
disk structure and settling the dust in a self-consistent way with the
alpha-prescription to probe the turbulent mixing strength.
  We are able to fit all three samples with a disk with the same input
parameters, scaling the inner edge to the dust evaporation radius and disk mass
to millimeter photometry. The Herbig stars require a special treatment for the
inner rim regions, while the T-Tauri stars require viscous heating, and the
brown dwarfs lack a good estimate of the disk mass because only few millimeter
detections exist.
  We find that the turbulent mixing strength does not vary across the stellar
mass range for a fixed grain size distribution and gas-to-dust ratio. Regions
with the same temperature have a self-similar vertical structure independent of
stellar mass, but regions at the same distance from the central star appear
more settled in disks around lower mass stars. We find a relatively low
turbulent mixing strength of alpha = 10^(-4) for a standard grain size
distribution, but our results are also consistent with alpha = 0.01 for a grain
size distribution with fewer small grains or a lower gas-to-dust ratio.

nonzero elastic moduli. Regular isostatic networks have finite moduli in the
limit of large sizes. However, numerical simulations show that all elastic
moduli of geometrically disordered isostatic networks go to zero with system
size. This holds true for positional as well as for topological disorder. In
most cases, elastic moduli decrease as inverse power-laws of system size. On
directed isostatic networks, however, of which the square and cubic lattices
are particular cases, the decrease of the moduli is exponential with size. For
these, the observed elastic weakening can be quantitatively described in terms
of the multiplicative growth of stresses with system size, giving rise to bulk
and shear moduli of order exp{-bL}. The case of sphere packings, which only
accept compressive contact forces, is considered separately. It is argued that
these have a finite bulk modulus because of specific correlations in contact
disorder, introduced by the constraint of compressivity. We discuss why their
shear modulus, nevertheless, is again zero for large sizes. A quantitative
model is proposed that describes the numerically measured shear modulus, both
as a function of the loading angle and system size. In all cases, if a density
p>0 of overconstraints is present, as when a packing is deformed by
compression, or when a glass is outside its isostatic composition window, all
asymptotic moduli become finite. For square networks with periodic boundary
conditions, these are of order sqrt{p}. For directed networks, elastic moduli
are of order exp{-c/p}, indicating the existence of an ""isostatic length scale""

forefront of physics. Due to their unprecedented controllability, these systems
are ideally suited to explore new exotic states of matter, which is one of the
key driving elements of the condensed matter research. One such topic of
considerable importance is topological insulators, materials that are
insulating in the interior but conduct along the edges. Quantum Hall and its
close cousin Quantum Spin Hall states belong to the family of these exotic
states and are the subject of this chapter.

sample of globular clusters under different relaxation conditions, based on
their core relaxation time (as listed in available catalogs), by means of two
well-known families of spherical stellar dynamical models. Systems
characterized by shorter relaxation time scales are expected to be better
described by isotropic King models, while less relaxed systems might be
interpreted by means of non-truncated, radially-biased anisotropic f^(\nu)
models, originally designed to represent stellar systems produced by a violent
relaxation formation process and applied here for the first time to the study
of globular clusters. The comparison between dynamical models and observations
is performed by fitting simultaneously surface brightness and velocity
dispersion profiles. For each globular cluster, the best-fit model in each
family is identified, along with a full error analysis on the relevant
parameters. Detailed structural properties and mass-to-light ratios are also
explicitly derived. We find that King models usually offer a good
representation of the observed photometric profiles, but often lead to less
satisfactory fits to the kinematic profiles, independently of the relaxation
condition of the systems. For some less relaxed clusters, f^(\nu) models
provide a good description of both observed profiles. Some derived structural
characteristics, such as the total mass or the half-mass radius, turn out to be
significantly model-dependent. The analysis confirms that, to answer some
important dynamical questions that bear on the formation and evolution of
globular clusters, it would be highly desirable to acquire larger numbers of
accurate kinematic data-points, well distributed over the cluster field.

language of Weyl geometry. We develop the concept of Weyl frames and point out
that the new mathematical formalism may lead to different pictures of the same
gravitational phenomena. We show that in an arbitrary Weyl frame general
relativity, which takes the form of a scalar-tensor gravitational theory, is
invariant with respect to Weyl tranformations. A kew point in the development
of the formalism is to build an action that is manifestly invariant with
respect to Weyl transformations. When this action is expressed in terms of
Riemannian geometry we find that the theory has some similarities with
Brans-Dicke gravitational theory. In this scenario, the gravitational field is
not described by the metric tensor only, but by a combination of both the
metric and a geometrical scalar field. We illustrate this point by, firstly,
discussing the Newtonian limit in an arbitrary frame, and, secondly, by
examining how distinct geometrical and physical pictures of the same phenomena
may arise in different frames. To give an example, we discuss the gravitational
spectral shift as viewed in a general Weyl frame. We further explore the
analogy of general relativity with scalar-tensor theories and show how a known
Brans-Dicke vacuum solution may appear as a solution of general relativity
theory when reinterpreted in a particular Weyl frame. Finally, we show that the
so-called WIST gravity theories are mathematically equivalent to Brans-Dicke
theory when viewed in a particular frame.

half-quantum-angular-momentum vortex configuration with spatial rotational
symmetry and skyrmion-type spin texture. Upon increasing the interatomic
interaction beyond a threshold $g_{c}$, the ground state starts to involve
higher-order angular momentum components and thus breaks the rotational
symmetry. In the case of $g_{\uparrow\downarrow}<g$, the condensate becomes
unstable towards the superposition of two degenerate half-quantum vortex
states. Both instabilities (at $g>g_{c}$ and $g_{\uparrow\downarrow}<g$) can be
determined by solving the Bogoliubov equations for collective density
oscillations of the half-quantum vortex state, and by analyzing the softening
of mode frequencies. We present the phase diagram as functions of the
interatomic interactions and the spin-orbit coupling. In addition, we directly
simulate the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation to examine the dynamical
properties of the system. Finally, we investigate the stability of the

electrostatic fields obtained from the solution of the logical grid Poisson
equation are interpolated to the particle positions on the logical grid. This

consistency of set-valued dynamic risk measures. Set-valued risk measures
appear naturally when markets with transaction costs are considered and capital
requirements can be made in a basket of currencies or assets. Time consistency
of scalar risk measures can be generalized to set-valued risk measures in
different ways. The most intuitive generalization is called time consistency.
We will show that the equivalence between a recursive form of the risk measure
and time consistency, which is a central result in the scalar case, does not
hold in the set-valued framework. Instead, we propose an alternative
generalization, which we will call multi-portfolio time consistency and show in
the main result of the paper that this property is indeed equivalent to the
recursive form as well as to an additive property for the acceptance sets.
Multi-portfolio time consistency is a stronger property than time consistency.
In the scalar case, both notions coincide.

X-ray (HXR) sources detected by RHESSI during the impulsive phase of an X3.9
class solar flare on 2003 November 3, which simultaneously shows two intense
footpoint (FP) sources. A distinct loop top (LT) coronal source is detected up
to ~150 keV and a second (upper) coronal source up to ~80 keV. These photon
energies are much higher than commonly observed in coronal sources and pose
grave modeling challenges. The LT source in general appears higher in altitude
with increasing energy and exhibits a more limited motion compared to the
expansion of the thermal loop. The high energy LT source shows an impulsive
time profile and its nonthermal power law spectrum exhibits soft-hard-soft
evolution during the impulsive phase, similar to the FP sources. The upper
coronal source exhibits an opposite spatial gradient and a similar spectral
slope compared to the LT source. These properties are consistent with the model
of stochastic acceleration of electrons by plasma waves or turbulence. However,
the LT and FP spectral index difference (varying from ~0-1) is much smaller
than commonly measured and than that expected from a simple stochastic
acceleration model. Additional confinement or trapping mechanisms of high
energy electrons in the corona are required. Comprehensive modeling including
both kinetic effects and the macroscopic flare structure may shed light on this
behavior. These results highlight the importance of imaging spectroscopic
observations of the LT and FP sources up to high energies in understanding
electron acceleration in solar flares. Finally, we show that the electrons
producing the upper coronal HXR source may very likely be responsible for the
type III radio bursts at the decimetric/metric wavelength observed during the
impulsive phase of this flare.

demonstrate that this increased risk is unavoidable and intrinsic to noisy

worst-case risk. So we introduce a pointwise lower bound on the minimum
achievable risk as an alternative to the minimax criterion, and use this bound

outflow, is also responsible for the shock-excitation of the warm H2 gas. In
addition, the warm H2 gas does not share the kinematics of the ionized/neutral
gas. The mid-IR ionized gas lines are systematically broader than the H2 lines,
which are resolved by the IRS (with FWHM up to 900km/s) in 60% of the detected

shows that, contrary to the HI gas, the H2 gas is inefficiently coupled to the

that a high C/O ratio of greater than 0.8, or even 1.0, is relatively common.
Two published catalogs find C/O$>0.8$ in 25-30% of systems, and C/O$>1.0$ in
$\sim$~6-10%. It has been suggested that in protoplanetary disks with C/O$>0.8$
that the condensation pathways to refractory solids will differ from what
occurred in our solar system, where C/O$=0.55$. The carbon-rich disks are
calculated to make carbon-dominated rocky planets, rather than oxygen-dominated
ones. Here we suggest that the derived stellar C/O ratios are overestimated.
One constraint on the frequency of high C/O is the relative paucity of carbon
dwarfs stars ($10^{-3}-10^{-5}$) found in large samples of low mass stars. We
suggest reasons for this overestimation, including a high C/O ratio for the
solar atmosphere model used for differential abundance analysis, the treatment
of a Ni blend that affects the O abundance, and limitations of one-dimensional
LTE stellar atmosphere models. Furthermore, from the estimated errors on the
measured stellar C/O ratios, we find that the significance of the high C/O tail
is weakened, with a true measured fraction of C/O$>0.8$ in 10-15% of stars, and
C/O$>1.0$ in 1-5%, although these are still likely overestimates. We suggest
that infrared T-dwarf spectra could show how common high C/O is in the stellar
neighborhood, as the chemistry and spectra of such objects would differ
compared to those with solar-like abundances. While possible at C/O$>0.8$, we
expect that carbon-dominated rocky planets are rarer than others have
suggested.

this paper, a comprehensive set of model atmospheres for low-mass SNe IIb/Ib/Ic

SNe Ic, where He lines are not seen, can thus be addressed. The state of H and

The models are constructed to represent iso-energetic explosions of the same

established that BFS sampling fails, in most cases, to capture the
IN-component(s) of directed networks, a description of the effects of BFS
sampling on other topological properties are all but absent from the
literature. To systematically study the effects of sampling biases on directed
networks, we compare BFS sampling to random sampling on complete large-scale
directed networks. We present new results and a thorough analysis of the
topological properties of seven different complete directed networks (prior to
sampling), including three versions of Wikipedia, three different sources of
sampled World Wide Web data, and an Internet-based social network. We detail
the differences that sampling method and coverage can make to the structural
properties of sampled versions of these seven networks. Most notably, we find
that sampling method and coverage affect both the bow-tie structure, as well as
the number and structure of strongly connected components in sampled networks.
In addition, at low sampling coverage (i.e. less than 40%), the values of
average degree, variance of out-degree, degree auto-correlation, and link
reciprocity are overestimated by 30% or more in BFS-sampled networks, and only
attain values within 10% of the corresponding values in the complete networks

rethink what we know about the structure, function, and evolution of real-world

invoke a galileon scalar which mediates a long range force, but is screened by
the Vainshtein mechanism on small scales. In such theories, non-relativistic
stars carry the full scalar charge (proportional to their mass), while black
holes carry none. Thus, for a galaxy free-falling in some external
gravitational field, its central massive black hole is expected to lag behind
the stars. To look for this effect, and to distinguish it from other
astrophysical effects, one can correlate the gravitational pull from the
surrounding structure with the offset between the stellar center and the black
hole. The expected offset depends on the central density of the galaxy, and
ranges up to ~0.1 kpc for small galaxies. The observed offset in M87 cannot be
explained by this effect unless the scalar force is significantly stronger than
gravity. We also discuss the systematic offset of compact objects from the
galactic plane as another possible signature.

usually with the same end result: a community detection algorithm of some kind.
Recent research offers methods for combining the results of such algorithms
into timelines of community evolution. This paper investigates community
detection and tracking from the data fusion perspective. We avoid the kind of
hard calls made by traditional community detection algorithms in favor of
retaining as much uncertainty information as possible. This results in a method
for directly estimating the probabilities that pairs of nodes are in the same
community. We demonstrate that this method is accurate using the LFR testbed,
that it is fast on a number of standard network datasets, and that it is has a
variety of uses that complement those of standard, hard-call methods. Retaining
uncertainty information allows us to develop a Bayesian filter for tracking
communities. We derive equations for the full filter, and marginalize it to
produce a potentially practical version. Finally, we discuss closures for the
marginalized filter and the work that remains to develop this into a
principled, efficient method for tracking time-evolving communities on
time-evolving networks.

to objects whose Spitzer SEDs diverge from the expectations for a typical full
disk. Here we use irradiated accretion disk models to fit the SEDs of 15 such
disks in NGC 2068 and IC 348. One group has a ""dip"" in infrared emission while
the others' continuum emission decreases steadily at all wavelengths. We find
that the former have an inner disk hole or gap at intermediate radii in the
disk and we call these objects ""transitional"" and pre-transitional"" disks,
respectively. For the latter group, we can fit these SEDs with full disk models
and find that millimeter data are necessary to break the degeneracy between
dust settling and disk mass. We suggest the term ""transitional"" only be applied
to objects that display evidence for a radical change in the disk's radial
structure. Using this definition, we find that transitional and
pre-transitional disks tend to have lower mass accretion rates than full disks
and that transitional disks have lower accretion rates than pre-transitional
disks. These reduced accretion rates onto the star could be linked to forming
planets. Future observations of transitional and pre-transitional disks will
allow us to better quantify the signatures of planet formation in young disks.

the frequency dependent index of refraction of the interstellar media and so
appear as chirped signals when they reach earth. Searches for dispersed
impulses have been limited by false detections due to radio frequency
interference (RFI) and, in some cases, artifacts of the instrumentation. Many
authors have discussed techniques to excise or mitigate RFI in searches for
fast transients, but comparisons between different approaches are lacking. This
work develops RFI mitigation techniques for use in searches for dispersed
pulses, employing data recorded in a ""Fly's Eye"" mode of the Allen Telescope
Array as a test case. We gauge the performance of several RFI mitigation
techniques by adding dispersed signals to data containing RFI and comparing
false alarm rates at the observed signal-to-noise ratios of the added signals.
We find that Huber filtering is most effective at removing broadband
interferers, while frequency centering is most effective at removing narrow
frequency interferers. Neither of these methods is effective over a broad range
of interferers. A method that combines Huber filtering and adaptive
interference cancellation provides the lowest number of false positives over
the interferers considered here. The methods developed here have application to
other searches for dispersed pulses in incoherent spectra, especially those
involving multiple beam systems.

quarks has been considered as a substantial structure of color anti-triplet.
This is not only a mathematical simplification for dealing with baryons, but
also provides a physical picture where the diquark would behave as a whole
object. It is natural to ask whether such a structure is sufficiently stable
against external disturbance. The mass spectra of the ground states of the
scalar and axial-vector diquarks which are composed of two-light (L-L),
one-light-one-heavy (H-L) and two-heavy quarks (H-H) respectively have been
calculated in terms of the QCD sum rules. We suggest a criterion as the
quantitative standard for the stability of the diquark. It is the gap between
the masses of the diquark and $\sqrt{s_0}$ where $s_0$ is the threshold of the
excited states and continuity, namely the larger the gap is, the more stable
the diquark would be. In this work, we calculate the masses of the type H-H to
complete the series of the spectra of the ground state diquarks. However, as
the criterion being taken, we find that all the gaps for the various diquaks
are within a small range, especially the gap for the diquark with two heavy
quarks which is believed to be a stable structure, is slightly smaller than
that for other two types of diquarks, therefore we conclude that because of the
large theoretical uncertainty, we cannot use the numerical results obtained
with the QCD sum rules to assess the stability of diquarks, but need to invoke
other theoretical framework.

used to determine cosmological parameters. When using clusters for cosmology,
the crucial assumption is that they are relaxed. However, subarcminute
resolution Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect images compared with high resolution
X-ray images of some clusters show significant offsets between the two peaks.
We have carried out self-consistent N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of
merging galaxy clusters using FLASH to study these offsets quantitatively. We
have found that significant displacements result between the SZ and X-ray peaks
for large relative velocities for all masses used in our simulations as long as
the impact parameters were about 100-250 kpc. Our results suggest that the SZ
peak coincides with the peak in the pressure times the line-of-sight
characteristic length and not the pressure maximum (as it would for clusters in
equilibrium). The peak in the X-ray emission, as expected, coincides with the
density maximum of the main cluster. As a consequence, the morphology of the SZ
signal and therefore the offset between the SZ and X-ray peaks change with
viewing angle. As an application, we compare the morphologies of our simulated
images to observed SZ and X-ray images and mass surface densities derived from
weak lensing observations of the merging galaxy cluster CL0152-1357. We find
that a large relative velocity of 4800 km/s is necessary to explain these
observations. We conclude that an analysis of the morphologies of
multi-frequency observations of merging clusters can be used to put meaningful
constraints on the initial parameters of the progenitors.

line (so called P Cygni profile). 1.37 days after the discovery, H$\alpha$ line
shows a nearly flat-topped profile in contrast to the previous day. From our

the brightness in each color band.

of real planar algebraic curves. It provides a geometric-topological analysis
of the decomposition of the plane induced by a finite number of algebraic
curves in terms of a cylindrical algebraic decomposition. From a high-level
perspective, the overall method splits into two main subroutines, namely an
algorithm denoted Bisolve to isolate the real solutions of a zero-dimensional
bivariate system, and an algorithm denoted GeoTop to analyze a single algebraic
curve.
  Compared to existing approaches based on elimination techniques, we
considerably improve the corresponding lifting steps in both subroutines. As a
result, generic position of the input system is never assumed, and thus our
algorithm never demands for any change of coordinates. In addition, we
significantly limit the types of involved exact operations, that is, we only
use resultant and gcd computations as purely symbolic operations. The latter
results are achieved by combining techniques from different fields such as
(modular) symbolic computation, numerical analysis and algebraic geometry.
  We have implemented our algorithms as prototypical contributions to the
C++-project CGAL. They exploit graphics hardware to expedite the symbolic
computations. We have also compared our implementation with the current
reference implementations, that is, LGP and Maple's Isolate for polynomial
system solving, and CGAL's bivariate algebraic kernel for analyses and
arrangement computations of algebraic curves. For various series of challenging
instances, our exhaustive experiments show that the new implementations

hardness (hardness ratio ($HR$), peak energy and spectral index) and duration
($T_{90}$) support the long/soft $-$ short/hard classification scheme for Fermi
GRBs. The $HR - T_{90}$ anti-correlation strongly depends upon the spectral
shape of GRBs and energy bands, and the bursts with the curved spectra in the
typical BATSE energy bands show a tighter anti-correlation than those with the
power-law spectra in the typical BAT energy bands. This might explain why the
$HR - T_{90}$ correlation is not evident for those GRB samples detected by
instruments like {\it Swift} with a narrower/softer energy bandpass. We also
analyze the intrinsic energy correlation for the GRBs with measured redshifts
and well defined peak energies. The current sample suggests
$E_{\mathrm{p,rest}}=2455\times (E_{\mathrm{iso}}/10^{52})^{0.59}$ for short
GRBs, significantly different from that for long GRBs. However, both the long

galaxies. To investigate this, we have Monte Carlo simulated the global spectra
of composite nebulae by a mix of spectra of individual components, based on
spectra of well-studied HII regions in nearby galaxies. We found that the Te
method results in an underestimated oxygen abundance (and hence in an
overestimated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio) if HII regions with different physical
properties contribute to the global spectrum of composite nebulae. This effect
is somewhat similar to the small-scale temperature fluctuations in HII regions
discussed by Peimbert. Our work thus suggests that the high Te-based N/O
abundances ratios found in SDSS galaxies may not be real. However, such an
effect is not expected to be present in dwarf galaxies since they have
generally an uniform chemical composition. The ON and NS calibrations give O

Thesis, 140 pages, examined August 2011, conferred January 2012",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been known for some time that warped extra dimensions offer a
potential explanation of the large hierarchy that exists between the
electroweak scale and the Planck scale. The majority of this work has focused
on a five dimensional slice of AdS space. This thesis attempts to address the
question, what possible spaces offer phenomenologically viable resolutions to
this gauge hierarchy problem. In order for a space to offer a potential
resolution to the hierarchy problem two conditions must be met: Firstly one
should be able to demonstrate that the space can be stabilised such that a
small effective electroweak scale (or large effective Planck scale) can be
obtained. Secondly one must demonstrate that the space allows for a Kaluza
Klein (KK) scale that is small enough such that one does not reintroduce a
hierarchy in the effective theory. Here we focus on the second condition and
examine the constraints, on the KK scale, coming from corrections to
electroweak observables and flavour physics which arise when gauge fields
propagate in an additional dimension. We study a large class of possible spaces
of different geometries and dimensionalities. In five dimensions it is found
that such constraints are generically large. In more than five dimensions it is
found that a significant proportion of such spaces suffer from either a high
density of KK modes or alternatively strongly coupled KK fields. The latter
would not offer viable resolutions to the hierarchy problem. Models in which
the Higgs propagates in the bulk are also studied, in the context of models
with a `soft wall' and it is found these have significantly reduced constraints
from flavour physics as well as a notion of a minimum fermion mass.

  Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 1333-1337",,,,"physics.comp-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ni coarsening in Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) solid oxide fuel cell
anodes is considered a major reason for anode degradation. We present a
predictive, quantative modeling framework based on the phase-field approach to
systematically examine coarsening kinetics in such anodes. The initial
structures for simulations are experimentally acquired functional layers of
anodes. Sample size effects and error analysis of contact angles are examined.
Three phase boundary (TPB) lengths and Ni surface areas are quantatively
identified on the basis of the active, dead-end, and isolated phase clusters
throughout coarsening. Tortuosity evolution of the pores is also investigated.
We find that phase clusters with larger characteristic length evolve slower
than those with smaller length scales. As a result, coarsening has small
positive effects on transport, and impacts less on the active Ni surface area
than the total counter part. TPBs, however, are found to be sensitive to local
morphological features and are only indirectly correlated to the evolution
kinetics of the Ni phase.

  of Physics",,"10.1088/1367-2630/14/5/055018",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  [Abridged] We present a comparison between weak-lensing (WL) and X-ray mass
estimates of a sample of numerically simulated clusters. The sample consists on
the 20 most massive objects at redshift z=0.25 and Mvir > 5 x 10^{14} Msun
h^{-1}. They were found in a cosmological simulation of volume 1 h^{-3} Gpc^3,
evolved in the framework of a WMAP-7 normalized cosmology. Each cluster has
been resimulated at higher resolution and with more complex gas physics. We
processed it thought Skylens and X-MAS to generate optical and X-ray mock
observations along three orthogonal projections. The optical simulations
include lensing effects on background sources. Standard observational tools and
methods of analysis are used to recover the mass profiles of each cluster
projection from the mock catalogues. Given the size of our sample, we could
also investigate the dependence of the results on cluster morphology,
environment, temperature inhomogeneity, and mass. We confirm previous results
showing that WL masses obtained from the fit of the cluster tangential shear
profiles with NFW functionals are biased low by ~ 5-10% with a large scatter
(~10-25%). We show that scatter could be reduced by optimally selecting
clusters either having regular morphology or living in substructure-poor
environment. The X-ray masses are biased low by a large amount (~25-35%),
evidencing the presence of both non-thermal sources of pressure in the ICM and
temperature inhomogeneity, but they show a significantly lower scatter than
weak-lensing-derived masses. The X-ray mass bias grows from the inner to the
outer regions of the clusters. We find that both biases are weakly correlated
with the third-order power ratio, while a stronger correlation exists with the
centroid shift. Finally, the X-ray bias is strongly connected with temperature
inhomogeneities.

Large parts are expository and may hopefully serve as a very incomplete
introduction to Teichmueller disks and curves, the moduli space of abelian
differentials with its SL2(R)-operation and variations of Hodge structure.

convergence speed of the segmentation process. However, to achieve this aim, it
causes the force constructed from the heat diffusion model unable to indicate
the object boundaries accurately. The image force based on electrostatic field
model can perform an exact shape recovery. First, this study introduces a
fusion scheme of these two image forces, which is capable of extracting the
object boundary with high precision and fast speed. Until now, there is no
satisfied analysis about the relationship between Snakes and Geometric Active
Contours (GAC). The second contribution of this study addresses that the GAC
model can be deduced directly from Snakes model. It proves that each term in
GAC and Snakes is correspondent and has similar function. However, the two
models are expressed using different mathematics. Further, since losing the
ability of rotating the contour, adoption of level sets can limits the usage of
GAC in some circumstances.
