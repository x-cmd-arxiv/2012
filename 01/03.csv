is revised in order to model the outflows of late-type O dwarfs that exhibit
the weak-wind phenomenon. With the theory's standard parameters for a generic
weak-wind star, the ambient gas is heated to coronal temperatures ~ 3 x 10^{6}K
at radii > 1.4 R, with cool radiativly-driven gas being then confined to dense
clumps with filling factor ~ 0.02. Radiative driving ceases at radius ~ 2.1R
when the clumps are finally destroyed by heat conduction from the coronal gas.
Thereafter, the outflow is a pure coronal wind, which cools and decelerates
reaching infinity with terminal velocity ~ 980$ km/ s.

Electronic Journal of Combinatorics. 17 (1) (2010), R174",,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A set without tangents in $\PG(2,q)$ is a set of points S such that no line
meets S in exactly one point. An exterior set of a conic $\mathcal{C}$ is a set
of points $\E$ such that all secant lines of $\E$ are external lines of
$\mathcal{C}$. In this paper, we first recall some known examples of sets
without tangents and describe them in terms of determined directions of an
affine pointset. We show that the smallest sets without tangents in $\PG(2,5)$
are (up to projective equivalence) of two different types. We generalise the
non-trivial type by giving an explicit construction of a set without tangents
in $\PG(2,q)$, $q=p^h$, $p>2$ prime, of size $q(q-1)/2-r(q+1)/2$, for all
$0\leq r\leq (q-5)/2$. After that, a different description of the same set in
$\PG(2,5)$, using exterior sets of a conic, is given and we investigate in
which ways a set of exterior points on an external line $L$ of a conic in
$\PG(2,q)$ can be extended with an extra point $Q$ to a larger exterior set of
$\mathcal{C}$. It turns out that if $q=3$ mod 4, $Q$ has to lie on $L$, whereas
if $q=1$ mod 4, there is a unique point $Q$ not on $L$.

There are two fundamental barriers to our ability to computationally understand
the long-term behavior of a dynamical system that describes a natural process.
The first one is unaccounted-for errors, which may make the system
unpredictable beyond a very limited time horizon. This is especially true for
chaotic systems, where a small change in the initial conditions may cause a
dramatic shift in the trajectories. The second one is Turing-completeness. By
the undecidability of the Halting Problem, the long-term prospects of a system
that can simulate a Turing Machine cannot be determined computationally.
  We investigate the interplay between these two forces -- unaccounted-for
errors and Turing-completeness. We show that the introduction of even a small
amount of noise into a dynamical system is sufficient to ""destroy""
Turing-completeness, and to make the system's long-term behavior
computationally predictable. On a more technical level, we deal with long-term
statistical properties of dynamical systems, as described by invariant
measures. We show that while there are simple dynamical systems for which the
invariant measures are non-computable, perturbing such systems makes the
invariant measures efficiently computable. Thus, noise that makes the short
term behavior of the system harder to predict, may make its long term
statistical behavior computationally tractable. We also obtain some insight
into the computational complexity of predicting systems affected by random
noise.

over general countable groups from the symbolic and topological perspectives.
We study free subflows (subflows in which every point has trivial stabilizer),
minimal subflows, disjointness of subflows, the problem of classifying subflows
up to topological conjugacy, and the differences in dynamical behavior between
pairs of points which disagree on finitely many coordinates. We call a point
hyper aperiodic if the closure of its orbit is a free subflow and we call it
minimal if the closure of its orbit is a minimal subflow.
  We prove that the set of all (minimal) hyper aperiodic points is always dense
but also meager and null. By employing notions and ideas from descriptive set
theory, we study the complexity of the sets of hyper aperiodic points and of
minimal points and completely determine their descriptive complexity. In doing
this we introduce a new notion of countable flecc groups and study their
properties. We obtain a dichotomy for the complexity of classifying free
subflows up to topological conjugacy. For locally finite groups the topological
conjugacy relation for all (free) subflows is hyperfinite and nonsmooth. For
nonlocally finite groups the relation is Borel bireducible with the universal
countable Borel equivalence relation.
  A primary focus of the paper is to develop constructive methods for the
notions studied. To construct hyper aperiodic points, a fundamental method of
construction of multi-layer marker structures is developed with great
generality. Variations of the fundamental method are used in many proofs in the
paper, and we expect them to be useful more broadly in geometric group theory.
As a special case of such marker structures, we study the notion of ccc groups

locally finite groups and for free products.

seesaw mechanism for small neutrino masses can also provide slow roll
inflection point inflation along a flat direction associated with a gauge
invariant combination of the Higgs, slepton and right handed sneutrino
superfields. Inflationary parameters are related to the Majorana and Dirac
couplings responsible for neutrino masses with the scale of inflation set by a
right-handed neutrino mass $M_{\nu^c} \sim 10^6-10^{12}$ GeV. Tuning of the
neutrino Dirac and Majorana superpotential couplings and soft Susy breaking
parameters is required to enforce flatness of the inflationary potential. In
contrast to previous inflection point inflation models the cubic term is
dominantly derived from superpotential couplings rather than soft A-terms. Thus
since $M_{\nu^c}>>M_{Susy}$ the tuning condition is almost independent of the
soft supersymmetry breaking parameters and therefore more stable. The required
fine tuning is also less stringent than for Minimal SUSY Standard Model (MSSM)
inflation or Dirac neutrino 'A-term"" inflation scenarios due to the much larger
value of the inflaton mass. Reheating proceeds via `instant preheating' which
rapidly dumps all the inflaton energy into a MSSM mode radiation bath giving a
high reheat temperature $T_{rh} \approx M_{\nu^c}^{3/4}\, 10^{6}$ GeV $\sim
10^{11}- 10^{15} $ GeV.
  Thus our scenario requires large gravitino mass $> 50 $ TeV to avoid a
gravitino problem. The `instant preheating' and Higgs component of the inflaton
also imply a `non-thermal' contribution to Leptogenesis due to facilitated
production of right handed neutrinos during inflaton decay. We derive the
tuning conditions for the scenario to work in the realistic New Minimal
Supersymmetric SO(10) GUT and show that they can be satisfied by realistic
fits.

light results from the competition between dynamic localization and effective
dimension increase, and shows non-monotonic behavior as a function of driving
amplitude. On the other hand, the shape of conductance distribution displays
crossover phenomena in the intermediate disorder strength; the application of
light dramatically changes the distribution from log-normal to normal
distributions. Furthermore, we propose that conductance of disordered systems
can be controlled by engineering the shape, frequency and amplitude of light.
Change of the shape of driving field controls the time-reversals symmetry and
the disordered system shows analogous behavior as negative magneto-resistance
known in static weak localization. A small change of frequency and amplitude of

explore models which extend the EPRL model for quantum gravity by coupling it
to a bosonic quantum field of representations of A(4). This coupling is

negative surface energy density for the shell sitting at the throat. We study a
gauge field subsystem which is of a special non-linear form containing a
square-root of the Maxwell term and which previously has been shown to produce
a QCD-like confining gauge field dynamics in flat space-time. The condition of
finite energy of the system or asymptotic flatness on one side of the horned
particle implies that the charged object sitting at the throat expels all the
flux it produces into the other side of the horned particle, which turns out to
be of a ""tube-like"" nature. An outside observer in the asymptotically flat
universe detects, therefore, apparently neutral object. The hiding of the
electric flux behind the tube-like region of a horned particle is the only
possible way that a truly charged particle can still be of finite energy, in a
theory that in flat space describes confinement. This points to the physical
relevance of such solutions, even though there is the need of negative energy
density at the throat of the horned particle, which can be of quantum

coefficient of restitution. All our apex-dropping distributions for any type of
bead (glass, stainless steel, zirconium) showed universality by scaling onto a
common curve with {\tau} = 1.5 and {\sigma} = 1.0, where 1/{\sigma} is the
power of the tuning parameter. From independent calculations using the moments
of the distribution, we find values for {\tau} = 1.6 \pm 0.1 and {\sigma} =
0.91 \pm 0.15. When beads were dropped across the surface of the pile instead
of solely on the apex, then the system also moved from the critical point and
again the avalanche size distributions fell on a common curve when scaled
similarly using the same values of {\tau} and {\sigma}. We also observed that
an hcp structure on the base of the pile caused an emergent structure in the
pile that had six faces with some fcc or hcp structure.

two distinct classical states of the phases with different persistent currents

coupling energy EJ of the junctions is larger than the charging energy EC =

process is exponentially small in the ratio EJ/EC. At given magnetic flux each
QPS can be described as the tunneling of the phase difference of a single
junction of almost 2pi, accompanied by a small harmonic displacement of the
phase difference of the other N-1 junctions. As a consequence the total QPS
amplitude nu is a global property of the ring. Here we study the dependence of
nu on the ring size N taking into account the effect of a finite capacitance C0
to ground which leads to the appearance of low-frequency dispersive modes.
Josephson and charging effects compete and lead to a nonmonotonic dependence of
the ring critical current on N. For N=infty, the system converges either
towards a superconducting or an insulating state, depending on the ratio

answer: ""Looking into a mirror can one get entangled with one's image?"" This is
not a frivolous question; rather, it bears on the effect of boundaries on the
behavior of quantum entanglement between a harmonic oscillator and a quantum
field, a basic problem of interest in proposed mirror-field superposition and
related experiments in macroscopic quantum phenomena, as well as atomic
fluctuation forces near a conducting surface.
  The object's internal degree of freedom is modeled by a harmonic oscillator
and the presence of a perfectly reflecting mirror enforces the Dirichlet
boundary conditions on the quantum field, restricting the latter to a half
space. By assuming a bilinear oscillator-field interaction, we derive a coupled
set of equations for the oscillator's and the field's Heisenberg operators. The
former can be cast in the form of a quantum Langevin equation, where the
dissipation and noise kernels respectively correspond to the retarded and
Hadamard functions of the free quantum field in half space.
  We use the linear entropy as measures of entanglement between the oscillator
and the quantum field under mirror reflection, then solve the early-time
oscillator-field entanglement dynamics and compare it with that between two
inertial oscillators in free space. At late times when the combined system is
in a stationary state, we obtain exact expressions for the oscillator's
covariance matrix and show that the oscillator-field entanglement decreases as
the oscillator moves closer to the mirror. We explain this behavior
qualitatively with the help of a mirror image and provide an answer to the
question raised above. We also compare this situation with the case of two real
oscillators and explain the differences.

Rashba spin-orbit coupling $\lambda_R$ and exchange field $M$. Based on a
continuum model at valley $K$ or $K'$, we show that there exist two distinct
physical origins of QAH effect at two different limits. For $M/\lambda_R\gg1$,
the quantization of Hall conductance in the absence of Landau-level
quantization can be regarded as a summation of the topological charges carried
by Skyrmions from real spin textures and Merons from \emph{AB} sublattice
pseudo-spin textures; while for $\lambda_R/M\gg1$, the four-band low-energy
model Hamiltonian is reduced to a two-band extended Haldane's model, giving
rise to a nonzero Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$ at either $K$ or $K'$. In the
presence of staggered \emph{AB} sublattice potential $U$, a topological phase
transition occurs at $U=M$ from a QAH phase to a quantum valley-Hall phase. We
further find that the band gap responses at $K$ and $K'$ are different when
$\lambda_R$, $M$, and $U$ are simultaneously considered. We also show that the
QAH phase is robust against weak intrinsic spin-orbit coupling $\lambda_{SO}$,
and it transitions a trivial phase when
$\lambda_{SO}>(\sqrt{M^2+\lambda^2_R}+M)/2$. Moreover, we use a tight-binding
model to reproduce the ab-initio method obtained band structures through doping
magnetic atoms on $3\times3$ and $4\times4$ supercells of graphene, and explain

link between dark matter halo mass (Mh), stellar mass (M*) and star-formation
rate (SFR) up to a redshift of 2. Our findings are five-fold. First, we find a
strong evolution of the relation between M* and SFR as a function of redshift
with an increase of sSFR = SFR/M* by a factor ~30 between z=0 and z= 2.3.
Second, we observe a decrease of sSFR with stellar mass. These results

formation is most efficient in dark matter halos with Mh~5x10^11 Msun, with
hints of an increase of this mass with redshift. Fourth, we find that SFR/Mh
increases by a factor ~15 between z = 0 and z = 2.3. Finally we find that the
SFR density is dominated by halo masses close to ~7x10^11 Msun at all redshift,
with a rapid decrease at lower and higher halo masses. Despite its simplicity,
our novel use of IR observations unveils some characteristic mass-scales

multivariate polynomials with rational coefficients and maximum degree $d$, we
construct a compact set $E\subset \R^n$ of Hausdorff dimension $n/d$ which does
not contain finite point configurations corresponding to the zero sets of the
given polynomials.
  Given a set $E\subset \R^n$, we study the angles determined by three points

Hausdorff dimension $n/2$ which does not contain the angle $\pi/2$. (This is
known to be sharp if $n$ is even.) We show that there is a compact set of
Hausdorff dimension $n/8$ which does not contain an angle in any given

amount of matter in a fixed comoving volume may vary from the time of
recombination to the present time due to energy transfer between the two
components. This implies that, in interacting dark energy models, the
fractional matter density estimated using the cosmic microwave background
assuming no interaction between dark matter and dark energy will in general be
shifted with respect to its true value. This may result in an incorrect
determination of the equation of state of dark energy if the interaction
between dark matter and dark energy is not properly accounted for, even if the
evolution of the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift is known with
arbitrary precision. In this paper we find an exact expression, as well as a
simple analytical approximation, for the evolution of the effective equation of
state of dark energy, assuming that the energy transfer rate between dark
matter and dark energy is described by a simple two-parameter model. We also
provide analytical examples where non-phantom interacting dark energy models

by accretion from the intergalactic medium and/or by various galactic feedback.
We herein present a systematical analysis of the Chandra observations of 53
nearby edge-on disk galaxies over a range of 3 orders of magnitude in SFR.
Various coronal properties, such as the luminosity, vertical/horizontal extent,
and other inferred parameters, are characterized for all the sample galaxies.
For galaxies with high enough counting statistics, we also examine the thermal
and chemical states of the coronal gas. Here we concentrate on the coronal
luminosity (Lx), estimated in 0.5-2keV and within 5 times the diffuse X-ray
vertical scale height. We find Lx strongly correlates with the SFR for the
whole sample. But the inclusion of Ia SNe in the total energy input (E_SN)
gives an even tighter correlation, which may be characterized with a linear
relation, Lx=0.5%E_SN, and with a dispersion of 0.45dex. Moreover, the coronal
radiation efficiency (\eta=Lx/E_SN) shows little correlation with either the
stellar mass or the gravitational mass (M_TF, inferred from the rotation
velocity), but is significantly correlated with their ratio (M_TF/M_*), which
may be expressed as a linear scaling relation \eta=0.35%M_TF/M_* for the entire
ranges of galaxy parameters. This joint scaling relation suggests that the
coronae are self-regulated by the combination of gravitational confinement and
feedback. But SN appears to be the primary heating source, because about half
of our galaxies are not massive enough to allow for the accretion to play a
major role. The commonly low \eta further suggests that the bulk of the SN
energy likely flows out into large-scale galactic halos for essentially all the
galaxies. Such ubiquitous outflows could have profound implications for
understanding the ecosystem, hence the evolution of galaxies.

$G_1$ in the first color, $G_2$ in the second color, or $G_3$ in the third

G_3)$, where $G_i \in \{K_3, K_3+e, K_4-e, K_4\}$. The minimal and maximal
combinations of $G_i$'s correspond to the classical Ramsey numbers $R_3(K_3)$
and $R_3(K_4)$, respectively, where $R_3(G) = R(G, G, G)$. Here, we focus on
the much less studied combinations between these two cases.
  Through computational and theoretical means we establish that $R(K_3, K_3,

  Ramsey numbers generalize to more colors, such as in the famous 4-color case
of $R_4(K_3)$, where monochromatic triangles are avoided. It is known that $51

the electrostatic repulsion between the two is considerably increased as
compared to the electrostatic repulsion between two bare charges in a

between the symmetrical parts of the system, was found to be dependent on the
magnitude of the charges and the separation between them. It was also found
that this increases reaches a steady state for separation greater than a

finite-state Markov chains based on the standard L_1 (variation distance)
mixing-time of the chain. Specifically, consider an ergodic Markov chain M and
a weight function f: [n] -> [0,1] on the state space [n] of M with mean mu =
E_{v <- pi}[f(v)], where pi is the stationary distribution of M. A t-step
random walk (v_1,...,v_t) on M starting from the stationary distribution pi has
expected total weight E[X] = mu t, where X = sum_{i=1}^t f(v_i). Let T be the
L_1 mixing-time of M. We show that the probability of X deviating from its mean
by a multiplicative factor of delta, i.e., Pr [ |X - mu t| >= delta mu t ], is
at most exp(-Omega(delta^2 mu t / T)) for 0 <= delta <= 1, and exp(-Omega(delta
mu t / T)) for delta > 1. In fact, the bounds hold even if the weight functions
f_i's for i in [t] are distinct, provided that all of them have the same mean
mu.
  We also obtain a simplified proof for the Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds based on
the spectral expansion lambda of M, which is the square root of the second
largest eigenvalue (in absolute value) of M tilde{M}, where tilde{M} is the
time-reversal Markov chain of M. We show that the probability Pr [ |X - mu t|
>= delta mu t ] is at most exp(-Omega(delta^2 (1-lambda) mu t)) for 0 <= delta
<= 1, and exp(-Omega(delta (1-lambda) mu t)) for delta > 1.
  Both of our results extend to continuous-time Markov chains, and to the case
where the walk starts from an arbitrary distribution x, at a price of a
multiplicative factor depending on the distribution x in the concentration
bounds.

8799, and the release of additional astrometric data following the discovery of
the fourth planet prompted us to examine the possibility of constraining these
two quantities by studying the long-term stability of this system at different
orbital inclinations and in its high-mass configuration (7-10-10-10 MJup). We
carried out ~1.5 million N-body integrations for different combinations of
orbital elements of the four planets. The most dynamically stable combinations
survived less than ~5 Myr at inclinations of 0{\deg} and 13{\deg}, and 41, 46,
and 31 Myr at 18{\deg}, 23{\deg}, and 30{\deg}, respectively. Given such short
lifetimes and the location of the system on the age-luminosity diagram for
low-mass objects, the most reasonable conclusion of our study is that the
planetary masses are less than 7-10-10-10 MJup and the system is quite young.
Two trends to note from our work are as follows. (1) In the most stable
systems, the higher the inclination, the more the coordinates for planets b and
c diverge from the oldest archival astrometric data (released after we
completed our N-body integrations), suggesting that either these planets are in
eccentric orbits or have lower orbital inclinations than that of planet d. (2)
The most stable systems place planet e closer to the central star than is
observed, supporting the conclusion that the planets are more massive and the
system is young. We present the details of our simulations and discuss the
implications of the results.

two-step dictionary learning algorithm. JBP differs from related convex
algorithms because it finds joint sparsity models with different atoms and
different coefficient values for intensity and depth. This is crucial for
recovering generative models where the same sparse underlying causes (3D
features) give rise to different signals (intensity and depth). We give a
theoretical bound for the sparse coefficient recovery error obtained by JBP,
and show experimentally that JBP is far superior to the state of the art Group
Lasso algorithm. When applied to the Middlebury depth-intensity database, our
learning algorithm converges to a set of related features, such as pairs of
depth and intensity edges or image textures and depth slants. Finally, we show
that the learned dictionary and JBP achieve the state of the art depth
inpainting performance on time-of-flight 3D data.

addressed to the problem of approach to the thermal equilibrium in an isolated

chain of weakly interacting harmonic oscillators. In the initial state,
macroscopic energy was supplied to one oscillator (atom) in the chain.
Subsequent evolution of the quantum state of the whole chain was determined due
to the model integrability. The main subject of interest was the time evolution
of the reduced density operators characterizing the quantum state of a
particular atom. On the short time-scale, the energy perturbation expands along
the chain with the velocity of the fastest phonon mode. On the long-time scale,
the single-atom density operators display strong fluctuations around the
canonical Gibbs distribution. These fluctuations are caused by the degeneracy
of the energy level differences (presence of resonances) in the model of
coupled harmonic oscillators. After lifting this degeneracy, fluctuations are
suppressed providing, that the reduced density operator of each atom in the
chain becomes very close to the Gibbs distribution at almost any time moment.

It is shown that
the free energy available in the form of sheared flows gives rise to unstable
electrostatic waves which accelerate the particles and heat them. The
electrostatic perturbations take place through two processes (a) by purely
growing sheared flow-driven instability and (b) by sheared flow-driven drift
waves. These processes occur throughout the corona and hence the self-heating
is very important in this plasma. These instabilities can give rise to local
electrostatic potentials $\varphi$ of the order of about 100 volts or less
within $3\times10^{-2}$ to a few seconds time if the initial perturbation is
assumed to be about one percent that is $\frac{e\varphi}{T_{e}}\simeq10^{-2}$.
The components of wave lengths in the direction perpendicular to external
magnetic field $\textbf{B}_{0}$ vary from about 10m to 1m. The purely growing
instability creates electrostatic fields by sheared flows even if the density
gradient does not exist whereas the density gradient is crucial for the
concurrence of drift wave instability. Subject headings: Sun: self-heating of

viewed as a biased tracer of the density field itself. A nonlinear
transformation also modifies the redshift space distortions in the same limit,
giving rise to a velocity bias. In models with primordial nongaussianity a
nonlinear transformation generates a scale dependent bias on large scales. We
derive analytic expressions for these for a general nonlinear transformation.
These biases can be expressed entirely in terms of the one point distribution
function (PDF) of the final field and the parameters of the transformation. Our
analysis allows one to devise nonlinear transformations with nearly arbitrary
bias properties, which can be used to increase the signal in the large scale
clustering limit. We apply the results to the ionizing equilibrium model of
Lyman-alpha forest, in which Lyman-alpha flux F is related to the density
perturbation delta via a nonlinear transformation. Velocity bias can be
expressed as an average over the Lyman-alpha flux PDF. At z=2.4 we predict the
velocity bias of -0.1, compared to the observed value of -0.13 +/- 0.03. Bias
and primordial nongaussianity bias depend on the parameters of the
transformation. Measurements of bias can thus be used to constrain these
parameters, and for reasonable values of the ionizing background intensity we
can match the predictions to observations. Matching to the observed values we
predict the ratio of primordial nongaussianity bias to bias to have the
opposite sign and lower magnitude than the corresponding values for the highly
biased galaxies, but this depends on the model parameters and can also vanish
or change the sign.

Therefore, we define when a feature can be {\em derived} from a set of

a challenging application with several issues in terms of effective use of

from quasar-like sources during cosmic reionization. We review the basic
algorithmic ingredients of C2-Ray before describing the changes implemented,
which include a treatment of the full on the spot (OTS) approximation,
secondary ionization, and multi-frequency photo-ionization and heating. We
performed a series of tests against equilibrium solutions from CLOUDY as well
as comparisons to the hydrogen only solutions by C2-Ray in the extensive code

approximation is more accurate than the simplified, uncoupled one. We find that
also with helium and a multi-frequency set up, long timesteps (up to ~10% of
the recombination time) still give accurate results for the ionization
fractions. On the other hand, accurate results for the temperature set strong
constrains on the timestep. The details of these constraints depend however on
the optical depth of the cells. We use the new version of the code to confirm
that the assumption made in many reionization simulations, namely that helium
is singly ionized everywhere were hydrogen is, is indeed valid when the sources

leeway of a scaled-down container before the full set of measured leeway
characteristics are compared with a semi-analytical model of immersed
containers. Our results are broadly consistent with the semi-analytical model,
but the model is found to be sensitive to choice of drag coefficient and makes
no estimate of the cross-wind leeway of containers. We extend the results from
the semi-analytical immersion model by extrapolating the observed leeway
divergence and estimates of the experimental uncertainty to various realistic
immersion levels. The sensitivity of these leeway estimates at different
immersion levels are tested using a stochastic trajectory model. Search areas
are found to be sensitive to the exact immersion levels, the choice of drag
coefficient and somewhat less sensitive to the inclusion of leeway divergence.
We further compare the search areas thus found with a range of trajectories
estimated using the semi-analytical model with only perturbations to the
immersion level. We find that the search areas calculated without estimates of
crosswind leeway and its uncertainty will grossly underestimate the rate of
expansion of the search areas. We recommend that stochastic trajectory models
of container drift should account for these uncertainties by generating search
areas for different immersion levels and with the uncertainties in crosswind

show that by using a non-quantum notion of separability a classical simulation

models.
  We first discuss on the construction of soft-wall models. We provide recipes
for constructing consistent models of this kind and address the issue of how
the length of the extra dimension can be stabilized. We also discuss on the
spectrum of fluctuations that arise in soft-wall models and we present a
concrete model where a large UV/IR hierarchy can be generated without any
fine-tuning.
  Next, we consider a two-brane setup to study how the electroweak symmetry can
be broken in warped models with generalized metrics when the Higgs boson
propagates in the bulk. We show how the bounds on the Kaluza-Klein (KK) scale
that arise from electroweak precision observables can be alleviated when the
Higgs is localized towards the infrared brane. We apply our results to a
minimal 5D extension of the SM and consider the AdS geometry and a deformation
of it inspired by soft-walls. We find that the deformed geometry greatly
reduces the bounds on the KK scale, to a point where the KK states can be
within the range of the LHC and the little hierarchy problem can be removed
without requiring the introduction of any custodial symmetry.
  Finally, we study the propagation of all SM fermions in the bulk of the extra
dimension, which we use to address the flavor puzzle of the SM. We find general
explicit expressions for oblique and non-oblique electroweak observables, as
well as flavor and CP violating operators. We apply these results to the RS
model and the model with deformed geometry, for which we perform a statistical
analysis departing from a random set of 5D Yukawa couplings. The comparison of
the predictions with the current experimental data exhibits an improvement of
the bounds in our model with respect to the RS model.

mechanics: those of realist interpretation, of classical properties and of
quantum measurement. Recently, we have identified some tacit assumptions that
lie at the roots of these problems. Thus, a realist interpretation is hindered
by the assumption that the only properties of quantum systems are values of
observables. If one simply postulates the properties to be objective that are
uniquely defined by preparation then all difficulties disappear. As for
classical properties, the wrong assumption is that there are arbitrarily sharp
classical trajectories. It turns out that fuzzy classical trajectories can be
obtained from quantum mechanics by taking the limit of high entropy. Finally,
standard quantum mechanics implies that any registration on a quantum system is
disturbed by all quantum systems of the same kind existing somewhere in the
universe. If one works out systematically how quantum mechanics must be
corrected so that there is no such disturbance, one finds a new interpretation
of von Neumann's ""first kind of dynamics"", and so a new way to a solution of
the quantum measurement problem. The present paper gives a very short review of
this work.

hook transmits the motor torque to the filament. We model it by discretizing
Kirchhoff's elastic-rod theory and develop a coarse-grained approach for
driving the helical filament by a motor torque. A rotating flagellum generates
a thrust force, which pushes the cell body forward and which increases with the
motor torque. We fix the rotating flagellum in space and show that it buckles
under the thrust force at a critical motor torque. Buckling becomes visible as
a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in the thrust force. A second buckling
transition occurs at an even higher motor torque. We attach the flagellum to a
spherical cell body and also observe the first buckling transition during
locomotion. By changing the size of the cell body, we vary the necessary thrust
force and thereby obtain a characteristic relation between the critical thrust
force and motor torque. We present a sophisticated analytical model for the
buckling transition based on a helical rod which quantitatively reproduces the
critical force-torque relation. Real values for motor torque, cell body size,

time to deal with non-linear regression. However, in some task, MLP's are too
powerful models and a small mean square error (MSE) may be more due to
overfitting than to actual modelling. If the noise of the regression model is
Gaussian, the overfitting of the model is totally determined by the behavior of
the likelihood ratio test statistic (LRTS), however in numerous cases the
assumption of normality of the noise is arbitrary if not false. In this paper,
we present an universal bound for the overfitting of such model under weak
assumptions, this bound is valid without Gaussian or identifiability
assumptions. The main application of this bound is to give a hint about

experimental and numerical approaches. A temporary network of 10 stations has
been deployed along and across the valley during two years; parallel various
experiments have been conducted, in particular ambient noise recording, and
seismic profiles with active sources for structure determination at the 10
sites. Classical observables have been measured for site amplification
evaluation, such as spectral ratios of horizontal or vertical motions between
site and reference stations using direct S waves and S coda, and spectral
ratios between horizontal and vertical (H/V) motions at single stations using
noise and S-coda records. Vertical shear-velocity profiles at the stations have
first been obtained from a joint inversion of Rayleigh wave dispersion curves
and ellipticity. They have subsequently been used to model the H/V spectral
ratios of noise data from synthetic seismograms, the H/V ratio of S-coda waves
based on equipartition theory, and the 3D seismic response of the basin using
the spectral element method. General good agreement is found between
simulations and observations. The 3D simulation reveals that topography has a
much lower contribution to site effects than sedimentary filling, except at the
narrow ridge crests. We find clear evidence of a basin edge effect, with an
increase of the amplitude of ground motion at some distance from the edge
inside the basin and a decrease immediately at the slope foot.

powerful applications to macroeconomics during the last decades. On the other
hand the theory of phase synchronization for weakly coupled complex oscillators
has been one of the leading theories in physics for many years with many
applications to different areas of science. For example, in neuroscience phase
synchronization is regarded as essential for functional coupling of different
brain regions. In an abstract sense both theories describe the dynamic
fluctuation around some equilibrium. In this paper, we point out that there
exists a very close connection between both theories. Apart from phase jumps, a
stochastic version of the Kuramoto equations can be approximated by a
cointegrated system of difference equations. As one consequence, the rich
theory on statistical inference for cointegrated systems can immediately be
applied for statistical inference on phase synchronization based on empirical
data. This includes tests for phase synchronization, tests for unidirectional
coupling and the identification of the equilibrium from data including phase
shifts. We study two examples on a unidirectionally coupled R\""ossler-Lorenz
system and on electrochemical oscillators. The methods from cointegration may
also be used to investigate phase synchronization in complex networks.
Conversely, there are many interesting results on phase synchronization which
may inspire new research on cointegration.

field for driven turbulence. A vertical stratification of the turbulence
intensity results in an alpha effect owing to the presence of horizontal shear.
Here we discuss the possibility of an experimental determination of the
components of the alpha tensor using both quasilinear theory and nonlinear
numerical simulations. For magnetic Prandtl numbers of the order of unity, we
find that in the high-conductivity limit the alpha effect in the direction of
the flow clearly exceeds the component in spanwise direction. In this limit,
alpha runs linearly with the magnetic Reynolds number Rm while in the
low-conductivity limit it runs with the product Rm*Re, where Re is the kinetic
Reynolds number so that for given Rm the alpha effect grows with decreasing
magnetic Prandtl number.
  For the small magnetic Prandtl numbers of liquid metals, a common value for
the horizontal elements of the alpha tensor appears, which makes it unimportant
whether the alpha effect is measured in the spanwise or streamwise directions.
The resulting effect should lead to an observable voltage in both directions of
about 0.5 mV for magnetic fields of 1 kgauss and velocity fluctuations of about
1 m/s in a channel of 50 cm height (independent of its width).

single-particle basis functions, which can in turn be expanded in a set of
auxiliary basis functions (ABFs). The construction of ABFs lies at the heart of
the RI technique, and here we propose a simple prescription for constructing
the ABFs which can be applied regardless of whether the underlying radial
functions have a specific analytical shape (e.g., Gaussian) or are numerically
tabulated. We demonstrate the accuracy of our RI implementation for Gaussian
and NAO basis functions, as well as the convergence behavior of our NAO basis
sets for the above-mentioned methods. Benchmark results are presented for the
ionization energies of 50 selected atoms and molecules from the G2 ion test set
as obtained with $GW$ and MP2 self-energy methods, and the G2-I atomization

works is presented. The construction indicates that it could be equivalent to
massless QCD. The case in which only quark condensate effects are retained is
discussed in more detail. Then, the appearing auxiliary fermion fields can be
integrated leading to a theory with the action of massless QCD, to which one
local and gauge invariant Lagrangian term for each quark flavour is added.
These terms are defined by two gluon and two quark fields, in a form curiously
not harming power counting renormalizability. The gluon self-energy is
evaluated in second order in the gauge coupling and all orders in the new quark
couplings, and the result became transversal as required by the gauge
invariance. The vacuum energy was calculated in the two loop approximation and
also became gauge parameter independent. The possibilities that higher loop
contributions to the vacuum energy allow the generation of a quark mass
hierarchy as a flavour symmetry breaking effect are discussed. However, the
decision on this issue needs the evaluation of more than two loop
contributions, in which more than one type of quark loops start appearing,
possibly leading to interference effects in the vacuum energy.

continually injects relativistic particles into the magnetosphere. Large active
magnetic loops around magnetars must be filled with outflowing particles that
interact with radiation via resonant scattering and spawn electron-positron
pairs. The outflow energy is processed into copious e+- until the plasma enters
outer parts of the loop where the magnetic field is reduced below 10^13 G. In
the outer zone, photons scattered by the outflow do not convert to e+- pairs
and the outflow radiates its energy away. The escaping radiation forms a
distinct hard X-ray peak in the magnetar spectrum. It has the following
features: (1) Its luminosity L=10^35-10^36 erg/s can easily exceed the thermal
luminosity from the magnetar surface. (2) Its spectrum extends from 10 keV to
the MeV band with a hard spectral slope, which depends on the object
inclination to the line of sight. (3) The anisotropic hard X-ray emission
exhibits strong pulsations as the magnetar spins. (4) The emission spectrum

the stability and the long-term secular evolution of self-consistent,
equilibrium, non-rotating, triaxial spheroidal galactic models. More
specifically, we consider Dehnen models built with the Schwarzschild method. We
show that short-term stability depends on the degree of velocity anisotropy
(radially anisotropic models are subject to rapid development of radial-orbit
instability). Long-term stability, on the other hand, depends mainly on the
properties of the potential, and in particular, on whether it admits a
substantial fraction of strongly chaotic orbits. We show that in the case of a
weak density cusp (gamma=1 Dehnen model) the N-body model is remarkably stable,
while the strong-cusp (gamma=2) model exhibits substantial evolution of shape
away from triaxiality, which we attribute to the effect of chaotic diffusion of
orbits. The different behaviour of these two cases originates from the
different phase space structure of the potential; in the weak-cusp case there
exist numerous resonant orbit families that impede chaotic diffusion. We also
find that it is hardly possible to affect the rate of this evolution by
altering the fraction of chaotic orbits in the Schwarzschild model, which is
explained by the fact that the chaotic properties of an orbit are not preserved
by the N-body evolution. There are, however, parameters in Schwarzschild
modelling that do affect the stability of an N-body model, so we discuss the
recipes how to build a `good' Schwarzschild model.

where baryons are described as non-topological solitons. By using the hedgehog
solution for the B = 1 states we construct three possible B = 2 configurations
to analyze the role of the relative orientation of the hedgehog quills in the
dynamics. The strong dependence of the intersoliton interaction on these
relative orientations reveals that studies of dense hadronic matter using this
model should take into account their implications.

diffusion of knowledge and to the technological evolution of society. Because
of this, knowledge creation, exchange and its subsequent transformation into
innovations for improved welfare and economic growth is briefly described from
a historical point of view. Next, three approaches are discussed for modeling
the diffusion of ideas in the areas of science and technology, through (i)
deterministic, (ii) stochastic, and (iii) statistical approaches. These are
illustrated through their corresponding population dynamics and epidemic models
relative to the spreading of ideas, knowledge and innovations. The
deterministic dynamical models are considered to be appropriate for analyzing
the evolution of large and small societal, scientific and technological systems
when the influence of fluctuations is insignificant. Stochastic models are
appropriate when the system of interest is small but when the fluctuations
become significant for its evolution. Finally statistical approaches and models
based on the laws and distributions of Lotka, Bradford, Yule, Zipf-Mandelbrot,
and others, provide much useful information for the analysis of the evolution
of systems in which development is closely connected to the process of idea
diffusion.

For example, how does the coupling to mobile charges modify the properties of a
spin liquid, and does the underlying frustration favor insulating or conducting
states? Supported by Monte Carlo simulations, our goal is in particular to
provide an analytical picture of the mechanisms involved. The models under
considerations exhibit Coulomb phases in two and three dimensions, where the
itinerant electrons are coupled to the localized spins via double exchange
interactions. Because of the Hund coupling, magnetic loops naturally emerge
from the Coulomb phase and serve as conducting channels for the mobile
electrons, leading to doping-dependent rearrangements of the loop ensemble in
order to minimize the electronic kinetic energy. At low electron density \rho,
the double exchange coupling mainly tends to segment the very long loops
winding around the system into smaller ones while it gradually lifts the
extensive degeneracy of the Coulomb phase with increasing \rho. For higher
doping, the results are strongly lattice dependent, displaying loop crystals
with a given loop length for some specific values of \rho, which can melt into
another loop crystal by varying \rho. Finally, we contrast this to the
qualitatively different behavior of analogous models on kagome or triangular
lattices.

prescribed subschemes of X provided these subschemes satisfy certain natural

subsets of projective schemes X over global fields. This capacity can be used
to generalize the converse part of the Fekete-Szeg\H{o} Theorem.

made out of two layers of dielectric elastomers is studied. The laminate is
pre-stretched by inducing a bias electric field perpendicular the the layers.
Incremental time-harmonic fields superimposed on the initial finite deformation
are considered next. Utilizing the Bloch-Floquet theorem along with the
transfer matrix method we determine the dispersion relation which relates the
incremental fields frequency and the phase velocity.
  Ranges of frequencies at which waves cannot propagate are identified whenever
the Bloch-parameter is complex. These band-gaps depend on the phases
properties, their volume fraction, and most importantly on the electric bias
field. Our analysis reveals how these band-gaps can be shifted and their width
can be modified by changing the bias electric field. This implies that by
controlling the electrostatic bias field desired frequencies can be filtered
out. Representative examples of laminates with different combinations of
commercially available dielectric elastomers are examined.

We found that mean value of circular polarization degree in intrinsic Josephson

additional transfer of particles over junction barrier occurring in multimode
