leakage of B-modes into the E-mode signal and vice versa, has been a
long-standing problem in weak gravitational lensing. At the two-point level
this problem was resolved by developing the so-called ring statistics, and
later the COSEBIs; however, extending these concepts to the three-point level
is far from trivial. Currently used methods to decompose three-point shear
correlation functions (3PCFs) into E- and B-modes require knowledge of the 3PCF
down to arbitrary small scales. This implies that the 3PCF needs to be modeled
on scales smaller than the minimum separation of 2 galaxies and subsequently
will be biased towards the model, or, in the absence of a model, the statistics
is affected by E/B-mode leakage (or mixing). In this paper we derive a new
third-order E/B-mode statistic that performs the decomposition using the 3PCF
only on a finite interval, and thereby is free of any E/B-mode leakage while at
the same time relying solely on information from the data. In addition, we
relate this third-order ring statistics to the convergence field, thereby
enabling a fast and convenient calculation of this statistic from numerical
simulations. We note that our new statistics should be applicable to
corresponding E/B-mode separation problems in the CMB polarization field.

considering a flat complex vector bundle over a compact Riemannian manifold,
endowed with a fiberwise nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form. The Riemmanian
metric and the bilinear form are used to define non-selfadjoint Laplacians
acting on vector-valued smooth forms under absolute and relative boundary
conditions. In the process to define the complex-valued analytic torsion, we
study spectral properties associated to these generalized Laplacians. As main
results, we obtain anomaly formulas for the complex-valued analytic torsion.
Our reasoning takes into account that the coefficients in the heat trace
asymptotic expansion associated to the boundary value problem under
consideration, are locally computable. The anomaly formulas for the
complex-valued Ray--Singer torsion are obtained by using the corresponding ones
for the Ray--Singer metric, obtained by Bruening and Ma on manifolds with
boundary, and an argument of analytic continuation. In odd dimensions, our
anomaly formulas are in accord with the corresponding results of Su, without
requiring the variations of the Riemannian metric and bilinear structures to be
supported in the interior of the manifold.

MAQRO has originally been proposed as a medium-sized fundamental-science space
mission for the 2010 call of Cosmic Vision. MAQRO unites two experiments:
DECIDE (DECoherence In Double-Slit Experiments) and CASE (Comparative
Acceleration Sensing Experiment). The main scientific objective of MAQRO, which
is addressed by the experiment DECIDE, is to test the predictions of quantum
theory for quantum superpositions of macroscopic objects containing more than
10e8 atoms. Under these conditions, deviations due to various suggested
alternative models to quantum theory would become visible. These models have
been suggested to harmonize the paradoxical quantum phenomena both with the
classical macroscopic world and with our notion of Minkowski space-time. The
second scientific objective of MAQRO, which is addressed by the experiment
CASE, is to demonstrate the performance of a novel type of inertial sensor
based on optically trapped microspheres. CASE is a technology demonstrator that
shows how the modular design of DECIDE allows to easily incorporate it with
other missions that have compatible requirements in terms of spacecraft and
orbit. CASE can, at the same time, serve as a test bench for the weak
equivalence principle, i.e., the universality of free fall with test-masses
differing in their mass by 7 orders of magnitude.

random numbers and is allowed to stop the sequence at any time, claiming a
reward equal to the most recent observation. The famous prophet inequality of
Krengel, Sucheston, and Garling asserts that a gambler who knows the
distribution of each random variable can achieve at least half as much reward,
in expectation, as a ""prophet"" who knows the sampled values of each random
variable and can choose the largest one. We generalize this result to the
setting in which the gambler and the prophet are allowed to make more than one
selection, subject to a matroid constraint. We show that the gambler can still
achieve at least half as much reward as the prophet; this result is the best
possible, since it is known that the ratio cannot be improved even in the
original prophet inequality, which corresponds to the special case of rank-one
matroids. Generalizing the result still further, we show that under an
intersection of p matroid constraints, the prophet's reward exceeds the
gambler's by a factor of at most O(p), and this factor is also tight.

stopping rules, these results also have applications to mechanism design. Our
results imply improved bounds on the ability of sequential posted-price

instantly decodable network coding (IDNC), in wireless multicast and broadcast
scenarios. We are interested in this class of network coding due to its
numerous benefits, such as low decoding delay, low coding and decoding
complexities and simple receiver requirements. We first extend the IDNC graph,
which represents all feasible IDNC coding opportunities, to efficiently operate
in both multicast and broadcast scenarios. We then formulate the minimum
completion delay problem for IDNC as a stochastic shortest path (SSP) problem.
Although finding the optimal policy using SSP is intractable, we use this
formulation to draw the theoretical guidelines for the policies that can
efficiently reduce the completion delay in IDNC. Based on these guidelines, we
design a maximum weight clique selection algorithm, which can efficiently
reduce the IDNC completion delay in polynomial time. We also design a quadratic
time heuristic clique selection algorithm, which can operate in real-time
applications. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms efficiently
reduce the IDNC completion delay compared to the random and maximum-rate
algorithms, and almost achieve the global optimal completion delay performance
over all network codes in broadcast scenarios.

is relevant, the cross sections for the interactions of hydrogen atoms with

collisional excitation by protons dominates over that by electrons.
Surprisingly, the hydrogen-proton cross sections at these velocities do not
exist for atomic levels of n >= 4, forcing researchers to utilize extrapolation
via inaccurate scaling laws. In this study, we present a faster and improved
algorithm for computing cross sections for the hydrogen-proton collisional
system, including excitation and charge transfer to the n >= 2 levels of the
hydrogen atom. We develop a code named BDSCx which directly solves the
Schrodinger equation with variable (but non-adaptive) resolution and utilizes a
hybrid spatial-Fourier grid. Our novel hybrid grid reduces the number of grid
points needed from ~4000 n^6 (for a ""brute force"", Cartesian grid) to ~2000 n^4

4 . We present (l,m)-resolved results for charge-transfer and excitation final
states for n = 2--4 and for projectile energies of 5--80 keV, as well as
fitting functions for the cross sections. The ability to accurately compute
proton-hydrogen cross sections to n = 4 allows us to calculate the Balmer

that the Balmer decrement starts to increase beyond its largely constant value

to gathering relevant information or to the success of modern businesses, the
question of rank-stability and choice of the damping factor (a parameter in the
algorithm) is clearly important. We investigate PR as a function of the damping
factor d on a network obtained from a domain of the World Wide Web, finding
that rank-reversal happens frequently over a broad range of PR (and of d). We
use three different correlation measures, Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall, to
study rank-reversal as d changes, and show that the correlation of PR vectors
drops rapidly as d changes from its frequently cited value, $d_0=0.85$.
Rank-reversal is also observed by measuring the Spearman and Kendall rank
correlation, which evaluate relative ranks rather than absolute PR.
Rank-reversal happens not only in directed networks containing rank-sinks but
also in a single strongly connected component, which by definition does not
contain any sinks. We relate rank-reversals to rank-pockets and bottlenecks in
the directed network structure. For the network studied, the relative rank is
more stable by our measures around $d=0.65$ than at $d=d_0$.

natural orthonormal frame, can always be decomposed into a canonical set of
transverse, longitudinal and Newton-Coulomb-type components, isotropic
influence of a cosmological constant, and contributions arising from specific
matter content of the universe. In particular, exact gravitational waves in
Einstein's theory always exhibit themselves via purely transverse effects with
D(D-3)/2 independent polarization states. To illustrate the utility of this
approach we study the family of pp-wave spacetimes in higher dimensions and
discuss specific measurable effects on a detector located in four spacetime

higher-dimensional gravitational waves observed in such physical subspace, need
not be tracefree.

black hole at the Galactic center), and we discuss how the ejection and capture
preference between unequal-mass binary members depends on which orbit they
approach the massive object. We show that the restricted three-body
approximation provides a simple and clear description of the dynamics. The
orbit of a binary with mass m around a massive object M should be almost
parabolic with an eccentricity |1-e| < (m/M)^{1/3} << 1 for a member to be
captured, while the other is ejected. Indeed, the energy change of the members
obtained for a parabolic orbit can be used to describe non-parabolic cases. If
a binary has an encounter velocity much larger than (M/m)^{1/3} times the
binary rotation velocity, it would be abruptly disrupted, and the energy change
at the encounter can be evaluated in a simple disruption model. We evaluate the
probability distributions for the ejection and capture of circular binary
members and for the final energies. In principle, for any hyperbolic (elliptic)
orbit, the heavier member has more chance to be ejected (captured), because it
carries a larger fraction of the orbital energy. However, if the orbital energy
is close to zero, the difference between the two members becomes small, and
there is practically no ejection and capture preference. The preference becomes
significant when the orbital energy is comparable to the typical energy change
at the encounter. We discuss its implications to hypervelocity stars and
irregular satellites around giant planets.

light scattering measurements in which we study both the rotational and

These measurements are accompanied by simultaneous microrheology and
macroscopic rheology experiments. We find that rotational diffusion of

decoupling of translational and orientational degrees of freedom finds its
origin in the dynamic heterogeneity since rotation and translation probe
different length scales in the sample. The macroscopic rheology experiments
show that the low frequency shear viscosity increases at a much faster rate

trace the dense gas we used the molecular species NH3, N2H+, HNC, HCO+, H13CO+,
HCN and H13CN, where some of them trace the more quiescent gas, while others
are sensitive to more dynamical processes. The selected cores have a wide
variety of morphological types and also show physical and chemical variations,
which may be associated to different evolutionary phases. We find evidence of
systematic motions in both starless and proto-stellar cores and we detect line
wings in many of the proto-stellar cores. Our observations probe linear
distances in the sources >~0.1pc, and are thus sensitive mainly to molecular
gas in the envelope of the cores. In this region we do find that, for example,
the radial profile of the N2H+(1-0) emission falls off more quickly than that
of C-bearing molecules such as HNC(1-0), HCO+(1-0) and HCN(1-0). We also
analyze the correlation between several physical and chemical parameters and
the dynamics of the cores. Depending on the assumptions made to estimate the
virial mass, we find that many starless cores have masses below the
self-gravitating threshold, whereas most of the proto-stellar cores have masses
which are near or above the self-gravitating critical value. An analysis of the
median properties of the starless and proto-stellar cores suggests that the

of multimode solutions expressible in terms of Riemann invariants, based on
links between two techniques, that of the symmetry reduction method and of the
generalized method of characteristics. A variant of the conditional symmetry
method for constructing this type of solution is proposed. A specific feature
of that approach is an algebraic-geometric point of view, which allows the
introduction of specific first-order side conditions consistent with the
original system of PDEs, leading to a generalization of the Riemann invariant
method for solving elliptic homogeneous systems of PDEs. A further
generalization of the Riemann invariants method to the case of inhomogeneous
systems, based on the introduction of specific rotation matrices, enables us to
weaken the integrability condition. It allows us to establish a connection
between the structure of the set of integral elements and the possibility of
constructing specific classes of simple mode solutions. These theoretical
considerations are illustrated by the examples of an ideal plastic flow in its
elliptic region and a system describing a nonlinear interaction of waves and
particles. Several new classes of solutions are obtained in explicit form,
including the general integral for the latter system of equations.

observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energy scan is related
to the turning off of deconfinement by testing the hypothesis that
hydrodynamics and parton coalescence always apply, but are obscured, at lower
energies, by variations in the widths of quark and anti-quark rapidity
distribution. We find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling
in elliptic flow. A lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the
absence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence. In a
coalescing partonic fluid, however, elliptic flow of anti-baryons should be the
greater than that of baryons, since antibaryons contain a greater admixture of
partons from the highly flowing midrapidity region. Intriguingly, purely
hadronic dynamics has a similar dependence of baryon-anti-baryons $v_2$ as
purely partonic dynamics, again because antibaryons tend to come from regions
where the deviation of the system from hydrodynamic behavior is at its
smallest. The opposite trend observed in experiment is therefore an indication
that we might be misunderstanding the origin of $v_2$. We finish by discussing
possible explanations of this, and suggest experimental measurements capable of
clarifying the situation.

far from equilibrium. A remarkable example in this last class is fluctuations

of the fluid, which happens to be a realization of a 1D diffusion where the
variance of the angular increments $\theta(t+\Delta t) - \theta(t)$ scales as
$\Delta t^{\nu}$, while the power spectral density of the rotation rate follows
a $1/f^{\alpha}$ scaling law. These scaling exponents are found to be $\alpha

nuclear spins are advantageous as quantum bits (qubits) due to their long

interactions and have weak polarisation. A coupled electron spin can be used to
polarise the nuclear spin and create fast single-qubit gates, however, the
permanent presence of electron spins is a source of nuclear decoherence. Here
we show how a transient electron spin, arising from the optically excited
triplet state of C60, can be used to hyperpolarise, manipulate and measure two
nearby nuclear spins. Implementing a scheme which uses the spinor nature of the
electron, we performed an entangling gate in hundreds of nanoseconds: five
orders of magnitude faster than the liquid-state J coupling. This approach can
be widely applied to systems comprising an electron spin coupled to multiple
nuclear spins, such as NV centres, while the successful use of a transient

of galaxies and the underlying dark matter distribution is of fundamental
importance for the interpretation of ongoing and upcoming galaxy surveys. The
so called local bias model, where galaxy density is a function of local matter
density, is frequently discussed as a means to infer the matter power spectrum
or correlation function from the measured galaxy correlation. However,
gravitational evolution generates a term quadratic in the tidal tensor and thus
non-local in the density field, even if this term is absent in the initial
conditions (Lagrangian space). Because the term is quadratic, it contributes as
a loop correction to the power spectrum, so the standard linear bias picture
still applies on large scales, however, it contributes at leading order to the
bispectrum for which it is significant on all scales. Such a term could also be
present in Lagrangian space if halo formation were influenced by the tidal
field. We measure the corresponding coupling strengths from the
matter-matter-halo bispectrum in numerical simulations and find a non-vanishing
coefficient for the tidal tensor term. We find no scale dependence of the bias
parameters up to k=0.1 h/Mpc and that the tidal effect is increasing with halo
mass. While the Lagrangian bias picture is a better description of our results
than the Eulerian bias picture, our results suggest that there might be a tidal
tensor bias already in the initial conditions. We also find that the
coefficients of the quadratic density term deviate quite strongly from the
theoretical predictions based on the spherical collapse model and a universal
mass function. Both quadratic density and tidal tensor bias terms must be
included in the modeling of galaxy clustering of current and future surveys if
one wants to achieve the high precision cosmology promise of these datasets.

directly attributable to an oxide skin that obscures the intrinsic behavior of
the liquid metals. We demonstrate how the intrinsic viscosity can be obtained
with precision through a scaling technique that collapses low- and
high-Reynolds number data. Measuring surface tension with a pendant drop
method, we show that the oxide skin generates a surface stress that mimics
surface tension and develop a simple model to relate this to the yield stress

solar flares are a plausible mechanism to accelerate populations of high
energy, non-thermal particles. One such reconnection scenario occurs at a 3D
magnetic null point, where global plasma flows give rise to strong currents in
the spine axis or fan plane. Aims: To understand the mechanism of charged
particle energy gain in both the external drift region and the diffusion region
associated with 3D magnetic reconnection. In doing so we evaluate the
efficiency of resistive spine and fan models for particle acceleration, and
find possible observables for each. Method: We use a full orbit test particle
approach to study proton trajectories within electromagnetic fields that are
exact solutions to the steady and incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations.
We study single particle trajectories and find energy spectra from many
particle simulations. The scaling properties of the accelerated particles with
respect to field and plasma parameters is investigated. Results: For fan
reconnection, strong non-uniform electric drift streamlines can accelerate the
bulk of the test particles. The highest energy gain is for particles that enter
the current sheet, where an increasing ""guide field"" stabilises particles
against ejection. The energy is only limited by the total electric potential
energy difference across the fan current sheet. The spine model has both slow
external electric drift speed and weak energy gain for particles reaching the
current sheet. Conclusions: The electromagnetic fields of fan reconnection can
accelerate protons to the high energies observed in solar flares, gaining up to
0.1 GeV for anomalous values of resistivity. However, the spine model, which
gave a harder energy spectrum in the ideal case, is not an efficient
accelerator after pressure constraints in the resistive model are included.

hierarchy of masses between curvature and isocurvature modes. When the
hierarchy is large, a low energy effective field theory (EFT) exists in which
only curvature modes participate in the dynamics of perturbations. In this EFT
heavy fields continue to have a significant role in the low energy dynamics, as
their interaction with curvature modes reduces their speed of sound whenever
the multi-field trajectory is subject to a sharp turn in target space. Here we
analyze under which general conditions this EFT remains a reliable description
for the linear evolution of curvature modes. We find that the main condition
consists on demanding that the rate of change of the turn's angular velocity
stays suppressed with respect to the masses of heavy modes. This adiabaticity
condition allows the EFT to accurately describe a large variety of situations
in which the multi-field trajectory is subject to sharp turns. To test this, we
analyze several models with turns and show that, indeed, the power spectra
obtained for both the original two-field theory and its single-field EFT are
identical when the adiabaticity condition is satisfied. In particular, when
turns are sharp and sudden, they are found to generate large features in the
power spectrum, accurately reproduced by the EFT.

The matter source is a massless scalar field. We perform a systematic study of
the space of solutions, and focus on the behavior of several geometrical
observables. We show that the big-bang singularity is replaced by a bounce and
the point-like singularities do not saturate the energy density bound. There
are up to three directional bounces in the scale factors, one global bounce in
the expansion, the shear presents up to four local maxima and can be zero at
the bounce. This allows for solutions with density larger than the maximal
density for the isotropic and Bianchi I cases. The asymptotic behavior is shown
to behave like that of a Bianchi I model, and the effective solutions connect
anisotropic solutions even when the shear is zero at the bounce. All known
facts of Bianchi I are reproduced. In the ""vacuum limit"", solutions are such
that almost all the dynamics is due to the anisotropies. Since Bianchi II plays
an important role in the Bianchi IX model and the Belinskii, Khalatnikov,
Lifshitz (BKL) conjecture, our results can provide an intuitive understanding
of the behavior in the vicinity of general space-like singularities, when
loop-geometric corrections are present.

the small electric charge for the dark constituents induced by the kinetic

creates the asymmetry that gives the right abundance, since the dark matter

star-forming galaxy, Leo T, based on imaging taken with the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). The HST/WFPC2
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of Leo T is exquisitely deep, extending ~ 2
magnitudes below the oldest main sequence turnoff, permitting excellent
constraints on star formation at all ages. We use a maximum likelihood CMD
fitting technique to measure the SFH of Leo T assuming three different sets of
stellar evolution models: Padova (solar-scaled metallicity) and BaSTI (both
solar-scaled and alpha-enhanced metallicities). The resulting SFHs are
remarkably consistent at all ages, indicating that our derived SFH is robust to
the choice of stellar evolution model. From the lifetime SFH of Leo T, we find
that 50% of the total stellar mass formed prior to z ~ 1 (7.6 Gyr ago).
Subsequent to this epoch, the SFH of Leo T is roughly constant until the most
recent ~ 25 Myr, where the SFH shows an abrupt drop. This decrease could be due
to a cessation of star formation or stellar initial mass function sampling
effects, but we are unable to distinguish between the two scenarios. Overall,
our measured SFH is consistent with previously derived SFHs of Leo T. However,
the HST-based solution provides improved age resolution and reduced
uncertainties at all epochs. The SFH, baryonic gas fraction, and location of
Leo T are unlike any of the other recently discovered faint dwarf galaxies in
the Local Group, and instead bear strong resemblance to gas-rich dwarf galaxies
(irregular or transition), suggesting that gas-rich dwarf galaxies may share
common modes of star formation over a large range of stellar mass (~ 10^5-10^9

molecules (C+, O, and CO) have been observed in the atmosphere of
protoplanetary disks. When combined with ground-based [CI], all principle forms
of carbon can be studied. The absence of neutral carbon [CI], which is
predicted by models to be strong, can then be interpreted together with [CII]
and carbon monoxide.
  Aims. We study the gas temperature, excitation, and chemical abundance of the
simple carbon-bearing species by the method of chemical-physical modeling. We
explore the sensitivity of the lines to the entering parameters and constrain
the region from which the line radiation emerges.
  Methods. Numerical models of the radiative transfer are used together with a
chemical network simulation and a calculation of the gas energetics to obtain
the gas temperature. We present our new model, which is based on our previous
models but includes several improvements.
  Results. A model of the disk around the Herbig Be star HD 100546 is able to
reproduce the CO ladder together with the atomic fine-structure lines of [OI]
and either [CI] or [CII]. We find that the high-J lines of CO can only be
reproduced by a warm atmosphere with Tgas>>Tdust. The high-J CO observable with
PACS are dominated from regions within some tens of AU.
  Conclusions. Only a warm atmosphere with Tgas>>Tdust can reproduce the CO
ladder. The CO ladder together with [O I] and the upper limit to [CI] can be
reproduced by models with a high gas/dust ratio and a low abundance of volatile
carbon. These models however produce too small amounts of [CII]. Models with a
low gas/dust ratio and more volatile carbon also reproduce CO and [OI], are in
closer agreement with observations of [CII], but overproduce [CI]. Due to the
uncertain origin of the [CII] emission, we prefer the high gas/dust ratio
models, indicating a low abundance of volatile carbon.

coupled to one or two massive Abelian gauge fields, we find solutions with an

increasingly important as the scale of astronomical surveys grows. Several
recent papers have used methods from machine learning and statistics to
construct classifiers on databases of labeled, multi--epoch sources with the
intention of using these classifiers to automatically infer the classes of
unlabeled sources from new surveys. However, the same source observed with two
different synoptic surveys will generally yield different derived metrics
(features) from the light curve. Since such features are used in classifiers,
this survey-dependent mismatch in feature space will typically lead to degraded
classifier performance. In this paper we show how and why feature distributions
change using OGLE and \textit{Hipparcos} light curves. To overcome survey
systematics, we apply a method, \textit{noisification}, which attempts to
empirically match distributions of features between the labeled sources used to
construct the classifier and the unlabeled sources we wish to classify. Results
from simulated and real--world light curves show that noisification can
significantly improve classifier performance. In a three--class problem using
light curves from \textit{Hipparcos} and OGLE, noisification reduces the
classifier error rate from 27.0% to 7.0%. We recommend that noisification be
used for upcoming surveys such as Gaia and LSST and describe some of the
promises and challenges of applying noisification to these surveys.

the range from having a low mass companion (~ one-hundredth the mass of the
primary galaxy) to a fairly massive companion (~ one-third the mass of the
primary galaxy). This approach has broad implications for many areas of
astrophysics - for the indirect detection of dark matter (or dark-matter
dominated dwarf galaxies), and for galaxy evolution in its use as a decipher of
the dynamical impact of satellites on galactic disks. Here, we present some
preliminary results on the emergent SEDs and images, calculated along the time
sequence of these dynamical simulations using the 3-D self-consistent Monte
Carlo radiative transfer code RADISHE. We explore star formation prescriptions

colors that are primarily affected by the galaxy's interaction history, and not

successful, we may be able to utilize the emergent UV-IR SED of the primary

KS-LDA for multi-reference systems, such as dissociation of H2 and N2, and
twisted ethylene, while performing similarly to KS-LDA for single-reference

computational efficiency (similar to KS-LDA), this DFT-LDA is applied to the
study of the singlet-triplet energy gaps (ST gaps) of acenes, which are

The ST gaps are shown to decrease monotonically with the increase of chain
length, and become vanishingly small (within 0.1 kcal/mol) in the limit of an

fundamentally new state of matter known as a superfluid which supports flow
without viscosity. This type of dissipationless transport can be observed by
forcing helium to travel through a narrow constriction that the normal liquid
could not penetrate. Recent experiments have highlighted the feasibility of
fabricating smooth pores with nanometer radii, that approach the truly one
dimensional limit where it is believed that a system of bosons (like helium-4)
may have startlingly different behavior than in three dimensions. The one
dimensional system is predicted to have a linear hydrodynamic description known
as Luttinger liquid theory, where no type of long range order can be sustained.
In the limit where the pore radius is small, Luttinger liquid theory would
predict that helium inside the channel behaves as a sort of quasi-supersolid
with all correlations decaying as power-law functions of distance at zero
temperature. We have performed large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of
helium-4 inside nanopores of varying radii at low temperature with realistic
helium-helium and helium-pore interactions. The results indicate that helium
inside the nanopore forms concentric cylindrical shells surrounding a core that

state at large values of $E_{\perp}$. The critical value of $E_{\perp}$ that
determines the transition point is a linear function of the magnetic field,
i.e., $E_{\perp,{\rm cr}}=E_{\perp}^{\rm off}+a B$, where $E_{\perp}^{\rm off}$
is the offset electric field and $a$ is the slope. The offset electric field
and energy gaps substantially increase with the inclusion of dynamical
screening compared to the case of static screening. The obtained values for the
offset and the energy gaps are comparable with experimental ones. The
interaction with dynamical screening can be strong enough for reordering the
levels in the quasiparticle spectrum (the $n=2$ Landau level sinks below the
$n=0$ and $n=1$ ones).

disks around supermassive black holes. The structure of these disks is
calculated by numerically modelling tidal disruption of magnetized interstellar
gas clouds. We find that the resulting disks are entirely supported by the
pressure of the magnetic fields against the component of gravitational force
directed perpendicular to the disks. The magnetic field shows ordered
large-scale geometry that remains stable for the duration of our numerical
experiments extending over 10% of the disk lifetime. Strong magnetic pressure
allows high accretion rate and inhibits disk fragmentation. This in combination
with the repeated feeding of manetized molecular clouds to a supermassive black
hole yields a possible solution to the long-standing puzzle of black hole
growth in the centres of galaxies.

spinfoam approach to quantum gravity, with an emphasis on its divergences.
Besides a personal introduction to the problem of quantum gravity, the
manuscript consists in two part. In the first one, we establish an exact
powercounting formula for the bubble divergences of the flat model, using tools
from discrete gauge theory and twisted cohomology. In the second one, we
address the issue of spinfoam continuum limit, both from the lattice field
theory and the group field theory perspectives. In particular, we put forward a
new proof of the Borel summability of the Boulatov-Freidel-Louapre model, with
an improved control over the large-spin scaling behaviour. We conclude with an
outlook of the renormalization program in spinfoam quantum gravity.

more nearly-supersymmetric particles (a ""stealth sector"") lead to collider

involves low-scale supersymmetry breaking, with an R-odd particle decaying to
its superpartner and a soft gravitino. We clarify the stealth mechanism and its
differences from compressed supersymmetry and explain the requirements for
stealth models with high-scale supersymmetry breaking, in which the soft
invisible particle is not a gravitino. We also discuss new and distinctive
classes of stealth models that couple through a baryon portal or Z' gauge

machine for proving such results that goes back to early work of Quillen.
Church and Farb discovered that many sequences of groups whose homology groups
do not stabilize in the classical sense actually stabilize in some sense as
representations. They called this phenomena representation stability. We prove
that the homology groups of congruence subgroups of $GL_n(R)$ (for almost any
reasonable ring $R$) satisfy a strong version of representation stability that
we call central stability. The definition of central stability is very
different from Church-Farb's definition of representation stability (it is
defined via a universal property), but we prove that it implies representation
stability. Our main tool is a new machine for proving central stability that is
analogous to the classical homological stability machine.

on the ESO - Very Large Telescope (VLT) early in the outburst simultaneous with

spectrum includes many broad (~2000 km/s), double-peaked emission profiles of
H, HeI, HeII, characteristic signatures of a low-mass X-ray binary during
outburst. We detect no spectral signatures of the low-mass companion star. The
strength of the diffuse interstellar bands results in a lower limit to the
total interstellar extinction of Av ~ 0.4 mag. Using the neutral hydrogen
column density obtained from the X-ray spectrum we estimate Av ~1 mag. The
radial-velocity structure of the interstellar NaI D and CaII H & K lines
results in a lower limit to the distance of ~ 4 +/- 1 kpc, consistent with
previous estimates. With this distance and Av, the dereddened spectral energy

mainly with respect to realistic noise conditions. In order to shed some light
on this issue, we evaluate the exact dynamics of some single qubit gate
fidelities using the measurement-based quantum computation scheme when the
qubits which are used as resource interact with a common dephasing environment.
We report a necessary condition for the fidelity dynamics of a general pure
N-qubit state, interacting with this type of error channel, to present an
oscillatory behavior and we show that for the initial canonical cluster state
the fidelity oscillates as a function of time. This state fidelity oscillatory
behavior brings significant variations to the values of the computational
results of a generic gate acting on that state depending on the instants we
choose to apply our set of projective measurements. As we shall see,
considering some specific gates that are frequently found in the literature,
neither fast application of the set of projective measurements necessarily
implies high gate fidelity, nor slow application thereof necessarily implies
low gate fidelity. Our condition for the occurrence of the fidelity oscillatory
behavior shows that the oscillation presented by the cluster state is due
exclusively to its initial geometry. Other states that can be used as resources
for measurement-based quantum computation can present the same initial
geometrical condition. Therefore, it is very important for the present scheme
to know when the fidelity of a particular resource state will oscillate in time
and, if this is the case, what are the best times to perform the measurements.

of sparse signals and images that enables sampling rates significantly below
the classical Nyquist rate. Despite significant progress in the theory and
methods of CS, little headway has been made in compressive video acquisition
and recovery. Video CS is complicated by the ephemeral nature of dynamic
events, which makes direct extensions of standard CS imaging architectures and
signal models difficult. In this paper, we develop a new framework for video CS
for dynamic textured scenes that models the evolution of the scene as a linear
dynamical system (LDS). This reduces the video recovery problem to first
estimating the model parameters of the LDS from compressive measurements, and
then reconstructing the image frames. We exploit the low-dimensional dynamic
parameters (the state sequence) and high-dimensional static parameters (the
observation matrix) of the LDS to devise a novel compressive measurement
strategy that measures only the dynamic part of the scene at each instant and
accumulates measurements over time to estimate the static parameters. This
enables us to lower the compressive measurement rate considerably. We validate
our approach with a range of experiments involving both video recovery, sensing
hyper-spectral data, and classification of dynamic scenes from compressive
data. Together, these applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach.

individuals or objects in the absence of external identification or tagging. We
address this problem by introducing a framework that captures the notion of
communities or clusters determined by the relative affinities among their
members. To this end we define what we call an affinity system, which is a set
of elements, each with a vector characterizing its preference for all other
elements in the set. We define a natural notion of (potentially overlapping)
communities in an affinity system, in which the members of a given community
collectively prefer each other to anyone else outside the community. Thus these
communities are endogenously formed in the affinity system and are
""self-determined"" or ""self-certified"" by its members.
  We provide a tight polynomial bound on the number of self-determined
communities as a function of the robustness of the community. We present a
polynomial-time algorithm for enumerating these communities. Moreover, we
obtain a local algorithm with a strong stochastic performance guarantee that
can find a community in time nearly linear in the of size the community.
  Social networks fit particularly naturally within the affinity system
framework -- if we can appropriately extract the affinities from the relatively
sparse yet rich information from social networks, our analysis then yields a
set of efficient algorithms for enumerating self-determined communities in
social networks. In the context of social networks we also connect our analysis
with results about $(\alpha,\beta)$-clusters introduced by Mishra, Schreiber,
Stanton, and Tarjan \cite{msst}. In contrast with the polynomial bound we prove
on the number of communities in the affinity system model, we show that there
exists a family of networks with superpolynomial number of
$(\alpha,\beta)$-clusters.

non-conforming triangulations. The method consists in constructing mappings
from triangles in a background mesh to curvilinear ones that conform exactly to
the immersed domain. Constructing such a map relies on a novel way of
parameterizing the immersed boundary over a collection of nearby edges with its
closest point projection. By interpolating the mappings to curvilinear
triangles at select points, we recover isoparametric mappings for the immersed
domain defined over the background mesh. Indeed, interpolating the constructed
mappings just at the vertices of the background mesh yields a fast meshing
algorithm that involves only perturbing a few vertices near the boundary.
  For the discretization of a curved domain to be robust, we have to impose
restrictions on the background mesh. Conversely, these restrictions define a
family of domains that can be discretized with a given background mesh. We then
say that the background mesh is a universal mesh for such a family of domains.
The notion of universal meshes is particularly useful in free/moving boundary
problems because the same background mesh can serve as the universal mesh for
the evolving domain for time intervals that are independent of the time step.
Hence it facilitates a framework for finite element calculations over evolving
domains while using a fixed background mesh. Furthermore, since the evolving
geometry can be approximated with any desired order, numerical solutions can be
computed with high-order accuracy. We demonstrate these ideas with various
numerical examples.

  Link States","10 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the adaptive shortest-path routing problem in wireless networks
under unknown and stochastically varying link states. In this problem, we aim
to optimize the quality of communication between a source and a destination
through adaptive path selection. Due to the randomness and uncertainties in the
network dynamics, the quality of each link varies over time according to a
stochastic process with unknown distributions. After a path is selected for
communication, the aggregated quality of all links on this path (e.g., total
path delay) is observed. The quality of each individual link is not observable.
We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit with dependent arms. We show
that by exploiting arm dependencies, a regret polynomial with network size can
be achieved while maintaining the optimal logarithmic order with time. This is
in sharp contrast with the exponential regret order with network size offered
by a direct application of the classic MAB policies that ignore arm
dependencies. Furthermore, our results are obtained under a general model of
link-quality distributions (including heavy-tailed distributions) and find
applications in cognitive radio and ad hoc networks with unknown and dynamic
communication environments.

Treasury survey of the Coma cluster at z~0.02 to study bars in massive disk
galaxies (S0s), and in dwarf galaxies in the Coma core. Our study helps
constrain the evolution of bars and disks in dense environments and provides a
comparison point for studies in lower density environments and at higher
redshifts. (1) We characterize the fraction and properties of bars in a sample
of 32 bright (M_V <= -18, M_* > 10^9.5 M_sun) S0 galaxies, which dominate the
population of massive disk galaxies in the Coma core. Measuring the S0 bar
fraction must be handled carefully, as the results depend on the method used:
the bar fraction for bright S0s in the Coma core is 50%+/-11%, 65%+/-11%, and
60%+/-11% for three methods of bar detection: strict ellipse fit criteria,
relaxed ellipse fit criteria, and visual classification. (2) We compare the S0
bar fraction across different environments (Coma core, A901/902, Virgo). We
find that the bar fraction among bright S0 galaxies does not show a
statistically significant variation across environments spanning two orders of
magnitude in galaxy number density (n~300-10,000 gal/Mpc^3). We speculate that
the S0 bar fraction is not significantly enhanced in rich clusters because S0s
in rich clusters are less prone to bar instabilities as they are dynamically
hot and gas poor due to ram pressure stripping and accelerated star formation.
In addition, high-speed encounters in rich clusters may be less effective than
slow, strong encounters in inducing bars. (3) We analyze a sample of 333 faint
(M_V > -18) dwarf galaxies in the Coma core. Using unsharp-masking, we find
only 13 galaxies with bar and/or spiral structure. The paucity of disk
structures in Coma dwarfs suggests that either disks are not common in these
galaxies, or that any disks present are too hot to develop instabilities.

enter and escape from $\Omega$. A law of large numbers for the maximal flow
from $\Gamma ^1$ to $\Gamma ^2$ in $\Omega$ is already known. In this paper we
investigate the asymptotic behavior of a maximal stream and a minimal cutset. A
maximal stream is a vector measure $\vec{\mu}_n^{\max}$ that describes how the
maximal amount of fluid can cross $\Omega$. Under conditions on the regularity
of the domain and on the law of the capacities of the edges, we prove that the
sequence $(\vec{\mu}_n^{\max})_{n\geq1}$ converges a.s. to the set of the
solutions of a continuous deterministic problem of maximal stream in an
anisotropic network. A minimal cutset can been seen as the boundary of a set
$E_n^{\min}$ that separates $\Gamma ^1$ from $\Gamma ^2$ in $\Omega$ and whose
random capacity is minimal. Under the same conditions, we prove that the
sequence $(E_n^{\min})_{n\geq1}$ converges toward the set of the solutions of a
continuous deterministic problem of minimal cutset. We deduce from this a
continuous deterministic max-flow min-cut theorem and a new proof of the law of

delivered an internally consistent set of critical exponents satisfying

Hilbert-space truncation error and the mass-flow error - could lead to this

origin, force the system to obey naive scaling laws even when the physical

mathematical approaches, it is concluded that the non-modal optimal
disturbances growth results from the discrete part of the spectrum only. It is
found that in the linearly unstable configurations the non-modal growth cannot
be larger than the exponential one. At the same time, the largest non-modal
growth takes place at the wavenumbers for which the mixing layer flow is
stable. The most profound growth is attained by oblique three-dimensional waves
that propagate at the angle close to 45o with respect to the base flow. Results
of the non-modal analysis are followed by the fully non-linear
three-dimensional time-dependent solutions, initial conditions for which are
taken as the calculated optimal vectors. The fully 3D non-linear calculations
exhibit growth and decay of flow structures that sometimes become similar to
those observed at late stages of time evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz

a fractal surface: depending on the underlying geometry of the roughness,
strongly superhydrophobic surfaces may in some cases be fully inefficient in
terms of drag reduction. Finally, our scaling analysis can be directly extended
to the study of heat transfer at fractal surfaces, in order to estimate the
Kapitsa surface resistance on patterned surfaces, as well as to the question of
trapping of diffusing particles by patchy hierarchical surfaces, in the context
of chemoreception.

  Invariance and the welcher Weg Problem","18 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Results of the welcher Weg experiment of Duerr, Nonn and Rempe are explained
by using ray representations of the Galilei group. The key idea is that the
state of the incoming atom be regarded as belonging to an irreducible unitary
ray representation of this group. If this is the case, interaction with an
interferometer with a which-way detector must split this state into the direct
sum of two states belonging to representations with different internal
energies. (While the zero of internal energy is arbitrary, the difference
between two internal energies is well-defined and is invariant under unitary
transformations.) The state of the outgoing atom will then be a superposition
of two mutually orthogonal states, so that there will be no interference.
Neither complementarity nor entanglement plays a role in this explanation.
Furthermore, in atom interferometry it is not enough for a quantum eraser to
erase the internal energy difference; to restore interference, two copies of a
representation have to be collapsed into one. In a direct sum of copies of the
same representation, copies of the same state will still be orthogonal. These
assertions may be testable, and two new atom interferometry experiments are
suggested. One of them is an `own-goal' experiment which may decisively refute
the explanation offered here, and restore the aura of mystery that this paper
tries to dispel.

find the following (1) The M_BH-sigma relation cannot flatten at low masses,
but may steepen. (2) The M_BH-M_bulge relation may well flatten in contrast.
(3) The M_BH-Sersic n relation is able to account for the large scatter in

relation seem to be dwarf elliptical galaxies. When plotting M_BH versus M_NC
we find three different regimes: (a) nuclear cluster dominated nuclei, (b) a
transition region, and (c) black hole-dominated nuclei. This is consistent with
the picture, in which black holes form inside nuclear clusters with a very
low-mass fraction. They subsequently grow much faster than the nuclear cluster,
destroying it when the ratio M_BH/M_NC grows above 100. Nuclear star clusters
may thus be the precursors of massive black holes in galaxy nuclei.

that are separated by an insulator and it is therefore also a microwave cavity.
The superconducting phase difference across the junction determines the
supercurrent as well as its spatial distribution. Both, an external magnetic
field and a resonant cavity intrafield produce a spatial modification of the
superconducting phase along the junction. The interplay between these two
effects leads to interference in the critical current of the junction and
allows us to continuously tune the coupling strength between the first cavity
mode and the Josephson phase from 1 to -0.5. This enables static and dynamic
control over the junction in the ultra-strong coupling regime.

the rotating frequency and subsequently the Reynolds and Stokes numbers, the

shown to be an insufficient indicator of the clustering trend in particles
laden flows.

population and its radial distribution. A total number of 62 bright BSSs (with
m_F255W < 21, corresponding to m_F555W < 20) has been identified, and they have
been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core. No significant upturn
in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts of M75, in contrast to
several other clusters studied with the same technique. This observational fact
is quite similar to what has been found in M79 (NGC 1904) by Lanzoni et al.
(2007a). Indeed the BSS radial distributions in the two clusters is
qualitatively very similar, even if in M75 the relative BSS frequency seems to
decrease significantly faster than in M79: indeed it decreases by a factor of 5
(from 3.4 to 0.7) within 1 r_c. Such evidence indicate that the vast majority
of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) have already sunk to the core.

  arXiv:1002.0547",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It often goes unnoticed that, even for a finite number of degrees of freedom,
the canonical commutation relations have many inequivalent irreducible unitary
representations; the free particle and a particle in a box provide examples
that are both simple and well-known. The representations are unitarily
inequivalent because the spectra of the position and momentum operators are
different, and spectra are invariant under unitary transformations. The
existence of these representations can have consequences that run from the
merely unexpected to the barely conceivable. To start with, states of a single
particle that belong to inequivalent representations will always be mutually
orthogonal; they will never interfere with each other. This property, called
superseparability elsewhere, is well-defined mathematically, but has not yet
been observed. This article suggests two single-particle interference
experiments that may reveal its existence. The existence of inequivalent
irreducibile representations may be traced to the existence of different
self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces. Analysis of the underlying mathematics reveals that some of these
extensions can be interpreted in terms of topological, geometrical and physical
quantities that can be controlled in the laboratory. The tests suggested are
based on these interpretations. In conclusion, it is pointed out that
mathematically rigorous many-worlds interpretations of quantum mechanics may be
possible in a framework that admits superseparability.

internal degrees of freedom in the scalar potential field $U$, which is a
function both on relative coordinates and time, and on relative speed and
accelerations. The equation for energy, which is an integral of motion when $U$
satisfies to certain differential condition, is derived for the general case.
For a free mass point all solutions of the equations of motion in the
center-of-inertia reference frame, moving with constant velocity, are found. As
a result, the center of mass follows along helical and more complicated
trajectories round a direction of motion of the center of inertia. This motion
can be interpreted as trembling movement (Zitterbewegung). On this basis a
conclusion is done that Zitterbewegung has purely classical origin, arising
even in a nonrelativistic case if internal degrees of freedom are taken into
account. The general equation of motion for a spin which can be interpreted
from positions of a classical mechanics is written down. Application of the
obtained results to the electron leads to new conception of electric charge,
sign of which corresponds to a sign of spin polarization.

local perturbations in the interface, or to appearance of collective modes ---

curve analysis, we derived the first rough estimates of the physical properties
of these systems. We find that the analyzed systems are somewhat similar to
each other. Both contain low-mass components of similar types, both are close
to the Sun, both have short orbital period, and both contain another low-mass
companions on longer orbits of a few years. In the case of GK Boo, both
components are probably of K3 spectral type, while the distant companion is
probably a late M star. The light curve of GK Boo is asymmetric, which probably
causes the shift in the secondary minima in the O-C diagram. System AE For
comprises two K7 stars, and the third body is a possible brown dwarf with a
minimal mass of only about 47 Jupiter Mass. We succeed in completing period and

analysis is needed to confirm the physical parameters of the components to a

existence of the approximate scale invariance, which breaks down spontaneously
by the condensation of anti-techni and techni-fermions. According to the
Goldstone theorem, a spinless, parity-even particle, called techni-dilaton
(TD), then emerges at low energy. If TC exhibits an extreme walking, TD mass is
parametrically much smaller than that of techni-fermions (around 1 TeV), while
its decay constant is comparable to the cutoff scale of walking TC. We analyze
the light, decoupled TD as a dark matter candidate and study cosmological
productions of TD, both thermal and non-thermal, in the early Universe. The
thermal population is governed dominantly by single TD production processes
involving vertices breaking the scale symmetry, while the non-thermal
population is by the vacuum misalignment and is accumulated via harmonic and
coherent oscillations of misaligned classical TD fields. The non-thermal
population turns out to be dominant and large enough to explain the abundance
of presently observed dark matter, while the thermal population is highly
suppressed due to the large TD decay constant. Several cosmological and
astrophysical limits on the light, decoupled TD are examined to find that the
TD mass is constrained to be in a range between 0.01 eV and 500 eV. From the
combined constraints on cosmological productions and astrophysical
observations, we find that the light, decoupled TD can be a good dark matter
candidate with the mass around a few hundreds of eV for typical models of

proportionality relation between the stress tensor and the geometry. This is an
oriented assumption driven by the fact that both the stress tensor and the
Einstein tensor are divergenceless. However, General Relativity is in essence a
nonlinear theory, so there is no obvious reason why the coupling to matter
should be linear. On another hand, modified theories of gravity usually affect
the vacuum dynamics, yet keep the coupling to matter linear. In this Letter we
address the implications of consistent nonlinear gravity/matter coupling. The
Eddington inspired Born-Infeld theory recently introduced by Banados and
Ferreira provides an enlightening realization of such coupling modifications.
We find that this theory coupled to a perfect fluid reduces to General
Relativity coupled to a nonlinearly modified perfect fluid, leading to an
ambiguity between modified coupling and modified equation of state. We discuss
observational consequences of this degeneracy and argue that such a completion
of General Relativity is viable from both an experimental and theoretical point
of view through energy conditions, consistency, and singularity-avoidance
perspectives. We use these results to discuss the impact of changing the
coupling paradigm.

investigate whether stellar mass, central velocity dispersion, surface mass

varies with one parameter when another is fixed. When the stellar mass is fixed
we see that strong trends remain with all other parameters, whereas residual
trends are weaker when surface mass density, n, or velocity dispersion are
fixed. Overall velocity dispersion is the best indicator of a galaxy's typical

indicated that both the halo and black hole properties are better correlated

consequence, physical observables are expected to be periodic in the Higgs

non-linear behavior as the function of the Higgs VEV. For a specific choice of
the VEV, the Yukawa coupling of KK zero mode fermion even vanishes. On the

which is linear in the Higgs field. We discuss how such two apparent

many luminous quasars are striking evidence for a broad line region in which
radiation driving plays an important role. We consider the case for a similar
role for radiation driving beyond the dust sublimation radius by focussing on
the infrared regime where the relationship between luminosity and the
prominence of the 3-5 micron bump may be key. To investigate this further, we
apply the 3D hydrodynamic wind model of Everett (2005) to predict the infrared
spectral energy distributions of quasars. The presence of the 3-5 micron bump
and strong, broad silicate features can be reproduced with this dynamical wind
model when radiation driving on dust is taken into account.

by analysing the effect of a homogeneous oscillatory shear on a fluid flow.
This model can be taken to represent the interaction between a large-scale
periodic tidal deformation and a smaller-scale convective motion. We first
consider analytically the limit in which the shear is of low amplitude and the
oscillation period is short compared to the timescales of the unperturbed flow.
In this limit there is a viscoelastic response and we obtain expressions for
the effective elastic modulus and viscosity coefficient. The effective
viscosity is inversely proportional to the square of the oscillation frequency,
with a coefficient that can be positive, negative or zero depending on the
properties of the unperturbed flow. We also carry out direct numerical
simulations of Boussinesq convection in an oscillatory shearing box and measure
the time-dependent Reynolds stress. The results indicate that the effective
viscosity of turbulent convection falls rapidly as the oscillation frequency is
increased, attaining small negative values in the cases we have examined,
although significant uncertainties remain because of the turbulent noise. We
discuss the implications of this analysis for astrophysical tides.

GHz remains quite compact as seen at different resolutions, whereas at ~1.7
GHz, high resolution imaging reveals some extended structure. The nuclear
region has an approximate linear size of 200 pc and shows the presence of two
main emission components: i) one with a composite spectrum due to ongoing
non-thermal activity (probably due to recently exploded supernovae and AGN
activity), ii) another one with a steep spectrum, likely dominated by an old
population of radio emitters, such as supernova remnants (SNRs). Radiative
losses are important, so re-acceleration or replenishment of new electrons is
necessary. We estimate a magnetic field strength of 18 \mu G at galactic, and
175 \mu G at nuclear scales, which are typical for galaxies in advanced
mergers.

from the quantum critical system YbRh2Si2 to the stable trivalent Yb system
YbCo2Si2 was investigated by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. While
the Kondo temperature changes by one order of magnitude, all compositions of
the single crystalline series Yb(Rh1-xCox)2Si2 show well defined ESR spectra
with a clear Yb3+ character for temperatures below \approx 20 K. With
increasing Co-content the ESR g-factor along the c-direction strongly increases
indicating a continuous change of the ground state wave function and, thus, a
continuous change of the crystal electric field. The linewidth presents a
complex dependence on the Co-content and is discussed in terms of the Co-doping
dependence of the Kondo interaction, the magnetic anisotropy and the influence
of ferromagnetic correlations between the 4f states. The results provide
evidence that, for low Co-doping, the Kondo interaction allows narrow ESR
spectra despite the presence of a large magnetic anisotropy, whereas at high
Co-concentrations, the linewidth is controlled by ferromagnetic correlations. A
pronounced broadening due to critical correlations at low temperatures is only
observed at the highest Co-content. This might be related to the presence of
incommensurate magnetic fluctuations.

mu=2 GeV. The perturbative results depend on a large number of parameters and

faster than a standard subgradient descent method that has an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$

mystery' in quantum mechanics. The mystery was that electrons traverse the
interferometer as waves, but are detected as particles. This note was motivated
by the question whether single electrons can be detected as waves. It suggests
a double-slit interferometry experiment with atoms of noble gases in which it
may be possible to detect an individual atom as a probability wave, using a
detector which can execute two different types of simple harmonic motion: as a
simple pendulum, and as a torsion pendulum. In the experiment, a torsional
oscillation will never be induced by the impact of a probability wave, but will
always be induced by the impact of a particle. Detection as a wave is
contingent on the atom interacting much more strongly with the macroscopic
detector as a whole than with its microscopic constituents. This requirement
may be more difficult to meet with electrons, protons, neutrons or photons than
with atoms.
