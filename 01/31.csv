evolution of the immune repertoire of B cells and antibodies based on Jerne's

networks generated by this model in the different regimes can be classified as
complex networks. We have found that in the chaotic regime the network has
random characteristics with large, constant values of clustering coefficients,
while in the ordered phase, the degree distribution of the network is
exponential and the clustering coefficient exhibits power law behavior. In the
transition region we observed a mixed behavior (random-like and exponential) of
the degree distribution as opposed to the scale-free behavior reported for
other biological networks. Randomness and low connectivity in the active sites
allow for rapid changes in the connectivity distribution of the immune network
in order to include and/or discard information and generate a dynamic memory.
However it is the availability of the low concentration nodes to change rapidly
without driving the system to pathological states that allow the generation of
dynamic memory and consequently a reproduction of immune system behavior in
mice. Although the overall behavior of degree correlation is positive, there is
an interplay between assortative and disassortative mixing in the stable and
transition regions regulated by a threshold value of the node degree, which
achieves a maximum value on the transition region and becomes totally
assortative in the chaotic regime.

molecular clouds. As cores are often embedded in filaments, it is important to
understand how line profiles from such systems differ from those of isolated
cores. We perform radiative transfer calculations on a hydrodynamic simulation
of a molecular cloud in order to model line emission from collapsing cores
embedded in filaments. We model two optically thick lines, CS(2-1) and
HCN(1-0), and one optically thin line, N2H+(1-0), from three embedded cores. In
the hydrodynamic simulation, gas self-gravity, turbulence, and bulk flows
create filamentary regions within which cores form. Though the filaments have
large dispersions, the N2H+(1-0) lines indicate subsonic velocities within the
cores. We find that the observed optically thick line profiles of CS(2-1) and
HCN(1-0) vary drastically with viewing angle. In over 50% of viewing angles,
there is no sign of a blue asymmetry, an idealised signature of infall motions
in an isolated spherical collapsing core. Profiles which primarily trace the
cores, with little contribution from the surrounding filament, are
characterised by a systematically higher HCN(1-0) peak intensity. The N2H+(1-0)
lines do not follow this trend. We demonstrate that red asymmetric profiles are
also feasible in the optically thick lines, due to emission from the filament
or one-sided accretion flows onto the core. We conclude that embedded cores may
frequently undergo collapse without showing a blue asymmetric profile, and that
observational surveys including filamentary regions may underestimate the
number of collapsing cores if based solely on profile shapes of optically thick
lines.

but the most useful individual recommendations are hard to be found among
diverse niche objects. In this paper we investigate the direction effect of the
random walk on user similarity measurements and find that the user similarity,
calculated by directed random walks, is reverse to the initial node's degree.
Since the ratio of small-degree users to large-degree users is very large in
real data sets, the large-degree users' selections are recommended extensively
by traditional CF algorithms. By tuning the user similarity direction from
neighbors to the target user, we introduce a new algorithm specifically to
address the challenge of diversity of CF and show how it can be used to solve
the accuracy-diversity dilemma. Without relying on any context-specific

outperforms the state-of-the-art CF methods. This work suggests that the random

of the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission
technique, which divides a wideband channel into a number of orthogonal
narrowband subchannels, called subcarriers. An OFDMA system takes advantage of
both frequency diversity (FD) gain and frequency-selective scheduling (FSS)
gain. A FD gain is achieved by allocating a user the subcarriers distributed
over the entire frequency band whereas a FSS gain is achieved by allocating a
user adjacent subcarriers located within a subband of a small bandwidth having
the most favorable channel conditions among other subbands in the entire
frequency band. Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) is a
promising technology to increase spectral efficiency. A well-known MU-MIMO mode
is Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) which can be used in the downlink
direction to allow a group of spatially separable users to share the same
time/frequency resources. In this paper, we study the gain from FSS in
SDMA-OFDMA systems using the example of WiMAX. Therefore, a complete SDMA-OFDMA
MAC scheduling solution supporting both FD and FSS is proposed. The proposed
solution is analyzed in a typical urban macro-cell scenario by means of
system-level packet-based simulations, with detailed MAC and physical layer
abstractions. By explicitly simulating the MAC layer overhead (MAP) which is
required to signal every packed data burst in the OFDMA frame we can present
the overall performance to be expected at the MAC layer. Our results show that
in general the gain from FSS when applying SDMA is low. However, under specific
conditions, small number of BS antennas or large channel bandwidth, a
significant gain can be achieved from FSS.

complete in the sense that any knot in the intersection of its terms may well
be topologically slice. However, the natural extension of this filtration to
what is called the n-solvable filtration of the smooth knot concordance group,
is unsatisfactory because any topologically slice knot lies in every term of
the filtration. To ameliorate this we investigate a new filtration, {B_n}, that
is simultaneously a refinement of the n-solvable filtration and a
generalization of notions of positivity studied by Gompf and Cochran. We show
that each B_n/B_{n+1} has infinite rank. But our primary interest is in the
induced filtration, {T_n}, on the subgroup, T, of knots that are topologically

the tau, s, and epsilon-invariants; while the non-triviliality of T_0/T_1 can
be detected by certain d-invariants. All of these concordance obstructions
vanish for knots in T_1. Nonetheless, going beyond this, our main result is
that T_1/T_2 has positive rank. Moreover under a ""weak homotopy-ribbon""

Stillinger-Weber type potentials. In general, composition-dependent N-body
terms in the total energy lead to explicit (N+1)-body forces, which potentially
renders them computationally expensive. We present an algorithm that overcomes
this problem and that can speed up the calculation of the forces for
composition-dependent pair potentials in such a way as to make them
computationally comparable in efficiency and scaling behaviour to standard EAM
potentials. We also discuss the implementation in Monte-Carlo simulations.
Finally, we exemplarily review the composition-dependent EAM model for the
Fe-Cr system [PRL 95, 075702 (2005)].

has been observed by International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) on several days
in March 1986. A coupled chemistry-emission model is developed for comet
1P/Halley to assess the importance of various production and loss mechanisms of
CO(a3pi) and to calculate the intensity of Cameron band emission on different
days of IUE observation. Two different solar EUV flux models, EUVAC of Richards
et al. (1994) and SOLAR2000 of Tobiska (2004), and different relative
abundances of CO and CO2, are used to evaluate the role of photon and
photoelectron in producing CO molecule in a3pi state in the cometary coma. It
is found that in comet 1P/Halley 60--70% of the total intensity of the Cameron
band emission is contributed by electron impact excitation of CO and CO2, while
the contribution from photodissociative excitation of CO2 is small (20--30%).
Thus, in the comets where CO and CO2 relative abundances are comparable, the
Cameron band emission is largely governed by electron impact excitation of CO,
and not by the photodissociative excitation of CO2 as assumed earlier. Model
calculated Cameron band 1-0 emission intensity (40 R) is consistent with the
observed IUE slit-averaged brightness (37 +/- 6 R) using EUVAC model solar flux
on 13 March 1986, and also on other days of observations. Since electron impact
excitation is the major production mechanism, the Cameron emission can be used
to derive photoelectron density in the inner coma rather than the CO2
abundance.

After inflation our universe must be reheated and we must have a long period of
radiation dominated before the epoch of Dark Matter. Typically the inflaton
decays while it oscillates around the minimum of its potential. If the inflaton
decay is not complete or sufficient then the remaining energy density of the
inflaton after reheating must be fine tuned to give the correct amount of Dark
Matter. An essential feature here, is that Dark Matter-Inflaton particle is
produced at low energies without fine tuning or new parameters. This process
uses the same coupling g as for the inflaton decay. Once the field phi becomes
non-relativistic it will decouple as any WIMP particle, since n_phi is
exponentially suppressed. The correct amount of Dark Matter determines the
cross section and we have a constraint between the coupling $g$ and the mass
$m_o$ of phi. The unification scheme we present here has four free parameters,
two for the scalar potential V(phi) given by the inflation parameter lambda of
the quartic term and the mass m_o. The other two parameters are the coupling
$g$ between the inflaton phi and a scalar filed varphi and the coupling h
between varphi with standard model particles psi or chi. These four parameters
are already present in models of inflation and reheating process, without
considering Dark Matter. Therefore, our unification scheme does not increase

where $K_1$ is the kinetic energy of the moving body, $V_1$ its potential

by using the usual Legendre transformation $L=2K_1+2K_2-H$ where $K_2$ is the
total kinetic energy of the environment. An equivalent expression of this
Lagrangian is $L=K_1-V_1-E_d$ where $E_d$ is the energy dissipated by the
friction from the moving body into the environment from the beginning of the

equation of the damped motion. We also show that this general formulation is a

kinetics. We ask the more formal question: is there a continuous path between
these states, along which the conservation laws hold, the concentrations remain
non-negative and the relevant thermodynamic potential G (Gibbs energy, for
example) monotonically decreases? The obvious necessary condition, G(x)\geq
G(y), is not sufficient, and we construct the necessary and sufficient
conditions. For example, it is impossible to overstep the equilibrium in
1-dimensional (1D) systems (with n components and n-1 conservation laws). The
system cannot come from a state x to a state y if they are on the opposite
sides of the equilibrium even if G(x) > G(y). We find the general
multidimensional analogue of this 1D rule and constructively solve the problem
of the thermodynamically admissible transitions.
  We study dynamical systems, which are given in a positively invariant convex
polyhedron D and have a convex Lyapunov function G. An admissible path is a
continuous curve along which $G$ does not increase. For x,y from D, x\geq y (x
precedes y) if there exists an admissible path from x to y and x \sim y if
x\geq y and y\geq x. The tree of G in D is a quotient space D/~. We provide an
algorithm for the construction of this tree. In this algorithm, the restriction
of G onto the 1-skeleton of $D$ (the union of edges) is used. The problem of
existence of admissible paths between states is solved constructively. The

The main point is a derivation of the particle crossing property from the KMS

incoming/outgoing particles with interacting fields is achieved by ""emulation""
of free wedge-localized fields within the wedge-localized interacting algebra.
The suspicion that the duality of the meromorphic functions, which appear in

result of Mellin-transforms of global operator-product expansions in conformal
QFT is thus confirmed. The connection of the wedge-localization setting with
the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebraic structure is pointed out and an Ansatz for
an extension to non-integrable models is presented. Modular localization leads
also to a widening of the renormalized perturbation setting by allowing
couplings of string-localized higher spin fields which stay within the
power-counting limit. This holds the promise of a Hilbert space formulation
which avoids the use of BRST Krein-spaces. .

is theoretically addressed. A general expression for the force acting per unit
area of a charged domain wall carrying free charge is derived. It is shown
that, in proper ferroelectrics, the free charge carried by the wall is
dependent on the size of the adjacent domains. As a result, it was found that
the mobility of such domain wall (with respect to the applied field) is
sensitive to the parameters of the domain pattern containing this wall. The
problem of the force acting on a planar charged 180-degree domain wall normal
to the polarization direction in a periodic domain pattern in a proper
ferroelectric is analytically solved in terms of Landau theory. It is shown
that, in small applied fields (in the linear regime), the forces acting on
walls in such pattern increase with decreasing the wall spacing, the direction
of the forces coinciding with those for the case of the corresponding neutral
walls. At the same time, for large enough wall spacings and large enough
fields, these forces can be of the opposite sign. It is shown that the domain
pattern considered is unstable in a defect-free ferroelectric. The poling of a
crystal containing such pattern, stabilized by the pinning pressure, is also
considered. It is shown that, except for a special situation, the presence of
charge domain walls can make poling more difficult. It is demonstrated that the
results obtained are also applicable to zig-zag walls under the condition that
the zig-zag amplitude is much smaller than the domain wall spacing.

single-field inflationary models that descend from a parent theory containing
multiple other scalar fields. By assuming that all other degrees of freedom in
the parent theory are sufficiently massive relative to the inflaton, it is
possible to derive an EFT valid to arbitrary order in perturbations, provided
certain generalized adiabaticity conditions are respected. These conditions
permit a consistent low energy EFT description even when the inflaton deviates
off its adiabatic minimum along its slowly rolling trajectory. By generalizing
the formalism that identifies the adiabatic mode with the Goldstone boson of
this spontaneously broken time translational symmetry prior to the integration
of the heavy fields, we show that this invariance of the parent theory dictates
the entire non-perturbative structure of the descendent EFT. The couplings of
this theory can be written entirely in terms of the reduced speed of sound of
adiabatic perturbations. The resulting operator expansion is distinguishable
from that of other scenarios, such as standard single inflation or DBI
inflation. In particular, we re-derive how certain operators can become
transiently strongly coupled along the inflaton trajectory, consistent with
slow-roll and the validity of the EFT expansion, imprinting features in the
primordial power spectrum, and we deduce the relevant cubic operators that
imply distinct signatures in the primordial bispectrum which may soon be

coupled to a fermionic reservoir and driven out of equilibrium by local quantum
quenches such as those recently realized in optical absorption experiments on
single quantum dots. We argue that equilibration in this problem is deeply
connected to the occurrence of Kondo Effect at low energy and that a highly non
trivial dynamical behavior may emerge whenever a local quantum critical point
intrudes between a conventional Kondo screened phase and a Kondo unscreened
one. We discuss this issue in the context of the Anderson Impurity model

3C273 and Fornax A) in the 7-year WMAP sky maps, with the goal of understanding
potential systematics involved in estimation of foreground spectral indices. We
estimate the spectral index, the polarization angle, the polarization fraction
and apparent size and shape of these objects when smoothed to a nominal
resolution of 1 degree FWHM. Second, we compute the spectral index as a
function of polarization orientation, alpha. Because these objects are
approximately point sources with constant polarization angle, this function
should be constant in the absence of systematics. However, computing it for the
K- and Ka-band WMAP data we find strong index variations for all four sources.
For Tau A, we find a spectral index beta=-2.59+-0.03 for alpha=30 degrees, and
beta=-2.03+-0.01 for alpha=50 degrees. On the other hand, the spectral index
between Ka and Q band is found to be stable. A simple elliptical Gaussian toy
model with parameters matching those observed in Tau A reproduces the observed
signal, and shows that the spectral index is in particular sensitive to the
detector polarization angle. Based on these findings, we first conclude that
estimation of spectral indices with the WMAP K-band polarization data at 1
degree scales is not robust. Second, we note that these issues may be of
concern for ground-based and sub-orbital experiments that use the WMAP
polarization measurements of Tau A for calibration of gain and polarization
angles.

provides a natural compactification of the space of morphisms from nonsingular

We show that the analogue of Givental's J-function for the resulting twisted
projective invariants is described by the same mirror hypergeometric series as
the corresponding Gromov-Witten invariants (which arise from the moduli space
of stable maps), but without the mirror transform (in the Calabi-Yau case).
This implies that the stable quotients and Gromov-Witten twisted invariants
agree if there is enough ""positivity"", but not in all cases. As a corollary of
the proof, we show that certain twisted Hurwitz numbers arising in the stable
quotients theory are also described by a fundamental object associated with
this hypergeometric series. We thus completely answer some of the questions
posed by Marian-Oprea-Pandharipande concerning their invariants. Our results
suggest a deep connection between the stable quotients invariants of complete
intersections and the geometry of the mirror families. As in Gromov-Witten
theory, computing Givental's J-function (essentially a generating function for
genus 0 invariants with 1 marked point) is key to computing stable quotients

basis of studies of (i) the role of WC stars in the evolution of massive stars,
(ii) the wind-driving mechanisms, and (iii) the feedback of WC stars as input

analyze the nearly complete sample of un-obscured Galactic WC stars, using
optical spectra as well as ultraviolet spectra when available. The observations
are fitted with theoretical spectra, using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model
atmosphere code. A large grid of line-blanked models has been established for
the range of WC subtypes WC4 - WC8, and smaller grids for the WC9 parameter
domain. Both WO stars and WN/WC transit types are also analyzed using special
models. Results: Stellar and atmospheric parameters are derived for more than
50 GalacticWC and two WO stars, covering almost the whole GalacticWC population
as far as the stars are single, and un-obscured in the visual. In the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, theWC stars reside between the hydrogen and the
helium zero-age main sequences, having luminosities L from 10^4.9 to 10^5.6
Lsun. The mass-loss rates scale very tightly with L^0.8. The two WO stars in
our sample turn out to be outstandingly hot (\approx200 kK) and do not fit into
the WC scheme. Conclusions: By comparing the empirical WC positions in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with evolutionary models, and from recent supernova
statistics, we conclude that WC stars have evolved from initial masses between
20 solar masses and 45 Msun. In contrast to previous assumptions, it seems that
WC stars in general do not descend from the most massive stars. Only the WO
stars might stem from progenitors that have been initially more massive than 45
Msun.

distance between each pair of words is at least k and the n words satisfy a set
of additional constraints. This problem has applications in, e.g., DNA
self-assembly and DNA arrays. Previous works include those that extended
results from coding theory to obtain bounds on code and word sizes for
biologically motivated constraints and those that applied heuristic local
searches, genetic algorithms, and randomized algorithms. In particular, Kao,
Sanghi, and Schweller (2009) developed polynomial-time randomized algorithms to
construct n DNA words of length within a multiplicative constant of the
smallest possible word length (e.g., 9 max{log n, k}) that satisfy various sets
of constraints with high probability. In this paper, we give deterministic
polynomial-time algorithms to construct DNA words based on derandomization
techniques. Our algorithms can construct n DNA words of shorter length (e.g.,
2.1 log n + 6.28 k) and satisfy the same sets of constraints as the words
constructed by the algorithms of Kao et al. Furthermore, we extend these new
algorithms to construct words that satisfy a larger set of constraints for
which the algorithms of Kao et al. do not work.

refinement code RAMSES. Four disks are selected from the MUGS (McMaster
Unbiased Galaxy Simulations) sample, generated with the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) code GASOLINE, alongside disks from Rahimi et al. (GCD+)
and Kobayashi & Nakasato (GRAPE-SPH). Two chemical evolution models of
inside-out disk growth were employed to contrast the temporal evolution of
their radial gradients with those of the simulations. We find that systematic
differences exist between the predicted evolution of radial abundance gradients
in the RaDES and chemical evolution models, compared with the MUGS sample;
specifically, the MUGS simulations are systematically steeper at high-redshift,
and present much more rapid evolution in their gradients. We find that the
majority of the models predict radial gradients today which are consistent with
those observed in late-type disks, but they evolve to this self-similarity in
different fashions, despite each adhering to classical `inside-out' growth. We
find that radial dependence of the efficiency with which stars form as a
function of time drives the differences seen in the gradients; systematic
differences in the sub-grid physics between the various codes are responsible
for setting these gradients. Recent, albeit limited, data at redshift z=1.5 are
consistent with the steeper gradients seen in our SPH sample, suggesting a
modest revision of the classical chemical evolution models may be required.

analysis poses a challenge for current galaxy formation models. Our results can
be summarized as follows: first, and contrary to observations of field
galaxies, these cluster galaxies are distributed almost equally amongst the
three main types of disk galaxy luminosity profiles (I/II/III), indicating that
the formation and/or survival of Type II breaks is suppressed within the
cluster environment. Second, we find examples of statistically-significant
inversions (""U-shapes"") in the age profiles of all three disk galaxy types,
reminescent of predictions from high-resolution simulations of
classically-truncated Type II disks in the field. These features characterize
the age profiles for only about a third (<36%) of each disk galaxy type in our
sample. An even smaller fraction of cluster disks (~11% of the total sample),
exhibit age profiles which decrease outwards (i.e., negative age gradients).
Instead, flat and/or positive age gradients prevail (>50%) within our Type I,
II and III sub-samples. These observations thus suggest that while stellar
migrations and inside-out growth can play a significant role in the evolution
of all disk galaxy types, other factors contributing to the evolution of
galaxies can overwhelm the predicted signatures of these processes. We
interpret our observations through a scenario whereby Virgo cluster disk
galaxies formed initially like their bretheren in the field but which, upon
falling into the cluster, were transformed into their present state through
external processes linked to the environment. Current disk galaxy formation
models fail to reproduce these results, thus calling for adequate
hydrodynamical simulations of dense galaxy environments, for which the current
paper provides many constraints. [Abridged]

theory which may have higher dimensional non-renormalizable operators. The
existence of these new operators can lead to interesting dynamics for the
evolution of the universe, including the appearance of new vacuum states. If
the universe today exists in a false vacuum, there will be a non-zero
probability to tunnel to the true vacuum state of the universe. Should this
transition occur elsewhere in the universe, bubbles of true vacuum will
nucleate and expand outwards. Bubbles that nucleate in the hot dense plasma of
the early universe will feel a friction from the plasma that acts against the
expansion of the bubble, until the bubble eventually reaches a steady state
expansion. Unlike many bubble formation scenarios where the bubble wall
velocity rapidly approaches the speed of light, friction from the hot
primordial plasma can cause the expanding bubble wall to reach a terminal
velocity while gravity waves are free to propagate through the hot dense plasma
at the speed of light. We analyze the effects of friction on the spectrum of
gravity waves caused by bubble collisions. We find that a phase transition in a
model with $\phi^6$ and $\phi^8$ operators that proceeds via a detonation in
the hot plasma of the early universe is unlikely. In the case of a
deflagration, the gravity wave spectrum is small and would likely require a
post-LISA experiment such as the Big Bang Observer, but is in principle,
observable.

factorization and resummation of Mellin moments of partonic cross-sections. We
consider various forms of the SCET result, which correspond to different
choices of the soft scale mu_s that characterizes this approach. We derive a
master formula that relates the SCET resummation to the QCD result for any
choice of mu_s. We then use it first, to show that if SCET resummation is
performed in N-Mellin moment space by suitable choice of mu_s it is equivalent
to the standard perturbative approach. Next, we show that if SCET resummation
is performed by choosing for mu_s a partonic momentum variable, the
perturbative result for partonic resummed cross-sections is again reproduced,
but like its standard perturbative counterpart it is beset by divergent
behaviour at the endpoint. Finally, using the master formula we show that when
mu_s is chosen as a hadronic momentum variable the SCET and standard approach
are related through a multiplicative (convolutive) factor, which contains the
dependence on the Landau pole and associated divergence. This factor depends on
the luminosity in a non-universal way; it lowers by one power of log the
accuracy of the resummed result, but it is otherwise subleading if one assumes
the luminosity not to contain logarithmically enhanced terms. Therefore, the
SCET approach can be turned into a prescription to remove the Landau pole from
the perturbative result, but the price to pay for this is the reduction by one
logarithmic power of the accuracy at each order and the need to make
assumptions on the parton luminosity.

with 50% of this increase from z~4 to z~1.8; and (4) the luminosity density
peaks at z~1-1.5, increasing by a factor of ~4 from z=4.0 to z~1-1.5, and
subsequently decreasing by a factor of ~1.5 by z=0.1. We find no evidence for a
steepening of the faint-end slope with redshift out to z=4, in contrast with
previous observational claims and theoretical predictions. The constant
faint-end slope suggests that the efficiency of stellar feedback may evolve
with redshift. Alternative interpretations are discussed, such as different
masses of the halos hosting faint galaxies at low and high redshifts and/or
environmental effects.

entropy of a massive lattice theory, showing significant deviations from naive
expectations. In particular, we show that finite size and finite mass effects
give rise to different contributions (with different exponents) and thus
violate a simple scaling argument.
  In the specific, we look at the entanglement entropy of a bipartite XYZ
spin-1/2 chain in its ground state. When the system is divided into two
semi-infinite half-chains, we have an analytical expression of the Renyi
entropy as a function of a single mass parameter. In the scaling limit, we show
that the entropy as a function of the correlation length formally coincides
with that of a bulk Ising model. This should be compared with the fact that, at
criticality, the model is described by a c=1 Conformal Field Theory and the
corrections to the entropy due to finite size effects show exponents depending
on the compactification radius of the theory. We will argue that there is no
contradiction between these statements.
  If the lattice spacing is retained finite, the relation between the mass
parameter and the correlation length generates new subleading terms in the
entropy, whose form is path-dependent in phase-space and whose interpretation
within a field theory is not available yet. These contributions arise as a
consequence of the existence of stable bound states and are thus a distinctive
feature of truly interacting theories, such as the XYZ chain.

holes are in place, so for a redshift z smaller than unity. Conversely, the
highest black hole formation rate corresponds to the peak in the cosmic star
formation history, earlier than z=1. This yields a fast declining \Lambda, by a
factor of about 5, from redshift 1 to 3. At even earlier times, before many
stars were formed, the value of \Lambda\ should be much smaller than its

probability of observing a trajectory associated with a prescribed driving
protocol, and the probability of its time-reverse. This forms the basis for a
general theoretical description of non-equilibrium thermodynamic pro- cesses.
Having established a connection between entropy production and an inequivalence
in probability for forward and time-reversed events, we proceed in the manner
of Sekimoto and Seifert, in particular, to derive results in stochastic
thermodynamics: a description of the evolution of a system between equilibrium
states that ties in with well-established thermodynamic expectations. We derive
fluctuation relations, state conditions for their validity, and illustrate
their op- eration in some simple cases, thereby providing some introductory
insight into the various celebrated symmetry relations that have emerged in

Universe, and are potentially the most effective tracer of the most distant

redshifts >5 is very scarce. We propose to improve this situation by obtaining
more observations of high-redshift hosts to better understand their properties
and help enable us to use GRBs as probes of the high-redshift universe. We
performed very deep photometric observations of three high-redshift GRB host
galaxies, GRB 080913 at z =6.7, GRB 060927 at z =5.5 and GRB 060522 at z =5.1.
In addition, we completed deep spectroscopic observations of the GRB080913 host
galaxy with X-Shooter at the VLT to search for Ly-alpha emission. For the sake
of the discussion, we use published results on another high-redshift GRB host,
GRB 050904 at z = 6.3. The sample of GRB host galaxies studied in this paper
consists of four out of the five spectroscopically confirmed GRBs at z>5.
Despite our presented observations being the deepest ever reported of
high-redshift GRB host galaxies, we do not detect any of the hosts, neither in
photometry nor in spectroscopy in the case of GRB 080913. These observations
indicate that the GRB host galaxies seem to evolve with time and to have lower
SFRs at z >5 than they have at z<1. In addition, the host galaxy of GRB 080913
at z =6.7 does not show Ly-alpha emission. While the measured properties of the

Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity towards a black hole formation threshold. When
the curvature is sufficiently large the additional higher order terms, affect
the evolution of the whole system. Since high curvature characterizes the
region when the critical behavior takes place this critical behavior is
destroyed. Both the self similarity and the mass scaling relation disappear.
Instead we find a different behavior near the black hole threshold, which
depends on the coupling constant of the higher order terms. The new features
include a change of the sign of the Ricci scalar on the origin which indicates
changes in the local geometry of space-time, and never occurs in classical
general relativity collapse, and oscillations with a constant rather than with
a diminishing length scale.

propensity scores in the social sciences is currently experiencing a tremendous

more wide-spread use of propensity score methods is the reliance on specialized
software, because many social scientists still use SPSS as their main analysis
tool. The current paper presents an implementation of various propensity score
matching methods in SPSS. Specifically the presented SPSS custom dialog allows
researchers to specify propensity score methods using the familiar
point-and-click interface. The software allows estimation of the propensity
score using logistic regression and specifying nearest-neighbor matching with
many options, e.g., calipers, region of common support, matching with and
without replacement, and matching one to many units. Detailed balance

show that gravitational radiation is emitted as long as the separation between

inspiral, they bob up and down sinusoidally. The understanding of this

today live in late-type galaxies, including bulge-less galaxies and those

similar stellar (or even bulge) mass. Here we discuss the predictions of two
state-of-the-art hierarchical galaxy formation models in which BHs grow via
mergers and, in one, also via disk instability. Our aim is to understand if the
wealth of new data on local BH demography is consistent with standard models.
We follow the merger trees of representative subsamples of BHs and compute the
fractional contributions of different processes to the final BH mass. We show
that the model in which BHs always closely follow the growth of their host
bulges, also during late disk instabilities (i.e., bars), produces too narrow a
distribution of BHs at fixed stellar mass to account for the numerous low-mass
BHs now detected in later-type galaxies. Models with a looser connection
between BH growth and bar instability instead predict the existence of a larger
number of undermassive BHs, in better agreement with the observations. The
scatter in the updated local BH-bulge mass relation (with no restriction on
galaxy type) appears to be quite large when including later-type systems, but
it can still be managed to be reproduced within current hierarchical models.
However, the fuelling of BHs during the late bar-instability mode needs to be
better quantified/improved to properly fit the data. We conclude discussing how
the possibly large number of BHs in later type galaxies demands for an in-depth
revision of the local BH mass function and its modelling.

Knot-A and Knot-B are both located along the western cavity wall opened by the

these two continuum sources are associated with bright, high-velocity 12CO(2-1)
emission, slightly shifted downstream of the outflow propagation direction with

Knot-B along the protostellar outflow cavity, the compactness of their 1.3-mm

that these two sources trace outflow features due to shocks along the cavity

use the Coulomb gas formalism to construct explicit contour integral formulas
for these correlation functions and thereby calculate the density of various
pinch-point configurations at arbitrary points in the rectangle, in the
hexagon, and for the case s=N, in the 2N-sided polygon at the system's critical
point. Explicit formulas for these results are given in terms of algebraic
functions or integrals of algebraic functions, particularly Lauricella
functions. In critical percolation, the result for s=N=2 gives the density of
red bonds between boundary clusters (in the continuum limit) inside a
rectangle. We compare our results with high-precision simulations of critical
percolation and Ising FK clusters in a rectangle of aspect ratio two and in a
regular hexagon and find very good agreement.

reliable view of the distant Hubble sequence, and its evolution over the past 6
Gyr. To achieve this goal, we have created a new morphological classification
method which (1) includes all the available observational data, (2) can be
easily reproduced, and (3) presents a negligible subjectivity. This method
allows us to study homogeneously the morphology of local and distant galaxies.
The first step has been to study the evolution of galaxies using the IMAGES
survey. This survey allowed us to establish the kinematic state of distant
galaxies, to study the chemical evolution of galaxies over the past 8 Gyr, and
to test important dynamical relations such as the Tully-Fisher relation. The
information gained from kinematics is, indeed, crucial to guarantee a robust
understanding of the different physical processes leading to the present day
Hubble sequence. Using Integral Field Spectroscopy, we have been able to test
our new morphological classification against the kinematic state of each
galaxy. We found that the morpho-kinematic correlation is much better using our
classification than other morphological classifications. Applying our
morphological classification to a representative sample of both local and
distant galaxies, having equivalent observational data, we obtained a Hubble
sequence both in the local and distant Universe. Our results strongly suggest
that more than half of the present-day spirals had peculiar morphologies, 6 Gyr
ago. Finally, I present further studies concerning the history of individual
galaxies at z < 1, combining kinematic and morphological observations. I also
present the first ever-estimated distant baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, which
does not appear to evolve over the past 6 Gyr.

momentum transport in a variety of astrophysical accretion disks. In systems
accreting at well below the Eddington rate, such as the central black hole in
the Milky Way (Sgr A*), the rate of Coulomb collisions between particles is
very small, making the disk evolve essentially as a collisionless plasma. We
present a nonlinear study of the collisionless MRI using first-principles
particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. In this initial study we focus on
local two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations, deferring more realistic
three-dimensional simulations to future work. For simulations with net vertical
magnetic flux, the MRI continuously amplifies the magnetic field until the
Alfv\'en velocity, v_A, is comparable to the speed of light, c (independent of
the initial value of v_A/c). This is consistent with the lack of saturation of
MRI channel modes in analogous axisymmetric MHD simulations. The amplification
of the magnetic field by the MRI generates a significant pressure anisotropy in
the plasma (with the perpendicular pressure being larger than the parallel
pressure). We find that this pressure anisotropy in turn excites mirror modes
and that the volume averaged pressure anisotropy remains near the threshold for
mirror mode excitation. Particle energization is due to both reconnection and
viscous heating associated with the pressure anisotropy. Reconnection produces
a distinctive power-law component in the energy distribution function of the
particles, indicating the likelihood of non-thermal ion and electron
acceleration in collisionless accretion disks. This has important implications
for interpreting the observed emission -- from the radio to the gamma-rays --
of systems such as Sgr A*.

Figures on the last pages are removed",,,,"hep-ph cond-mat.stat-mech nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, we study the critical dynamics near the QCD critical point.
  Near the critical point, the relevant modes for the critical dynamics are
identified as the hydrodynamic modes. Thus, we first study the linear dynamics
of them by the relativistic hydrodynamics.
  We show that the thermal diffusion mode is the most relevant mode, whereas
the sound mode is suppressed around the critical point. We also find that the
Landau equation, which is believed to be an acausal hydrodynamic equation, has
no problem to describe slowly varying fluctuations. Moreover, we find that the
Israel-Stewart equation, which is a causal one, gives the same result as the
Landau equation gives in the long-wavelength region.
  Next, we study the nonlinear dynamics of the hydrodynamic modes by the
nonlinear Langevin equation and the dynamic renormalization group (RG). In the
vicinity of the critical point, the usual hydrodynamics breaks down by large
fluctuations. Thus, we must consider the nonlinear Langevin equation. We
construct the nonlinear Langevin equation based on the generalized Langevin
theory. After the construction, we apply the dynamic RG to the Langevin
equation and derive the RG equation for the transport coefficients.
  We find that the resulting RG equation turns out to be the same as that for
the liquid-gas critical point except for an insignificant constant.
Consequently, the bulk viscosity and the thermal conductivity strongly diverge
at the critical point. Then, a system near the critical point can not be
described as a perfect fluid by their strong divergences.
  We also show that the thermal and viscous diffusion modes exhibit
critical-slowing down with the dynamic critical exponents z_{thermal} \sim 3
and z_{viscous} \sim 2, respectively.
  In contrast, the sound mode shows critical-speeding up with the negative
exponent z_{sound} \sim -0.8.

turbulence in a central volume of the size of the inertial scale is shown to
have negligible mean and shear. The Taylor Reynolds number is about 480.
  The influence of large scale anisotropy on the turbulence is examined from
three aspects, namely the velocity structure functions, the velocity
correlation functions, and the integral lengths. The directional dependence of
two different second order transverse structure functions, in which one of them
has separations stretched along the axis of symmetry of the turbulence and the
other one normal to it, is studied. It is shown that the inertial range scaling
exponents, determined using the extended-self-similarity procedure, and the
Kolmogorov constants of the two structure functions are unaffected by the
direction in which the structure functions are measured.
  Finally, it is found that, except in the isotropic case, the second order
transverse velocity correlation functions deviate from each other at the large
scale with increasing anisotropy. A self-similarity argument similar to one
found in the study of critical phenomena is proposed. It is shown that the
argument leads to a power-law relationship between the large scale velocity
fluctuation and the correlation length, with an exponent that depends on the
inertial range scaling exponent of the turbulence. The data collapse predicted
by the self-similarity hypothesis is verified. It is demonstrated that the
value of the power-law exponent is consistent with the value of the inertial
range scaling exponent.

variable hard X-ray emission. To elucidate the reasons for this emission, we
mounted a multiwavelength campaign in 2010 centered around 4 XMM observations.
The observational techniques included long baseline optical interferometry
(LBOI), monitoring by an Automated Photometric Telescope and Halpha
observations. Because gamma Cas is also known to be in a binary, we measured
Halpha radial velocities and redetermined its period as 203.55+/-0.2 days and
an eccentricity near zero. The LBOI observations suggest that the star's
decretion disk was axisymmetric in 2010, has an inclination angle near 45^o,
and a larger radius than previously reported. The Be star began an ""outburst""
at the beginning of our campaign, made visible by a disk brightening and
reddening during our campaign. Our analyses of the new high resolution spectra
disclosed many attributes found from spectra obtained in 2001 (Chandra) and
2004 (XMM). As well as a dominant hot 14 keV thermal component, these familiar
ones included: (i) a fluorescent feature of Fe K stronger than observed at
previous times, (ii) strong lines of N VII and Ne XI lines indicative of
overabundances, and (iii) a subsolar Fe abundance from K-shell lines but a
solar abundance from L-shell ions. We also found that 2 absorption columns are
required to fit the continuum. While the first one maintained its historical
average of 1X10^21 cm^-2, the second was very large and doubled to 7.4X10^23
cm^-2 during our X-ray observations. Although we found no clear relation
between this column density and orbital phase, it correlates well with the disk
brightening and reddening both in the 2010 and earlier observations. Thus, the
inference from this study is that much (perhaps all?) of the X-ray emission
from this source originates behind matter ejected by gamma Cas into our line of
sight.

Origins Deep Survey-South (GOODS-S) field. Our ETGs span a large redshift
range, 0.35 < z < 1.5, with each redshift spectroscopically-confirmed by
previous published surveys of the ERS field. We combine our measured WFC3 ERS
and ACS GOODS-S photometry to gain continuous sensitivity from the rest-frame
far-UV to near-IR emission for each ETG. The superior spatial resolution of the
HST over this panchromatic baseline allows us to classify the ETGs by their
small-scale internal structures, as well as their local environment. By fitting
stellar population spectral templates to the broad-band photometry of the ETGs,
we determine that the average masses of the ETGs are comparable to the
characteristic stellar mass of massive galaxies, 11< log(M [Solar]) < 12.
  By transforming the observed photometry into the GALEX FUV and NUV, Johnson
V, and SDSS g' and r' bandpasses we identify a noteworthy diversity in the
rest-frame UV-optical colors and find the mean rest-frame (FUV-V)=3.5 and
(NUV-V)=3.3, with 1$\sigma$ standard deviations approximately equal to 1.0. The
blue rest-frame UV-optical colors observed for most of the ETGs are evidence
for star-formation during the preceding gigayear, but no systems exhibit
UV-optical photometry consistent with major recent (<~50 Myr) starbursts.
Future publications which address the diversity of stellar populations likely
to be present in these ETGs, and the potential mechanisms by which recent
star-formation episodes are activated, are discussed.

the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition of the two-dimensional XY model. A
local pseudo-magnetization is introduced to characterize the symmetric
structure of the dynamic systems. The dynamic scaling behavior of the
pseudo-magnetization and Binder cumulant is carefully analyzed, and the
critical exponents are determined. To illustrate the dynamic effect of the
topological defect, similar analysis for the the dynamic relaxation with a
spin-wave initial state is also performed for comparison. We demonstrate that a
limited amount of quenched disorder in the core of the vortex state may alter
the dynamic universality class. Further, theoretical calculations based on the
long-wave approximation are presented.

limit, we show that the complex fugacity generates interference between
Euclidean path histories, i.e., monopole-instanton events, and radically alters
the vacuum structure. At theta=0, a mass gap is due to the monopole-instanton
plasma, and the theory has a unique vacuum. At theta=pi, the monopole induced
mass gap vanishes, despite the fact that monopole density is independent of
theta, due to destructive topological interference. The theory has two options:
to remain gapless or to be gapped with a two-fold degenerate vacua. We show the
latter is realized by the magnetic bion mechanism, and the two-vacua are
realization of spontaneous CP-breaking.
  The effect of the theta-term in the circle-compactified gauge theory is a
generalization of Aharonov-Bohm effect, and the geometric (Berry) phase. As
theta varies from 0 to pi, the gauge theory interpolates between even- and
odd-integer spin quantum anti-ferromagnets on two spatial dimensional
bi-partite lattices, which have ground state degeneracies one and two,
respectively, as it is in gauge theory at theta=0 and theta=pi.

Lines are completely understood: the contribution from isolated lines vanishes.
All other lines can be deformed holomorphically to the van Geemen lines, whose
superpotential is determined via the associated inhomogeneous Picard-Fuchs
equation. Substantial progress is made for conics: the families found by
Mustata contain conics reducible to isolated lines, hence they have a vanishing
superpotential. The search for all conics invariant under a residual Z2
symmetry reduces to an algebraic problem at the limit of our computational
capabilities. The main results are of arithmetic flavor: the extension of the
moduli space by the algebraic cycle splits in the large complex structure limit
into groups each governed by an algebraic number field. The expansion
coefficients of the superpotential around large volume remain irrational. The
integrality of those coefficients is revealed by a new, arithmetic twist of the
di-logarithm: the D-logarithm. There are several options for attempting to
explain how these invariants could arise from the A-model perspective. A
successful spacetime interpretation will require spaces of BPS states to carry
number theoretic structures, such as an action of the Galois group.

monetizing the use of the Internet. It is well-known that truthtelling is not a

this paper we study the space of equilibria in GSP, and quantify the efficiency
loss that can arise in equilibria under a wide range of sources of uncertainty,
as well as in the full information setting. The traditional Bayesian game
models uncertainty in the valuations (types) of the participants. The
Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction gives rise to a further form of
uncertainty: the selection of quality factors resulting in uncertainty about
the behavior of the underlying ad allocation algorithm. The bounds we obtain
apply to both forms of uncertainty, and are robust in the sense that they apply
under various perturbations of the solution concept, extending to models with
information asymmetries and bounded rationality in the form of learning
strategies.
  We present a constant bound (2.927) on the factor of the efficiency loss
(\emph{price of anarchy}) of the corresponding game for the Bayesian model of
partial information about other participants and about ad quality factors. For
the full information setting, we prove a surprisingly low upper bound of 1.282
on the price of anarchy over pure Nash equilibria, nearly matching a lower
bound of 1.259 for the case of three advertisers. Further, we do not require
that the system reaches equilibrium, and give similarly low bounds also on the
quality degradation for any no-regret learning outcome. Our conclusion is that
the number of advertisers in the auction has almost no impact on the price of
anarchy, and that the efficiency of GSP is very robust with respect to the
belief and rationality assumptions imposed on the participants.

method (WG-FEM) is developed in this paper for solving elliptic partial

The paper also presents many numerical tests for validating the WG-FEM for
solving second order elliptic interface problems. For such interface problems,
the solution possesses a certain singularity due to the nonsmoothness of the
interface. A challenge in research is to design high order numerical methods
that work well for problems with low regularity in the solution. The best known
numerical scheme in the literature is of order one for the solution itself in

of delivering numerical approximations that are of order 1.75 in the usual
$L_\infty$ norm for $C^1$ or Lipschitz continuous interfaces associated with a
$C^1$ or $H^2$ continuous solutions. Theoretically, it is proved that high

of the fluid is equivalent to the ultralocality of the holographic

AdS black hole with a topologically planar event horizon. However, when this

planar black hole, as used in most AdS/CFT analyses of QGP physics, is
""fragile"". The upshot is that the AdS/CFT duality apparently predicts that the

However, we argue that holography indicates that relatively low angular momenta
delay the development of the instability, so that in practice it may be
observable only for peripheral collisions involving favourable impact

signals related to the quasiparticle scattering interference and/or the
density-wave-like orders which are crucial in interpretation of the ground
states and the phase transitions in quasi-2D strongly correlated electron
systems such as cuprate and pnictide high-Tc superconductors. The octet model
has been used to describe the FTSTS data according to the simplified banana
band model of cuprates in superconducting ground state and worked well deep
inside the superconducting dome, but away from the superconducting ground state
the description starts to show severe limitations, such as appearance of
particle-hole asymmetry of the quasiparticle band as will be discussed later.
The first efforts to describe the FTSTS signals based on the fully-phased
Green's function-based quasiparticle scattering interference theory, however
lacked the full similarity to the FTSTS data, in part due to the lack of
accurate information on the tunneling and scattering matrix elements. In this
paper we discuss how the noise due to the potential disorder and the various
artifacts in the raw FTSTS data can be handled by a simple cross-sectional
analysis with an isotropic Gaussian averaging and modeling the set-point effect
by an energy-independent and position-dependent factor to the density of states
function. The result shows that in the cross-sectional presentation an enhanced
correlation exists between the FTSTS data and the theoretical simulation even
without the accurate model for the tunneling and the scattering matrix elements
and without the assumption for particle-hole symmetry, suggesting that it can
be a new starting point of a more robust quantum physical analysis framework
appropriate for the phase transition study in the high-Tc superconductors and
other strongly correlated electron systems.

fading Gaussian vector broadcast channels with perfect channel state
information (CSI) at the transmitter. A novel criterion for US is proposed,
which depends on both CSI and the data symbols, while conventional criteria
only depend on CSI. Since the optimization of US based on the proposed
criterion is infeasible, a greedy algorithm of data-dependent US is proposed to
perform the optimization approximately. An overhead issue arises in fast fading
channels: On every update of US, the transmitter might inform each user whether
he/she has been selected, using a certain fraction of resources. This overhead
results in a significant rate loss for fast fading channels. In order to
circumvent this overhead issue, iterative detection and decoding schemes are
proposed on the basis of belief propagation. The proposed iterative schemes
require no information about whether each user has been selected. The proposed
US scheme is compared to a data-independent US scheme. The complexity of the
two schemes is comparable to each other for fast fading channels. Numerical
simulations show that the proposed scheme can outperform the data-independent
scheme for fast fading channels in terms of energy efficiency, bit error rate,
and achievable sum rate.

network associated with a representable matroid. Therefore, constructing such
network-error correcting and detecting codes implies the construction of
certain representable matroids that satisfy some special conditions, and vice

error detecting and correcting networks with a specified capability of
network-error correction. Using these construction algorithms, a large class of

theoretical use and practical implementation, with parameters such as number of

to be comparable to the complexity of existing algorithms that design multicast
scalar linear network-error correcting codes. Finally we also show that linear
network coding is not sufficient for the general network-error detection

is to partition a collection of data points into disjoint clusters. Often a
bound $k$ on the number of clusters is given or assumed by the practitioner.
Many versions of this problem have been defined, most notably $k$-means and
$k$-median.
  An underlying problem with the unsupervised nature of clustering it that of
determining a similarity function. One approach for alleviating this difficulty
is known as clustering with side information, alternatively, semi-supervised
clustering. Here, the practitioner incorporates side information in the form of
""must be clustered"" or ""must be separated"" labels for data point pairs. Each
such piece of information comes at a ""query cost"" (often involving human
response solicitation). The collection of labels is then incorporated in the
usual clustering algorithm as either strict or as soft constraints, possibly
adding a pairwise constraint penalty function to the chosen clustering
objective.
  Our work is mostly related to clustering with side information. We ask how to
choose the pairs of data points. Our analysis gives rise to a method provably
better than simply choosing them uniformly at random. Roughly speaking, we show
that the distribution must be biased so as more weight is placed on pairs
incident to elements in smaller clusters in some optimal solution. Of course we
do not know the optimal solution, hence we don't know the bias. Using the
recently introduced method of $\eps$-smooth relative regret approximations of
Ailon, Begleiter and Ezra, we can show an iterative process that improves both
the clustering and the bias in tandem. The process provably converges to the
optimal solution faster (in terms of query cost) than an algorithm selecting
pairs uniformly.

formula for the capacity region of the interference channel with two pairs of

rectangles, where each rectangle is determined by a pair of spectral inf-mutual
information rates. Although the presented formula is usually difficult to
compute, it provides us useful insights into the interference channels. For
example, the formula suggests us that the simplest inner bounds (obtained by
treating the interference as noise) could be improved by taking into account
the structure of the interference processes. This is verified numerically by
computing the mutual information rates for Gaussian interference channels with
embedded convolutional codes.

In increasing T, the oscillation rapidly disappears once the thermal broadening

the edge with a depth which proportional to reciprocal of T, with v being the

nuclei and, more importantly, in the equation of state (EoS) of compact stars.
At present it is almost totally unknown, both experimentally and theoretically,
in the density regime appropriate for the interior of neutron stars. Basing on
a strong-coupled structure of dense baryonic matter encoded in the skyrmion
crystal approach with a topology change and resorting to the notion of
generalized HLS (hidden local symmetry) in hadronic interactions, we address a
variety of hitherto unexplored issues of nuclear interactions associated with
the symmetry energy, i.e., kaon condensation and hyperons, possible topology
change in dense matter, nuclear tensor forces, conformal symmetry and chiral
symmetry etc in the EoS of dense compact-star matter. One of the surprising
results coming from the hidden local symmetry structure that is distinct from
what is given by standard phenomenological approaches is that at high density,
baryonic matter is driven by RG flow to the ""dilaton-limit fixed point (DLFP)""
constrained by ""mended symmetries."" We further propose how to formulate kaon
condensation and hyperons in compact-star matter in a framework anchored on a
single effective Lagrangian by treating hyperons as the Callan-Klebanov
kaon-skyrmion bound states simulated on crystal lattice. This formulation
suggests that hyperons can figure in the stellar matter -- if at all -- when or
after kaons condense, in contrast to the standard phenomenological approaches
where the hyperons appear as the first strangeness degree of freedom in matter
thereby suppressing or delaying kaon condensation. In our simplified
description of the stellar structure in terms of symmetry energies which is
compatible with that of the 1.97 solar mass star, kaon condensation plays a
role of ""doorway state"" to strange-quark matter.

a simulation showing that transverse friction elicits a soft 'hindered rolling'

collider experiments. In the THDM-X, new Higgs bosons mostly decay into tau
leptons in the wide range of the parameter space. Such scalar bosons are less
constrained by current experimental data, because of the suppressed quark
Yukawa interactions. We discuss a search strategy of the THDM-X with multi-tau
lepton final states at International linear collider and Large Hadron Collider.
By using the collinear approximation, we show that a four tau lepton signature
(e^+e^- -> HA -> 4\tau) can be a clean signal.

analysed with a focus on lens and prism shaped fundamental cells. The
conjecture is tested that well proportioned spaces lead to a suppression of
large-scale anisotropies according to the observed cosmic microwave background
(CMB). The focus is put on lens spaces L(p,q) which are supposed to be oddly
proportioned. However, there are inhomogeneous lens spaces whose shape of the
Voronoi domain depends on the position of the observer within the manifold.
Such manifolds possess no fixed measure of well-proportioned and allow a
predestined test of the well-proportioned conjecture. Topologies having the
same Voronoi domain are shown to possess distinct CMB statistics which thus
provide a counter-example to the well-proportioned conjecture. The CMB

for the superior behaviour of the Poincar\'e dodecahedron is found.

structure in the pulse profile. An outburst of this source was discovered by
MAXI GSC in 2010 April. It was the first detection of the transient activity of
LS V +44 17 since the source was identified as a Be/X-ray binary in 1997. From
the data of the follow-up RXTE observation near the peak of the outburst, we
found a narrow dip structure in its pulse profile which was clearer in the
lower energy bands. The pulse-phase-averaged energy spectra in the 3$-$100 keV
band can be fitted with a continuum model containing a power-law function with
an exponential cutoff and a blackbody component, which are modified at low
energy by an absorption component. A weak iron K$\alpha$ emission line is also
detected in the spectra. From the pulse-phase-resolved spectroscopy we found
that the absorption column density at the dip phase was much higher than those
in the other phases. The dip was not seen in the subsequent RXTE observations
at lower flux levels. These results suggest that the dip in the pulse profile
originates from the eclipse of the radiation from the neutron star by the
accretion column.

formulation of the laws of physics needs a major overhaul. I here argue that
some effort should be directed toward manifestations of laws that are already
known, but whose implications are poorly understood in OPERA-type contexts. My
preferred example of this sort is that the OPERA result might be the first
observation of a previously unnoticed effect, belonging to a family of effects
which includes those responsible for the well-known peculiar properties of the
""tunneling time"". Tentative support for this specific hypothesis comes from the
presence of evanescence and ""postselection"", and the observation that the
fraction of neutrinos absorbed in rock on the way from CERN to LNGS is of a few
parts in $10^5$, i.e. comparable to the fraction of the overall travel time by
which OPERA neutrinos are found to reach LNGS earlier than expected. This leads
me to stress that the OPERA result is still consistent with subluminality of a
suitably ""postselection-corrected"" velocity. Adopting the popular (but here
disfavored) interpretation of the OPERA result as a ""signal velocity"" one could
obtain superluminal values of the postselection-corrected velocity in some
technologically feasible OPERA-like setups, a prediction which I propose to
test. I also propose a semi-heuristic formula for the ""rock dwell time"" and
find that it gives a result in rough agreement with the OPERA travel-time
measurements. This suggests that effects similar to the ones found for OPERA's
muon neutrinos should also be found, but with tangibly different magnitude, for
muon anti-neutrinos under similar experimental conditions. And I argue that,
whether or not they end up being relevant for the OPERA anomaly, the effects
here considered should be significant in the Planck-scale realm.

agreement with this prediction, 47 % of the Stokes V profiles analyzed has an

consistently for whatever value of the threshold on the amplitude asymmetry.

models in an integrated way that is capable of simulating the urban system. As
the interconnection of such models is not a trivial task, one of the key
elements that may be applied is the description of the urban geometric
properties in an ""interoperable"" way. Focusing on air quality as one of the
most pronounced urban problems, the geometric aspects of a city may be
described by objects such as those defined in CityGML, so that an appropriate
air quality model can be applied for estimating the quality of the urban air on
the basis of atmospheric flow and chemistry equations.
  In this paper we first present theoretical background and motivations for the
interconnection of 3D city models and other models related to sustainable
development and urban planning. Then we present a practical experiment based on
the interconnection of CityGML with an air quality model. Our approach is based
on the creation of an ontology of air quality models and on the extension of an
ontology of urban planning process (OUPP) that acts as an ontology mediator.

combining exact calculations, based on the integrability of the model, with
numerical calculations. Within linear response theory the absorbed intensity is
determined by the imaginary part of the dynamical susceptibility. The moments
of the normalized intensity can be used to define the shift of the resonance
frequency induced by the interactions and the line width independently of the
shape of the spectral line. These moments can be calculated exactly as
functions of temperature and strength of an external magnetic field, as long as
the field is directed along the symmetry axis of the chain. This allows us to
discuss the line width and the resonance shift for a given magnetic field in
the full range of possible anisotropy parameters. For the interpretation of
these data we need a qualitative knowledge of the line shape which we obtain
from fully numerical calculations for finite chains. Exact analytical results
on the line shape are out of reach of current theories. From our numerical work
we could extract, however, an empirical parameter-free model of the line shape
at high temperatures which is extremely accurate over a wide range of
anisotropy parameters and is exact at the free fermion point and at the
isotropic point. Another prediction of the line shape can be made in the
zero-temperature and zero magnetic field limit, where the sufficiently
anisotropic model shows strong absorption. For anisotropy parameters in the
massive phase we derive the exact two-spinon contribution to the spectral line.
From the intensity sum rule it can be estimated that this contribution accounts
for more than 80% of the spectral weight if the anisotropy parameter is
moderately above its value at the isotropic point.

into a class of two-agent distributed control systems in which the agents
cooperate in order to realize common goals that are determined via independent

actions taken are unknown in advance to the other agent. These goals can be
conveniently summarized in the form of a {\em target matrix}, whose entries are
computed by the control system responding to the choices of inputs made by the
two agents. We show how to realize such target matrices for a broad class of
systems that possess an input-output mapping that is bilinear. One can classify
control-communication strategies, known as {\em control protocols}, according
to the amount of information sharing occurring between the two agents.
Protocols that assume no information sharing on the inputs that each agent
selects and protocols that allow sufficient information sharing for identifying
the common goals are the two extreme cases. Control protocols will also be
evaluated and compared in terms of cost functionals given by integrated
quadratic functions of the control inputs. The minimal control cost of the two

predominantly above or below the band gap energy of ZB GaAs [E(g,ZB)]. This

WZ segments along the wire axis establish a type II band alignment, where
electrons captured within the ZB segments recombine with holes of the
neighboring WZ segments. Thus, the corresponding transition energy depends on
the degree of confinement of the electrons, and transition energies exceeding
E(g,ZB) are possible for very thin ZB segments. At low temperatures, the
incorporation of carbon acceptors plays a major role in determining the
spectral profile as these can effectively bind holes in the ZB segments. From
cathodoluminescence measurements of single GaAs NWs performed at room

four 4-dimensional vector (k, m, l, n). In the paper, a classification of
degenerate 4-dimensional real matrices of rank 1, 2, 3. is elaborated. To
separate possible classes of degenerate matrices of ranks 1 and 2, we impose
linear restrictions on (k, m, l, n), which are compatible with the group
multiplication law. All the subsets of matrices obtained by this method, are
either sub-groups or semigroups. To obtain singular matrices of rank 3, we
specify 16 independent possibilities to get 4-dimensional matrices with zero
determinant.

cyber-physical systems, heterogeneous information networks have become
increasingly popular and content-rich over time. In many cases, such networks
contain multiple types of objects and links, as well as different kinds of
attributes. The clustering of these objects can provide useful insights in many
applications. However, the clustering of such networks can be challenging since
(a) the attribute values of objects are often incomplete, which implies that an
object may carry only partial attributes or even no attributes to correctly
label itself; and (b) the links of different types may carry different kinds of
semantic meanings, and it is a difficult task to determine the nature of their
relative importance in helping the clustering for a given purpose. In this
paper, we address these challenges by proposing a model-based clustering
algorithm. We design a probabilistic model which clusters the objects of
different types into a common hidden space, by using a user-specified set of
attributes, as well as the links from different relations. The strengths of
different types of links are automatically learned, and are determined by the
given purpose of clustering. An iterative algorithm is designed for solving the
clustering problem, in which the strengths of different types of links and the
quality of clustering results mutually enhance each other. Our experimental
results on real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the algorithm.

have not been compared systematically under the same experimental framework, as
they were developed from two independent lines of research that do not refer to

technique should be adopted for a specific application. Furthermore, the
experimental evaluation of the existing techniques, as presented in previous
work, falls short in several aspects. Some methods were tested only on small
road networks with up to one hundred thousand vertices; some approaches were
evaluated using distance queries (instead of shortest path queries), namely,
queries that ask only for the length of the shortest path; a state-of-the-art

reducing the utility of information networks. To alleviate the negative impacts

filtering functionality. Thus, nodes are responsible for the removal (or
significant reduction) of the redundant data items relayed through them. We
refer to such nodes as filters. We formally define the Filter Placement problem

\phi_c, the probability of finding local crystalline configurations first
becomes finite and, for larger packing fractions, increases by several orders

Rayleigh scattering haze detected at optical wavelengths extends into the
near-infrared, or if it becomes transparent leaving molecular features to
dominate the transmission spectrum. Due to saturation and non-linearity
affecting the brightest (central) pixels of the spectrum, light curves were
extracted from the blue and red ends of the spectra only, corresponding to
wavelength ranges of 1.099-1.168 um and 1.521-1.693 um, respectively, for the
first visit, and 1.082-1.128 um and 1.514-1.671 um for the second. The light
curves were fitted using a Gaussian process model to account for instrumental
systematics whilst simultaneously fitting for the transit parameters. This
gives values of the planet-to-star radius ratio for the blue and red light
curves of 0.15650\pm0.00048 and 0.15634\pm0.00032, respectively, for visit one

consistent, and we see no evidence for the drop in absorption expected if the
haze that is observed in the optical becomes transparent in the infrared. This
tentatively suggests that the haze dominates the transmission spectrum of HD

of widely varying parameters. Binaries with separations of 100--1000 au are
prevalent in the Solar neighborhood; at these separations planet formation
around a binary member may largely proceed as if around a single star. During
the early dynamical evolution of a planetary system, planet--planet scattering
can eject planets from a star's grasp. In a binary, the motion of a planet
ejected from one star has effectively entered a restricted three-body system
consisting of itself and the two stars, and the equations of motion of the
three body problem will apply as long as the ejected planet remains far from
the remaining planets. Depending on its energy, escape from the binary as a
whole may be impossible or delayed until the three-body approximation breaks
down, and further close interactions with its planetary siblings boost its
energy when it passes close to its parent star. Until then this planet may be
able to transition from the space around one star to the other, and chaotically
`bounce' back and forth. In this paper we directly simulate scattering
planetary systems that are around one member of a circular binary, and quantify
the frequency of bouncing in scattered planets. We find that a great majority
(70 to 85 per cent) of ejected planets will pass at least once through the
space of it's host's binary companion, and depending on the binary parameters
about 45 to 75 per cent will begin bouncing. The time spent bouncing is roughly
log-normally distributed with a peak at about $10^4$ years, with only a small
percentage bouncing for more than a Myr. This process may perturb and possibly
incite instability among existing planets around the companion star. In rare
cases, the presence of multiple planets orbiting both stars may cause
post-bouncing capture or planetary swapping.

Empowerment is a recently introduced information-theoretic quantity motivated
by hypotheses about the efficiency of the sensorimotor loop in biological
organisms, but also from considerations stemming from curiosity-driven
learning. Empowemerment measures, for agent-environment systems with stochastic
transitions, how much influence an agent has on its environment, but only that
influence that can be sensed by the agent sensors. It is an
information-theoretic generalization of joint controllability (influence on
environment) and observability (measurement by sensors) of the environment by
the agent, both controllability and observability being usually defined in
control theory as the dimensionality of the control/observation spaces. Earlier
work has shown that empowerment has various interesting and relevant
properties, e.g., it allows us to identify salient states using only the
dynamics, and it can act as intrinsic reward without requiring an external
reward. However, in this previous work empowerment was limited to the case of
small-scale and discrete domains and furthermore state transition probabilities
were assumed to be known. The goal of this paper is to extend empowerment to
the significantly more important and relevant case of continuous vector-valued
state spaces and initially unknown state transition probabilities. The
continuous state space is addressed by Monte-Carlo approximation; the unknown
transitions are addressed by model learning and prediction for which we apply
Gaussian processes regression with iterated forecasting. In a number of
well-known continuous control tasks we examine the dynamics induced by
empowerment and include an application to exploration and online model
learning.

""Let C and D be two smooth conics in the projective complex plane. If D passes
through the n(n-1)/2 vertices of a complete polygon with n sides tangent to C
then D passes through the vertices of infinitely many such polygons."" According
to Marcel Berger this theorem is the nicest result about the geometry of
conics. Even if it is, there are few proofs of it. To my knowledge there are
only three. The first proof, published in 1822 and based on infinitesimal
deformations, is due to Poncelet. Later, Jacobi proposed a new proof based on
finite order points on elliptic curves; his proof, certainly the most famous,
is explained in a modern way and in detail by Griffiths and Harris. In 1870
Weyr proved a Poncelet theorem in space (more precisely for two quadrics) that
implies the one above when one quadric is a cone; this proof is explained by
Barth and Bauer. Our aim in this short note is to involve vector bundles
techniques to propose a new proof of this celebrated result. Poncelet did not
appreciate Jacobi's for the reason that it was too far from the geometric
intuition. I guess that he would not appreciate our proof either for the same
reason.
