spacetimes with symmetries and their possible relation with the theory of black
holes. We will concetrate specially on one aspect of this possible equivalence,
namely whether the static black hole uniqueness theorems extend to static
spacetimes containing marginally outer trapped surfaces. The principal result
of this thesis states that this question has an affirmative answer, under
suitable not global-in-time conditions on the spacetime. Furthermore, in order
to solve this question, we will obtain several results which generalize known
properties of static spacetimes to the initial data setting and can be of
independent interest. Finally, we will study the Penrose inequality in static
initial data which are not time-symmetric. Our main result in this last part of
the thesis is the discovery of a counter-example of a recent version of the
Penrose inequality proposed by Bray and Khuri in 2009.

the BH model with one type of spinless bosons agrees quantitatively with
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Our approach is numerically less
intensive than such simulations, so we are able to perform calculation on
experimentally realistic, large 3D systems, explore a wide range of parameter
values, and make direct contact with a variety of experimental measurements. We
also generalize our inhomogeneous mean-field theory to study BH models with
harmonic traps and (a) two species of bosons or (b) spin-1 bosons. With two
species of bosons we obtain rich phase diagrams with a variety of SF and MI
phases and associated shells, when we include a quadratic confining potential.
For the spin-1 BH model we show, in a representative case, that the system can
display alternating shells of polar SF and MI phases; and we make interesting
predictions for experiments in such systems.

probability models for the shape and size of simply connected 2D closed curves,
avoiding the need to specify landmarks through modeling the entire curve while
borrowing information across curves for related objects. Prevalent approaches
follow a fundamentally different strategy in providing an initial point
estimate of the curve and/or locations of landmarks, which are then fed into
subsequent statistical analyses. Such two-stage methods ignore uncertainty in
the first stage, and do not allow borrowing of information across objects in
estimating object shapes and sizes. Our fully Bayesian hierarchical model is
based on multiscale deformations within a linear combination of cyclic basis
characterization, which facilitates automatic alignment of the different curves
accounting for uncertainty. The characterization is shown to be highly flexible
in representing 2D closed curves, leading to a nonparametric Bayesian prior
with large support. Efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are developed
for simultaneous analysis of many objects. The methods are evaluated through

electrons released by the sources and spreading into the interstellar medium.
We use the data from the Fermi gamma-ray telescope to locate the degree-scale
100 GeV gamma-ray sources. We find that the number of such sources and their
overall power match to those expected when CRs injection events happen every
~100 yr in portions of ~1e50 erg. We find that most of the sources are
associated to pulsars with spin down age less than ~30 kyr and hence to the
recent supernova explosions. This supports the hypothesis of supernova origin
of Galactic CRs. We notice that the degree-scale extended emission does not
surround shell-like supernova remnants without pulsars. Based on this
observation, we argue that the presence of the pulsar is essential for the CR
acceleration process. We expect that a significant fraction of the degree-scale
sources should be detectable as extended sources with km3-scale neutrino
detectors.

the use of digital fountain codes along with conventional Reed-Solomon block

$\mathbb{R}P^{d-1}$, inputs $u_t$ are in a manifold $U$ of arbitrary finite
dimension, and $A \colon U \to GL(d,\mathbb{R})$ is a differentiable mapping.
  An input sequence $(u_0,\ldots,u_{N-1})$ is called universally regular if for
any initial state $\xi_0 \in \mathbb{R}P^{d-1}$, the derivative of the time-$N$
state with respect to the inputs is onto.
  In this paper we deal with the universal regularity of constant input
sequences $(u_0, \dots, u_0)$. Our main result states that generically in the
space of such systems, for sufficiently large $N$, all constant inputs of
length $N$ are universally regular, with the exception of a discrete set. More
precisely, the conclusion holds for a $C^2$-open and $C^\infty$-dense set of
maps $A$, and $N$ only depends on $d$ and on the dimension of $U$. We also show
that the inputs on that discrete set are nearly universally regular; indeed
there is a unique non-regular initial state, and its corank is $1$.
  In order to establish the result, we study the spaces of bilinear control
systems. We show that the codimension of the set of systems for which the zero
input is not universally regular coincides with the dimension of the control
space. The proof is based on careful matrix analysis and some elementary
algebraic geometry. Then the main result follows by applying standard
transversality theorems.

complementary photometric data from the COSMOS survey, we explore segregation
effects occurring in groups of galaxies at intermediate/high redshifts. We
built two composite groups at intermediate (0.2 <= z <= 0.45) and high (0.45 <
z <= 0.8) redshifts, and we divided the corresponding composite group galaxies
into three samples according to their distance from the group center. We
explored how galaxy stellar masses and colors - working in narrow bins of
stellar masses - vary as a function of the galaxy distance from the group
center. We found that the most massive galaxies in our sample (Log(M_gal/M_sun)
>= 10.6) do not display any strong group-centric dependence of the fractions of
red/blue objects. For galaxies of lower masses (9.8 <= Log(M_gal/M_sun) <=
10.6) there is a radial dependence in the changing mix of red and blue
galaxies. This dependence is most evident in poor groups, whereas richer groups
do not display any obvious trend of the blue fraction. Interestingly, mass
segregation shows the opposite behavior: it is visible only in rich groups,
while poorer groups have a a constant mix of galaxy stellar masses as a
function of radius. We suggest a simple scenario where color- and
mass-segregation originate from different physical processes. While dynamical
friction is the obvious cause for establishing mass segregation, both
starvation and galaxy-galaxy collisions are plausible mechanisms to quench star
formation in groups at a faster rate than in the field. In poorer groups the
environmental effects are caught in action superimposed to secular galaxy
evolution. Their member galaxies display increasing blue fractions when moving
from the group center to more external regions, presumably reflecting the
recent accretion history of these groups.

role in a variety of knowledge management and information diffusion tasks. The
nodes in these networks correspond to individuals who are self-interested. The
topology of these networks often plays a crucial role in deciding the ease and
speed with which certain tasks can be accomplished using these networks.
Consequently, growing a stable network having a certain topology is of
interest. Motivated by this, we study the following important problem: given a
certain desired network topology, under what conditions would best response
(link addition/deletion) strategies played by self-interested agents lead to
formation of a pairwise stable network with only that topology. We study this
interesting reverse engineering problem by proposing a natural model of
recursive network formation. In this model, nodes enter the network
sequentially and the utility of a node captures principal determinants of
network formation, namely (1) benefits from immediate neighbors, (2) costs of
maintaining links with immediate neighbors, (3) benefits from indirect
neighbors, (4) bridging benefits, and (5) network entry fee. Based on this
model, we analyze relevant network topologies such as star graph, complete
graph, bipartite Turan graph, and multiple stars with interconnected centers,
and derive a set of sufficient conditions under which these topologies emerge
as pairwise stable networks. We also study the social welfare properties of the
above topologies.

observed as part of the Sloan WFC Edge-on Late-type Lens Survey (SWELLS)
project. Fifteen of the lenses are taken from paper I while five are newly
discovered systems. The systems are galaxy-galaxy lenses where the foreground
deflector has an inclined disc, with a wide range of morphological types, from
late-type spiral to lenticular. For each system, we compare the total mass
inside the critical curve inferred from gravitational lens modelling to the
stellar mass inferred from stellar population synthesis (SPS) models, computing
the stellar mass fraction f* = M(SPS)/M(lens). We find that, for the lower mass
SWELLS systems, adoption of a Salpeter stellar initial mass function (IMF)
leads to estimates of f* that exceed 1. This is unphysical, and provides strong
evidence against the Salpeter IMF being valid for these systems. Taking the
lower mass end of the SWELLS sample sigma(SIE) < 230 km/s, we find that the IMF
is lighter (in terms of stellar mass-to-light ratio) than Salpeter with 98%
probability, and consistent with the Chabrier IMF and IMFs between the two.
This result is consistent with previous studies of spiral galaxies based on
independent techniques. In combination with recent studies of massive
early-type galaxies that have favoured a heavier Salpeter-like IMF, this result
strengthens the evidence against a universal stellar IMF.

outburst of the Galactic black hole candidate X-ray binary H1743-322. With the
high angular resolution of the Very Long Baseline Array, we resolve the jet
ejection event and measure the proper motions of the jet ejecta relative to the
position of the compact core jets detected at the beginning of the outburst.
This allows us to accurately couple the moment when the jet ejection event
occurred with X-ray spectral and timing signatures. We find that X-ray timing
signatures are the best diagnostic of the jet ejection event in this outburst,
which occurred as the X-ray variability began to decrease and the Type C
quasi-periodic oscillations disappeared from the X-ray power density spectrum.
However, this sequence of events does not appear to be replicated in all black
hole X-ray binary outbursts, even within an individual source. In our
observations of H1743-322, the ejection was contemporaneous with a quenching of
the radio emission, prior to the start of the major radio flare. This
contradicts previous assumptions that the onset of the radio flare marks the
moment of ejection. The jet speed appears to vary between outbursts, with a
possible positive correlation with outburst luminosity. The compact core radio
jet reactivated on transition to the hard intermediate state at the end of the
outburst, and not when the source reached the low hard spectral state.
Comparison with the known near-infrared behaviour of the compact jets suggests

reliability of such measurements. Here we examine the apparent radius in a
homogeneous sample of long, mixed H/He bursts from the low-mass X-ray binaries
GS 1826-24 and KS 1731-26. The measured blackbody normalisation (proportional
to the emitting area) in these bursts is constant over a period of up to 60s in
the burst tail, even though the flux (blackbody temperature) decreased by a
factor of 60-75% (30-40%). The typical rms variation in the mean normalisation
from burst to burst was 3-5%, although a variation of 17% was found between
bursts observed from GS 1826-24 in two epochs. A comparison of the
time-resolved spectroscopic measurements during bursts from the two epochs
shows that the normalisation evolves consistently through the burst rise and
peak, but subsequently increases further in the earlier epoch bursts. The
elevated normalisation values may arise from a change in the anisotropy of the
burst emission, or alternatively variations in the spectral correction factor,
f_c, of order 10%. Since burst samples observed from systems other than GS
1826-24 are more heterogeneous, we expect that systematic uncertainties of at
least 10% are likely to apply generally to measurements of neutron-star radii,

high-mass star formation, however the local environment in which they form is
still unclear. Four primary, yet conflicting, models have emerged to explain
the commonly observed methanol maser structures at 6.67 GHz. These suggest that
masers trace accretion disks, outflows, shock fronts or disks dominated by
infall/outflows. One proposed means of testing these models is through mapping
the local magnetic field structures around maser sources, which were predicted
to lie parallel to shock and outflows and perpendicular to accretion disks. To
follow up this suggestion we have determined magnetic field directions from
full polarisation observations of 10 6.67-GHz sources. We find morphology that
is parallel to the source structure, indicative of shocks or outflows, in five
sources and perpendicular morphology indicative of disks in three. These
results do not support any of the expected models and the diverse morphologies
observed indicate that the masers could be emitting from different evolutionary
stages or environments, or from a common local environment with complex
associated magnetic fields. To resolve this conflict we suggest a new approach
that will search the simulations of massive star formation, which are just
becoming available, for suitable sites for maser emission.

attributed to the strong atom-cavity coupling. The pulling distribution gives
rise to a spectral broadening, which can be dominant over the non-dispersive
broadening addressed in the previous works. We also developed a corresponding

a generalized NFW dark matter halo and a stellar mass distribution obtained by
deprojecting the MGE fit to the high-resolution K'-band LGSAO imaging data of
the galaxy, with the (spatially constant) M/L ratio as a free parameter. We

Quantum strategies may improve the precision, for noiseless processes, by an

computing systems has attracted a great deal of attention. In response to this,
many energy-aware scheduling algorithms have been developed primarily using the
dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) capability which has been incorporated
into recent commodity processors. Majority of these algorithms involve two
passes: schedule generation and slack reclamation. The former pass involves the
redistribution of tasks among DVFS-enabled processors based on a given cost
function that includes makespan and energy consumption; and, while the latter
pass is typically achieved by executing individual tasks with slacks at a lower
processor frequency. In this paper, a new slack reclamation algorithm is
proposed by approaching the energy reduction problem from a different angle.
Firstly, the problem of task slack reclamation by using combinations of
processors' frequencies is formulated. Secondly, several proofs are provided to
show that (1) if the working frequency set of processor is assumed to be
continues, the optimal energy will be always achieved by using only one
frequency, (2) for real processors with a discrete set of working frequencies,
the optimal energy is always achieved by using at most two frequencies, and (3)
these two frequencies are adjacent/neighbouring when processor energy
consumption is a convex function of frequency. Thirdly, a novel algorithm to
find the best combination of frequencies to result the optimal energy is
presented. The presented algorithm has been evaluated based on results obtained
from experiments with three different sets of task graphs: 3000 randomly
generated task graphs, and 600 task graphs for two popular applications
(Gauss-Jordan and LU decomposition). The results show the superiority of the
proposed algorithm in comparison with other techniques.

cosmology, these contradictions are removed or alleviated by the introduction
of three completely independent new components of stress-energy -- the
inflaton, dark matter, and dark energy. Each of these in its turn is meant to
have (or to currently) dominate the dynamics of the universe. There is still no
non-gravitational evidence for any of these dark sectors; nor for the required
extensions of the standard model. An alternative is to imagine that GR itself
must be modified. Certain coincidences of scale even suggest that one might
expect not to have to make three independent. Because they must address the
most different types of data, attempts to replace dark matter with modified
gravity are the most controversial. A phenomenological model (or family of
models), Modified Newtonian Dynamics, has, over the last few years seen several
covariant realizations. We discuss a number of challenges that any model that
seeks to replace dark matter with modified gravity must face: the loss of
Birkhoff's Theorem, and the calculational simplifications it implies; the
failure to explain clusters, whether static or interacting, and the consequent
need to introduce dark matter of some form, whether hot dark matter neutrinos,
or dark fields that arise in new sectors of the modified gravity theory; the
intrusion of cosmological expansion into the modified force law, that arises
precisely because of the coincidence in scale between the centripetal
acceleration at which Newtonian gravity fails in galaxies, and the cosmic
acceleration. We conclude with the observation that, although modified gravity
may indeed manage to replace dark matter, it is likely to do so by becoming or
incorporating, a dark matter theory itself.

self-consistent mean field method. We demonstrate the existence of edge
superconducting state (ESS), in which the bulk is still an insulator and the
superconductivity only appears near the edges. The ESS results from the special
energy dispersion of TI, and is a general property of the superconductivity in
TI. The phase transition in this model essentially consists of two steps. When
the attractive U becomes nonzero, ESS appears immediately. After the attractive
U exceeds a critical value $U_c$, the whole system becomes a superconductor.
The effective model of the ESS has also been discussed and we believe that the
conception of ESS can be realized in atomic optical lattice system.

covariance structure is non-singular. It can also be used in the case where the
covariance structure is singular, because the method identifies particular
non-stochastic linear combinations of the observations which must be
constrained to zero. In order to use this method, the Cholesky decomposition
has to be generalized to symmetric and indefinite matrices using complex
arithmetic methods. This method is applied to the problem of determining the
spatial size (vertex) for the Higgs Boson decay in the Higgs -> 4 lepton
channel. A comparison based on the Chi-Square variable from the vertex fit for
Higgs signal and t-tbar background is presented and shows that the background
can be greatly suppressed using the Chi-Square variable. One of the major
advantages of this novel method over the currently adopted technique of
b-tagging is that it is not affected by multiple interactions (pile up).

vector in all or part of the region. We compare the colors with those of
scattered continuum associated with the low-mass protostar L 1527, modeled
scattered continuum in cavities, shocked emission associated with low-mass
protostars, modeled H2 emission for thermal and fluorescent cases, and modeled
PAH emission. Of the emission mechanisms discussed above, scattered continuum
provides the simplest explanation for the observed linear correlation. In this
case, the color variation within each object is attributed to different
foreground extinctions at different positions. Alternative possible emission
mechanisms to explain this correlation may be a combination of thermal and
fluorescent H2 emission in shocks, and a combination of scattered continuum and
thermal H2 emission, but detailed models or spectroscopic follow-up are
required to further investigate this possibility. Our color-color diagrams also
show possible contributions from PAHs in two objects. However, none of our
sample show clear evidence for PAH emission directly associated with the
high-mass protostars, several of which should be associated with ionizing
radiation. This suggests that those protostars are heavily embedded even at
mid-infrared wavelengths.

Impl(t) satisfies a specification Spec(t) for all instantiations of parameter

in a network, the type of data, the capacities of buffers, etc. The main theme
of this paper is automation of uniform verification of a subclass of PMCP with
the parameter of the first kind, i.e. the number of processes in the network.
We use CSP as our formalism. We present a type reduction theory, which, for a
given verification problem, establishes a function \phi that maps all
(sufficiently large) instantiations T of the parameter to some fixed type T^
and allows us to deduce that if Spec(T^) is refined by \phi(Impl(T)), then
(subject to certain assumptions) Spec(T) is refined by Impl(T). The theory can
be used in practice by combining it with a suitable abstraction method that
produces a t-independent process Abstr that is refined by {\phi}(Impl(T)) for
all sufficiently large T. Then, by testing (with a model checker) if the
abstract model Abstr refines Spec(T^), we can deduce a positive answer to the
original uniform verification problem. The type reduction theory relies on
symbolic representation of process behaviour. We develop a symbolic operational
semantics for CSP processes that satisfy certain normality requirements, and we
provide a set of translation rules that allow us to concretise symbolic
transition graphs. Based on this, we prove results that allow us to infer
behaviours of a process instantiated with uncollapsed types from known
behaviours of the same process instantiated with a reduced type. One of the
main advantages of our symbolic operational semantics and the type reduction
theory is their generality, which makes them applicable in a wide range of
settings.

several results for small-world and tree-like random graph models. First, we
study the hyperbolicity of Kleinberg small-world random graphs and show that
the hyperbolicity of these random graphs is not significantly improved
comparing to graph diameter even when it greatly improves decentralized
navigation. Next we study a class of tree-like graphs called ringed trees that
have constant hyperbolicity. We show that adding random links among the leaves
similar to the small-world graph constructions may easily destroy the
hyperbolicity of the graphs, except for a class of random edges added using an
exponentially decaying probability function based on the ring distance among
the leaves.
  Our study provides one of the first significant analytical results on the
hyperbolicity of a rich class of random graphs, which shed light on the
relationship between hyperbolicity and navigability of random graphs, as well

With our time-dependent model atmosphere code PHOENIX, our goal is to
simulate light curves and spectra of hydrodynamical models of all types of
supernovae. In this work, we simulate near-infrared light curves of SNe Ia and
confirm the cause of the secondary maximum. Methods. We apply a simple energy
solver to compute the evolution of an SN Ia envelope during the free expansion
phase. Included in the solver are energy changes due to expansion, the energy
deposition of {\gamma}-rays and interaction of radiation with the material.
Results. We computed theoretical light curves of several SN Ia hydrodynamical
models in the I, J, H, and K bands and compared them to the observed SN Ia
light curves of SN 1999ee and SN 2002bo. By changing a line scattering
parameter in time, we obtained quite reasonable fits to the observed
near-infrared light curves. This is a strong hint that detailed NLTE effects in
IR lines have to be modeled, which will be a future focus of our work.
Conclusions. We found that IR line scattering is very important for the
near-infrared SN Ia light curve modeling. In addition, the recombination of Fe
III to Fe II and of Co III to Co II is responsible for the secondary maximum in
the near-infrared bands. For future work the consideration of NLTE for all
lines (including the IR subordinate lines) will be crucial.

step process consisting of electron capture to form an intermediate shape

its natural life time or its interaction with the surface. The electron capture
is modeled using the Keldysh Green's function technique and the negative ion
decay is described by a combination of the Keldysh technique and a rate

efficient and the natural decay to be clearly dominating over the
surface-induced decay. Secondary electron emission coefficients are calculated
for aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, silicon oxide, and diamond at several
kinetic energies of the projectile. With the exception of magnesium oxide the
coefficients turn out to be of the order of 0.1 over the whole range of kinetic
energies. This rather large value is a direct consequence of the shape
resonance acting as a relay state for electron emission.

spontaneous CP violation. Associated with each complex scalar field is a U(1)
symmetry that may be explicitly broken by terms in the scalar potential (called
spurions). In order for CP-odd phases in the vacuum to be physical, these
phases must be related to spontaneously broken U(1) generators that are also
explicitly broken by a sufficient number of inequivalent spurions. In the case
where the vacuum is characterized by a single complex phase, our result implies
that the phase must be associated with a U(1) generator that is broken
explicitly by at least two inequivalent spurions. A suitable generalization of
this result to the case of multiple complex phases has also been obtained.
These conditions may be used both to distinguish models capable of spontaneous
CP violation, and as a model building technique for obtaining spontaneously
CP-violating deformations of CP conserving models. As an example, we analyze
the generic two Higgs doublet model, where we also carry out a complete spurion
analysis. We also comment on other models with spontaneous CP violation,
including the chiral Lagrangian, a minimal version of Nelson-Barr model, and
little Higgs models with spontaneous CP violation.

demonstrate that the overall spin down trend continues and is stronger than
ever. We compare the observations with predictions from a model assuming

the history of the assembly and evolution of galaxies. Here, we develop a
method to study the CSFR from a purely theoretical point of view. Starting from
detailed models of chemical evolution, we obtain the histories of star
formation of galaxies of different morphological types. These histories are
then used to determine the luminosity functions of the same galaxies by means
of a spectro-photometric code. We obtain the CSFR under different hypothesis.
First, we study the hypothesis of a pure luminosity evolution scenario, in
which all galaxies are supposed to form at the same redshift and then evolve
only in luminosity. Then we consider scenarios in which the number density or
the slope of the LFs are assumed to vary with redshift. After comparison with
available data we conclude that a pure luminosity evolution does not provide a
good fit to the data, especially at very high redshift, although many
uncertainties are still present in the data. On the other hand, a variation in
the number density of ellipticals and spirals as a function of redshift can
provide a better fit to the observed CSFR. We also explore cases of variable
slope of the LFs with redshift and variations of number density and slope at
the same time. We cannot find any of those cases which can improve the fit to
the data respect to the solely number density variation. Finally, we compute
the evolution of the average cosmic metallicity in galaxies with redshift.

we estimate interdependencies between these time series. With clustering
coefficient and average shortest path length, we observe unweighted interaction
networks, derived via thresholding the values of interdependence, to possess
non-trivial topologies as compared to Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi networks, which would
indicate small-world characteristics. These topologies reflect the mostly
unavoidable finiteness of the data, which limits the reliability of typically
used estimators of signal interdependence. We propose random networks that are
tailored to the way interaction networks are derived from empirical data.

interaction in a weak-field limit of Kaluza-Klein models. We explain why some
models meet the classical gravitational tests, while others do not. We show
that variation of the total volume of the internal spaces generates the fifth
force. This is the main reason of the problem. It happens for all considered
models (linear with respect to the scalar curvature and nonlinear $f(R)$, with
toroidal and spherical compactifications). We explicitly single out the
contribution of the fifth force to nonrelativistic gravitational potentials. In
the case of models with toroidal compactification, we demonstrate how tension
(with and without effects of nonlinearity) of the gravitating source can fix
the total volume of the internal space, resulting in the vanishing fifth force
and consequently in agreement with the observations. It takes place for latent
solitons, black strings and black branes. We also demonstrate a particular
example where non-vanishing variations of the internal space volume do not
contradict the gravitational experiments. In the case of spherical
compactification, the fifth force is replaced by the Yukawa interaction for
models with the stabilized internal space. For large Yukawa masses, the effect
of this interaction is negligibly small, and considered models satisfy the
gravitational tests at the same level of accuracy as general relativity.

radial-tangential broadening technique during our 1D LTE investigation. We have
shown that, from a statistical point of view, one must consider using a

concentric spherical boundary on the self-energy of a point-like scalar charged
test particle at rest. We assume that the boundary is outside the monopole's
core with a general spherically symmetric inner structure. An important
quantity to this analysis is the three-dimensional Green function associated
with this system. For both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions obeyed by
the scalar field on the sphere, the Green function presents a structure that
contains contributions due to the background geometry of the spacetime and the
boundary. Consequently the corresponding induced scalar self-energy present
also similar structure. For points near the sphere the boundary-induced part
dominates and the self-force is repulsive/attractive with respect to the
boundary for Dirichlet/Neumann boundary condition. In the region outside the
sphere at large distances from it, the boundary-free part in the self-energy
dominates and the corresponding self-force can be either attractive or
repulsive with dependence of the curvature coupling parameter for scalar field.
In particular, for the minimal coupling we show the presence of a stable
equilibrium point for Dirichlet boundary condition. In the region inside the
sphere the nature of the self-force depends on the specific model for the
monopole's core. As illustrations of the general procedure adopted we shall
consider two distinct models, namely flower-pot and the ballpoint-pen ones.

and upper limits for N in RHB stars. The RHB stars clearly separate into two
groups: the vast majority are O-rich and Na-poor, while about 10-15% are
Na-rich and moderately O-poor. Most Na-rich RHB stars are also Ba-rich and
there is an overall correlation between Na and Ba abundances within the RHB.
The group of Ba-rich RHB stars resides on the warmer edge and includes ~10% of
the RHB stars. We propose that they are the descendant of the stars on the RGB
sequence with very red v-y colour. This sequence is known also to consist of Ba
and perhaps CNO-rich stars. However, the upper limit we obtain for N
([N/Fe]<1.55) for one of the Ba-rich stars coupled with the low C-abundances
for RGB Ba-rich stars from the literature suggests that the total CNO might not
be particularly high ([(C+N+O)/Fe]<=0.15). The other Na-rich RHB stars are also
at the warm edge of the RHB and the only RR Lyrae is Na-rich and moderately
O-poor. We also find a Na-O anticorrelation among BHB stars, partially
overlapping that found among RHB stars, though generally BHB stars are more
Na-rich and O-poor. However, there is no clear correlation between temperature
and Na and O abundances within the BHB. The average He abundance in BHB stars
is Y=0.29+/-0.05. N abundances are quite uniform at [N/Fe]=1.16+/-0.14 among
BHB stars, with a small trend with temperature. This value is consistent with
normal CNO abundance and excludes that BHB stars are very CNO-rich: this leaves
an age spread of ~1.5 Gyr as the only viable explanation for the split of the
SGB. [Abridged]

a better fit to the observed molecular ring than a true ring feature. This is
because both a spiral arm, and the observed feature known as the molecular

emission in the velocity longitude map can be fitted by a nearly symmetric 2
armed spiral pattern. One of the arms corresponds to the molecular ring, whilst
the opposite arm naturally reproduces the Perseus arm. Multiple arms also
contribute to further emission in the vicinity of the molecular ring and match

water from the first stages of star formation to the formation of planets and
comets. Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO
towards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water
formation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral
survey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the
CHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of
numerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with
ground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code
RATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an
abundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a
similar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope
lines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of
1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption
lines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It
may correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices
at the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot
corino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8%
in the added absorbing layer. Although it is clearly higher than the cosmic D/H
abundance, the HDO/H2O ratio remains lower than the D/H ratio derived for other
deuterated molecules observed in the same source. The similarity of the ratios
derived in the hot corino and in the added absorbing layer suggests that water
formed before the gravitational collapse of the protostar, contrary to
formaldehyde and methanol, which formed later once the CO molecules had
depleted on the grains.

polycrystalline solid is the isotropic average of the FIDs for individual
single crystallites. It has been recently proposed theoretically and verified
experimentally that the long-time behavior of single-crystal FIDs has the
universal form of exponentially decaying sinusoidal oscillations.
Polycrystalline averaging complicates the situation theoretically, while the
available experimental evidence is also ambiguous. Exponentially decaying
sinusoidal oscillations have been observed for Xe-129 in polycrystalline solid
xenon but not for F-19 in the powder of CaF2. In this paper, we present the
first principles FID calculations for the powders of both CaF2 and solid xenon.
In both cases, the asymptotic long-time behavior has the expected form of
exponentially decaying sinusoidal oscillations, which is determined by the
single crystallite FID with the slowest exponential decay. However, this
behavior appears only at rather small values of the signal that have not yet
been measured in experiments. At intermediate times accessible experimentally,
a polycrystalline FID depends on the distribution of the exponential decay
constants and oscillation frequencies for single crystallite FIDs. In CaF2,
these parameters are relatively broadly distributed, and as a result, the
sinusoidal long-time oscillations become somewhat washed out. In contrast, the
single crystallite parameters are more clustered in solid xenon, and, as a
result, the experimentally observable range is characterized by well-defined
oscillation frequency and exponential decay constant even though both of these
parameters do not represent the true long-time behavior. The above difference
of the intermediate FID behavior originates from the difference of the crystal
structures of solid xenon and CaF2.

results from the PLANCK/SZ survey can be used to determine the total neutrino
mass with a (1\sigma) uncertainty of 0.06 eV, assuming it is in the range
0.1-0.3 eV, and the survey detection limit is set at the 5\sigma significance
level. Our results constitute a significant improvement on the limits expected
from PLANCK/CMB lensing measurements, 0.15 eV. Based on expected results from
future cosmic-variance-limited (CVL) SZ survey we predict a 1\sigma uncertainty
of 0.04 eV, a level comparable to that expected when CMB lensing extraction is
carried out with the same experiment. A few percent uncertainty in the mass
function parameters could result in up to a factor \sim 2-3 degradation of our
PLANCK and CVL forecasts. Our analysis shows that cluster number counts provide
a viable complementary cosmological probe to CMB lensing constraints on the
total neutrino mass.

dependent on an effective storage and supply of water resources. In some
regions the economic growth has led to a level of water demand which can only
be accomplished through efficient reservoir networks. Such infrastructures are
not always planned at larger scale but rather made by farmers according to
their local needs of irrigation during droughts. Based on extensive data from
the upper Jaguaribe basin, one of the world's largest system of reservoirs,
located in the Brazilian semiarid northeast, we reveal that surprisingly it
self-organizes into a scale-free network exhibiting also a power-law in the
distribution of the lakes and avalanches of discharges. With a new
self-organized-criticality-type model we manage to explain the novel critical
exponents. Implementing a flow model we are able to reproduce the measured
overspill evolution providing a tool for catastrophe mitigation and future

on all the fields (including the ghosts) and antifields; it uniquely fixes the
dependence on the background field of all the one-particle irreducible Green's
functions of the theory at hand. The approach is valid both at the perturbative

practical application, we derive the renormalization group equation in the

obtained. As a result, the exact form for the locus in a color-color diagrams
has been deduced, and an analytical formula to determine with precision the
black body temperature of an object from any pair of measurements has been
developed. Thus, using two images of the same field obtained with different
filters, one can compute a fast estimation of black body temperatures for every
pixel in the image, that is, a new image of the black body temperatures for all
the objects in the field. Once these temperatures are obtained, the method
allows, as a consequence, a quick estimation of their emission in other
frequencies, assuming a black body behavior. These results provide new tools
for data analysis.

Barut-Girardello coherent states for a polynomial Weyl-Heisenberg algebra. This
algebra depends on r parameters. For some special values of the parameter
corresponding to r = 1, the algebra covers the cases of the su(1,1) algebra,
the su(2) algebra and the ordinary Weyl-Heisenberg or oscillator algebra. For r
arbitrary, the generalized Weyl-Heisenberg algebra admits finite or
infinite-dimensional representations depending on the values of the parameters.
Coherent states of the Perelomov type are derived in finite and infinite
dimensions through a Fock-Bargmann approach based on the use of complex
variables. The same approach is applied for deriving coherent states of the
Barut-Girardello type in infinite dimension. In contrast, the construction of
Barut-Girardello coherent states in finite dimension can be achieved solely at
the price to replace complex variables by generalized Grassmann variables.
Finally, some preliminary developments are given for the study of Bargmann
functions associated with some of the coherent states obtained in this work.

small satellites in the service of developing countries. Space technology
related issues have also been addressed as part of various other activities of
the Programme on Space Applications. Building on these experiences, the Office

excitons in semiconductors and quantum electrodynamics circuits based on
Josephson junctions. Recently, there is also strong interest to study similar

the ultra strong coupling regime can be reached and new physical effects have
been predicted. An other interesting feature of this system is that, in
contrast to systems based on superconductors, the ultra strong coupling regime
can be maintained up to room temperature. In this work, we demonstrate that
parabolic quantum wells coupled to LC circuit resonators in the ultra strong
