key from some arbitrary linearly ordered universe. The broadcast cycle -- a
sequence of frames sorted by the keys and permuted by $k$-bit reversal -- is
transmitted in a round robin fashion by the broadcaster. At arbitrary time

bound the number of keys outside $[K', K""]$ that will ever be received. In

SED is then modeled as a combination of torus reprocessed active galactic

extending to \sim130 pc from the supermassive black hole. Evidence is seen for
a break or cutoff in the core synchrotron emission. The associated population
of relativistic electrons could in principle be responsible for some of the

requires a cool dust component, consistent with dust-reprocessed radiation from

incorporates explicit partonic degrees of freedom in terms of strongly
interacting quasiparticles (quarks and gluons) in line with an equation of
state from lattice QCD as well as the dynamical hadronization and hadronic
collision dynamics in the final reaction phase. The experimentally observed
increase of the elliptic flow $v_2$ of charged hadrons with collision energy is
successfully described in terms of the PHSD approach. The PHSD scaling
properties of various collective observables are confronted with experimental

harmonics $v_3$ and $v_4$ in the azimuthal angular distribution shows a similar
tendency of growing deviations between partonic and purely hadronic models with
increasing collision energy. This demonstrates that the excitation functions of
azimuthal anisotropies reflect the increasing role of quark-gluon degrees of

the specific variation of the ratio $v_4/(v_2)^2$ with respect to bombarding

among secondary users (SUs) who adjust their power levels to compete for
spectrum opportunities while satisfying the interference temperature (IT)
constraints imposed by primary users. The considered interaction among the SUs
is characterized by the following three features. First, since the SUs are
decentralized, they are selfish and aim to maximize their own long-term payoffs
from utilizing the network rather than obeying the prescribed allocation of a
centralized controller. Second, the SUs interact with each other repeatedly and
they can coexist in the system for a long time. Third, the SUs have limited and
imperfect monitoring ability: they only observe whether the IT constraints are
violated, and their observation is imperfect due to the erroneous measurements.
To capture these features, we model the interaction of the SUs as a repeated
game with imperfect monitoring. We first characterize the set of Pareto optimal
payoffs that can be achieved by deviation-proof spectrum sharing policies,
which are policies that the selfish users find it in their interest to comply
with. Next, for any given payoff in this set, we show how to construct a
deviation-proof policy to achieve it. The constructed deviation-proof policy is
amenable to distributed implementation, and allows users to transmit in a
time-division multiple-access (TDMA) fashion. In the presence of strong
multi-user interference, our policy outperforms existing spectrum sharing
policies that dictate users to transmit at constant power levels
simultaneously. Moreover, our policy can achieve Pareto optimality even when
the SUs have limited and imperfect monitoring ability, as opposed to existing
solutions based on repeated games, which require perfect monitoring abilities.

different timescales along cosmic time. A transition might happen around z ~ 1
as the cosmic star formation rate starts its decrease. Identifying the
dynamical nature of galaxies on a representative sample is necessary to infer
and compare the mass assembly mechanisms across cosmic time. We present an
analysis of the kinematics properties of 50 galaxies with 0.9 < z < 1.6 from
the MASSIV sample observed with SINFONI/VLT with 4.5x10^9 Msun < M < 1.7x10^11
Msun and 6 Msun/yr < SFR < 300 Msun/yr. This is the largest sample with
2D-kinematics in this redshift range. We provide a classification based on
kinematics as well as on close galaxy environment. We find that 29% of galaxies
are experiencing merging or have close companions that may be gravitationally
linked. This is placing a lower limit on the fraction of interacting galaxies.
We find that at least 44% of the galaxies display ordered rotation whereas at
least 35% are non-rotating objects. All rotators except one are compatible with
rotation-dominated (Vmax/sigma > 1) systems. Non-rotating objects are mainly
small objects (Re < 4 kpc). Combining our sample with other 3D-spectroscopy
samples, we find that the local velocity dispersion of the ionized gas
component decreases continuously from z ~ 3 to z = 0. The proportion of disks
also seems to be increasing in star-forming galaxies when the redshift
decreases. The number of interacting galaxies seems to be at a maximum at z ~
1.2. These results draw a picture in which cold gas accretion may still be
efficient at z ~ 1.2 but in which mergers may play a much more significant role
at z ~ 1.2 than at higher redshift. From a dynamical point of view, the
redshift range 1 < z < 2 therefore appears as a transition period in the galaxy
mass assembly process.

semi-empirical Hamiltonian [Phys. Rev. B, 74, 155408 (2006)] is used to model
the interaction between carbon atoms. The metal catalyst forming a
supersaturated metal-alloy droplet is represented by a jellium, and the effect
of collisions between the carbon atoms and the catalyst is captured by charge
transfers between the jellium and the carbon. Starting from carbon clusters in
different initial configurations (e.g., random structures, cage structures,
bulk-cut spherical clusters, etc.), we anneal them to different temperatures.
These simulations are performed with clusters placed in the jellium as well as
in vacuum. We find that, in the presence of jellium, and for an optimal charge
transfer of ~ 0.1 e-0.2 e, open cage structures (and some elongated cage
structures) are formed, which may be viewed as precursors to the growth of
SWCNTs. We will also discuss the implications of a spherical boundary on the
nucleation of a SWCNT.

As we know the peak temperature of chip increases in 3-dimensional structures

inter-layer components. In sub-nanometre scale technologies, it is inevitable
to analysis the heat developed in individual chip to extract the temperature
distribution of the entire chip. With the technology scaling in new generation
ICs more and more components are integrated to a smaller area. Along with the
other parameters threshold voltage is also scaled down which results in
exponential increase in leakage current. This has resulted in rise in hotspot
temperature value due to increase in leakage power. In this paper, we have
analysed the temperature developed in an IC with four identical processors at
2.4 GHz in different floorplans. The analysis has been done for both 2D and 3D
arrangements. In the 3D arrangement, a three layered structure has been

This five-band system is the simplest lattice that can support simultaneously
the two different paradigmatic Dirac-Weyl fermions with half-integer spin and
integer spin. We demonstrate that these pseudo-relativistic structures,
including a flat band at half-filling, can be deduced from the underlying
Kagome sublattice. We further show that the signatures of the two kinds of
relativistic fermions can be clearly revealed by several perturbations, such as
a uniform magnetic field, a Haldane-type spin-orbit term, and charge density

between the two kinds of relativistic fermions, or even to isolate them

the most active microquasars and is the only Galactic black hole candidate with
confirmed high energy Gamma-ray emission, thanks to detections by Fermi/LAT and
AGILE. In 2011, Cygnus X-3 was observed to transit to a soft X-ray state, which
is known to be associated with high-energy Gamma-ray emission. We present the
results of a multi-wavelength campaign covering a quenched state, when radio
emission from Cygnus X-3 is at its weakest and the X-ray spectrum is very soft.
A giant (~ 20 Jy) optically thin radio flare marks the end of the quenched
state, accompanied by rising non-thermal hard X-rays. Fermi/LAT observations (E
>100 MeV) reveal renewed Gamma-ray activity associated with this giant radio
flare, suggesting a common origin for all non-thermal components. In addition,
current observations unambiguously show that the Gamma-ray emission is not
exclusively related to the rare giant radio flares. A 3-week period of
Gamma-ray emission is also detected when Cygnus X-3 was weakly flaring in
radio, right before transition to the radio quenched state. No Gamma rays are
observed during the ~ one-month long quenched state, when the radio flux is
weakest. Our results suggest transitions into and out of the ultrasoft X-ray
(radio quenched) state trigger Gamma-ray emission, implying a connection to the
accretion process, and also that the Gamma-ray activity is related to the level
of radio flux (and possibly shock formation), strengthening the connection to
the relativistic jets.

implementing quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates. This method, which we
recently proposed and demonstrated, consists of driving two
transversely-coupled quantum bits (qubits) with a driving field that is
resonant with one of the two qubits. For specific relative amplitudes and
phases of the driving field felt by the two qubits, one of the two transitions
in the degenerate pair is darkened, or in other words, becomes forbidden by
effective selection rules. At these driving conditions, the evolution of the
two-qubit state realizes a CNOT gate. The gate speed is found to be limited
only by the coupling energy J, which is the fundamental speed limit for any
entangling gate. Numerical simulations show that at gate speeds corresponding
to 0.48J and 0.07J, the gate fidelity is 99% and 99.99%, respectively, and
increases further for lower gate speeds. In addition, the effect of
higher-lying energy levels and weak anharmonicity is studied, as well as the
scalability of the method to systems of multiple qubits. We conclude that in
all these respects this method is competitive with existing schemes for
creating entanglement, with the added advantages of being applicable for qubits
operating at fixed frequencies (either by design or for exploitation of
coherence sweet-spots) and having the simplicity of microwave-only operation.

substructures located deep within the virialized regions of a halo is
determined by its infall which in turn is determined by the large scale
velocity shear, a surprising result given the virilaized nature of haloes. The
non-random nature of subhalo accretion is thus imprinted on the angular
momentum measured at z = 0. We also find that haloes' spin axis is aligned with

rather than the gravitational tidal tensor. The procedure consists of the
construction of the the shear tensor at each (grid) point in space and the
evaluation of its three eigenvectors. A given point is classified to be either
a void, sheet, filament or a knot according to the number of eigenvalues above
a certain threshold, 0, 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The threshold is treated as a
free parameter that defines the web. The algorithm has been applied to a dark
matter only, high resolution simulation of a box of side-length 64$h^{-1}$Mpc

resulting velocity based cosmic web resolves structures down to <0.1$h^{-1}$Mpc

under-dense regions are made of extended voids bisected by planar sheets, whose
density is also below the mean. The over-dense regions are vastly dominated by
the linear filaments and knots. The resolution achieved by the velocity based
cosmic web provides a platform for studying the formation of halos and galaxies

updated explanation for the origin of the inner filament. Sutherland et al.
(1993) suggested that radio jet-induced shocks can drive the observed optical
line emission. We argue that such shocks can naturally arise due to a weak
cocoon-driven bow shock (rather than from the radio jet directly), propagating
through the diffuse interstellar medium from a location near the inner northern
radio lobe. The shock can overrun a molecular cloud, triggering star-formation
in the dense molecular cores. Ablation and shock heating of the diffuse gas
then gives rise to the observed optical line and X-ray emission. Deeper X-ray
observations should show more diffuse emission along the filament.

iterative inverse-variance-weighted least-squares minimization procedure to
generate a best set of basis functions. The method is similar to principal
components analysis, but with the substantial advantage that it uses
measurement uncertainties in a responsible way and accounts naturally for
poorly measured and missing data; it models the variance in the

smoothness prior (inspired by Gaussian processes) or a non-negative constraint,
without making the method prohibitively slow. Because the method optimizes a
justified scalar (related to the likelihood), the basis provides a better fit
to the data in a probabilistic sense than any PCA basis. We test the method on
SDSS spectra, concentrating on spectra known to contain two redshift

simulations of self-gravitating accretion discs with a simple cooling law. It
is well-known that there exists a steady gravito-turbulent state, in which
cooling is balanced by dissipation of weak shocks, with a net outward transport
of angular momentum. Previous results indicated that if cooling is too fast
(typical time scale 3/Omega, where Omega is the local angular velocity), this
steady state can not be maintained and the disc will fragment into
gravitationally bound clumps. We show that, in the two-dimensional local
approximation, this result is in fact not converged with respect to numerical
resolution and longer time integration. Irrespective of the cooling time scale,
gravito-turbulence consists of density waves as well as transient clumps. These
clumps will contract because of the imposed cooling, and collapse into bound
objects if they can survive for long enough. Since heating by shocks is very
local, the destruction of clumps is a stochastic process. High numerical
resolution and long integration times are needed to capture this behaviour. We
have observed fragmentation for cooling times up to 20/Omega, almost a factor 7
higher than in previous simulations. Fully three-dimensional simulations with a
more realistic cooling prescription are necessary to determine the effects of
the use of the two-dimensional approximation and a simple cooling law.

for BCGs. We find that while the SEDs of some BCGs follow the expectation of
red, dust-free old stellar populations, many exhibit signatures of recent star
formation in the form of excess UV or mid-IR emission, or both. We establish a
mean near-UV to 2MASS K color of 6.59 \pm 0.34 for quiescent BCGs. We use this
mean color to quantify the UV excess associated with star formation in the
active BCGs. We use fits to a template of an evolved stellar population and
library of starburst models and mid-IR star formation relations to estimate the
obscured star formation rates. Many of the BCGs in X-ray clusters with low
central gas entropy exhibit enhanced UV (38%) and mid-IR emission (43%), above
that expected from an old stellar population. These excesses are consistent
with on-going star formation activity in the BCG, star formation that appears
to be enabled by the presence of high density, X-ray emitting gas in the the
core of the cluster of galaxies. This hot, X-ray emitting gas may provide the
enhanced ambient pressure and some of the fuel to trigger the star formation.
This result is consistent with previous works that showed that BCGs in clusters
with low central gas entropy host H{\alpha} emission-line nebulae and radio
sources, while clusters with high central gas entropy exhibit none of these
features. UV and mid-IR measurements combined provide a complete picture of
unobscured and obscured star formation occurring in these systems.

dust is not destroyed by SN shock waves and all dust is produced in stars. If
there is net dust destruction by SN shock waves, the dust-to-metals gradient is
flatter than or equal to the metallicity gradient (assuming the gradients have
the same sign). Similarly, if there is net dust growth in the ISM, then the
dust-to-metals gradient is steeper than or equal to the metallicity gradient.
The latter result implies that if dust gradients are steeper than metallicity

growth in galaxy discs, where a negative slope indicates dust growth.

resembles both the spike-and-slab RBM and sparse coding. Since exact inference
in this model is intractable, we derive a structured variational inference
procedure and employ a variational EM training algorithm. Prior work on
approximate inference for this model has not prioritized the ability to exploit
parallel architectures and scale to enormous problem sizes. We present an
inference procedure appropriate for use with GPUs which allows us to
dramatically increase both the training set size and the amount of latent
factors.
  We demonstrate that this approach improves upon the supervised learning
capabilities of both sparse coding and the ssRBM on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We
evaluate our approach's potential for semi-supervised learning on subsets of

projectors have ""trivial"" ground states which can be constructed by a local
quantum circuit of bounded depth and range acting on a product state. While the
toric code only has nontrivial ground states, commuting projector Hamiltonians
which are sums of two-body interactions have trivial ground states.
  We define an ""interaction complex"" for a Hamiltonian, generalizing the
interaction graph, and we show that if this complex can be continuously mapped
to a 1-complex using a map with bounded diameter of pre-images then the
Hamiltonian has a trivial ground state assuming one technical condition on the
Hamiltonian (this condition holds for all stabilizer Hamiltonians, and we also
prove the result for all Hamiltonians under an assumption on the 1-complex).
While this includes cases considered by Ref., it also includes other
Hamiltonians whose interaction complexes cannot be coarse-grained into the case
of Ref.
  One motivation for this is the quantum PCP conjecture. Many commonly studied
interaction complexes can be mapped to a 1-complex after removing a small
fraction of sites. For commuting projector Hamiltonians on such complexes, a
trivial ground state for the Hamiltonian with those sites removed is a low
energy trivial state for the original Hamiltonian. Such states can act as a
classical witness to the existence of a low energy state. While this result
applies only to commuting Hamiltonians, it suggests that to prove a quantum PCP
conjecture one should consider interaction complexes which cannot be mapped to
1-complexes after removing a small fraction of cells. We define this more
precisely below; in a sense this generalizes the idea of an expander graph.
Surprisingly, such complexes do exist as will be shown elsewhere, and have
useful properties in quantum coding theory.

for any value of parameters $\mu\leq \mu(N):=(N-2)^2/4$, the corresponding
parabolic system can be controlled to zero with the control distributed in any

constant in the Hardy inequality with interior singularity. When considering
the case of boundary singularity a better critical Hardy constant is obtained,
namely $\mu_{N}:=N^2/4$. In this article we extend the previous results in
[18],[8], to the case of boundary singularity. More precisely, we show that for

clusters at low redshifts using SDSS data to conduct a comprehensive
investigation into the photometric variation of red sequence modal galaxy
colours with environment. The clusters span a range of Bautz-Morgan types and
evolutionary stages and are representative of the global underlying
intermediate L_X cluster sample. We define cluster membership using SDSS
spectroscopic data and characterize the clusters by deriving new recession
velocities, velocity dispersions and other parameters for each. We construct
colour-magnitude diagrams for each of these clusters and obtain the position of
the red sequence using a robust line fitting algorithm with a Lorentzian merit
function. In doing so, we describe a population of discordant points on the
colour-magnitude plane which are the result of photometric blending, dust and
other causes. By fitting the clusters with Schechter functions to derive M*
values in each SDSS passband, we combine the red sequence of the galaxy
clusters together to form a composite sample. We detail how the modal colour
value of the red sequence varies with radius from the centre of this composite
cluster and local galaxy density for all SDSS colours. In agreement with
previous studies, these colours are shown to systematically move blueward with
increasing distance from the cluster centres, or equivalently lower local
galaxy density, whilst the width of the red sequence increases. This supports
the idea that the galaxies at the outskirts of these clusters have younger
luminosity-weighted ages than those at the core indicating their star formation
has been quenched more recently than in the core. A comparison of our derived
gradients in (g-r) with earlier works tentatively suggests that these gradients
vary with redshift which would reflect the hierarchical build-up of the red

bands of the T1.5 dwarf 2MASS J21392676+0220226 (2M2139), revealing persistent,
periodic ($P=7.721\pm$0.005 hr) variability with a peak-to-peak amplitude as
high as 26% in the $J$-band. The light curve shape varies on a timescale of
days, suggesting that evolving atmospheric cloud features are responsible.
Using interpolations between model atmospheres with differing cloud thicknesses
to represent a heterogeneous surface, we find that the multi-wavelength
variations and the near-infrared spectrum of 2M2139 can be reproduced by either
(1)cool, thick cloud features sitting above a thinner cloud layer, or (2)warm
regions of low condensate opacity in an otherwise cloudy atmosphere, possibly
indicating the presence of holes or breaks in the cloud layer. We find that
temperature contrasts between thick and thin cloud patches must be greater than
175 K and as high as 425 K. We also consider whether the observed variability
could arise from an interacting binary system, but this scenario is ruled out.
2M2139 joins the T2.5 dwarf SIMP0136 discovered by Artigau and coworkers as the
second L/T transition brown dwarf to display large-amplitude variability on
rotational timescales, suggesting that the fragmentation of dust clouds at the
L/T transition may contribute to the abrupt decline in condensate opacity and
$J$-band brightening observed to occur over this regime.

sunspot complex that produced several major eruptions, including the first
X-class flare of Solar Cycle 24. Extrapolated non-linear force-free coronal
fields show substantial electric current and free energy increase during early
flux emergence near a low-lying sigmoidal filament with sheared kilogauss field
in the filament channel. The computed magnetic free energy reaches a maximum of
~2.6e32 erg, about 50% of which is stored below 6 Mm. It decreases by ~0.3e32
erg within 1 hour of the X-class flare, which is likely an underestimation of
the actual energy loss. During the flare, the photospheric field changed
rapidly: horizontal field was enhanced by 28% in the core region, becoming more
inclined and more parallel to the polarity inversion line. Such change is
consistent with the conjectured coronal field ""implosion"", and is supported by
the coronal loop retraction observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA).
The extrapolated field becomes more ""compact"" after the flare, with shorter
loops in the core region, probably because of reconnection. The coronal field
becomes slightly more sheared in the lowest layer, relaxes faster with height,
and is overall less energetic.

intensively studied but remains unsettled. Current popular source candidates
include unresolved star-forming galaxies, starburst galaxies, and blazars. In
this paper we calculate the EGB contribution from the interactions of cosmic
rays accelerated by Type Ia supernovae (SNe), extending earlier work which only
included core-collapse SNe. We consider Type Ia events in star-forming
galaxies, but also in quiescent galaxies that lack star formation. For
star-forming galaxies, consistently including Type Ia events makes little
change to the star-forming EGB prediction, so long as both SN types have the
same cosmic-ray acceleration efficiencies in star-forming galaxies. Thus, our
updated EGB estimate continues to show that star-forming galaxies can represent
a substantial portion of the signal measured by Fermi. For quiescent galaxies,
conversely, we find a wide range of possibilities for the EGB contribution. The
dominant uncertainty we investigated comes from the mass in hot gas, which
provides targets for cosmic rays; total gas masses are as yet poorly known,
particularly at larger radii. Additionally, the EGB estimation is very
sensitive to the cosmic-ray acceleration efficiency and confinement, especially
in quiescent galaxies. In the most optimistic allowed scenarios, quiescent
galaxies can be an important source of the EGB. In this case, star-forming
galaxies and quiescent galaxies together will dominate the EGB and leave little
room for other contributions. If other sources, such as blazars, are found to
have important contributions to the EGB, then either the gas mass or cosmic-ray
content of quiescent galaxies must be significantly lower than in their
star-forming counterparts. In any case, improved Fermi EGB measurements will
provide important constraints on hot gas and cosmic rays in quiescent galaxies.

cosmology proposed in 1948, was uniformly expanding rather than exhibiting a
cyclical behaviour. In a much revised version it was developed into the
quasi-steady-state cosmological model (QSSC) of the 1990s. From a historical

by observing the companion star's velocity and light curves as functions of the
orbital phase. However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital
inclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole
mass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,
thus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume
that accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's
orbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption
lines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing
the Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital
motion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the
Doppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the
prediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black
hole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0
(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source
covering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters
substantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3
observed with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind
absorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a
companion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of
-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in
particular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain
the mass ratio. This method in principle can also be applied to any accreting
compact objects with detectable accretion disk wind absorption line features.

a low-mass X-ray binary viewed at very high inclination, thereby allowing the
disc structure and extended disc coronal regions to be visible. We study the
structure of the accretion disc in X1822-371 by modelling the phase-resolved
spectra both in optical and X-ray regime. We analyse high time resolution
optical ESO/VLT spectra of X1822-371 to study the variability in the emission
line profiles. In addition, we use data from XMM-Newton space observatory to
study phase-resolved as well as high resolution X-ray spectra. We apply the
Doppler tomography technique to reconstruct a map of the optical emission
distribution in the system. We fit multi-component models to the X-ray spectra.
We find that our results from both the optical and X-ray analysis can be
explained with a model where the accretion disc has a thick rim in the region
where the accretion stream impacts the disc. The behaviour of the H_beta line
complex implies that some of the accreting matter creates an outburst around
the accretion stream impact location and that the resulting outflow of matter
moves both away from the accretion disc and towards the centre of the disc.
Such behaviour can be explained by an almost isotropic outflow of matter from
the accretion stream impact region. The optical emission lines of HeII 4686 and
5411 show double peaked profiles, typical for an accretion disc at high
inclination. However, their velocities are slower than expected for an
accretion disc in a system like X1822-371. This, combined with the fact that
the HeII emission lines do not get eclipsed during the partial eclipse in the
continuum, suggests that the line emission does not originate in the orbital
plane and is more likely to come from above the accretion disc, for example the
accretion disc wind.

equilibria in the nominal and perturbed markets. These markets are also
analyzed using a game-theoretic point of view. Sufficient conditions are

strategic games and the equilibria of close games. This analysis is used to
quantify the effect of uncertainty of RERs and its possible mitigation using
Demand Response. Finally numerical studies are reported using an IEEE 30-bus to

implications for the internal shock model of the prompt GRB emission and
studied it in the context of impulsive Poynting-dominated flows. Our results
show that unless the magnetization of GRB jets is extremely high, \sigma > 100
in the prompt emission zone, the magnetic model may still be compatible with
the observations. The main effect of reduced dissipation efficiency is merely
an increase in the size of the dissipation zone and even for highly magnetised
GRB jets this size may remain below the external shock radius, provided the
central engine can emit magnetic shells on the time scale well below the
typical observed variability scale of one second. Our analytical and numerical
results suggest that magnetic shells begin strongly interact with each other
well before they reach the coasting radius. As the result, the impulsive jet in
the dissipation zone is best described not as a collection of shells but as a
continuous highly magnetised flow with a high amplitude magnetosonic wave
component. How exactly the dissipated wave energy is distributed between the
radiation and the bulk kinetic energy of radial jets depends on the relative
rates of radiative and adiabatic cooling. In the fast radiative cooling regime,
the corresponding radiative efficiency can be as high as the wave contribution
to their energy budget, independently of the magnetization. Moreover, after
leaving the zone of prompt emission the jet may still remain
Poynting-dominated, leading to weaker emission from the reverse shock compared
to non-magnetic models.

approach allows for an integrated treatment of both coherent (ballistic) and
non-coherent (co-tunneling) contributions to the effective charge transport,
where the latter involve the existence of transient charged states of the
corresponding molecular species. An expression for the net current is
calculated by using second-order perturbation theory to take into account all
possible transitions between states localized at the two different electrodes

formalism can be extended to describe the electronic transport both in
conjugated as in saturated molecules, where localized orbitals are more likely
to be found. In this manner, the method can be applied to the full range of
coupling regimes, not only to the weak or strong cases, but also in

best previously known time bound for solving one-clock priced timed games was
2^(O(n^2+m)), due to Rutkowski. For our improvement, we introduce and study a
new algorithm for solving one-clock priced timed games, based on the sweep-line

the algorithmic theory of Markov decision processes. As a corollary, we also

possibility of acceleration at 1$\sigma$ hence giving viability to power-law

containing dynamical canonical scalar field is ruled out by WMAP7 data since
its present value of equation of state parameter does not match the WMAP7

energy at zero and finite temperature for the transverse oscillations of a
piecewise uniform closed string. We make use of three different
regularizations: the cutoff method, the complex contour integration method, and
the zeta-function method. The string model is relativistic, in the sense that
the velocity of sound is for each string piece set equal to the velocity of
light. In this sense the theory is analogous to the electromagnetic theory in a
dielectric medium in which the product of permittivity and permeability is
equal to unity (an isorefractive medium). We demonstrate how the formalism
works for a two-piece string, and for a 2N-piece string, and show how in the
latter case a compact recursion relation serves to facilitate the formalism
considerably. The Casimir energy turns out to be negative, and the more so the
larger the number of pieces in the string. The two-piece string is quantized in
D-dimensional spacetime, in the limit when the ratio between the two tensions
is very small. We calculate the free energy and other thermodynamic quantities,
demonstrate scaling properties, and comment on the meaning of the Hagedorn
critical temperature for the two-piece string. Thereafter, as a novel
development we present a scalar field theory for a real field in
three-dimensional space in a potential rising linearly with a longitudinal
coordinate z in the interval 0<z<1, and which is thereafter held constant on a
horizontal plateau. The potential is taken as a rough model of the two-piece
string potential under simplifying conditions, when the length ratio between
the pieces is replaced formally with the mentioned length parameter z.

  By a suitable splitting of the Hamiltonian, we connect the problem to the
""renormalized energy"" W, a Coulombian interaction for points in the plane
introduced in our prior work, which is expected to be a good way of measuring
the disorder of an infinite configuration of points in the plane. By so doing,
we are able to examine the situation at the microscopic scale, and obtain
several new results: a next order asymptotic expansion of the partition
function, estimates on the probability of fluctuation from the equilibrium
measure at microscale, and a large deviations type result, which states that
configurations above a certain threshhold of W have exponentially small
probability. When \beta\to \infty, the estimate becomes sharp, showing that the
system has to ""crystallize"" to a minimizer of W. In the case of weighted Fekete
sets, this corresponds to saying that these sets should microscopically look
almost everywhere like minimizers of W, which are conjectured to be ""Abrikosov""
triangular lattices.

chain of $L$ identical (classically chaotic and finite-horizon) unit cells,
which is connected to semi-infinite plane leads at its extremes. Particles
inside the cavity are free and only interact with the boundaries through
elastic collisions; this means waves are described by the Helmholtz equation
with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the waveguide walls. The equivalent to
the disorder ensemble is an energy ensemble, defined over a classically small
range but many mean level spacings wide. The number of propagative channels in
the leads is $N$. We have studied the (adimensional) Landauer conductance $g$
as a function of $L$ and $N$ in the cosine-shaped waveguide and by means of our
RMT periodic chain model. We have found that $<g(L)>$ exhibit two regimes.
First, for chains of length $L\lesssim\sqrt{N}$ the dynamics is diffusive just
like in the disordered wire in the metallic regime, where the typic ohmic
scaling is observed with $<g(L)> = N/(L+1)$. In this regime, the conductance
distribution is a Gaussian with small variance but which grows linearly with
$L$. Then, in longer systems with $L\gg\sqrt{N}$, the periodic nature becomes
relevant and the conductance reaches a constant asymptotic value
$<g(L\to\infty)> \sim <N_B>$. The variance approaches a constant value
$\sim\sqrt{N}$ as $L\to\infty$. Comparing the conductance using the unitary and
orthogonal circular ensembles we observed that a weak localization effect is
present in the two regimes.

of extrasolar planets. It induces flux variations which affect significantly
the transit depth determination and the derivations of planetary and stellar
parameters. Furthermore, the colour dependence of stellar activity may
significantly influence the characterization of planetary atmospheres. Here we
present a systematic approach to quantify the corresponding stellar flux
variations as a function of wavelength bands. We consider a star with spots
covering a given fraction of its disc and model the variability in the UBVRIJHK
photometric system and in the Spitzer/IRAC wavebands for dwarf stars from G to
M spectral types. We compare activity-induced flux variations in different
passbands with planetary transits and quantify how they affect the
determination of the planetary radius and the analysis of the transmission
spectroscopy in the study of planetary atmospheres. We suggest that the
monitoring of the systems by using broad band photometry, from visible to
infrared, helps to constraining activity effects. The ratio of the relative
variations of the stellar fluxes in short wavelength optical bands (e.g., U or
B) to near infrared ones (e.g., J or K) can be used to distinguish starspot
brightness dips from planetary transits in a stellar light curve. In addition
to the perturbations in the measurement of the planetary radius, we find that
starspots can affect the determination of the relative semimajor axis and the
inclination of the planetary orbit which have a significant impact on the
derivation of the stellar density from the transit light curves.

approach to the modelling of the excesses of galaxy clusters over high-mass

generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), which is closely related to the
generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. After introducing the formalism,
we study the impact of different thresholds and redshift ranges on the
distributions, as well as the influence of the survey area on the mean excess
above a given mass threshold. We also show that both the GPD and the GEV
approach lead to identical results for rare, thus high-mass and high-redshift,
clusters. As an example, we apply the Pareto approach to ACT-CL J0102-4915 and
SPT-CL J2106-5844 and derive the respective cumulative distribution functions
of the exceedance over different mass thresholds. We also study the possibility
to use the GPD as a cosmological probe. Since in the maximum likelihood
estimation of the distribution parameters all the information from clusters
above the mass threshold is used, the GPD might offer an interesting
alternative to GEV-based methods that use only the maxima in patches. When
comparing the accuracy with which the parameters can be estimated, it turns out
that the patch-based modelling of maxima is superior to the Pareto approach. In
an ideal case, the GEV approach is capable to estimate the location parameter
with a percent level precision for less than 100 patches. This result makes the
GEV based approach potentially also interesting for cluster surveys with a
smaller area.

proposed for high dimensional regression problems. However, tuning parameter
choice and computational efficiency in ultra-high dimensional problems remain

attributable to the computational efficiency of the LARS algorithm, but similar
efficiency for better behaved penalties has remained elusive. In this article,
we propose a highly efficient path following procedure for combination of any
convex loss function and a broad class of penalties. From a Bayesian
perspective, this algorithm rapidly yields maximum a posteriori estimates at
different hyper-parameter values. To bypass the inefficiency and potential
instability of cross validation, we propose an empirical Bayes procedure for
rapidly choosing the optimal model and corresponding hyper-parameter value.
This approach applies to any penalty that corresponds to a proper prior
distribution on the regression coefficients. While we mainly focus on sparse
estimation of generalized linear models, the method extends to more general
regularizations such as polynomial trend filtering after reparameterization.
The proposed algorithm scales efficiently to large $p$ and/or $n$. Solution
paths of 10,000 dimensional examples are computed within one minute on a laptop

considered and we give an estimate of the cavity finesse. We also compute the
cooperativity parameter and show how it depends on the gap width and cavity
length. Maximization of the cooperativity does not always correspond to
maximization of the coupling.

aqueous mixture containing salt near or above the critical temperature. We find
an attractive interaction far from the coexistence curve due to the combination
of preferential solvent adsorption at the colloids' surface and preferential
ion solvation. We show that the ion-specific interaction strongly depends on
the amount of salt added as well as on the mixture composition. Our results are
in accord with recent experiments. For a highly antagonistic salt of
hydrophilic anions and hydrophobic cations, a repulsive interaction at an
intermediate inter-colloid distance is predicted even though both the
electrostatic and adsorption forces alone are attractive.

lobes on either side of our Galaxy (Su et al. 2010), appear morphologically
connected to the Galactic center, and thus offer a chance to test several
models of supermassive black hole (SMBH) evolution, feedback and relation with
their host galaxies. We use a physical feedback model (King 2003, 2010) and
novel numerical techniques (Nayakshin et al. 2009) to simulate a short burst of
activity in Sgr A*, the central SMBH of the Milky Way, ~6 Myr ago, temporally
coincident with a star formation event in the central parsec. We are able to
reproduce the bubble morphology and energetics both analytically (Zubovas et
al. 2011) and numerically (Zubovas & Nayakshin, in prep). These results provide
strong support to the model, which was also used to simulate more extreme
environments (Nayakshin & Power 2010).

B-lymphocytes. A network node represents a population of B-lymphocytes of the
same specificity (idiotype), which is encoded by a bitstring. The links of the
network connect nodes with complementary and nearly complementary bitstrings,
allowing for a few mismatches. A node is occupied if a lymphocyte clone of the
corresponding idiotype exists, otherwise it is empty. There is a continuous
influx of new B-lymphocytes of random idiotype from the bone marrow.
B-lymphocytes are stimulated by cross-linking their receptors with
complementary structures. If there are too many complementary structures,
steric hindrance prevents cross-linking. Stimulated cells proliferate and
secrete antibodies of the same idiotype as their receptors, unstimulated
lymphocytes die.
  Depending on few parameters, the autonomous system evolves randomly towards
patterns of highly organized architecture, where the nodes can be classified
into groups according to their statistical properties. We observe and describe
analytically the building principles of these patterns, which allow to
calculate number and size of the node groups and the number of links between
them. The architecture of all patterns observed so far in simulations can be
explained this way. A tool for real-time pattern identification is proposed.

  Floors","27 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study examines the performance of traditional round dowels in concrete
floors and attempts to optimize the design of dowels through Finite Element
(FE) analysis. A new type of Double-Tapered Round (DTR) dowels is proposed, and
the performance of DTR dowels is compared to that of traditional cylindrical
dowels. Linear Elastic (LE) analysis are performed in Abaqus (v-6.11) order to
identify the optimized geometry of DTR dowels that would achieve (1) highest
load transfer across adjacent slabs through shear action, and (2) lowest
bearing stresses on the concrete. LE analyses are complemented by nonlinear FE
analysis. The Riks method available in Abaqus/Standard, coupled with the
Concrete Damaged Plasticity (CDP) model is used to simulate the degradation of
concrete surrounding both DTR the traditional cylindrical dowels. Results
obtained show that the use of DTR dowels can reduce bearing stresses at the
face of the joint by as much 2.2 times as compared to traditional cylindrical
dowels. While adequate load-transfer is a crucial part for the proper
performance pavement structures, the load-transfer capacity of DTR dowels was
more effective over cylindrical dowels by as far as 116%. In the inelastic
range, even after significant concrete degradation and steel yielding, DTR
dowels maintained a higher load-transfer capacity than traditional cylindrical
dowels, and also presented lower amounts of differential deflections across
concrete floors. Finally, damage in the concrete matrix below the dowel was
relatively more confined for the case of DTR dowels, as compared to traditional
cylindrical dowels.

epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) leads to the formation of quasi free standing
small aggregates of clusters. Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy
measurements reveal that these clusters preserve the linear dispersion of the
graphene quasiparticles and surprisingly increase their Fermi velocity. They
also strongly modify the band structure of graphene around the Van Hove
singularities (VHs) by a strong extension without charge transfer. This result
gives a new insight on the role of the intercalant in the renormalization of
the bare electronic band structure of graphene usually observed in Graphite and
Graphene Intercalation Compounds.
