Tomchenko","On the probable wave nature of Bose crystals","2 pages, submitted in Nature, v2: reference 8 is completed",,,,"cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  At the present time, it is considered that Bose crystals are formed at the
cooling of a fluid, because the state of crystal is more favorable by energy.
It is also believed [1,2] that no ordering factor forming a crystal is present,
except for the interatomic interaction.
  However, the available solutions [1,2,3] for the wave functions (WFs) of the
ground and excited states of a crystal are approximate and are obtained for
cyclic boundary conditions, which are not realized in the Nature. Here, we
present the exact solutions for the WFs of a Bose crystal with rectangular
lattice under natural zero boundary conditions.
  The structure of WFs implies that 1) a crystal is formed by a standing wave
in the probability field; 2) a crystal in the ground state contains a
condensate of atoms with the wave vector \textbf{k}_l=(\pi/\bar{R}_x,
\pi/\bar{R}_y, \pi/\bar{R}_z) (\bar{R}_x, \bar{R}_y, \bar{R}_z are the periods
of the lattice) that is equal to a half of the vector of the reciprocal
lattice. These solutions indicate that the ordering factor forming a crystal is
an intense standing wave similar to a sound one. Thus, the periodicity of a
lattice is caused by that of a sound wave, but not only by the energy minimum
principle. Apparently, the crystals of other types and with different lattices
have the wave nature as well. The condensate opens a possibility to explain the
nonclassical inertia moment discovered by Kim and Chan [4,5] in solid He-4,
which testifies, probably, to the presence of a superfluid subsystem in the
crystal.

for stripe ordering of charges and magnetic moments. Therefore, stripe order
should be considered as the typical consequence of doping a Mott insulator, but
only in cuprates stripe order or fluctuating stripes coexist with metallic
properties. A linear relationship between the charge concentration and the
incommensurate structural and magnetic modulations can be considered as the
finger print of stripe ordering with localized degrees of freedom. In
nickelates and in cobaltates with K2NiF4 structure, doping suppresses the
nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetism and induces stripe order. The higher amount
of doping needed to induce stripe phases in these non-cuprates series can be
attributed to reduced charge mobility. Also manganites exhibit clear evidence
for stripe phases with further enhanced complexity, because orbital degrees of
freedom are involved. Orbital ordering is the key element of stripe order in
manganites since it is associated with the strongest structural distortion and
with the perfectly fulfilled relation between doping and incommensurability.
Magnetic excitations in insulating stripe phases exhibit strong similarity with
those in the cuprates, but only for sufficiently short magnetic correlation
lengths reflecting well-defined magnetic stripes that are only loosely coupled.

between two and three with respect to redundancy policies aiming for data
availability. These results imply an according increase in storage capacity and
decrease in time to complete backups, at the expense of longer times required
to restore data. We believe this is a very reasonable price to pay, given the
nature of the application.
  We complete our work with a discussion on practical issues, and their
solutions, related to which encoding technique is more suitable to support our

systems which support oscillations. In this work we consider a prototype of
such systems, which has been recently found at the core of many genetic
circuits showing oscillatory behaviour. Our model consists of two interacting
species A and B, where A activates not only its own production, but also that
of its repressor B. While the self-activation of A leads already to a bistable
unit, the coupling with a negative feedback loop via B makes the unit
frustrated. In the deterministic limit of infinitely many molecules, such a
bistable frustrated unit is known to show excitable and oscillatory dynamics,
depending on the maximum production rate of A which acts as a control
parameter. We study this model in its fully stochastic version and we find
oscillations even for parameters which in the deterministic limit are deeply in
the fixed-point regime. The deeper we go into this regime, the more irregular
these oscillations are, becoming finally random excitations whenever
fluctuations allow the system to overcome the barrier for a large excursion in
phase space. The fluctuations can no longer be fully treated as a perturbation.
The smaller the system size (the number of molecules), the more frequent are
these excitations. Therefore, stochasticity caused by demographic noise makes
this unit even more flexible with respect to its oscillatory behaviour.

we also present a phase diagram for the expected final fates of rotating
massive Pop III stars. Our non-rotating models become redder than the previous
models in the literature, given the larger overshooting parameter adopted in
this study. In particular, convective dredge-up of the helium core material
into the hydrogen envelope is observed in our non-rotating very massive star
models (>~200 Msun), which is potentially important for the chemical yields. On
the other hand, the stars become bluer and more luminous with a higher
rotational velocity. With the Spruit-Tayler dynamo, our models with a
sufficiently high initial rotational velocity can reach the critical rotation
earlier and lose more mass as a result, compared to the previous models without
magnetic fields. The most dramatic effect of rotation is found with the
so-called chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), which is observed for a
limited mass and rotational velocity range. CHE has several important
consequences: 1) Both primary nitrogen and ionizing photons are abundantly
produced. 2) Conditions for gamma-ray burst progenitors are fulfilled for an
initial mass range of 13 - 84 Msun. 3) Pair instability supernovae of type Ibc
are expected for 84 -190 Msun and 4) Both a pulsational pair instability
supernova and a GRB may occur from the same progenitor of about 56 - 84 Msun,
which might significantly influence the consequent GRB afterglow. We find that
CHE does not occur for very massive stars (> 190 Msun), in which case the
hydrogen envelope expands to the red-supergiant phase and the final angular
momentum is too low to make any explosive event powered by rotation.

of systems biology. One approach is to analyze gene expression data to infer a
network of gene interactions on the basis of their correlated responses to
environmental and genetic perturbations. The inferred network can then be
analyzed to identify functional communities. However, commonly used algorithms
can yield unreliable results due to experimental noise, algorithmic
stochasticity, and the influence of arbitrarily chosen parameter values.
Furthermore, the results obtained typically provide only a simplistic view of
the network partitioned into disjoint communities and provide no information of
the relationship between communities. Here, we present methods to robustly
detect coregulated and functionally enriched gene communities and demonstrate
their application and validity for Escherichia coli gene expression data.
Applying a recently developed community detection algorithm to the network of
interactions identified with the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR)
method, we show that a hierarchy of network communities can be identified.
These communities significantly enrich for gene ontology (GO) terms, consistent
with them representing biologically meaningful groups. Further, analysis of the
most significantly enriched communities identified several candidate new
regulatory interactions. The robustness of our methods is demonstrated by
showing that a core set of functional communities is reliably found when
artificial noise, modeling experimental noise, is added to the data. We find
that noise mainly acts conservatively, increasing the relatedness required for
a network link to be reliably assigned and decreasing the size of the core
communities, rather than causing association of genes into new communities.

the modified Str\""omgren and Str\""omgren filter systems to produce similar

infer that the technique is able to relieve the age-metallicity degeneracy by
separating the age effects from the metallicity effects, but still unable to
completely break. We further extend this paper to re-study the evolution of
galaxies in the low mass, dynamically poor A779 cluster by correlating the
luminosity (mass), density, radial distance with the estimated age,
metallicity, and the star formation history. Our results distinctly show the
bimodality of the young, low-mass, metal-poor population with the mean age of
6.7 Gyr (\pm 0.5 Gyr) and the old, high-mass, metal-rich galaxies with the mean
age of 9 Gyr (\pm 0.5 Gyr). The method also observes the color evolution of the
blue cluster galaxies to red, and the downsizing phenomenon. Our analysis shows
that the modified Str\""omgren photometry is very well suited for studying low-
and intermediate-z clusters, as it is capable of observing deeper with better
spatial resolution at spectroscopic redshift limits, and the narrowband filters
estimate the age and metallicity with lesser uncertainties compared to other

persistent jumps over the unbounded set of categories, the asymptotic

primordial black holes during the radiative era of the early universe, we
present here a further investigation of the critical nature of the process
involved, aimed at making contact with some of the basic underlying ideas from
the literature on critical collapse. We focus on the intermediate state, which
we have found appearing in cases with perturbations close to the critical
limit, and examine the connection between this and the similarity solutions
which play a fundamental role in the standard picture of critical collapse. We
have derived a set of self-similar equations for the null-slicing form of the
metric which we are using for our numerical calculations, and have then
compared the results obtained by integrating these with the ones coming from
our simulations for collapse of cosmological perturbations within an expanding
universe. We find that the similarity solution is asymptotically approached in
a region which grows to cover both the contracting matter and part of the
semi-void which forms outside it. Our main interest is in the situation
relevant for primordial black hole formation in the radiative era of the early
universe, where the relation between the pressure $p$ and the energy density
$e$ can be reasonably approximated by an expression of the form $p = we$ with
$w=1/3$. However, we have also looked at other values of $w$, both because
these have been considered in previous literature and also because they can be
helpful for giving further insight into situations relevant for primordial
black hole formation. As in our previous work, we have started our simulations

symmetry of a neutron star. Most notably is rotation, magnetic fields, and/or
accretion of matter from companion stars. All these phenomena influence the
macroscopic structures of neutron stars, but also impact their microscopic
compositions. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the cooling of
rotationally deformed, two-dimensional (2D) neutron stars in the framework of
general relativity theory, with the ultimate goal of better understand the
impact of 2D effects on the thermal evolution of such objects. The equations
that govern the thermal evolution of rotating neutron stars are presented in
this paper. The cooling of neutron stars with different frequencies is computed
self-consistently by combining a fully general relativistic 2D rotation code
with a general relativistic 2D cooling code. We show that rotation can
significantly influence the thermal evolution of rotating neutron stars. Among
the major new aspects are the appearances of hot spots on the poles, and an
increase of the thermal coupling times between the core and the crust of
rotating neutron stars. We show that this increase is independent of the
microscopic properties of the stellar core, but depends only on the frequency
of the star.

have to take into account not only the network topology, but also dynamics of
interactions between nodes. We investigate this claim using the paradigm of
synchronization in a network of coupled oscillators. As the network evolves to
a global steady state, nodes belonging to the same community synchronize faster
than nodes belonging to different communities. Traditionally, nodes in network
synchronization models are coupled via one-to-one, or conservative
interactions. However, social interactions are often one-to-many, as for
example, in social media, where users broadcast messages to all their
followers. We formulate a novel model of synchronization in a network of
coupled oscillators in which the oscillators are coupled via one-to-many, or
non-conservative interactions. We study the dynamics of different interaction
models and contrast their spectral properties. To find multi-scale community
structure in a network of interacting nodes, we define a similarity function
that measures the degree to which nodes are synchronized and use it to
hierarchically cluster nodes. We study real-world social networks, including
networks of two social media providers. To evaluate the quality of the
discovered communities in a social media network we propose a community quality
metric based on user activity. We find that conservative and non-conservative
interaction models lead to dramatically different views of community structure
even within the same network. Our work offers a novel mathematical framework
for exploring the relationship between network structure, topology and
dynamics.

However, when implementation complexity is considered, the expansions are

protograph expansion by cyclically shifting connections generates a
quasi-cyclic (QC) code. Other recent work by Smarandache and Vontobel has
provided upper bounds on the minimum distance of QC codes. In this paper, we
generalize these bounds to punctured QC codes and then show how to tighten
these for certain classes of codes. We then evaluate these upper bounds for the

wide range of scientific measurements. From a user's perspective, an ideal
amplifier has very low noise, operates over a broad frequency range, and has a
high dynamic range - it is capable of handling strong signals with little
distortion. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain all of these
characteristics simultaneously. For example, modern transistor amplifiers offer
multi-octave bandwidths and excellent dynamic range. However, their noise
remains far above the fundamental limit set by the uncertainty principle of
quantum mechanics. Parametric amplifiers, which predate transistor amplifiers
and are widely used in optics, exploit a nonlinear response to transfer power
from a strong pump tone to a weak signal. If the nonlinearity is purely
reactive, ie. nondissipative, in theory the amplifier noise can reach the
quantum-mechanical limit. Indeed, microwave frequency superconducting Josephson
parametric amplifiers do approach the quantum limit, but generally are narrow
band and have very limited dynamic range. In this paper, we describe a
superconducting parametric amplifier that overcomes these limitations. The
amplifier is very simple, consisting only of a patterned metal film on a
dielectric substrate, and relies on the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a
superconducting transmission line. We measure gain extending over 2 GHz on
either side of an 11.56 GHz pump tone, and we place an upper limit on the added
noise of the amplifier of 3.4 photons at 9.4 GHz. Furthermore, the dynamic
range is very large, comparable to microwave transistor amplifiers, and the
concept can be applied throughout the microwave, millimeter-wave and
submillimeter-wave bands.

SDSS DR7 with the NVSS and FIRST radio surveys. Using this sample, the
differences between `high-excitation' (or `quasar-mode'; HERG) and
`low-excitation' (`radio-mode'; LERG) radio galaxies are investigated. A
primary difference is the distinct nature of the Eddington-scaled accretion
rate onto their central black holes: HERGs typically have accretion rates
between 1 and 10% of Eddington, whereas LERGs predominatly accrete at a rate
below 1% Eddington. This is consistent with models where the population
dichotomy is caused by a switch between radiatively efficient and inefficient
accretion modes at low accretion rates. Local radio luminosity functions are
derived separately for the two populations, showing that although LERGs
dominate at low luminosity and HERGs above 1e26 W/Hz, examples of both classes
are found at all radio luminosities. Using the V/Vmax test it is shown that the
populations show differential cosmic evolution at fixed radio luminosity: HERGs
evolve strongly at all luminosities, while LERGs show weak or no evolution.
This suggests that the luminosity-dependent evolution of the radio luminosity
function is driven, at least in part, by the changing relative contributions of
these two populations with luminosity. The host galaxies of the sources are
also distinct: HERGs are typically of lower stellar mass, with lower black hole
masses, bluer colours and weaker 4000-Ang breaks indicating younger stellar
populations. These results offer strong support to the picture in which HERGs
are fuelled at high rates through radiative accretion disks by cold gas,
perhaps from mergers and interactions, while LERGs are fuelled via radiatively
inefficient flows at low accretion rates, often by gas associated with the hot
X-ray haloes of their host galaxy/cluster, as part of a radio-AGN feedback loop

the observation of old neutron stars with strong dark matter self-interactions.
We show that for a dark matter density of $~10^3$ GeV/cm$^3$ and dark matter
mass $m_\chi$ less than approximately 10 GeV, there is a potential exclusion
region for dark matter interactions with nucleons that is three orders of
magnitude more stringent than without self-interactions. The potential
exclusion region for dark matter self-interaction cross sections is many orders
of magnitude stronger than the current Bullet Cluster limit. For example, for
high dark matter density regions, we find that for $m_\chi\sim 10$ GeV when the
dark matter interaction cross section with the nucleons ranges from
$\sigma_{\chi n}\sim 10^{-52}$ cm$^2$ to $10^{-57}$ cm$^2$, the dark matter
self-interaction cross section limit is $\sigma_{\chi\chi}< 10^{-33}$ cm$^2$,
which is about ten orders of magnitude stronger than the Bullet Cluster limit.

proplyds, but in agreement with the theoretical scaling of proplyd size with
distance from the ionizing source. These objects are located at projected
separations of 6-14pc from the OB association, compared to 0.1pc for the Orion
proplyds, but are clearly being photoionized by the 65 O-type stars in Cyg OB2.
Central star candidates are identified in near- and mid-IR images, supporting
the proplyd scenario, though their large sizes and notable asymmetries is more
consistent with the EGG scenario. A third possibility is therefore considered,
that these are a unique class of photoevaporating partially-embedded young

driving galaxy formation and evolution. The rest-frame UV emission is key to
measure the cosmic SFR. However, UV light is strongly reddened by dust. In
starburst galaxies, the UV colour and the attenuation are linked, allowing to
correct for dust extinction. Unfortunately, evidence has been accumulating that
the relation between UV colour and attenuation is different for normal
star-forming galaxies when compared to starburst galaxies. It is still not
understood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the UV colour-attenuation
relation of starburst galaxies. Previous work and models hint that the role of
the shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations have an
important role. In this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasons
to explain this deviation. We have used the CIGALE SED fitting code to model
the far UV to the far IR emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiral
galaxies from the HRS. We have explored the influence of a wide range of
physical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on the accurate
determination of the attenuation from the UV colour, and why normal galaxies do
not follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. We have found that the
deviation can be best explained by intrinsic UV colour differences between
different regions in galaxies. Variations in the shape of the attenuation curve
can also play a secondary role. Standard age estimators of the stellar
populations prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic UV colour. These
results are also retrieved on a sample of 58 galaxies when considering their
integrated fluxes. When correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxies
for the attenuation, it is crucial to take into account possible variations in
the intrinsic UV colour as well as variations of the shape of the attenuation
curve.

consider white dwarf masses ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 $M_\odot$ and account for
their different chemical compositions. We find excellent agreement with the
orbital evolution predicted by mass transfer stability analysis. Much of our
effort in this paper is dedicated to determining which binary systems are prone
to a thermonuclear explosion just prior to merger or at surface contact. We
find that a large fraction of He-accreting binary systems explode: all
dynamically unstable systems with accretor masses below 1.1 $M_\odot$ and donor
masses above $\sim$ 0.4 $M_\odot$ are found to trigger a helium detonation at
surface contact. A substantial fraction of these systems could explode at
earlier times via detonations induced by instabilities in the accretion stream,
as we have demonstrated in our previous work. We do not find definitive
evidence for an explosion prior to merger or at surface contact in any of the
studied double carbon-oxygen systems. Although we cannot exclude their
occurrence if some helium is present, the available parameter space for a
successful detonation in a white dwarf binary of pure carbon-oxygen composition
is small. We demonstrate that a wide variety of dynamically unstable systems
are viable type Ia candidates. The next decade thus holds enormous promise for
the study of these events, in particular with the advent of wide-field synoptic

satellite galaxies lose stellar mass and contribute to the diffuse ""intrahalo
light"" (IHL). We implement two models that relate satellite galaxy stellar mass
loss to the detailed knowledge of subhalo dark matter mass loss. Model 1
assumes that the fractional stellar mass loss of a galaxy is proportional to
the fractional amount of dark matter mass loss of its subhalo. Model 2 accounts
for a delay in the time that stellar mass is lost since the galaxy resides deep
in the potential well of the subhalo which may experience dark matter mass loss
for some time before the galaxy is affected. We use these models to predict the
stellar masses of a population of galaxies and use abundance matching to
predict the clustering of several r-band luminosity threshold samples from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Abundance matching assuming no stellar mass loss
(akin to abundance matching at the time of subhalo infall) over-estimates the
correlation function on small scales (<~ 1 Mpc), while allowing too much
stellar mass loss leads to an under-estimate. For each sample, we are thus able
to constrain the amount of stellar mass loss required to match the observed
clustering. We find that less luminous satellite galaxies experience more
efficient stellar mass loss than luminous satellites. From these models, we can
infer the amount of stellar mass that is deposited into the IHL. We find that
both of our model predictions for the mean amount of IHL as a function of halo
mass are consistent with current observational measurements. However, our two
models predict a different amount of scatter in the IHL from halo to halo, with
Model 2 being favored by observations. This demonstrates that a comparison to
IHL measurements provides independent verification of our stellar mass loss
models. (Abridged)

Turn-Offs, with spectroscopic metallicity distributions of Red Giant Branch
stars. This allows us to obtain the most detailed and complete Star Formation
History to date, as well as an accurate timescale for chemical enrichment. The
Star Formation History shows that Sculptor is dominated by old ($>$10 Gyr),
metal-poor stars, but that younger, more metal-rich populations are also
present. Using Star Formation Histories determined at different radii from the
centre we show that Sculptor formed stars with an increasing central
concentration with time. The old, metal-poor populations are present at all
radii, while more metal-rich, younger stars are more centrally concentrated. We
find that within an elliptical radius of 1 degree, or 1.5 kpc from the centre,
a total mass in stars of 7.8$\times10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$ was formed, between 14
and 7 Gyr ago, with a peak at 13$-$14 Gyr ago. We use the detailed Star
Formation History to determine age estimates for individual Red Giant Branch
stars with high resolution spectroscopic abundances. Thus, for the first time,
we can directly determine detailed timescales for the evolution of individual
chemical elements. We find that the trends in alpha-elements match what is
expected from an extended, relatively uninterrupted period of star formation
continuing for 6$-$7 Gyr. The knee in the alpha-element distribution occurs at
an age of 10.9$\pm$1Gyr, suggesting that SNe Ia enrichment began
$\approx2\pm$1Gyr after the start of star formation in Sculptor.

true elliptical galaxies. Our sample selection method does not introduce
artificial cuts in the parameters describing the galaxy but instead it
associates to every object a weight measuring the probability of being in a
given spectro-morphological class. Thus the sample minimizes the selection
biases. We show that morphologically defined ellipticals are basically
distributed in 3 spectral classes, which dominate at different stellar masses.
The bulk of the population (about 50%) is formed by a well defined class of
galaxies with old stellar populations that formed their stars at very early
epochs in a short episode of star formation. They dominate the scaling
relations of elliptical galaxies known from previous works and represent the
canonical elliptical class. At the low mass end, we find a population of
slightly larger ellipticals, with smaller velocity dispersions at fixed stellar
mass, which seem to have experienced a more recent episode of star formation
probably triggered by gas-rich minor mergers. The high mass end tends to be
dominated by a third spectral class, slightly more metal rich and with more
efficient stellar formation than the reference class. This third class
contributes to the curvature of the mass-size relation at high masses reported
in previous works. Our method is therefore able to isolate typical spectra of
elliptical galaxies following different evolutive pathways.

counts in the PACS (100 & 160) and SPIRE (250, 350, and 500 micron) bands with
available observations. We find very good agreement with the counts in the PACS
bands, for the overall counts and for galaxies binned by redshift at z< 2. At z
> 2 our model underpredicts the number of bright galaxies by a factor of ten.
The agreement is much worse for all three SPIRE bands, and becomes
progressively worse with increasing wavelength. We discuss a number of possible
reasons for these discrepancies, and hypothesize that the effect of blending on
the observational flux estimates is likely to be the dominant issue. We note
that the PACS number counts are relatively robust to changes in the dust
emission templates, while the predicted SPIRE number counts are more template
dependent. We present quantitative predictions for the relationship between the
observed PACS 160 and SPIRE 250 micron fluxes and physical quantities such as
halo mass, stellar mass, cold gas mass, star formation rate, and total infrared
(IR) luminosity, at different redshifts. We also present quantitative
predictions for the correlation between PACS 160 micron flux and the
probability that a galaxy has experienced a recent major or minor merger.
Although our models predict a strong correlation between these quantities, such
that more IR-luminous galaxies are more likely to be merger-driven, we find
that more than half of all high redshift IR-luminous galaxies detected by

find that both optical colour and mass-to-light (M/L) ratio gradients are
shallower in central galaxies residing in denser environments (higher N_gal).
This trend is driven by metallicity gradients, while age gradients appear to be
less dependent on the environment and to have a larger scatter. On the other
hand, satellites do not show any differences in terms of the environment. The
same results are found if galaxies are classified by central age, and both
central and satellite galaxies have shallower gradients if they are older and
steeper gradients if younger, satellites being independent of ages. In central
galaxies, we show that the observed trends can be explained with the occurrence
of dry mergings, which are more numerous in denser environments and producing
shallower colour gradients because of more uniform metallicity distributions
due to the mixing of stellar populations, while no final clues about merging
occurrence can be obtained for satellites. Finally we discuss all systematics

construct the f(R) theory of N=2, D=5 gauged supergravity with a vector
multiplet, and that for the four-dimensional U(1)^4 gauged theory with three
vector fields set equal. We find that some previously-known BPS singular
""superstars"" become wormholes in the f(R) theories. We also construct a large
class of f(R) (gauged) pseudo-supergravities. In addition we show that the

tension by using the current Pulsar Timing Array limits on the stochastic
gravitational wave background (SGWB). We have developed a code to compute the
spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) based on the widely accepted one-scale
model. In its simplest form the one-scale model allows one to vary: (i) the
string tension, G\mu/c^2; (ii) the size of cosmic string loops relative to the
horizon at birth, \alpha; (iii) the spectral index of the emission spectrum, q;
(iv) the cut-off in the emission spectrum, n_*; and (v) the intercommutation
probability, p. The amplitude and slope of the spectrum in the nHz frequency
range is very sensitive to these unknown parameters. We have also investigated
the impact of more complicated scenarios with multiple initial loop sizes, in
particular the 2-\alpha models proposed in the literature and a log-normal
distribution for \alpha. We have computed the constraint on G\mu/c^2 due to the
limit on a SGWB imposed by data from the European Pulsar Timing Array. Taking
into account all the possible uncertainties in the parameters we find a
conservative upper limit of G\mu/c^2<5.3x 10^{-7} which typically occurs when
the loop production scale is close to the gravitational backreaction scale,
\alpha\approx\Gamma G\mu/c^2. Stronger limits are possible for specific values
of the parameters which typically correspond to the extremal cases \alpha\ll
\Gamma G\mu/c^2 and \alpha\gg \Gamma G\mu/c^2. This limit is less stringent
than the previously published limits which are based on cusp emission, an
approach which does not necessarily model all the possible uncertainties. We
discuss the prospects for lowering this limit by two orders of magnitude, or
even a detection of the SGWB, in the very near future in the context of the
Large European Array for Pulsars and the Square Kilometre Array.

an orbital period of about 35 years (for a circular orbit). Around the primary
star, we detect a disk-like structure with indications for a radial temperature
gradient. The polar axis of this AU-scale disk is aligned with the
arcminute-scale bipolar nebula in which V921 Sco is embedded. Using

study in a clustered high-stellar-density star-forming environment. We
particularly aim to determine the presence of magnetospheric accretion and dust
disks for each binary component, and measure the overall disk frequency. We
carried out spatially resolved adaptive-optics-assisted observations to acquire
near-IR photometry and spectroscopy of 26 binaries in the ONC, and determine
stellar parameters such as effective temperatures, spectral types,
luminosities, and masses, as well as accretion properties and near-infrared
excesses for the individual binary components. A fraction of 40(+10/-9)% of the
binary components in the sample can be inferred to be T Tauri stars possessing
an accretion disk, marginally fewer than the disk fraction of single stars. We
find that disks in wide binaries of >200AU separation are consistent with
random pairing, while the evolution of circumprimary and circumsecondary disks
is observed to be synchronized in close binaries (separations <200AU).
Circumbinary disks appear to be unsuitable to explain this difference.
Furthermore, we identify several mixed pairs of accreting and non-accreting
components, suggesting that these systems are common and that there is no
preference for either the more or less massive component to evolve faster. The
derived accretion luminosities and mass accretion rates of the ONC binary
components are of similar magnitude as those for both ONC single stars and
binaries in the Taurus star-forming region. The paper concludes with a
discussion of the (presumably weak) connection between the presence of inner
accretion disks in young binary systems and the existence of planets in stellar

This is finally adapted to a parton level simulation using the CHARYBDIS2

unbiased method, as well as by using single high $p_{\rm T}$ particles and
simulated jets embedded into real Pb-Pb events and reconstructed with the
anti-$k_{\rm T}$ jet finder. The influence of a low transverse momentum cut-off
on particles used in the jet reconstruction is quantified by varying the
minimum track $p_{\rm T}$ between 0.15 GeV/$c$ and 2 GeV/$c$. For embedded jets
reconstructed from charged particles with $p_{\rm T} > 0.15$ GeV/$c$, the
uncertainty in the reconstructed jet transverse momentum due to the heavy-ion
background is measured to be 11.3 GeV/$c$ (standard deviation) for the 10% most
central Pb-Pb collisions, slightly larger than the value of 11.0 GeV/$c$
measured using the unbiased method. For a higher particle transverse momentum
threshold of 2 GeV/$c$, which will generate a stronger bias towards hard
fragmentation in the jet finding process, the standard deviation of the
fluctuations in the reconstructed jet transverse momentum is reduced to 4.8-5.0
GeV/$c$ for the 10% most central events. A non-Gaussian tail of the momentum
uncertainty is observed and its impact on the reconstructed jet spectrum is
evaluated for varying particle momentum thresholds, by folding the measured
fluctuations with steeply falling spectra.

models have been studied, in part, as a way to address apparent discrepancies
between the predictions of standard cold dark matter models and observations of
galactic structure. Our study is aimed at developing independent constraints on
these models. In such models, DDM decays into a less massive, stable dark
matter (SDM) particle and a significantly lighter particle. The small mass
splitting between the parent DDM and the daughter SDM provides the SDM with a
recoil or ""kick"" velocity vk, inducing a free-streaming suppression of matter
fluctuations. This suppression may be probed via weak lensing power spectra
measured by a number of forthcoming imaging surveys that aim primarily to
constrain dark energy. Using scales on which linear perturbation theory alone
is valid (multipoles < 300), surveys like Euclid or LSST can be sensitive to vk
> 90 km/s for lifetimes ~ 1-5 Gyr. To estimate more aggressive constraints, we
model nonlinear corrections to lensing power using a simple halo evolution
model that is in good agreement with numerical simulations. In our most
ambitious forecasts, using multipoles < 3000, we find that imaging surveys can
be sensitive to vk ~ 10 km/s for lifetimes < 10 Gyr. Lensing will provide a
particularly interesting complement to existing constraints in that they will
probe the long lifetime regime far better than contemporary techniques. A
caveat to these ambitious forecasts is that the evolution of perturbations on
nonlinear scales will need to be well calibrated by numerical simulations
before they can be realized. This work motivates the pursuit of such a
numerical simulation campaign to constrain dark matter with cosmological weak
lensing.

cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated
by some form of ""dark energy"" with exotic physical properties, or that
Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound
implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious experimental
efforts to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with
percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well
established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clusters.
We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques
and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit ""Stage
IV"" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We
briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space
distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski test, and direct measurements of H_0. We
present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of
state and parameterized deviations from GR, achievable with Stage III and Stage
IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and
CMB data. We also show the level of precision required for other methods to
provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We
emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most
powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties
and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic
acceleration produce data sets with broad applications, and they continue the
longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater
detail over ever larger scales.

and continues to be performed using the finite element method. However, the
issues of mesh entanglement under large deformation, considerable complexity in
handling contact, and difficulties encountered while solving large deformation
fluid-structure interaction problems have led to the exploration of alternative
approaches. The material point method uses Lagrangian solid particles embedded
in an Eulerian grid. Particles interact via the grid with other particles in
the same body, with other solid bodies, and with fluids. Thus, the three issues
mentioned in the context of finite element analysis are circumvented.
  In this paper, we present simulations of cylinders which fragment due to
explosively expanding gases generated by reactions in a high energy material
contained inside. The material point method is the numerical method chosen for
these simulations discussed in this paper. The plastic deformation of metals is
simulated using a hypoelastic-plastic stress update with radial return that
assumes an additive decomposition of the rate of deformation tensor. Various
plastic strain, plastic strain rate, and temperature dependent flow rules and
yield conditions are investigated. Failure at individual material points is
determined using porosity, damage and bifurcation conditions. Our models are
validated using data from high strain rate impact experiments. It is concluded
that the material point method possesses great potential for simulating high

Minimization of this term favors those 4D-CBCT images such that any anatomical
features at one spatial point at one phase can be found in a nearby spatial
point at neighboring phases. 4D-CBCT reconstruction is achieved by minimizing a
total energy containing a data fidelity term and the TNLM energy term. As for
the image enhancement, 4D-CBCT images generated by the FDK algorithm are
enhanced by minimizing the TNLM function while keeping the enhanced images
close to the FDK results. A forward-backward splitting algorithm and a
Gauss-Jacobi iteration method are employed to solve the problems. The
algorithms are implemented on GPU to achieve a high computational efficiency.
The reconstruction algorithm and the enhancement algorithm generate visually
similar 4D-CBCT images, both better than the FDK results. Quantitative
evaluations indicate that, compared with the FDK results, our reconstruction
method improves contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) by a factor of 2.56~3.13 and our
enhancement method increases the CNR by 2.75~3.33 times. The enhancement method

Calibrated Doppler velocities would be useful for (i) improving estimates of
the Poynting flux of magnetic energy across the photosphere, and (ii)
constraining processes underlying flux cancellation, the mutual apparent loss
of magnetic flux in closely spaced, opposite-polarity magnetogram features. We
present a method to absolutely calibrate line-of-sight (LOS) velocities in
solar active regions (ARs) near disk center using three successive vector
magnetograms and one Dopplergram coincident with the central magnetogram. It
exploits the fact that Doppler shifts measured along polarity inversion lines
(PILs) of the LOS magnetic field determine one component of the velocity
perpendicular to the magnetic field, and optimizes consistency between changes
in LOS flux near PILs and the transport of transverse magnetic flux by LOS
velocities, assuming ideal electric fields govern the magnetic evolution. We
apply our method to vector magnetograms of AR 11158, observed by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory,
and find clear evidence of offsets in the Doppler zero point, in the range of
50 -- 550 m s$^{-1}$. In addition, we note that a simpler calibration can be
determined from an LOS magnetogram and Dopplergram pair from the median Doppler
velocity among all near-disk-center PIL pixels. We briefly discuss shortcomings
in our initial implementation, and suggest ways to address these. In addition,
as a step in our data reduction, we discuss use of temporal continuity in the
transverse magnetic field direction to correct apparently spurious fluctuations

force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations based on simultaneous observations at a
photospheric and a chromospheric height. To that end, we used the Si I 10827
\AA\ line and the He I 10830 \AA\ triplet obtained with the Tenerife Infrared
Polarimeter (TIP) at the VTT (Tenerife). The two extrapolations have been
carried out independently from each other and their respective spatial domains
overlap in a considerable height range. This opens up new possibilities for
diagnostics in addition to the usual ones obtained through a single
extrapolation from, typically, a photospheric layer. Among those possibilities,
this method allows the determination of an average formation height of the He I
10830 \AA\ signal of \approx 2 Mm above the surface of the sun. It allows, as
well, to cross-check the obtained 3D magnetic structures in view of verifying a
possible deviation from the force- free condition especially at the
photosphere. The extrapolations yield a filament formed by a twisted flux rope
whose axis is located at about 1.4 Mm above the solar surface. The twisted
field lines make slightly more than one turn along the filament within our box,
which results in 0.055 turns/Mm. The convex part of the field lines (as seen
from the solar surface) constitute dips where the plasma can naturally be
supported. The obtained 3D magnetic structure of the filament depends on the
choice of the observed horizontal magnetic field as determined from the
180\circ solution of the azimuth. We derive a method to check for the
correctness of the selected 180\circ ambiguity solution.

use the model of Hannestad and Raffelt (HR) that calculates the Kaluza-Klein
(KK) graviton production in supernova cores and the large fraction subsequently
gravitationally bound around the resulting NS. The predicted decay of the bound
KK gravitons to {\gamma}{\gamma} should contribute to the flux from NSs.
Considering 2 to 7 extra dimensions of the same size in the context of the HR
model, we use Monte Carlo techniques to calculate the expected differential
flux of gamma-rays arising from these KK gravitons, including the effects of
the age of the NS, graviton orbit, and absorption of gamma-rays in the
magnetosphere of the NS. We compare our Monte Carlo-based differential flux to
the experimental differential flux using maximum likelihood techniques to
obtain our limits on LED. Our limits are more restrictive than past EGRET-based
optimistic limits that do not include these important corrections.
Additionally, our limits are more stringent than LHC based limits for 3 or
fewer LED, and comparable for 4 LED. We conclude that if the effective Planck
scale is around a TeV, then for 2 or 3 LED the compactification topology must
be more complicated than a torus.

upper bounds for the truncated series estimator. Besides, our proof contains
several ingredients which might be of independent interest: 1. The notion of
approximation radius depends on the volume of the body. It is an intuitive
notion and is flexible to yield strong minimax lower bounds; 2. The connection
between the approximation radius and the Kolmogorov width is a consequence of a
novel duality relationship on the Kolmogorov width, developed by utilizing some

key technique referred to as eigen-direction alignment (EDA) precoding. The EDA
precoding efficiently aligns the two-user's eigen-modes into the same
directions. Based on that, we carry out multi-stream PNC over the aligned
eigen-modes. We derive an achievable rate of the proposed EDA-PNC scheme, based
on nested lattice codes, over a MIMO TWRC. Asymptotic analysis shows that the
proposed EDA-PNC scheme approaches the capacity upper bound as the number of
user antennas increases towards infinity. For a finite number of user antennas,
we formulate the design criterion of the optimal EDA precoder and present
solutions. Numerical results show that there is only a marginal gap between the
achievable rate of the proposed EDA-PNC scheme and the capacity upper bound of
the MIMO TWRC, in the median-to-large SNR region. We also show that the

quantify the geometric impact of anchor placement on localization performance.
We present a theoretical framework for quantifying the anchor placement impact.
An experimental study, as well as the field test using a UWB ranging
technology, is presented. These experimental results validate the theoretical
analysis. As a byproduct, we propose a two-phase localization method (TPLM) and
show that TPLM outperforms the least-square method in localization accuracy by
a huge margin. TPLM performs much faster than the gradient descent method and
slightly better than the gradient descent method in localization accuracy. Our
field test suggests that TPLM is more robust against noise than the
least-square and gradient descent methods.

to, e.g., instability of rotational shear. In this paper we estimate turbulent
transport coefficients for stably stratified rotating stellar radiation zones.
Stable stratification induces strong anisotropy with a very small ratio of
radial-to-horizontal turbulence intensities. Angular momentum is transported
mainly due to the correlation between azimuthal and radial turbulent motions
induced by the Coriolis force. This non-diffusive transport known as the
Lambda-effect has outward direction in radius and is much more efficient
compared to the effect of radial eddy viscosity. Chemical species are
transported by small radial diffusion only. This result is confirmed using
direct numerical simulations combined with the test-scalar method. As a
consequence of the non-diffusive transport of angular momentum, the estimated
characteristic time of rotational coupling (< 100 Myr) between radiative core
and convective envelope in young solar-type stars is much shorter compared to
the time-scale of Lithium depletion (~1 Gyr).

addition of bone by osteoblasts, a process that is modulated by the prevailing
mechanical environment. In this paper a fully coupled model of bone remodeling
is developed, based on coupling a bone cell population model with a
micromechanical homogenization scheme of bone stiffness. While the former model
considers biochemical regulatory mechanisms between bone cells such as the
RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway and action of TGF-\beta, the latter model allows for
accurate upscaling of the mechanical properties of bone. Importantly, we
consider bone remodeling as being controlled proportionally to the microscopic
strain energy density, on the observation scale where the sensing of the
mechanical loading takes place, estimated by means of continuum
micromechanics-based strain concentration. This approach allows to address two
fundamental questions of bone biology: (i) How do biochemical changes influence
bone remodeling and so affect the composition and mechanical properties of
bone? and (ii) What mechanisms are responsible for mechanoregulation of bone
remodeling? Numerical studies highlight the conceptual advantage of this new
approach compared to conventional phenomenological models. It is demonstrated
that the proposed model is able to simulate changes of the bone constituent
volume fractions that are in qualitative agreement with experimental
observations for osteoporotic and disuse syndromes.

the framework of the quantum Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY)

second-order recursion. This structure suggests a scaling of the expansion
coefficients and the corresponding time scales in powers of $N^{1/2}$ with the

analytically that closing the BBGKY hierarchy by neglecting $\ell$-spin

time evolution with at most $\ell/2$ independent frequencies. Moreover, for the

can be a macroscopic process, with the size of the critical nucleus

molecule (tetramethyl silane, TMS) using few-cycle pulses of intense 800 nm
light. In conventional mass spectrometry, symmetrical molecules like TMS do not
exhibit a prominent molecular ion (TMS$^+$) as unimolecular dissociation into
[Si(CH$_3$)$_3]^+$ proceeds very fast. Under strong field and few-cycle
conditions, this dissociation channel is defeated by time-dependent
bond-hardening: a field-induced potential well is created in the TMS$^+$
potential energy curve that effectively traps a wavepacket. The time-dependence
of this bond hardening process is verified using longer-duration ($\geq$ 100
fs) pulses; the relatively ""slower"" fall-off of optical field in such pulses
allows the initially trapped wavepacket to leak out, thereby rendering TMS$^+$
unstable once again. Our results are significant as they demonstrate (i)
optical generation of polyatomic ions that are normally inaccessible and (ii)
optical control of dynamics in strong fields, with distinct advantages over
weak-field control scenarios that demand a narrow bandwidth appropriate for a

several major issues prevailing in the IT industries such as delay time,

estimate for range based positioning algorithms in wireless sensor networks. In
this study, we argue that in certain situations when the measured distances
between sensor nodes are positively biased, e.g., in non-line-of-sight
conditions, the target node is confined to a closed bounded convex set (a
feasible set) which can be derived from the measurements. Then, we formulate
two classes of geometric upper bounds with respect to the feasible set. If an
estimate is available, either feasible or infeasible, the worst-case position
error can be defined as the maximum distance between the estimate and any point
in the feasible set (the first bound). Alternatively, if an estimate given by a
positioning algorithm is always feasible, we propose to get the maximum length
of the feasible set as the worst-case position error (the second bound). These
bounds are formulated as nonconvex optimization problems. To progress, we relax
the nonconvex problems and obtain convex problems, which can be efficiently
solved. Simulation results indicate that the proposed bounds are reasonably
tight in many situations.

into families of graphs that turn out to be independent of map nonlinearity or
other particulars. Here we provide an in depth description of the HV treatment
of the Feigenbaum scenario, together with analytical derivations that relate to
the degree distributions, mean distances, clustering coefficients, etc.,

describe how the resultant families of graphs can be framed into a
renormalization group scheme in which fixed-point graphs reveal their scaling
properties. These fixed points are then re-derived from an entropy optimization
process defined for the graph sets, confirming a suggested connection between
renormalization group and entropy optimization. Finally, we provide analytical

junction. The electromechanical coupling is provided by distance dependent
tunneling rates between the electrodes and the island. The system asymmetry,
resulting from the geometrical configuration, leads, for weak coupling, to an
equation of the mechanical motion that reduces to the well-known Duffing
equation. At zero bias voltage the island motion is determined by the
homogenous Duffing equation that opens up two separate regions of solutions
depending on the superconducting phases. The island either moves under
influence of an anharmonic single well potential, or is governed by a double
well potential that allows for off-center oscillations. Under applied bias
voltage the island equation of motion turns into a modified Duffing equation,
with time dependent coefficients, that demonstrate both quasi periodic and
chaotic behavior.

coupled to a scalar massless field, we examine the consequences on the exact
solution imposed by a semiclassical treatment of gravitational interaction when
the scalar field is quantized. In agreement with the work of Doplicher,
Fredenhagen and Roberts (DFR), imposing the principle of gravitational
stability against localization of events, we find that the region where an
event is localized, or where initial conditions can be assigned, has a minimal
extension, of the order of the Planck length. This conclusion, though limited
to the case of spherical symmetry, is more general than that of DFR, since it
does not require the use of the notion of energy through the Heisenberg
Principle, nor of any approximation as the linearized Einstein equations.
  We shall then describe the influence of this minimal length scale in a
cosmological model, namely a simple universe filled with radiation, which is
effectively described by a conformally coupled scalar field in a conformal KMS
state. Solving the backreaction, a power law inflation scenario appears close
to the initial singularity. Furthermore, the initial singularity becomes light
like and thus the standard horizon problem is avoided in this simple model.
This indication goes in the same direction as those drawn at a heuristic level
from a full use of the principle of gravitational stability against
localization of events, which point to a background dependence of the effective
Planck length, through which a-causal effects may be transmitted.

place. In this regime a symmetric threshold quantizer is known to reduce
channel capacity by a factor of 2/pi, i.e., to cause an asymptotic power loss
of approximately two decibels. Here it is shown that this power loss can be
avoided by using asymmetric threshold quantizers and asymmetric signaling
constellations. To avoid this power loss, flash-signaling input distributions
are essential. Consequently, one-bit output quantization of the Gaussian
channel reduces spectral efficiency. Threshold quantizers are not only
asymptotically optimal: at every fixed SNR a threshold quantizer maximizes
capacity among all one-bit output quantizers. The picture changes on the
Rayleigh-fading channel. In the noncoherent case a one-bit output quantizer
causes an unavoidable low-SNR asymptotic power loss. In the coherent case,
however, this power loss is avoidable provided that we allow the quantizer to
depend on the fading level.

show that it is approximately equal to the fundamental length of the theory

theory with respect to general relativity and $G$ is the gravitational

held together by gravity. We also estimate the critical mass above which
pressureless compact objects are unstable to colapse into a black hole, showing
that it is approximately equal to the fundamental mass $M_* = \kappa^{1/2} c^2

center-of-mass energy of s_NN = 2.76 TeV are studied within a multiphase
transport (AMPT) model whose initial conditions are obtained from the recently
updated HIJING 2.0 model. The centrality dependence of charged hadron
multiplicity dN_ch/deta at midrapidity was found quite sensitive to the largely
uncertain gluon shadowing parameter s_g that determines the nuclear
modification of the gluon distribution. We find final-state parton scatterings
reduce considerably hadron yield at midrapidity and enforces a smaller gluon
shadowing to be consistent with dN_ch/deta data at LHC. With such a constrained
parton shadowing, charged hadron and neutral pion production over a wide
transverse momenta range are investigated in AMPT. Relative to nucleon-nucleon
collisions, the particle yield in central heavy ion collisions is suppressed
due to parton energy loss. While the calculated magnitude and pattern of
suppression is found consistent with that measured in Au+Au collisions at s_NN
= 0.2 TeV at RHIC, at the LHC energy the suppression is overpredicted which may
imply the medium formed at LHC is less opaque than expected from simple RHIC
extrapolations. Reduction of the QCD coupling constant alpha_s by ~30% in the
higher temperature plasma formed at LHC as compared to that at RHIC was found
to reproduce the measured suppression at LHC.

layers under tensile deformation in the direction perpendicular to the layers.
The instability mechanism, which operates in elastic materials from geological
to nanometer scales, involves the elastic contrast between different layers. In
a regular stacking of ""hard"" and ""soft"" layers, the tensile stress is first
accommodated by a large deformation of the soft layers. The inhibited Poisson
contraction results in a compressive stress in the direction transverse to the
tensile deformation axis. The hard layers sustain this transverse compression
until buckling takes place and results in an undulated structure. Using
molecular simulations, we demonstrate this scenario for a material made of
triblock copolymers. The buckling deformation is observed to take place at the
nanoscale, at a wavelength that depends on strain rate. In contrast to what is
commonly assumed, the wavelength of the undulation is not determined by defects
in the microstructure. Rather, it results from kinetic effects, with a
competition between the rate of strain and the growth rate of the instability.

environment beyond the degree necessary to solve the current task it has at

consider a multi-stage stochastic game between a learning agent and an

allocate effort towards learning about aspects of the world which are not

emission are very useful diagnostics of the dynamics and stability of their
interstellar medium. Previous studies have shown that the power spectra can be
approximated as two power-laws, a shallow one at large scales (larger than 500
pc) and a steeper one at small scales, with the break between the two
corresponding to the line-of-sight thickness of the galaxy disk. We present a
thorough analysis of the power spectra of the dust and gas emission at several
wavelengths in the nearby galaxy M33. In particular, we use the recently
obtained images at five wavelengths by PACS and SPIRE onboard Herschel. The
large dynamical range (2-3 dex in scale) of most images allow us to determine
clearly the change in slopes from -1.5 to -4, with some variations with
wavelength. The break scale is increasing with wavelength, from 100 pc at 24
and 100micron to 350 pc at 500micron, suggesting that the cool dust lies in a
thicker disk than the warm dust, may be due to star formation more confined to
the plane. The slope at small scale tends to be steeper at longer wavelength,
meaning that the warmer dust is more concentrated in clumps. Numerical
simulations of an isolated late-type galaxy, rich in gas and with no bulge,
like M33, are carried out, in order to better interpret these observed results.
Varying the star formation and feedback parameters, it is possible to obtain a
range of power-spectra, with two power-law slopes and breaks, which nicely
bracket the data. The small-scale power-law is indeed reflecting the 3D
behaviour of the gas layer, steepening strongly while the feedback smoothes the
structures, by increasing the gas turbulence. M33 appears to correspond to a
fiducial model with an SFR of $\sim$ 0.7 Mo/yr, with 10% supernovae energy
coupled to the gas kinematics.

(\alpha^2/\rho) increases for all temperatures examined. This behavior suggests
a strong asymmetry in the conduction of electrons and holes. The highest figure
of merit (zT) is observed in YbMg2Bi2, with zT approaching 0.4 at 600K for two
samples with carrier densities of approximately 2x10^{18}cm^{-3} and
8x10^{18}cm^{-3} at room temperature. Refinements of neutron powder diffraction
data yield similar behavior for the structures of CaMg2Bi2 and YbMg2Bi2, with
smooth lattice expansion and relative expansion in $c$ being ~35% larger than
relative expansion in $a$ at 973K. First principles calculations reveal an
increasing band gap as Bi is replaced by Sb then As, and subsequent Boltzmann
transport calculations predict an increase in \alpha for a given $n$ associated
with an increased effective mass as the gap opens. The magnitude and
temperature dependence of \alpha suggests higher zT is likely to be achieved at
larger carrier concentrations, roughly an order of magnitude higher than those
in the current polycrystalline samples, which is also expected from the
detailed calculations.

decays of hadrons receive contributions from new heavy gauge bosons and
scalars. Prominent examples are the right-handed W' bosons in left-right
symmetric models and charged Higgs (H^\pm) particles in models with extended
scalar sector like two Higgs doublet models and supersymmetric models. Even in
the case of decays with four different quark flavours involved, to which
penguin operators cannot contribute, twenty linearly independent operators,
instead of two in the SM, have to be considered. Anticipating the important
role of such decays at the LHCb, KEKB and Super-B in Rome and having in mind
future improved lattice computations, we complete the existing NLO QCD formulae
for these processes by calculating O(alpha_s) corrections to matching
conditions for the Wilson coefficients of all contributing operators in the
NDR-\bar{MS} scheme. This allows to reduce certain unphysical scale and
renormalization scheme dependences in the existing NLO calculations. Our
results can also be applied to models with tree-level heavy neutral gauge boson
and scalar exchanges in Delta F = 1 transitions and constitute an important

iterative deepening search which iteratively increases the term-depth bound. We
prove soundness and completeness of our generic evaluation method and show

  Decisions in Wireless Networks",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a large multi-hop wireless network, nodes are preferable to make
distributed and localized link-scheduling decisions with only interactions
among a small number of neighbors. However, for a slowly decaying channel and
densely populated interferers, a small size neighborhood often results in
nontrivial link outages and is thus insufficient for making optimal scheduling
decisions. A question arises how to deal with the information outside a
neighborhood in distributed link-scheduling. In this work, we develop joint
approximation of information and distributed link scheduling. We first apply
machine learning approaches to model distributed link-scheduling with complete
information. We then characterize the information outside a neighborhood in
form of residual interference as a random loss variable. The loss variable is
further characterized by either a Mean Field approximation or a normal
distribution based on the Lyapunov central limit theorem. The approximated
information outside a neighborhood is incorporated in a factor graph. This
results in joint approximation and distributed link-scheduling in an iterative
fashion. Link-scheduling decisions are first made at each individual node based
on the approximated loss variables. Loss variables are then updated and used
for next link-scheduling decisions. The algorithm repeats between these two
phases until convergence. Interactive iterations among these variables are
implemented with a message-passing algorithm over a factor graph. Simulation
results show that using learned information outside a neighborhood jointly with
distributed link-scheduling reduces the outage probability close to zero even
for a small neighborhood.

vector multiplets and whose scalar manifold is the symmetric space SO(1,1) x

explicit example of solutions falling in this ansatz. In particular we point
out the existence of a black ring that has an extra dipole charge with respect
to the solutions of the STU-model. In the near-horizon limit, this ring has an
AdS_3 x S^3 geometry with the same radius as the one of the 3-charge black hole
and thus its microstates should belong to the usual D1-D5 CFT.

can be enhanced by first identifying observations belonging to known solar
system objects. The assignation of new observations to a known object is an
attribution problem that occurs when a least squares orbit already exists for
the object but a separate fit is not possible to just the set of new
observations. In this work we explore the strongly asymmetric attribution
problem in which the existing least squares orbit is very well constrained and
the new data are sparse. We describe an attribution algorithm that introduces
new quality control metrics in the presence of strong biases in the astrometric
residuals. The main biases arise from the stellar catalogs used in the
reduction of asteroid observations and we show that a simple debiasing with
measured regional catalog biases significantly improves the results. We tested
the attribution algorithm using data from the PS1 survey that used the 2MASS
star catalog for the astrometric reduction. We found small but statistically
significant biases in the data of up to 0.1 arcsec that are relevant only when
the observations reach the level of accuracy made possible by instruments like
PS1. The false attribution rate was measured to be < 1/1,000 with a simple
additional condition that can reduce it to zero while the attribution
efficiency is consistent with 100%.

In particular, via the analysis of Dirac brackets, it is outlined how the
holonomy-flux algebra coincides with the one of Loop Quantum Gravity if paths
are parallel to fiducial vectors only. This way the quantization procedure for
the Bianchi I model is performed by applying the techniques developed in Loop
Quantum Gravity but restricting the admissible paths. Furthermore, the local
character retained by the reduced variables provides a relic diffeomorphisms
constraint, whose imposition implies homogeneity on a quantum level. The
resulting picture for the fundamental spatial manifold is that of a cubical
knot with attached SU(2) irreducible representations. The discretization of
geometric operators is outlined and a new perspective for the super-Hamiltonian

diluted primary mirror made of fixed cospherical segments, a helium balloon (or
cables suspended between two mountains), carries a gondola containing the focal
optics. Since 2003, we have been building a technical demonstrator of this
diluted telescope. First fringes were obtained in May 2004 with two
closely-spaced primary segments and a CCD on the focal gondola. We have been
testing the whole optical train with three primary mirrors. The main aim of
this article is to describe the metrology that we have conceived, and tested
under the helium balloon to align the primary mirrors separate by 5-10 m on the
ground with an accuracy of a few microns. The servo loop stabilizes the mirror
of metrology under the helium balloon with an accuracy better than 5 mm while
it moves horizontally by 30 cm in open loop by 10-20 km/h of wind. We have
obtained the white fringes of metrology; i.e., the three mirrors are aligned
(cospherized) with an accuracy of {\approx} 1 micron. We show data proving the
stability of fringes over 15 minutes, therefore providing evidence that the
mechanical parts are stabilized within a few microns. This is an important step
that demonstrates the feasibility of building a diluted telescope using cables
strained between cliffs or under a balloon. Carlina, like the MMT or LBT, could
be one of the first members of a new class of telescopes named diluted
telescopes.

early Universe can dilute the neutralino dark matter (DM) abundance, if
Universe is not radiation dominated at DM decoupling, due to its
dissipative-like coupling to DM. In this scenario two basic mechanisms compete,
the modified Hubble expansion rate tending to increase the relic density and a
dissipative force that tends to decrease it. The net effect can lead to an
overall dramatic decrease of the predicted relic abundance, sometimes by
amounts of the order of O(10^2) or so. This feature is rather generic,
independent of any particular assumption on the underlying string dynamics,
provided dilaton dominates at early eras after the end of inflation but before
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The latter ensures that BBN is not upset by the
presence of the dilaton. In this paper, within the context of such a scenario,
we study the phenomenology of the constrained minimal supersymmetric model
(CMSSM) by taking into account all recent experimental constraints, including
those from the LHC searches. We find that the allowed parameter space is
greatly enlarged and includes regions that are beyond the reach of LHC. The
allowed regions are compatible with Direct Dark Matter searches since the small
neutralino annihilation rates, that are now in accord with the cosmological
data on the relic density, imply small neutralino-nucleon cross sections below
the sensitivities of the Direct Dark Matter experiments. It is also important
that the new cosmologically accepted regions are compatible with Higgs boson
masses larger than 120 GeV, as it is indicated from the LHC experimental data.
The smaller annihilation cross sections needed to explain WMAP data require
that the detector performances of current and planned indirect DM search
experiments through gamma rays should be greatly improved in order to probe the
CMSSM regions.

of readily accessible oncoge- nomic array data.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: We here present arrayMap, a curated reference
database and bioinformatics resource targeting copy number profiling data in
human cancer. The arrayMap database provides a platform for meta-analysis and
systems level data integration of high-resolution oncogenomic CNA data. To
date, the resource incorporates more than 40,000 arrays in 224 cancer types
extracted from several resources, including the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO), EBIs ArrayExpress (AE), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), publication
supplements and direct submissions. For the majority of the included datasets,
probe level and integrated visualization facilitate gene level and genome wide
data re- view. Results from multi-case selections can be connected to
downstream data analysis and visualization tools.
  Conclusions/Significance: To our knowledge, currently no data source provides
an extensive collection of high resolution oncogenomic CNA data which readily
could be used for genomic feature mining, across a representative range of
cancer entities. arrayMap represents our effort for providing a long term
platform for oncogenomic CNA data independent of specific platform
considerations or specific project dependence. The online database can be

E 76, 011602 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevE.76.011602",,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simple observations of evaporating solutions reveal a complex hierarchy of
spatio-temporal instabilities. We analyze one such instability suggested by the
qualitative observations of Du and Stone and find that it is driven by a novel
variant of the classical {\em morphological instability} in alloy
solidification. In the latter case a moving solid-liquid interface is
accompanied by a solutally enriched boundary layer that is thermodynamically
metastable due to {\em constitutional supercooling}. Here, we consider the
evaporation of an impure film adjacent to a solid composed of the nonvolatile
species. In this case, constitutional supercooling within the film is created
by evaporation at the solution-vapor interface and this drives the corrugation
of the solid--solution interface across the thickness of the film. The
principal points of this simple theoretical study are to suggest an instability
mechanism that is likely operative across a broad range of technological and
natural systems and to focus future quantitative experimental searches.

purpose of this activity is to give a mathematical proof of large
falsifications and to estimate possible 'real results of elections'. My purpose
is to show that
  1. Statistical argumentation allows to prove existence of falsifications and
to give a lower estimate of falsification, near 1-2 percents.
  2. Statistical proofs of stronger statements are incorrect from both points
of view of mathematics and of natural sciences.
  3. This problem is not a problem of pure mathematics (since it includes
strong indeterminacy of sociological nature).
