In the presence of
non-trivial couplings between the inflaton and the vector fields, it turns out
that no-hair conjecture does not hold and vector-hair appears. In the case of
uniform couplings, nevertheless, we find that the universe approaches an
isotropic final state after transient anisotropic inflationary phases. For
general couplings, we numerically show attractors are anisotropic inflation.
Even in these cases, it turns out that the inflation always tends to minimize
the anisotropy in the expansion of the universe.

Schrodinger's equation for certain nonlinear quantum oscillations problems. At
lowest order, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the conventional semi-classical
formalism is replaced by an inverted-potential-vanishing-energy variant
thereof. Under smoothness, convexity and coercivity hypotheses on its potential
energy function, we prove, using the calculus of variations together with the
Banach space implicit function theorem, the existence of a global, smooth
`fundamental solution'. Higher order quantum corrections, for ground and
excited states, are computed through the integration of associated systems of
linear transport equations, and formal expansions for the corresponding energy
eigenvalues obtained by imposing smoothness on the quantum corrections to the
eigenfunctions. For linear oscillators our expansions naturally truncate,
reproducing the well-known solutions for the energy eigenfunctions and
eigenvalues. As an application, we calculate a number of terms in the
corresponding expansions for the one-dimensional anharmonic oscillators of
quartic, sectic, octic, and dectic types and find that our eigenvalue
expansions agree with those of Rayleigh/Schrodinger theory, whereas our wave
functions more accurately capture the more-rapid-than-gaussian decay. For the
quartic oscillator our results strongly suggest that the ground state energy
eigenvalue expansion and its associated wave function expansion are Borel
summable to yield natural candidates for the actual exact ground state solution
and its energy. Our techniques for proving the existence of the crucial
`fundamental solution' to the relevant Hamilton Jacobi equation admit infinite
dimensional generalizations. In a parallel project we shall show how this
construction can be carried out for the Yang-Mills equations in Minkowski
spacetime.

used only a small number of injections of short numerical-relativity waveforms,

numerical relativity hybrid waveforms, large numbers of injections, and the use
of real detector data. We report on the submission requirements for the NINJA-2

relativity groups have contributed 63 hybrid waveforms consisting of a
numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to
a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. We summarize the

particular adsorbates considered. When a weakly-polar single covalent bond is
established with the layer, a local spin-moment of 1.0 $\mu_B$ always appears
in graphene. This effect is similar to that of H adsorption, which saturates
one $p_z$ orbital in the carbon layer. The magnetic couplings between the
adsorbates show a strong dependence on the graphene sublattice of
chemisorption. Molecules adsorbed at the same sublattice couple
ferromagnetically, with an exchange interaction that decays very slowly with
distance, while no magnetism is found for adsorbates at opposite sublattices.
Similar magnetic properties are obtained if several $p_z$ orbitals are

four stress-tensor multiplets in N=4 SYM at weak coupling. It does not rely on
Feynman diagrams and makes use of the recently discovered symmetry of the
integrand under permutations of external and integration points. This symmetry
holds for any gauge group, so it can be used to predict the integrand both in
the planar and non-planar sectors. We demonstrate the great efficiency of
graph-theoretical tools in the systematic study of the possible permutation
symmetric integrands. We formulate a general ansatz for the correlation
function as a linear combination of all relevant graph topologies, with
arbitrary coefficients. Powerful restrictions on the coefficients come from the
analysis of the logarithmic divergences of the correlation function in two
singular regimes: Euclidean short-distance and Minkowski light-cone limits. We
demonstrate that the planar integrand is completely fixed by the procedure up
to six loops and probably beyond. In the non-planar sector, we show the absence
of non-planar corrections at three loops and we reduce the freedom at four
loops to just four constants. Finally, the correlation function/amplitude
duality allows us to show the complete agreement of our results with the
four-particle planar amplitude in N=4 SYM.

spin-orbit interaction described by a vector $\blam = (\lambda_x, \lambda_y,

increasing $\lambda = |\blam|$, fermions at a finite density $\rho\approx\kf^3$
evolve to a BEC like state even in the presence of a weak attractive
interaction (described by a scattering length $\as$). The BEC obtained at large
spin-orbit coupling ($\lambda \gg k_F$) is a condensate of rashbons -- novel
bosonic bound pairs of fermions whose properties are determined solely by the
gauge field. Here we study the collective excitations of such superfluids by
constructing a Gaussian theory using functional integral methods. We derive
explicit expressions for superfluid phase stiffness, sound speed and mass of
the Anderson-Higgs boson that are valid for any $\blam$ and scattering length.
We find that at finite $\lambda$, the phase stiffness is always lower than that
set by the density of particles, consistent with earlier work[arXiv:1110.3565]
which attributed this to the lack of Galilean invariance of the system at
finite $\lambda$. We show that there is an emergent Galilean invariance at
large $\lambda$, and the phase stiffness is determined by the rashbon density
and mass, consistent with Leggett's theorem. We further demonstrate that the
rashbon BEC state is a superfluid of anisotropic rashbons interacting via a
contact interaction characterized by a rashbon-rashbon scattering length $a_R$.
We show that $a_R$ goes as $\lambda^{-1}$ and is essentially {\em independent}
of the scattering length between the fermions as long as it is nonzero.
Analytical results are presented for a rashbon BEC obtained in a spherical
gauge field with $\lambda_x = \lambda_y = \lambda_z =

and hierarchical clustering. However, how to satisfy many constraints in these
algorithmic settings has been shown to be intractable. One alternative to
encode many constraints is to use spectral clustering, which remains a
developing area. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework for constrained
spectral clustering. In contrast to some previous efforts that implicitly
encode Must-Link and Cannot-Link constraints by modifying the graph Laplacian
or constraining the underlying eigenspace, we present a more natural and
principled formulation, which explicitly encodes the constraints as part of a
constrained optimization problem. Our method offers several practical
advantages: it can encode the degree of belief in Must-Link and Cannot-Link
constraints; it guarantees to lower-bound how well the given constraints are
satisfied using a user-specified threshold; it can be solved deterministically
in polynomial time through generalized eigendecomposition. Furthermore, by
inheriting the objective function from spectral clustering and encoding the
constraints explicitly, much of the existing analysis of unconstrained spectral
clustering techniques remains valid for our formulation. We validate the
effectiveness of our approach by empirical results on both artificial and real
datasets. We also demonstrate an innovative use of encoding large number of
constraints: transfer learning via constraints.

fields in the off-equatorial E-region (90-120 km) of the Earth's ionosphere and
their subsequent penetration into the deeper ionospheric layers is studied
theoretically and numerically. These ELF currents and fields are generated by
the interaction of an electromagnetic pulse with the E-region at its lower
boundary located at 90 km above the Earth's surface. The wave penetration (with
a typical wavelength of the order of 10 km) of the generated ELF currents and
fields into the deeper ionospheric layers up to 120 km takes place due to the
dominance of the Hall conductivity over the Pederson conductivity in the region
between 90-120 km and penetration becomes diffusive above 120 km. During night
time, the increase in the wave speed due to the reduced conductivities leads to
the deeper penetration. As the angle between Earth's magnetic field and
horizontal is increased (going away from the equator), the currents and fields
penetrate deeper into the ionospheric layers with increased wavelength, the
magnitudes of horizontal (east-west) and vertical currents decrease near the

moves on a circular orbit or (ii) plunges from it towards the horizon. It is
shown that such circular near-horizon orbits can exist for near-extremal black

orbit (MBO) and photon one (PhO). We consider generic ""dirty"" rotating black
holes not specifying the metric and show that the energy in the centre of mass
frame has the universal scaling dependence on the surface gravity $\kappa $.
Namely, $E_{c.m.}\sim \kappa ^{-n}$ where for the ISCO $n=1/3$ in case (i) or
$n=1/2$ in case (ii). For the MBO and PhCO $n=1/2$ in both scenarios that
agrees with recent calculations of Harada and Kimura for the Kerr metric. We
also generalize the Grib and Pavlov's observations made for the Kerr metric.
The magnitude of the BSW effect on the location of collision has a somewhat
paradoxical character: it is decreasing when approaching the horizon.

  Systems","To appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT cs.SY math.IT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stabilization of non-stationary linear systems over noisy communication
channels is considered. Stochastically stable sources, and unstable but
noise-free or bounded-noise systems have been extensively studied in
information theory and control theory literature since 1970s, with a renewed
interest in the past decade. There have also been studies on non-causal and
causal coding of unstable/non-stationary linear Gaussian sources. In this
paper, tight necessary and sufficient conditions for stochastic stabilizability
of unstable (non-stationary) possibly multi-dimensional linear systems driven
by Gaussian noise over discrete channels (possibly with memory and feedback)
are presented. Stochastic stability notions include recurrence, asymptotic mean
stationarity and sample path ergodicity, and the existence of finite second
moments. Our constructive proof uses random-time state-dependent stochastic
drift criteria for stabilization of Markov chains. For asymptotic mean
stationarity (and thus sample path ergodicity), it is sufficient that the
capacity of a channel is (strictly) greater than the sum of the logarithms of
the unstable pole magnitudes for memoryless channels and a class of channels
with memory. This condition is also necessary under a mild technical condition.
Sufficient conditions for the existence of finite average second moments for
such systems driven by unbounded noise are provided.

  The key ingredient of these formulae is the correlation coefficient between
two trait values randomly chosen from (X_1,...,X_n). This interspecies
correlation coefficient takes into account not only variation due to the random
sampling of two species out of n and the stochastic nature of Brownian motion
but also the uncertainty in the phylogenetic tree. The latter is modeled by a
(supercritical or critical) conditioned branching process. In the critical case
we modify the Aldous-Popovic model by assuming a proper prior for the time of

families of local rings.
  The algorithms use the \emph{black-box} model which is suitable for sparse
and structured matrices. The algorithms depend on a number of tools, such as
matrix rank computation over finite fields, for which the best-known time- and
memory-efficient algorithms are probabilistic.
  For an $\nxn$ matrix $A$ over the ring $\Fzfe$, where $f^e$ is a power of an
irreducible polynomial $f \in \Fz$ of degree $d$, our algorithm requires
$\bigO(\eta de^2n)$ operations in $\F$, where our black-box is assumed to
require $\bigO(\eta)$ operations in $\F$ to compute a matrix-vector product by
a vector over $\Fzfe$ (and $\eta$ is assumed greater than $\Pden$). The
algorithm only requires additional storage for $\bigO(\Pden)$ elements of $\F$.
In particular, if $\eta=\softO(\Pden)$, then our algorithm requires only
$\softO(n^2d^2e^3)$ operations in $\F$, which is an improvement on known dense
methods for small $d$ and $e$.
  For the ring $\ZZ/p^e\ZZ$, where $p$ is a prime, we give an algorithm which
is time- and memory-efficient when the number of nontrivial invariant factors
is small. We describe a method for dimension reduction while preserving the
invariant factors. The time complexity is essentially linear in $\mu n r e \log
p,$ where $\mu$ is the number of operations in $\ZZ/p\ZZ$ to evaluate the
black-box (assumed greater than $n$) and $r$ is the total number of non-zero
invariant factors.
  To avoid the practical cost of conditioning, we give a Monte Carlo
certificate, which at low cost, provides either a high probability of success
or a proof of failure. The quest for a time- and memory-efficient solution
without restrictions on the number of nontrivial invariant factors remains
open. We offer a conjecture which may contribute toward that end.

magnetosphere- disc systems, as expected in neutron star X-ray binaries and
possibly also in accreting black hole systems. Our two-dimensional
magnetosphere-disc model consists of a Keplerian disc in contact with an
uniformly rotating magnetosphere with low plasma density. Two types of global
overstable modes exist in such systems, the interface modes and the disc
inertial-acoustic modes. We examine various physical effects and parameters
that influence the properties of these oscillation modes, particularly their
growth rates, including the magnetosphere field configuration, the velocity and
density contrasts across the magnetosphere-disc interface, the rotation profile
(with Newtonian or General Relativistic potential), the sound speed and
magnetic field of the disc. The interface modes are driven unstable by
Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz in- stabilities, but can be stabilized by
the toroidal field (through magnetic tension) and disc differential rotation
(through finite vorticity). General relativity increases their growth rates by
modifying the disc vorticity outside the magnetosphere boundary. The interface
modes may also be affected by wave absorption associated with corotation
resonance in the disc. In the presence of a magnetosphere, the
inertial-acoustic modes are effectively trapped at the innermost region of the
relativistic disc just outside the interface. They are driven unstable by wave
absorption at the corotation resonance, but can be stabilized by modest disc
magnetic fields. The overstable oscillation modes studied in this paper have
characteristic properties that make them possible candidates for the
quasi-periodic oscillations observed in X-ray binaries.

evidence (ln B >> 5) that the Hubble constant averaged in independent spherical
radial shells is closer to its asymptotic value when referred to the rest frame
of the Local Group, rather than the standard rest frame of the Cosmic Microwave
Background. An exception occurs for radial shells in the range 40/h-60/h Mpc.
Angular averages reveal a dipole structure in the Hubble flow, whose amplitude
changes markedly over the range 32/h-62/h Mpc. Whereas the LG frame dipole is
initially constant and then decreases significantly, the CMB frame dipole
initially decreases but then increases. The map of angular Hubble flow
variation in the LG rest frame is found to coincide with that of the residual
CMB temperature dipole, with correlation coefficient -0.92. These results are
difficult to reconcile with the standard kinematic interpretation of the motion
of the Local Group in response to the clustering dipole, but are consistent
with a foreground non-kinematic anisotropy in the distance-redshift relation of
0.5% on scales up to 65/h Mpc. Effectively, the differential expansion of space
produced by nearby nonlinear structures of local voids and denser walls and
filaments cannot be reduced to a local boost. This hypothesis suggests a
reinterpretation of bulk flows, which may potentially impact on calibration of
supernovae distances, anomalies associated with large angles in the CMB
anisotropy spectrum, and the dark flow inferred from the kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. It is consistent with recent studies that find
evidence for a non-kinematic dipole in the distribution of distant radio
sources.

electrons during the reionization epoch induces a correlation between the
distribution of galaxies and the polarization pattern of the CMB, the magnitude
of which is proportional to the quadrupole moment of radiation at the time of
scattering. Since the quadrupole moment generated by gravitational waves (GWs)
gives rise to a different polarization pattern than that produced by scalar
modes, one can put interesting constraints on the strength of GWs on large
scales by cross-correlating the small scale galaxy distribution and CMB
polarization. We use this method together with Fisher analysis to predict how
well future surveys can measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We find that
with a future CMB experiment with detector noise Delta_P = 2 mu K-arcmin and a
beam width theta_FWHM = 2' and a future galaxy survey with limiting magnitude
I<25.6 one can measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio with an error sigma_r \simeq
0.09. To measure r \approx 0.01, however, one needs Delta_P \simeq 0.5 mu
K-radian and theta_FWHM \simeq 1'. We also investigate a few systematic
effects, none of which turn out to add any biases to our estimators, but they
increase the error bars by adding to the cosmic variance. The incomplete sky
coverage has the most dramatic effect on our constraints on r for large sky
cuts, with a reduction in signal-to-noise smaller than one would expect from
the naive estimate (S/N)^2 \propto f_sky. Specifically, we find a degradation
factor of f_deg=0.32 \pm 0.01 for a sky cut of |b|>10^\circ (f_sky=0.83) and
f_deg=0.056 \pm 0.004 for a sky cut of |b|>20^\circ (f_sky=0.66). Nonetheless,
given that our method has different systematics than the more conventional
method of observing the large scale B modes directly, it may be used as an
important check in the case of a detection.

chemical tagging to identify stars that are highly clustered in a
multi-dimensional chemical abundance space (C-space). In a sample of six stars,
three, possibly four stars are identified as potential cluster stars. The
initial stellar mass of the parent cluster is estimated from two independent
observations to M*,init=1.9^{+1.5}_{-0.9} (1.6^{+1.2}_{-0.8}) x 10^5 M_sol,
assuming a Salpeter (Kroupa) initial mass function (IMF). If corroborated by
follow-up spectroscopy, this star cluster is the most metal-poor system
identified to date. Chemical signatures of remnant clusters in dwarf galaxies
like Sextans provide us with a very powerful probe to the high-redshift
Universe. From available observational data, we argue that the average star
cluster mass in the majority of the newly discovered ultra-faint dwarf galaxies
was notably lower than it is in the Galaxy today and possibly lower than in the
more luminous, classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Furthermore, the mean
cumulative metallicity function of the dwarf spheroidals falls below that of
the ultra-faints, which increases with increasing metallicity as predicted from
our stochastic chemical evolution model. These two findings, together with a
possible difference in the <[Mg/Fe]> ratio suggest that the ultra-faint dwarf
galaxy population, or a significant fraction thereof, and the dwarf spheroidal
population, were formed in different environments and would thus be distinct in
origin.

the context of four-dimensional compactifications. As a first step, we show
that for generic supersymmetric compactifications, the Bianchi identity for the

deform any O6-D6 Minkowski compactification at first order in F_0. For a single

frequently in pulsar and transient astronomy. For current and future transient
pipelines, dedispersion can dominate the total execution time, meaning its
computational speed acts as a constraint on the quality and quantity of science
results. It is thus critical that the algorithm be able to take advantage of
trends in commodity computing hardware. With this goal in mind, we present
analysis of the 'direct', 'tree' and 'sub-band' dedispersion algorithms with
respect to their potential for efficient execution on modern graphics
processing units (GPUs). We find all three to be excellent candidates, and
proceed to describe implementations in C for CUDA using insight gained from the
analysis. Using recent CPU and GPU hardware, the transition to the GPU provides
a speed-up of 9x for the direct algorithm when compared to an optimised
quad-core CPU code. For realistic recent survey parameters, these speeds are
high enough that further optimisation is unnecessary to achieve real-time
processing. Where further speed-ups are desirable, we find that the tree and
sub-band algorithms are able to provide 3-7x better performance at the cost of
certain smearing, memory consumption and development time trade-offs. We finish
with a discussion of the implications of these results for future transient
surveys. Our GPU dedispersion code is publicly available as a C library at:

threshold ($\sim 0.35 \textrm{M}_{\odot}$) where they are expected to be fully
convective on the main sequence. Non-equilibrium He3 burning creates a
convective core, which is separated from a deep convective envelope by a small
radiative zone. The steady increase in central He3 causes the core to grow
until it touches the surface convection zone, which triggers fully convective
episodes in what we call the ""convective kissing instability"". These episodes
lower the central abundance and cause the star to return to a state in which is
has a separate convective core and envelope. These periodic events eventually
cease when the He3 abundance throughout the star is sufficiently high that the
star is fully convective, and remains so for the rest of its main sequence
lifetime. The episodes correspond to few percent changes in radius and
luminosity, over Myr to Gyr timescales. We discuss the physics of the
instability, as well as prospects for detecting its signatures in open clusters
and wide binaries. Secondary stars in cataclysmic variables (CVs) will pass
through this mass range, and this instability could be related to the observed
paucity of such systems for periods between two and three hours. We demonstrate
that the instability can be generated for CV secondaries with mass-loss rates
of interest for such systems, and discuss potential implications.

of ~7 * 10^11 to 10^12 solar masses), independent of redshift and indicative
that most of BH growth occurs in the cold-flow dominated regime. Black hole
growth is by and large regulated by the evolution of gas density. The typical
Eddington ratio at a given mass scales simply as cosmological density (1+z)^3
and the peak is caused by the competition between increased gas density
available in more massive hosts, and a decrease due to strong AGN feedback that
deprives the black hole of sufficient gas to fuel further rapid growth in the
high mass end. In addition to evolution in the mean Eddington ratio, we show
that the distribution of Eddington ratio among both mass-selected and
luminosity-selected samples is approximately log-normal. We combine these
findings into a single log-normal fitting formula for the distribution of
Eddington ratios as a function of (M_BH,z). This formula can be used in
analytic and semi analytic models for evolving black hole populations,
predicting black hole masses of observed quasars, and, in conjunction with the

supernovae (SNe), and find that if SNe produce 10^-3 solar masses of dust each,
then the total SN dust input and AGB input are roughly equivalent. We consider
several scenarios of SNe dust production and destruction and find that the
interstellar medium (ISM) dust can be accounted for solely by stellar sources
if all SNe produce dust in the quantities seen around the dustiest examples and
if most SNe explode in dense regions where much of the ISM dust is shielded

Without a net positive contribution from SNe to the dust budget, this suggests
that dust must grow in the ISM or be formed by another unknown mechanism.

field can dim the radiation from magnetized astrophysical objects. Here we
perform a detailed calculation aimed at quantifying the signatures of
photon-axion conversion in the spectra, light curves, and polarization of
neutron stars (NSs). We take into account the energy and angle-dependence of
the conversion probability and the surface thermal emission from NSs. The
latter is computed from magnetized atmosphere models that include the effect of
photon polarization mode conversion due to vacuum polarization. The resulting
spectral models, inclusive of the general-relativistic effects of gravitational
redshift and light deflection, allow us to make realistic predictions for the
effects of photon to axion conversion on observed NS spectra, light curves, and
polarization signals. We identify unique signatures of the conversion, such as
an increase of the effective area of a hot spot as it rotates away from the
observer line of sight. For a star emitting from the entire surface, the
conversion produces apparent radii that are either larger or smaller (depending
on axion mass and coupling strength) than the limits set by NS equations of
state. For an emission region that is observed phase-on, photon-axion
conversion results in an inversion of the plane of polarization with respect to
the no-conversion case. While the quantitative details of the features that we
identify depend on NS properties (magnetic field strength, temperature) and
axion parameters, the spectral and polarization signatures induced by
photon-axion conversion are distinctive enough to make NSs very interesting and
promising probes of axion physics.

strong irradiating flux which governs their radiative and dynamical properties.
We compute a suite of 3D circulation models with dual-band radiative transfer,
exploring a relevant range of irradiation temperatures, both with and without
temperature inversions. We find that, for irradiation temperatures T \lesssim
2000 K, heat redistribution is very efficient, producing comparable day- and
night-side fluxes. For Tirr \approx 2200-2400 K, the redistribution starts to
break down, resulting in a high day-night flux contrast. Our simulations
indicate that the efficiency of redistribution is primarily governed by the
ratio of advective to radiative timescales. Models with temperature inversions
display a higher day-night contrast due to the deposition of starlight at
higher altitudes, but we find this opacity-driven effect to be secondary
compared to the effects of irradiation. The hotspot offset from the substellar
point is large when insolation is weak and redistribution is efficient, and
decreases as redistribution breaks down. The atmospheric flow can be
potentially subjected to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (as indicated by the
Richardson number) only in the uppermost layers, with a depth that penetrates
down to pressures of a few millibars at most. Shocks penetrate deeper, down to
several bars in the hottest model. Ohmic dissipation generally occurs down to
deeper levels than shock dissipation (to tens of bars), but the penetration
depth varies with the atmospheric opacity. The total dissipated Ohmic power
increases steeply with the strength of the irradiating flux and the dissipation
depth recedes into the atmosphere, favoring radius inflation in the most
irradiated objects.

that the explosion occurred at z~0.376. We fitted black body functions to

parametrized code SYNOW to model the spectrum. We constructed a bolometric
light curve and compared it with explosion models. The very early light curves
show a dip in the g- and r-bands and a possible initial cooling phase in the
u-band before rising to maximum light. The bolometric light curve shows a
precursor plateau with a duration of 6-10 days in the rest-frame. A lower limit
of M_u < -21.5 can be placed on the absolute peak luminosity of the SN, while
the rise time is constrained to be at least 29 days. During our observations,
the emitting sphere doubled its radius to 2x10^15 cm, while the temperature
remained hot at 15000 K. As for other similar SNe, the spectrum is best modeled
with elements including O II and Mg II, while we tentatively suggest that Fe
III might be present. We suggest that the precursor plateau might be related to
a recombination wave in a circumstellar medium (CSM) and discuss whether this
is a common property of all similar explosions. The subsequent rise can be
equally well described by input from a magnetar or by ejecta-CSM interaction,
but the models are not well constrained owing to the lack of post-maximum
observations, and CSM interaction has difficulties accounting for the precursor
plateau self-consistently. Radioactive decay is less likely to be the mechanism
that powers the luminosity. The host galaxy, detected in deep imaging with the
10 m GTC, is a moderately young and star-forming, but not a starburst, galaxy.

exact solution of the corresponding eigenvalue problem in closed form is not
feasible since the computation of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian boils down
to the analysis of a one-dimensional operator of Heun type, whose spectrum

we manage to get both lower and upper bounds on the eigenvalues of the scalar

A model based solely on orientation cannot explain all the observed
phenomenology. In the following, we will present evidence that accretion rate
is also a key parameter for the presence of Hidden Broad Line Regions in
Seyfert 2 galaxies. Our sample consists of 21 sources with polarized Hidden
Broad Lines and 18 sources without Hidden Broad Lines. We use stellar velocity
dispersions from several studies on the CaII and Mg b triplets in Seyfert 2
galaxies, to estimate the mass of the central black holes via the
Mbh-{\sigma}\ast relation. The ratio between the bolometric luminosity, derived
from the intrinsic (i.e. unabsorbed) X-ray luminosity, and the Eddington
luminosity is a measure of the rate at which matter accretes onto the central
supermassive black hole. A separation between Compton-thin HBLR and non-HBLR
sources is clear, both in accretion rate (log Lbol/LEdd = -1.9) and in
luminosity (log Lbol = 43.90). When, properly luminosity-corrected,
Compton-thick sources are included, the separation between HBLR and non-HBLR is
less sharp but no HBLR source falls below the Eddington ratio threshold. We
speculate that non-HBLR Compton-thick sources with accretion rate higher than
the threshold, do possess a BLR, but something, probably related to their heavy
absorption, is preventing us from observing it even in polarized light. Our
results for Compton-thin sources support theoretical expectations. In a model
presented by Nicastro (2000), the presence of broad emission lines is
intrinsically connected with disk instabilities occuring in proximity of a
transition radius, which is a function of the accretion rate, becoming smaller
than the innermost stable orbit for very low accretion rates and therefore
luminosities.

constraints such a model places on the structure of the progenitor and the
distribution and velocity of ejecta. My main conclusion is that the rise of SN
2011fe requires a mass fraction 0.03 of 56Ni (or some other heating source like
48Cr) distributed between a depth of ~0.004-0.1Msun below the WD's surface.
Radioactive elements this shallow are not found in simulations of a single C/O
detonation. Scenarios that may produce this material include helium-shell
burning during a double-detonation ignition, a gravitationally confined
detonation, and a subset of deflagration to detonation transition models. In
general, the power-law rise can differ from quadratic depending on the details
of the event, so comparisons of this work with observed bolometric rises of SNe
Ia would place strong constraints on the distribution of shallow radioactive
material, providing important clues for identifying the elusive progenitors of

combination of transit timingn variations (TTVs) and dynamical stability.
Correlated TTVs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the same
physical system. Orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of the
transiting companions that are in the planetary regime. This paper describes a
non-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of TTVs
based on the correlation of two TTV data sets. We apply this method to an
analysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transiting
planet candidates identified by Kepler. We confirm four transiting planets in
two multiple planet systems based on their TTVs and the constraints imposed by
dynamical stability. An additional three candidates in these same systems are
not confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets once
further observations and analyses are possible. If all were confirmed, these
systems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. Our results
demonstrate that TTVs provide a powerful tool for confirming transiting
planets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for which
Doppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. Continued Kepler
observations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses and
orbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.
If Kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysis
could likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transiting
planets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

classical and classical-quantum channels are studied. The contribution of the
paper goes in two main directions: i) extending classical bounds of Shannon,
Gallager and Berlekamp to classical-quantum channels, and ii) proposing a new
framework for lower bounding the probability of error of channels with a
zero-error capacity in the low rate region. The relation between these two
problems is revealed by showing that Lov\'asz' bound on zero-error capacity
emerges as a natural consequence of the sphere packing bound once we move to
the more general context of classical-quantum channels. A variation of
Lov\'asz' bound is then derived to lower bound the probability of error in the
low rate region by means of auxiliary channels. As a result of this study,
connections between the Lov\'asz theta function, the expurgated bound of
Gallager, the cutoff rate of a classical channel and the sphere packing bound
for classical-quantum channels are established.

requiring the system remain stable for astronomical timescales. Finally, we
report dynamical fits to the transit times, yielding possible values for the

dynamical fits may allow detailed constraints on the systems' architectures,

decades, leading to multiple extensions of the classical LP paradigm. However,
few of these are designed as extensions of the well-established and powerful
CLP scheme for Constraint Logic Programming. In a previous work we have
proposed the SQCLP ({\em proximity-based qualified constraint logic
programming}) scheme as a quite expressive extension of CLP with support for
qualification values and proximity relations as generalizations of uncertainty
values and similarity relations, respectively. In this paper we provide a
transformation technique for transforming SQCLP programs and goals into
semantically equivalent CLP programs and goals, and a practical Prolog-based
implementation of some particularly useful instances of the SQCLP scheme. We
also illustrate, by showing some simple---and working---examples, how the
prototype can be effectively used as a tool for solving problems where
qualification values and proximity relations play a key role. Intended use of
SQCLP includes flexible information retrieval applications.

related to the Barbero-Immirzi (BI) parameter. This gravitational action is an
important object of investigation in a non-perturbative formalism of quantum

standard Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric. Finally, we show the theory
with BI parameter and minimally coupling Dirac field, in the zero mass limit,
is equivalent to an additional term which looks like a perfect fluid with the
equation of state \ $p = w\rho$, with $w = 1$ which is independent of the BI
parameter. The existence of mass imposes a variable $w$, which creates either
an inflationary phase with $w=-1$, or assumes an ultra hard equation of states
$w = 1$ for very early universe. Both phases relax to a pressure less fluid $w
= 0$ for late universe (corresponding to the limit $m\to\infty$).

majority of Kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeed
represent true, physically-associated transiting planets. Binary stars provide
the primary source of false positives among Kepler planet candidates, implying
that false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among Kepler
targets. In contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around a
smaller number of Kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systems
and/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star are
correlated. There are more than one hundred times as many Kepler planet
candidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a random
distribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.
Most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the Kepler target
star, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits a
fainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has been
estimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiple
star system. We use the low overall false positive rate among Kepler multis,
together with analysis of Kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validate
the closely-packed Kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that has
evolved somewhat off of the main sequence. Kepler-33 hosts five transiting
planets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

  As application we treat constraint satisfaction problems over reals. These

provide insight into the functioning of cochlear implants. Ideally, these
studies can identify limitations in sound processing strategies and lead to
improved methods for providing sound information to cochlear implant users. To
accomplish this, models must accurately describe auditory nerve spiking while
avoiding excessive complexity that would preclude large-scale simulations of
populations of auditory nerve fibers and obscure insight into the mechanisms
that influence neural encoding of sound information. In this spirit, we develop
a point process model of the auditory nerve that provides a compact and
accurate description of neural responses to electric stimulation. Inspired by
the framework of generalized linear models, the proposed model consists of a
cascade of linear and nonlinear stages. We show how each of these stages can be
associated with biophysical mechanisms and related to models of neuronal
dynamics. Moreover, we derive a semi-analytical procedure that uniquely
determines each parameter in the model on the basis of fundamental statistics
from recordings of single fiber responses to electric stimulation, including
threshold, relative spread, jitter, and chronaxie. The model also accounts for
refractory and summation effects that influence the responses of auditory nerve
fibers to high pulse rate stimulation. Throughout, we compare model predictions
to published physiological data and explain differences in auditory nerve
responses to high and low pulse rate stimulation. We close by performing an
ideal observer analysis of simulated spike trains in response to sinusoidally
amplitude modulated stimuli and find that carrier pulse rate does not affect
modulation detection thresholds.

extremely efficient vortex element computations can be made, which need
evaluation of just two scalar harmonic FMM sums for evaluating the velocity and
vorticity evolution terms. Details of the decomposition, translation and
conversion formulae, and sample numerical results are presented.

exists a value L* such that as L transitions from greater than or equal L* to
less than L* the upper branch of the bifurcation diagram splits into two parts.
In contrast, the solution set of the semilinear version of the prescribed mean
curvature equation is independent of L and exhibits only a saddle node
bifurcation. Therefore, as this analysis suggests, the splitting bifurcation is
a byproduct of the mean curvature operator coupled with the singular

model. However, we find that this initial condition is only applicable in a
flat universe with only dark energy and pressureless matter. In fact, in order
to obtain more information from current observational data, such as cosmic
microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), we need to
consider the contribution of radiation. For this situation, the initial
condition mentioned above becomes invalid. To overcome this shortage, we
investigate the evolution of dark energy in the matter-dominated and
radiation-dominated epochs, and obtain a new initial condition $\Omega_{\rm
de}(z_{\rm ini})=\frac{n^2(1+z_{\rm ini})^{-2}}{4}(1+\sqrt{F(z_{\rm ini})})^2$

$F(z)\equiv\frac{\Omega_{r0}(1+z)}{\Omega_{m0}+\Omega_{r0}(1+z)}$ with
$\Omega_{r0}$ and $\Omega_{m0}$ being the current density parameters of
radiation and pressureless matter, respectively. This revised initial condition
is applicable for the differential equation of $\Omega_{\rm de}$ obtained in
the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe with dark energy,
pressureless matter, radiation, and even spatial curvature, and can still keep
the NADE model being a single-parameter model. With the revised initial
condition and the observational data of type Ia supernova (SNIa), CMB and BAO,
we finally constrain the NADE model. The results show that the single free
parameter $n$ of the NADE model can be constrained tightly.

changes, while small trades cause small price changes. However, for extremely
large price changes, the trade size and news play a minor role, while the
liquidity (especially price gaps on the limit order book) is a more influencing
factor. Hence, there might be other influencing factors of immediate price
impacts of trades. In this paper, through mechanical analysis of price
variations before and after a trade of arbitrary size, we identify that the
trade size, the bid-ask spread, the price gaps and the outstanding volumes at
the bid and ask sides of the limit order book have impacts on the changes of
prices. We propose two regression models to investigate the influences of these
microscopic factors on the price impact of buyer-initiated partially filled
trades, seller-initiated partially filled trades, buyer-initiated filled
trades, and seller-initiated filled trades. We find that they have
quantitatively similar explanation powers and these factors can account for up
to 44% of the price impacts. Large trade sizes, wide bid-ask spreads, high
liquidity at the same side and low liquidity at the opposite side will cause a
large price impact. We also find that the liquidity at the opposite side has a
more influencing impact than the liquidity at the same side. Our results shed
new lights on the determinants of immediate price impacts.

out that this smoothing effect is purely non linear and is absolutely crucial

resolution and sensitive observations of ground-state transi- tions of three
molecular ions: the methylidyne cation CH+, its isotopologue 13CH+, and
sulfanylium SH+. Because of their unique chemical properties, a comparative
analysis of these cations provides essential clues to the link between the
chemistry and dynamics of the diffuse interstellar medium. Methods. The CH+,
13CH+, and SH+ lines are observed in absorption towards the distant high-mass
star-forming regions (SFRs) DR21(OH), G34.3+0.1, W31C, W33A, W49N, and W51, and
towards two sources close to the Galactic centre, SgrB2(N) and SgrA*+50. All
sight lines sample the diffuse interstellar matter along pathlengths of several
kiloparsecs across the Galactic Plane. In order to compare the velocity
structure of each species, the observed line profiles were deconvolved from the
hyperfine structure of the SH+ transition and the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ spectra
were independently decomposed into Gaussian velocity components. To analyse the
chemical composition of the foreground gas, all spectra were divided, in a
second step, into velocity intervals over which the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ column
densities and abundances were derived. Results. SH+ is detected along all
observed lines of sight, with a velocity structure close to that of CH+ and
13CH+. The linewidth distributions of the CH+, SH+, and 13CH+ Gaussian
components are found to be similar. These distributions have the same mean
(<\delta\u{psion}> ~ 4.2 km s-1) and standard deviation
(\sigma(\delta\u{psion}) ~ 1.5 km s-1). This mean value is also close to that
of the linewidth distribution of the CH+ visible transitions detected in the
solar neighbourhood. We show that the lack of absorption components narrower
than 2 km s-1 is not an artefact caused by noise: the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ line
profiles are therefore statistically broader than those of most species
detected in absorption in diffuse interstellar gas (e. g. HCO+, CH, or CN). The
SH+/CH+ column density ratio observed in the components located away from the
Galactic centre spans two orders of magnitude and correlates with the CH+
abundance. Conversely, the ratio observed in the components close to the
Galactic centre varies over less than one order of magnitude with no apparent
correlation with the CH+ abundance. The observed dynamical and chemical
properties of SH+ and CH+ are proposed to trace the ubiquitous process of
turbulent dissipation, in shocks or shears, in the diffuse ISM and the specific
environment of the Galactic centre regions.

gradual softening on cooling leading to an increase in static permittivity. A
new polar phonon with frequency near the TO1 soft mode was detected below 150

from the Brillouin zone edge, which is activated in infrared spectra due to an
antiferrodistortive phase transition and due to simultaneous presence of polar
and/or magnetic nanoclusters. In the antiferromagnetic phase we have observed a
remarkable softening of the lowest-frequency polar phonon under an applied

actual performance of efficient negotiation methods. Specifically, we start by
proposing the theoretical notion of Abstract Negotiation Method (ANM) as a map
from the negotiation domain in itself, for any utility profile of the parties.
ANM can face both direct and iterative negotiations, since we show that ANM
class is closed under the limit operation. The generality of ANM is proven by
showing that it captures a large class of well known in literature negotiation
methods. Hence we show that if mutual information is assumed then any Pareto
efficient ANM is manipulable by one single party or by a collusion of few of
them. We concern about the efficiency of the resulting manipulation. Thus we
find necessarily and sufficient conditions those make manipulability equivalent
to actual inefficiency, meaning that the manipulation implies a change of the
efficient frontier so the Pareto efficient ANM converges to a different, hence
actually inefficient, frontier. In particular we distinguish between strong and
weak actual inefficiency. Where, the strong actual inefficiency is a drawback
which is not possible to overcome of the ANMs, like the Pareto invariant one,
so its negotiation result is invariant for any two profiles of utility sharing
the same Pareto frontier, we present. While the weak actual inefficiency is a
drawback of any mathematical theorization on rational agents which constrain in
a particular way their space of utility functions. For the weak actual
inefficiency we state a principle of Result's Inconsistency by showing that to
falsify theoretical hypotheses is rational for any agent which is informed
about the preference of the other, even if the theoretical assumptions, which
constrain the space of agents' utilities, are exact in the reality, i.e. the
preferences of each single agent are well modeled.

discuss effects of various angular momentum distributions. Using a perturbation
theory, we have found a rather general result that the high-order acoustic

enhanced. We calculate a viscous growth rates for the lowest-order modes and
show that already lowest-order inertial mode is unstable for less steep angular

caused by the occurrence either chaotic oscillations of order parameters

temperature correlates well with the dust temperature (to within 40%). The C18O
emission is optically thin, and the 13CO emission is marginally optically
thick; despite its high mass, OMC 1 shows the lowest opacities. A virial

graded self-injective algebras and that of algebras of finite global dimension.
For a positively graded self-injective algebra $A$ such that $A_0$ has finite
global dimension, we construct two types of triangle-equivalences. First we
show that there exists a triangle-equivalence between the stable category of
$\mathbb{Z}$-graded $A$-modules and the derived category of a certain algebra
$\Gamma$ of finite global dimension. Secondly we show that if $A$ has
Gorenstein parameter $\ell$, then there exists a triangle-equivalence between
the stable category of $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$-graded $A$-modules and a
derived-orbit category of $\Gamma$, which is a triangulated hull of the orbit
category of the derived category.

naturally arises from this sector is studied for the first time. Limits on the
parameter space from experimental and cosmological observations relating to the
inert neutralino dark matter are explored and the consequences for Higgs boson
phenomenology are investigated. In plausible scenarios it is found that the
couplings of the lightest inert neutralinos to the SM-like Higgs boson are
always rather large. This has major implications for Higgs boson collider
phenomenology and leads to large spin-independent LSP-nucleon cross-sections.
Because of the latter, scenarios in which $E_6$SSM inert neutralinos account
for all of the observed dark matter are now severely challenged by recent dark
matter direct detection experiment analyses. In plausible scenarios consistent
with observations from both cosmology and LEP the lightest inert neutralino is
required to have a mass around half of the Z boson mass if it contributes to
cold dark matter and this means that $\tan(\beta)$ cannot be too large.
  A new variant of the $E_6$SSM called the $E_6Z_2^S$SSM is also presented in
which the dark matter scenario is very different to the inert neutralino cold
dark matter scenario and in which the presence of supersymmetric massless
states in the early universe modifies the expansion rate of the universe prior
to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The new dark matter scenario is consistent with
current observations and the modified expansion rate provides a better
explanation of various data than the SM prediction. The prospects for a warm
dark matter scenario in the $E_6$SSM are also briefly discussed.

re-scaling. The rapid development of q-calculus has led to the discovery of new
generalizations of q-Euler polynomials involving q-integers. The present paper
deals with the modified Dirichlet's type of twisted q-Euler polynomials with
weight alpha. We apply the method of generating function and p-adic q-integral
representation on Zp, which are exploited to derive further classes of q-Euler
numbers and polynomials. To be more precise we summarize our results as
follows, we obtain some combinatorial relations between modified Dirichlet's
type of twisted q-Euler numbers and polynomials with weight alpha. Furthermore
we derive witt's type formula and Distribution formula (Multiplication theorem)
for modified Dirichlet's type of twisted q-Euler numbers and polynomials with
weight alpha. In section three, by applying Mellin transformation we define
q-analogue of modified twisted q-l-functions of Dirichlet's type and also we
deduce that it can be written as modified Dirichlet's type of twisted q-Euler
polynomials with weight alpha. Moreover we will find a link between modified
twisted Hurwitz-zeta function and q-analogue of modified twisted q-l-functions
of Dirichlet's type which yields a deeper insight into the effectiveness of
this type of generalizations. In addition we consider q-analogue of partial
zeta function and we derive behavior of the modified q-Euler L-function at s =
0. In final section, we construct p-adic twisted Euler q-L function with weight
alpha and interpolate Dirichlet's type of twisted q-Euler polynomials with
weight alpha at negative integers. Our new generating function possess a number
of interesting properties which we state in this paper.

mass estimates for each of these groups derived from a calibration between the
optical richness of bright galaxies (M_r<-20.5) within 1 Mpc, and X-ray-derived
mass for a small subset of 129 groups and clusters with X-ray measurements. We
derive the mean (stacked) surface number density profiles of galaxies as a
function of total halo mass in different mass bins. We find that derived
profiles can be well-described by a projected NFW profile with a concentration
parameter (<c>~2.6) that is approximately a factor of two lower than that of
the dark matter (as predicted by N-body cosmological simulations) and nearly
independent of halo mass. Interestingly, in spite of the difference in shape
between the galaxy and dark matter radial distributions, both exhibit a high
degree of self-similarity. A self-consistent comparison to several recent
semi-analytic models of galaxy formation indicates that: (1) beyond ~0.3 r_500
current models are able to reproduce both the shape and normalisation of the
satellite profiles; and (2) within ~0.3 r_500 the predicted profiles are
sensitive to the details of the satellite-BCG merger timescale calculation. The
former is a direct result of the models being tuned to match the global galaxy
luminosity function combined with the assumption that the satellite galaxies do
not suffer significant tidal stripping, even though their surrounding dark
matter haloes can be removed through this process. Combining our results with
measurements of the intracluster light should provide a way to inform
theoretical models on the efficacy of the tidal stripping and merging
processes.

For small spread in particle size, the system orders in a polycrystalline
structure of hexagonal domains. The domain size and the packing density both
decrease as the spread in particle size is increased up to 10.5+/-0.5%. From
this point onwards the system becomes amorphous, and the close packing density
increases again with spread in particle size. We argue that the polycrystalline
and amorphous regions are separated by a Kosterlitz-Thouless-type phase
transition. In the amorphous region we find the close packing density to vary
proportional to the logarithm of the friction factor, or cooling rate. We also
studied the fracture behaviour of surface layers of sintered particles.
Fracture strength increases with spread in particle size, but the brittleness
of the layers shows a minimum at the polycrystalline-amorphous transition. We
further show that mixing distributions of big and small particles generally
leads to weaker and more brittle layers, even though the close packing density
is higher than for either of the particle types. We point out applications to
foam stability by the Pickering mechanism.

on an extensive density-functional theory mapping of the adiabatic potential
energy surface (PES) along the six O2 molecular degrees of freedom. Neural
networks are subsequently used to interpolate this grid data to a continuous
representation. The low computational cost with which forces are available from
this PES representation allows then for a sufficiently large number of
molecular dynamics trajectories to quantitatively determine the very low
initial dissociative sticking coefficient at this surface. Already these
adiabatic calculations yield dissociation probabilities close to the scattered
experimental data. Our analysis shows that this low reactivity is governed by
large energy barriers in excess of 1.1 eV very close to the surface.
Unfortunately, these adiabatic PES characteristics render the dissociative
sticking a rather insensitive quantity with respect to a potential spin or
charge non-adiabaticity in the O2-Ag(111) interaction. We correspondingly
attribute the remaining deviations between the computed and measured
dissociation probabilities primarily to unresolved experimental issues with
respect to surface imperfections.

calculated in the ""cold plasma approximation"", which neglects the relativistic

temperatures T_eff =1-3 MK and magnetic fields B \sim 10^{10}-10^{11} G,
typical for the so-called central compact objects (CCOs) in supernova remnants,
for which the electron cyclotron energy E_{c,e} and its first harmonics are in
the observable soft X-ray range. Although the relativistic parameters, such as
kT_eff /(m_e c^2) and E_{c,e} /(m_e c^2), are very small for CCOs, the
relativistic effects substantially change the emergent spectra at the cyclotron
resonances, E \approx sE_{c,e} (s=1, 2,...). Although the cyclotron absorption
features can form in a cold plasma due to the quantum oscillations of the
free-free opacity, the shape and depth of these features change substantially
if the relativistic effects are included. In particular, the features acquire
deep Doppler cores, in which the angular distribution of the emergent intensity
is quite different from that in the cold plasma approximation. The relative
contributions of the Doppler cores to the equivalent widths of the features

poles of the bipolar coordinate system but rather refer to two distinct centers

be an odd prime and let $G$ be a $p$-group of exponent $p^e$. Assume also that
{\rm (i)} char $K = p>0$, or {\rm (ii)} char $K \ne p$ and $K$ contains a
primitive $p^e$-th root of unity. In this paper we prove that $K(G)$ is
rational over $K$ for the following two types of groups: {\rm (1)} $G$ is a
finite $p$-group with an abelian normal subgroup $H$ of index $p$, such that
$H$ is a direct product of normal subgroups of $G$ of the type $C_{p^b}\times
(C_p)^c$ for some $b,c:1\leq b,0\leq c$; {\rm (2)} $G$ is any group of order
$p^5$ from the isoclinic families with numbers $1,2,3,4,8$ and 9.

the case of Leibniz algebras. In the present paper we investigate the

understanding of stellar evolution. It provides an estimate of the point at
which an evolved isothermal core embedded in an extended envelope begins to
contract. We investigate contours of constant fractional mass in terms of
homology invariant variables U and V and find that the SC limit exists because
the isothermal core solution does not intersect all the contours for an
envelope with polytropic index 3. We find that this analysis also applies to
similar limits in the literature including the inner mass limit for polytropic
models of quasi-stars. Consequently, any core solution that does not intersect
all the fractional mass contours exhibits an associated limit and we identify
several relevant cases where this is so. We show that a composite polytrope is
at a fractional core mass limit when its core solution touches but does not
cross the contour of the corresponding fractional core mass. We apply this test
to realistic models of helium stars and find that stars typically expand when
their cores are near a mass limit. Furthermore, it appears that stars that
evolve into giants have always first exceeded an SC-like limit.

\textit{ab initio} calculations. The calculations reveal that $\alpha$-FeSe
takes transitions to NiAs-type, MnP-type, and CsCl-type FeSe. Transitions from
NiAs-type to MnP-type and CsCl-type FeSe is also predicted. MnP-type FeSe is
also found to be able to transform to CsCl-type FeSe, which is easier from
$\alpha$-FeSe than the transition to MnP-type FeSe, but comparable to the
transition from NiAs-type FeSe. The calculated electronic structures show that
all phases of FeSe are metallic, but the ionic interaction between Fe-Se bonds
becomes stronger and the covalent interaction becomes weaker when the
structural phase transition occurs from $\alpha$-FeSe to the other phases of
FeSe. The experimentally observed decrease in $T_{c}$ of superconducting
$\alpha$-FeSe at high pressure may be due to a structural/magnetic instability,
which exists at high pressure. The results suggest us to increase the $T_{c}$
of $\alpha$-FeSe if such phase transitions are frustrated by suitable methods.

electrically charged annihilation products directly generate thrust after being
deflected and collimated by a magnetic nozzle. Simulations were carried out
using the Geant4 (Geometry and tracking) software toolkit released by the CERN
accelerator laboratory for Monte Carlo simulation of the interaction of
particles with matter and fields. Geant permits a more sophisticated and
comprehensive design and optimization of antimatter engines than the software
environment for simulations reported by prior researchers. The main finding is
that effective exhaust speeds Ve ~ 0.69c (where c is the speed of light) are
feasible for charged pions in beamed core propulsion, a major improvement over
the Ve ~ 0.33c estimate based on prior simulations. The improvement resulted
from optimization of the geometry and the field configuration of the magnetic
nozzle. Moreover, this improved performance is realized using a magnetic field
on the order of 10 T at the location of its highest magnitude. Such a field
could be produced with today's technology, whereas prior nozzle designs
anticipated and required major advances in this area. The paper also briefly
reviews prospects for production of the fuel needed for a beamed core engine.
