with zero net baryon density by the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for interacting
quarks in uniform background temporal color gauge fields. In the low
temperature confining phase, unphysical thermal quark-antiquark excitations
which would appear in the mean field approximation, are eliminated by enforcing
vanishing expectation value of the ""Polyakov-loop"" of the background gauge
field, while in the high temperature confining phase this expectation value is
taken as close to unity allowing thermal excitations of free quarks and
antiquarks. Mesonic excitations in the low temperature phase appear in the
correlation energy as contributions of collective excitations. We describe them
in terms of thermal fluctuations of auxiliary fields in one-loop (Gaussian)
approximation, where pions appear as Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with
dynamical symmetry breaking of the chiral symmetry in the limit of vanishing
bare quark masses. We show that the equations of state reduces to that of free
meson gas with numerically small corrections arising from the composite nature
of mesons.

effective temperatures and radii -- and therefore the estimated masses -- of

base our relations on a large set of low-mass stars in the field with Halpha
activity measurements, and on a set of low-mass eclipsing binaries with X-ray
activity measurements from which we indirectly infer the Halpha activity. Both
samples yield consistent relations linking the amount by which an active
object's temperature is suppressed, and its radius inflated, to the strength of
its Halpha emission. These relations are found to approximately preserve
bolometric luminosity. We apply these relations to the peculiar brown-dwarf
eclipsing binary 2M0535-05, in which the active, higher-mass brown dwarf has a
cooler temperature than its inactive, lower-mass companion. The relations
correctly reproduce the observed temperatures and radii of 2M0535-05 after
accounting for the Halpha emission; 2M0535-05 would be in precise agreement
with theoretical isochrones were it inactive. The relations that we present are
applicable to brown dwarfs and low-mass stars with masses below 0.8 Msun and
for which the activity, as measured by the fractional Halpha luminosity, is in
the range -4.6 < log LHa/Lbol < -3.3. We expect these relations to be most
useful for correcting radius and mass estimates of low-mass stars and brown
dwarfs over their active lifetimes (few Gyr) and when the ages or distances
(and therefore luminosities) are unknown. We also discuss the implications of

many properties of the high redshift (z>6) stellar population as a whole. This
background, specifically, from 1 to 200 microns, will contain any information
about the era of reionization and the stars responsible for producing these
ionizing photons. In this paper, we look at the fractional anisotropy delta I/I
of this high redshift population, which is the ratio of the magnitude of the
fluctuations (delta I) and the mean intensity (I). We show that this can be
used to constrain the escape fraction of the population as a whole. The
magnitude of the fluctuations of the CIB depend on the escape fraction, while
the mean intensity does not. This results in lower values of the escape
fraction producing higher values of the fractional anisotropy. This difference
is predicted to be larger at the longer wavelengths bands (above 10 microns),
albeit it is also much harder to observe in that range. We show that the
fractional anisotropy can also be used to separate a dusty from a dust-free
population. Finally, we discuss the constraints provided by current
observations on the CIB fractional anisotropy.

depending on the type functor. Its semantics is defined in terms of a
categorically defined relation lifting operation. As the main contributions of
our paper we introduce a derivation system, and prove that it provides a sound
and complete axiomatization for the collection of coalgebraically valid
inequalities. Our soundness and completeness proof is algebraic, and we employ
Pattinson's stratification method, showing that our derivation system can be
stratified in countably many layers, corresponding to the modal depth of the
formulas involved. In the proof of our main result we identify some new
concepts and obtain some auxiliary results of independent interest. We survey
properties of the notion of relation lifting, induced by an arbitrary but fixed
set functor. We introduce a category of Boolean algebra presentations, and
establish an adjunction between it and the category of Boolean algebras. Given
the fact that our derivation system involves only formulas of depth one, it can
be encoded as a endo-functor on Boolean algebras. We show that this functor is
finitary and preserves embeddings, and we prove that the Lindenbaum-Tarski

theory with an upside-down potential whose energy appears to be unbounded
below. Worse yet, the integral representation of the partition function of the
theory does not exist. It is shown that one can avoid these difficulties if one
replaces the original theory by its PT-symmetric analog. For a zero-dimensional
O(N)-symmetric quartic vector model the partition function of the PT-symmetric
analog is calculated explicitly in the double-scaling limit.

whose Markovian noise amplitude can be modulated in time such as to provide an
additional degree of incoherent control. In particular, adding bang-bang
control of amplitude damping noise (non-unital) allows the dynamic system to
act transitively on the entire set of density operators. This means one can
transform any initial quantum state into any desired target state. Adding
switchable bit-flip noise (unital), on the other hand, suffices to explore all
states majorised by the initial state. We have extended our open-loop optimal
control algorithm (DYNAMO package) by such degrees of incoherent control so
that these unprecedented reachable sets can systematically be exploited in
experiments. As illustrated for an ion trap experimental setting, open-loop
control with noise switching can accomplish all state transfers one can get by
the more complicated measurement-based closed-loop feedback schemes.

and generally are valid only within a limited range of scales. For example,
general relativity provides an effective description of the Universe at large
length scales, and has been tested from the cosmic scale down to distances as
small as 10 meters. In contrast, quantum theory provides an effective
description of physics at small length scales. Direct tests of quantum theory
have been performed at the smallest probeable scales at the Large Hadron
Collider, ${\sim} 10^{-20}$ meters, up to that of hundreds of kilometers. Yet,
such tests fall short of the scales required to investigate potentially
significant physics that arises at the intersection of quantum and relativistic
regimes. We propose to push direct tests of quantum theory to larger and larger
length scales, approaching that of the radius of curvature of spacetime, where
we begin to probe the interaction between gravity and quantum phenomena. In
particular, we review a wide variety of potential tests of fundamental physics
that are conceivable with artificial satellites in Earth orbit and elsewhere in
the solar system, and attempt to sketch the magnitudes of potentially
observable effects. The tests have the potential to determine the applicability
of quantum theory at larger length scales, eliminate various alternative
physical theories, and place bounds on phenomenological models motivated by
ideas about spacetime microstructure from quantum gravity. From a more
pragmatic perspective, as quantum communication technologies such as quantum
key distribution advance into Space towards large distances, some of the
fundamental physical effects discussed here may need to be taken into account
to make such schemes viable.

understanding dynamical phase transitions in open systems. A candidate for such
transitions is the atom maser, which for certain parameters exhibits strong
intermittency in the atom detection counts, and has a bistable stationary
state. Although previous numerical results suggested that the ""free energy"" may
not be a smooth function, we show that the atom detection counts satisfy a
large deviations principle, and therefore we deal with a phase cross-over
rather than a genuine phase transition. We argue however that the latter occurs
in the limit of infinite pumping rate. As a corollary, we obtain the Central
Limit Theorem for the counting process.
  The proof relies on the analysis of a certain deformed generator whose
spectral bound is the limiting cumulant generating function. The latter is
shown to be smooth, so that a large deviations principle holds by the
Gartner-Ellis Theorem. One of the main ingredients is the Krein-Rutman theory
which extends the Perron-Frobenius theorem to a general class of positive
compact semigroups.

on the unit of a word even for formal uses of the Chinese language, social
media only makes word segmentation in Chinese even more difficult. In this
document we propose a pointillism approach to natural language processing.
Rather than words that have individual meanings, the basic unit of a
pointillism approach is trigrams of characters. These grams take on meaning in
aggregate when they appear together in a way that is correlated over time.
  Our results from three kinds of experiments show that when words and topics
do have a meme-like trend, they can be reconstructed from only trigrams. For
example, for 4-character idioms that appear at least 99 times in one day in our
data, the unconstrained precision (that is, precision that allows for deviation
from a lexicon when the result is just as correct as the lexicon version of the
word or phrase) is 0.93. For longer words and phrases collected from
Wiktionary, including neologisms, the unconstrained precision is 0.87. We
consider these results to be very promising, because they suggest that it is
feasible for a machine to reconstruct complex idioms, phrases, and neologisms
with good precision without any notion of words. Thus the colorful and baroque
uses of language that typify social media in challenging languages such as
Chinese may in fact be accessible to machines.

blowing up P^1*P^1 in three points is the quintic del Pezzo surface dP_5, whose
automorphism group is the permutation group S_5, which is also a symmetry of
the pair of genus six curves. The subgroup A_5, of even permutations, is an
automorphism of each curve, while the odd permutations interchange the two

what should have anticipated from the outset, that the genus six curves are the
curves of the Wiman pencil. We consider the family of lines also for the cases
that the manifolds of the Dwork pencil become singular. For the conifold the

atoms opens new possibilities for studying impurity dynamics in a controlled
setting. We discuss how the techniques of atomic physics can be used to explore
new regimes and manifestations of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC),
which could not be accessed in solid state systems. We consider a system of
impurity atoms localized by a strong optical lattice potential and immersed in
a sea of itinerant Fermi atoms. Ramsey interference experiments with impurity
atoms probe OC in the time domain, while radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy
probes OC in the frequency domain. The OC in such systems is universal for all
times and is determined by the impurity scattering length and Fermi wave vector
of itinerant fermions. We calculate the universal Ramsey response and RF
absorption spectra. In addition to the standard power-law contribution, which
corresponds to the excitation of multiple particle-hole pairs near the Fermi
surface, we identify a novel contribution to OC that comes from exciting one
extra particle from the bottom of the itinerant band. This gives rise to a
non-analytic feature in the RF absorption spectra, which evolves into a true
power-law singularity with universal exponent 1/4 at the unitarity.
Furthermore, we discuss the manifestations of OC in spin-echo experiments, as
well as in the energy counting statistic of the Fermi gas following a sudden
quench of the impurity state. Finally, systems in which the itinerant fermions
have two or more hyperfine states provide an even richer playground for
studying non-equilibrium impurity physics, allowing one to explore
non-equilibrium OC and to simulate quantum transport through nano-structures.
This provides a useful connection between cold atomic systems and mesoscopic
quantum transport.

framework for stochastic search algorithms. Given a parametrized family of
probability distributions on the search space, the IGO turns an arbitrary
optimization problem on the search space into an optimization problem on the
parameter space of the probability distribution family and defines a natural
gradient ascent on this space. From the natural gradients defined over the
entire parameter space we obtain continuous time trajectories which are the
solutions of an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Via discretization, the
IGO naturally defines an iterated gradient ascent algorithm. Depending on the
chosen distribution family, the IGO recovers several known algorithms such as
the pure rank-\mu update CMA-ES. Consequently, the continuous time
IGO-trajectory can be viewed as an idealization of the original algorithm. In
this paper we study the continuous time trajectories of the IGO given the
family of isotropic Gaussian distributions. These trajectories are a
deterministic continuous time model of the underlying evolution strategy in the
limit for population size to infinity and change rates to zero. On functions
that are the composite of a monotone and a convex-quadratic function, we prove
the global convergence of the solution of the ODE towards the global optimum.
We extend this result to composites of monotone and twice continuously
differentiable functions and prove local convergence towards local optima.

interacting particle systems on the d-dimensional integer lattice, with a
finite set of states, within the framework of the graphical construction of the
dynamics based on Poisson processes. We first develop general results for what
we call CFTP times with ambiguities. These are analogous to classical coupling
(from the past) times, except that the coupling property holds only provided
that some ambiguities concerning the stochastic evolution of the system are
resolved. If these ambiguities are rare enough on average, CFTP times with
ambiguities can be used to build actual CFTP times, whose properties can be
controlled in terms of those of the original CFTP time with ambiguities. We
then prove a general perturbation result, which can be stated informally as
follows. Start with an interacting particle system possessing a CFTP time whose
definition involves the exploration of an exponentially integrable number of
points in the graphical construction, and which satisfies the positive rates
property. Then consider a perturbation obtained by adding new transitions to
the original dynamics. Our result states that, provided that the perturbation
is small enough (in the sense of small enough rates), the perturbed interacting
particle system too possesses a CFTP time (with nice properties such as an
exponentially decaying tail). The proof consists in defining a CFTP time with
ambiguities for the perturbed dynamics, from the CFTP time for the unperturbed
dynamics. Finally, we discuss examples of particle systems to which this result
can be applied. Concrete examples include a class of neighbor-dependent
nucleotide substitution model, and variations of the classical voter model,
illustrating the ability of our approach to go beyond the case of weakly
interacting particle systems.

the fluctuations pattern. Secondly, ""true"" aging is demonstrated, i.e. the
anomalous field effect relaxation depends on the time elapsed since the

the tension with experiment. We also compute R(D) in models with electrically

and toroidal magnetic fields flowing from the hotspot into the cavity. Many
observed features are explained. Gas, CRs and field flow back along the cavity
surface in a ""boundary backflow"" consistent with detailed FRII observations.
Computed ages of backflowing CRs are consistent with observed radio-synchrotron
age variations only if shear instabilities in the boundary backflow are damped
and we assume this is done with viscosity of unknown origin. Magnetic fields
estimated from synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) X-radiation observed near the
hotspot evolve into radio lobe fields. Computed profiles of radio synchrotron
lobe emission perpendicular to the jet are dramatically limb-brightened in
excellent agreement with FRII observations although computed lobe fields exceed
those observed. Strong winds flowing from hotspots naturally create kpc-sized
spatial offsets between hotspot inverse Compton (IC-CMB) X-ray emission and
radio synchrotron emission that peaks 1-2 kpc ahead where the field increases
due to wind compression. In our computed version of Cygnus A, nonthermal X-ray
emission increases from the hotspot (some IC-CMB, mostly SSC) toward the offset
radio synchrotron peak (mostly SSC). A faint thermal jet along the symmetry
axis may be responsible for redirecting the Cygnus A non-thermal jet.

six RR Lyrae stars in the LMC and three RR Lyrae stars in the SMC. These stars
were chosen because their previously determined photometric metallicities were
among the lowest metallicities found for stars belonging to the old populations
in the Magellanic Clouds. We find the spectroscopic metallicities of these
stars to be as low as [Fe/H]_{spec} = -2.7dex, the lowest metallicity yet
measured for any star in the Magellanic Clouds. We confirm that for metal-poor
stars, the photometric metallicities from the Fourier decomposition of the
lightcurves are systematically too high compared to their spectroscopic
counterparts. However, for even more metal-poor stars below [Fe/H]_{phot} <
-2.8dex this trend is reversed and the spectroscopic metallicities are
systematically higher than the photometric estimates. We are able to determine
abundance ratios for ten chemical elements, which extend the abundance
measurements of chemical elements for RR Lyrae stars in the Clouds beyond
[Fe/H] for the first time. For the overall [alpha/Fe] ratio, we obtain an
overabundance of 0.36dex, which is in very good agreement with results from
metal-poor stars in the Milky Way halo as well as from the metal-poor tail in
dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Comparing the abundances with those of the stars in
the Milky Way halo we find that the abundance ratios of stars of both

chemical point of view early contributions from Magellanic-type galaxies to the
formation of the Galactic halo as claimed in cosmological models are plausible.

formation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,
massive galaxies (cQGs) at z = 1.5 - 3. At z > 2 most cSFGs have specific
star-formation rates (sSFR = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive SFGs at
the same epoch, and host X-ray luminous AGN 30 times (~30%) more frequently.
These properties suggest that cSFGs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergers
or disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an AGN, which,
in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). The
cSFGs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cQGs by z = 1.5.
After this epoch, cSFGs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cQGs.
Meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cQGs continue to enlarge to match local QGs
in size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd
(larger) SFGs as later arrivals to the red sequence. In summary, we propose two
evolutionary scenarios of QG formation: an early (z > 2), fast-formation path
of rapidly-quenched cSFGs that evolve into cQGs that later enlarge within the
quiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z < 2) path for SFGs to form QGs
without passing through a compact state.

in the wings of the stellar Lyman-alpha emission line. The absorption occurs at
wavelengths Doppler-shifted from line center by +/- 100 km/s - larger than the
thermal speeds with which partially neutral, 10E4 K hydrogen escapes from hot
Jupiter atmospheres. It has been proposed that the absorption arises from 10E6
K hydrogen from the host stellar wind, made momentarily neutral by charge
exchange with planetary H I. The +/-100 km/s velocities would then be
attributed to the typical velocity dispersions of protons in the stellar wind -
as inferred from spacecraft measurements of the Solar wind. To test this
proposal, we perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of colliding hot Jupiter and
stellar winds, augmented by a chemistry module to compute the amount of hot
neutral hydrogen produced by charge exchange. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
mixes the two winds; in the mixing layer, charge exchange reactions establish,
within tens of seconds. Enough hot neutral hydrogen is generated to reproduce
the transit observations, and the amount of absorption converges with both
spatial resolution and time. Our calculations support the idea that charge
transfer between colliding winds correctly explains Lyman-alpha transit
observations - modulo the effects of magnetic fields, which we do not model but
which may suppress mixing. Other neglected effects include, in order of
decreasing importance, rotational forces related to orbital motion, gravity,
and stellar radiation pressure; we discuss quantitatively the errors introduced
by our approximations. How hot stellar hydrogen cools when it collides with
cold planetary hydrogen is also considered; a more careful treatment of how the
mixing layer thermally equilibrates might explain the recent detection of
Balmer H-alpha absorption in transiting hot Jupiters.

they are embedded in massive dark matter halos. We draw these conclusions from

the profile shapes change more rapidly. Mergers with moderate mass-ratios of
1:5 give $\alpha \sim 2.3$ and a final Sersic index of $n = 9.5$ after doubling
the stellar mass. This is accompanied by a significant increase of the dark
matter fraction within the stellar half-mass radius, driven by the strong size
increase probing larger, dark matter dominated regions. Only a few intermediate
mass-ratio mergers of galaxies embedded in massive dark matter halos can result
in the observed concurrent inside-out growth and the rapid evolution in profile
shapes. Apart from negative stellar metallicity gradients such a 'minor' merger
scenario also predicts significantly lower dark matter fractions for $z \sim 2$
compact quiescent galaxies and their rare present day analogues (abbreviated).

correspondence. Previous works have found that, contrary to naive expectations,
it is possible to set up collimated beams of gluonic radiation despite the
strong coupling. We show that, on the gravity side of the correspondence, this
follows directly (for arbitrary quark motion, and independently of any
approximations) from the fact that the string dual to the quark remains
unexpectedly close to the AdS boundary whenever the quark moves
ultra-relativistically. We also work out the validity conditions for a related
approximation scheme that proposed to explain the beaming effect though the
formation of shock waves in the bulk fields emitted by the string. We find that
these conditions are fulfilled in the case of ultra-relativistic uniform
circular motion that motivated the proposal, but unfortunately do not hold for
much more general quark trajectories.

proposed, intended to resolve certain difficulties in the treatment of fluid
mixing instabilities. Most have involved changes to the algorithm which either
introduce artificial correction terms or violate arguably the greatest
advantage of SPH over other methods: manifest conservation of energy, entropy,
momentum, and angular momentum. Here, we show how a class of alternative SPH
equations of motion (EOM) can be derived self-consistently from a discrete
particle Lagrangian (guaranteeing manifest conservation) in a manner which
tremendously improves treatment of instabilities and contact discontinuities.
Saitoh & Makino recently noted that the volume element used to discretize the
EOM does not need to explicitly invoke the mass density (as in the 'standard'
approach); we show how this insight, and the resulting degree of freedom, can
be incorporated into the rigorous Lagrangian formulation that retains ideal
conservation properties and includes the 'Grad-h' terms that account for
variable smoothing lengths. We derive a general EOM for any choice of volume
element (particle 'weights') and method of determining smoothing lengths. We
then specify this to a 'pressure-entropy formulation' which resolves problems
in the traditional treatment of fluid interfaces. Implementing this in a new
version of the GADGET code, we show it leads to good performance in mixing
experiments (e.g. Kelvin-Helmholtz & blob tests). And conservation is
maintained even in strong shock/blastwave tests, where formulations without
manifest conservation produce large errors. This also improves the treatment of
sub-sonic turbulence, and lessens the need for large kernel particle numbers.
The code changes are trivial and entail no additional numerical expense. This
provides a general framework for self-consistent derivation of different
'flavors' of SPH.

capture large jumps in multivariate climate whilst remaining temporally
consistent. The pre-calibrated nature of the forward model allows us to cut
feedback between the observation and evolution equations and thus integrate out
the state variable entirely whilst making minimal simplifying assumptions. A
key part of this approach is the creation of mixtures of marginal data

of computational model prediction. Four types of methods are investigated,
namely classical and Bayesian hypothesis testing, a reliability-based method,
and an area metric-based method. Traditional Bayesian hypothesis testing is
extended based on interval hypotheses on distribution parameters and equality
hypotheses on probability distributions, in order to validate models with
deterministic/stochastic output for given inputs. Two types of validation
experiments are considered - fully characterized (all the model/experimental
inputs are measured and reported as point values) and partially characterized
(some of the model/experimental inputs are not measured or are reported as
intervals). Bayesian hypothesis testing can minimize the risk in model
selection by properly choosing the model acceptance threshold, and its results
can be used in model averaging to avoid Type I/II errors. It is shown that
Bayesian interval hypothesis testing, the reliability-based method, and the
area metric-based method can account for the existence of directional bias,
where the mean predictions of a numerical model may be consistently below or
above the corresponding experimental observations. It is also found that under
some specific conditions, the Bayes factor metric in Bayesian equality
hypothesis testing and the reliability-based metric can both be mathematically
related to the p-value metric in classical hypothesis testing. Numerical
studies are conducted to apply the above validation methods to gas damping
prediction for radio frequency (RF) microelectromechanical system (MEMS)
switches. The model of interest is a general polynomial chaos (gPC) surrogate
model constructed based on expensive runs of a physics-based simulation model,

Kennedy and O'Hagan (KOH) framework for model calibration under uncertainty,
and develop extensions to multi-physics models and various scenarios of
available data. Both aleatoric uncertainty (due to natural variability) and
epistemic uncertainty (due to lack of information, including data uncertainty
and model uncertainty) are accounted for in the calibration process.
Challenging aspects of Bayesian calibration for multi-physics models are
investigated, including: (1) calibration with different forms of experimental
data (e.g., interval data and time series data), (2) determination of the
identifiability of model parameters when the analytical expression of model is
known or unknown, (3) calibration of multiple physics models sharing common
parameters, which enables efficient use of data especially when the
experimental resources are limited. A first-order Taylor series expansion-based
method is proposed to determine which model parameters are identifiable.
Following the KOH framework, a probabilistic discrepancy function is estimated
and added to the prediction of the calibrated model, attempting to account for
model uncertainty. This discrepancy function is modeled as a Gaussian process
when sufficient data are available for multiple model input combinations, and
is modeled as a random variable when the available data are limited. The
overall approach is illustrated using two application examples related to
microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices: (1) calibration of a dielectric
charging model with time-series data, and (2) calibration of two physics models
(pull-in voltage and creep) using measurements of different physical quantities
in different devices.

contain a homogenous set of global parameters of SN hosts, including
morphological classifications and measures of nuclear activity. The
measurements of apparent magnitudes, diameters (D25), axial ratios (b/a), and
position angles (PA) of SN host galaxies were made using the images extracted
from the SDSS g-band. For each host galaxy, we analyzed RGB images of the SDSS
to accurately measure the position of its nucleus to provide the SDSS name.
With these images, we also provide the host galaxy's morphological type, and
note if it has a bar, a disturbed disk, and whether it is part of an
interacting or merging system. In addition, the SDSS nuclear spectra were
analyzed to diagnose the central power source of the galaxies. Special
attention was paid to collect accurate data on the spectroscopic classes,
coordinates, offsets of SNe, and heliocentric redshifts of the host galaxies.
The creation of this large database will help to better understand how the
different types of SNe are correlated with the properties of the nuclei and
global physical parameters of the host galaxies, and minimize possible
selection effects and errors that often arise when data are selected from
different sources and catalogs.

approximations, we explore different environments in which the SNR may evolve,

signatures of interaction between similar-mass galaxy pairs in the Sloan

projected pair separation; not only obvious indicators of merging, disturbance
and tidal tails, but also more regular features, such as spiral arms and bars.
These trends are robustly quantified, using a control sample to account for
observational biases, producing measurements of the strength and separation
scale of various morphological responses to pair interaction. For example, we
find that the presence of spiral features is enhanced at scales < 70 h^-1 kpc,
probably due to both increased star formation and the formation of tidal tails.
On the other hand, the likelihood of identifying a bar decreases significantly
in pairs with separations < 30 h^-1 kpc, suggesting that bars are suppressed by
close interactions between galaxies of similar mass. We go on to show how
morphological indicators of physical interactions provide a way of
significantly refining standard estimates for the frequency of close pair
interactions, based on velocity offset and projected separation. The presence
of loosely wound spiral arms is found to be a particularly reliable signal of
an interaction, for projected pair separations up to ~100 h^-1 kpc. We use this
indicator to demonstrate our method, constraining the fraction of low-redshift

detections is a computationally intensive problem, even when sophisticated
indexing schemes are used to exclude obviously false candidates. Legacy
astronomical catalogs already contain detections of more than a hundred million
objects while the ongoing and future surveys will produce catalogs of billions
of objects with multiple detections of each at different times. The varying
statistical error of position measurements, moving and extended objects, and
other physical properties make it necessary to perform the cross-identification
using a mathematically correct, proper Bayesian probabilistic algorithm,
capable of including various priors. One time, pair-wise cross-identification
of these large catalogs is not sufficient for many astronomical scenarios.
Consequently, a novel system is necessary that can cross-identify multiple

solution based on a cluster of commodity servers and ordinary relational

powered sources across their entire luminosity range from galactic X-ray
binaries to luminous quasars, with emphasis on AGN and their phenomenology.
Central to this model is the notion of MHD winds launched from the accretion
disks that power these objects. These winds provide the matter that manifests
as blueshifted absorption features in the UV and X-ray spectra of a large
fraction of these sources; furthermore, their density distribution in the
poloidal plane determines the ""appearance"" (i.e. the column and velocity
structure of these absorption features) as a function of the observer
inclination angle. This work focuses on just the broadest characteristics of
these objects; nonetheless, it provides scaling laws that allow one to
reproduce within this model the properties of objects spanning a very wide
luminosity range and viewed at different inclination angles, and trace them to
a common underlying dynamical structure. Its general conclusion is that the AGN
phenomenology can be accounted for in terms of three parameters: The wind mass
flux in units of the Eddington value, $\dot m$, the observer's inclination
angle $\theta$ and the logarithmic slope between the O/UV and X-ray fluxes

$\alpha_{OX}$ and UV luminosity, we conclude that the AGN structure depends on
only two parameters. Interestingly, the correlations implied by this model
appear to extend to and consistent with the characteristics of galactic X-ray
sources, suggesting the presence of a truly unified underlying structure for

confirmed the flattening of the radial velocity dispersion profiles for stars
in various nearby globular clusters. As the projected radial coordinate is
increased, a radius appears beyond which, the measured velocity dispersion
ceases to drop and settles at a fixed value, $\sigma_{\infty}$. Under Newtonian
gravity, this is explained by invoking tidal heating from the overall Milky Way
potential on the outer, more loosely bound stars, of the globular clusters in
question. From the point of view of modified gravity theories, such an outer
flattening is expected on crossing the critical acceleration threshold $a_{0}$,
beyond which, a transition to MONDian dynamics is expected, were equilibrium
velocities cease to be a function of distance. In this paper we attempt to sort
out between the above competing explanations, by looking at their plausibility
in terms of an strictly empirical approach. We determine Newtonian tidal radii
using masses accurately calculated through stellar population modelling, and
hence independent of any dynamical assumptions, distances, size and orbital
determinations for a sample of 16 globular clusters. We show that their
Newtonian tidal radii at perigalacticon are generally larger that the radii at
which the flattening in the velocity dispersion profiles occurs, by large
factors of 4, on average. While this point makes the Newtonian tidal
explanation suspect, it is found that the radii at which the flattening is
observed on average correlate with the radii where the $a_{0}$ threshold is
crossed, and that $\sigma_{\infty}$ values scale with the fourth root of the
total masses, all features predicted under modified gravity theories.

provide important clues for trying to piece together a quantum theory of

consistent theory of gravity and quantum mechanics, quantum theory will be
unmodified. Here, we examine the black hole information problem in the context
of generalisations of quantum theory. In particular, we examine black holes in
the setting of generalised probabilistic theories, in which quantum theory and
classical probability theory are special cases. We compute the time it takes
information to escape a black hole, assuming that information is preserved. We
find that under some very general assumptions, the arguments of Page (that
information should escape the black hole after half the Hawking photons have
been emitted), and the black-hole mirror result of Hayden and Preskill (that
information can escape quickly) need to be modified. The modification is
determined entirely by what we call the Wootters-Hardy parameter associated
with a theory. We find that although the information leaves the black hole
after enough photons have been emitted, it is fairly generic that it fails to
appear outside the black hole at this point -- something impossible in quantum
theory due to the no-hiding theorem. The information is neither inside the
black hole, nor outside it, but is delocalised. Our central technical result is
an information decoupling theorem which holds in the generalised probabilistic
framework.

and apparent chaos, and how this has prompted some professionals to offer their

$t\to\infty$, though --- provided that $p$ is chosen so that the frequencies
$\{n^{-p}\}_{n\in\Nset}$ are rationally linear independent; no conjecture has
been forthcoming for rationally dependent $\{n^{-p}\}_{n\in\Nset}$. Moreover,
following other experts' tip-offs, the interesting relationship of the
asymptotics of $\pzcS_p(t)$ to properties of the Riemann $\zeta$ function is
exhibited using the Mellin transform.

result comes from the Virial Theorem for a spherical isotropic cluster, and is
insensitive to the theory of gravity. A gravitational redshift signal also does
not directly distinguish between the Einsteinian and f(R) gravity theories,
because each theory requires different dark halo mass function to keep the
clusters in equilibrium. When this constraint is imposed, the gravitational
redshift has no sensitivity to theory. Indeed our N-body simulations show that
the halo mass function differs in f(R), and that the transverse Doppler effect
is stronger than analytically predicted due to non-equilibrium.

the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature power spectrum, treating the
collisions perturbatively. In a large class of models, one can approximate a
multiple collision scenario as a superposition of individual collision events
governed by nearly isotropic and scale-invariant distributions, most appearing
to take up less than half of the sky. In this case, the shape of the expected
CMB temperature spectrum maintains statistical isotropy and typically features
a dramatic increase in power in the low multipoles relative to that of the
best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model, which is in tension particularly with the observed
quadrupole. We argue that this predicted spectrum is largely model-independent

axis referred to the Earth-fixed frame. The variation of the figure axis should
be the basic object to which the geophysical events are linked. By the method
of rigid dynamics, the relation between the rotational and the figure axes is
derived. The polar motion is the motion of the rotational axis on the Earth's
surface and therefore the exact position of the figure axis on the surface at
each moment is obtained from the polar motion. Since the accuracy of the recent
data for the polar motion is very high, the obtained position of the figure
axis is considered to keep good quality. As an average for a long duration of
time, the obtained figure axis exhibits stable annual and semi-annual
variations while it has no component with the period of the Chandler wobble.
Besides this general feature, it shows different patterns from year to year as
well as small irregularities with shorter periods, most of which are considered
to be significant but not attributed to the observational errors. Further, a
simple model is introduced for the cause of the seasonal variation of the
figure axis. The model explains both the variation of the figure axis obtained
above and that of the rotational speed which is so far known.

display pairing with finite center of mass momentum, with clear signatures
either in momentum space or real space, which could be observed in cold atomic

interstellar scintillation (ISS) at radio wavelengths, as well as their
scintillation amplitudes, have been found to decrease significantly for sources
at redshifts z > 2. This can be attributed to an increase in the angular sizes
of the \muas-scale cores or a decrease in the flux densities of the compact
\muas cores relative to that of the mas-scale components with increasing
redshift, possibly arising from (1) the space-time curvature of an expanding
Universe, (2) AGN evolution, (3) source selection biases, (4) scatter
broadening in the ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) and intervening galaxies,
or (5) gravitational lensing. We examine the frequency scaling of this redshift
dependence of ISS to determine its origin, using data from a dual-frequency
survey of ISS of 128 sources at 0 < z < 4. We present a novel method of
analysis which accounts for selection effects in the source sample. We
determine that the redshift dependence of ISS is partially linked to the
steepening of source spectral indices ({\alpha}^8.4_4.9) with redshift, caused
either by selection biases or AGN evolution, coupled with weaker ISS in the
{\alpha}^8.4_4.9 < -0.4 sources. Selecting only the -0.4 < {\alpha}^8.4_4.9 <
0.4 sources, we find that the redshift dependence of ISS is still significant,
but is not significantly steeper than the expected (1+z)^0.5 scaling of source
angular sizes due to cosmological expansion for a brightness temperature and
flux-limited sample of sources. We find no significant evidence for scatter
broadening in the IGM, ruling it out as the main cause of the redshift
dependence of ISS. We obtain an upper limit to IGM scatter broadening of <
110\muas at 4.9 GHz with 99% confidence for all lines of sight, and as low as <
8\muas for sight-lines to the most compact, \sim 10\muas sources.

Recent studies on
MAC scheduling have shown that carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) can be
controlled to be achieve optimality in terms of throughput or utility. These
results imply that just a simple MAC algorithm without message passing is
possible to achieve high performance guarantee. However, such studies are
conducted only on the assumption that channel conditions are static. Noting
that the main drive for achieving optimality in optimal CSMA is to let it run a
good schedule for some time, formally referred to as the mixing time, it is
under-explored how such optimal CSMA performs for time-varying channel
conditions. In this paper, under the practical constraint of restricted
back-off rates (i.e., limited sensing speed), we consider two versions of
CSMAs: (i) channel-unaware CSMA (U-CSMA) and (ii) channel-aware CSMA (A-CSMA),
each of which is characterized as its ability of tracking channel conditions.
We first show that for fast channel variations, A-CSMA achieves almost zero
throughput, implying that incomplete tracking of channel conditions may
seriously degrade performance, whereas U-CSMA, accessing the media without
explicit consideration of channel conditions, has positive worst-case guarantee
in throughput, where the ratio of guarantee depends on network topology. On the
other hand, for slow channel variations, we prove that A-CSMA is
throughput-optimal for any network topology. Our results provide the precise
trade-off between sensing costs and performances of CSMA algorithms, which
guides a robust design on MAC scheduling under highly time-varying scenarios.

Energy is eliminated via the generation of an apparent cosmic acceleration from
the causal flow of inhomogeneity information coming in towards each observer
from distant structure-forming regions. This second-generation formalism
incorporates ""recursive nonlinearities"": the process by which
already-established metric perturbations will then act to slow down all future
flows of inhomogeneity information. Here, the long-range effects of causal
backreaction are now damped, weakening its impact for models that were
previously best-fit cosmologies. Nevertheless, we find that causal backreaction
can be recovered as a replacement for Dark Energy via the adoption of larger
values for the dimensionless `strength' of the clustering evolution functions
being modeled -- a change justified by the hierarchical nature of clustering
and virialization in the universe, occurring on multiple cosmic length scales
simultaneously. With this, and with one new model parameter representing the
slowdown of clustering due to astrophysical feedback processes, an alternative
cosmic concordance can once again be achieved for a matter-only universe in
which the apparent acceleration is generated entirely by causal backreaction
effects. One drawback is a new degeneracy which broadens our predicted range
for the observed jerk parameter $j_{0}^{\mathrm{Obs}}$, thus removing what had
appeared to be a clear signature for distinguishing causal backreaction from
Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$CDM. As for the long-term fate of the universe,
incorporating recursive nonlinearities appears to make the possibility of an
`eternal' acceleration due to causal backreaction far less likely; though this
does not take into account gravitational nonlinearities or the large-scale
breakdown of cosmological isotropy, effects not easily modeled within this
formalism.

require that at least one jet be identified to originate from a bottom quark.
Discrimination between the signal and the large background is achieved through
the use of a Bayesian artificial neural network. The number of tagged events
and their distributions are consistent with the standard model expectations. We
observe no evidence for a Higgs boson signal and set 95% C.L. upper limits on
the $WH$ production cross section times the branching ratio to decay to $b\bar
b$ pairs, $\sigma(p\bar p \rightarrow W^{\pm} H) \times {\cal B}(H\rightarrow
b\bar b)$, relative to the rate predicted by the standard model. For the Higgs
boson mass range of 100 GeV/c$^2$ to 150 GeV/c$^2$ we set observed (expected)
upper limits from 1.34 (1.83) to 38.8 (23.4). For 115 GeV/c$^2$ the upper limit
is 3.64 (2.78). The combination of the present search with an independent
analysis that selects events with three jets yields more stringent limits
ranging from 1.12 (1.79) to 34.4 (21.6) in the same mass range. For 115
GeV/c$^2$ the upper limit is 2.65 (2.60).

criticalities including logarithmic behavior. On the other hand, the critical

limit we find that the presence of the passive layer can largely influence the
conductivity of the active layer despite the absence of drag. This induces a
non-trivial temperature behavior of the single layer conductivity and
furthermore suggests a promising strategy towards increasing the role of
inelastic scattering in future experiments. For small but finite chemical
potential we find that the drag resistivity varies substantially as a function
of the ratio of inelastic and elastic scattering. We find that an extrapolation
from finite chemical potential to zero chemical potential and to the clean
system is delicate and the order of limits matters. In the Fermi liquid regime
we analyze drag as a function of temperature $T$ and the distance $d$ between
the layers and compare our results to existing theoretical and experimental
results. In addition to the conventional $1/d^4$-dependence with an associated
$T^2$-behavior we find there is another regime of $1/d^5$-dependence where drag
varies in linear-in-$T$ fashion. The relevant parameter separating these two

dictated by the sign of a non dimensional parameter $b$. For the general
Keller-Segel model where the stimulant is moderately supplied, the system can
undergo a dynamic transition to either steady state patterns or spatiotemporal
oscillations. From the pattern formation point of view, the formation and the
mechanism of both the lamella and rectangular patterns are derived.

Seyfert 1 galaxy; for 4 out of 7 sources, we have been able to estimate the
central black hole mass. Three of the type 2 AGN of our sample display optical
features typical of the LINER class and one is a likely Compton thick AGN. All
galaxies classified in this work are relatively nearby objects since their
redshifts lie in the range 0.008-0.075; the only galactic object found lies at
an estimated distance of 90 pc. We have also investigated the optical versus
X-ray emission ratio of the galaxies of our sample to test the AGN unified

the optical reddening (due to dust): we find that for most of our sources,

biological networks is one of the main challenges currently faced by
computational biology. Constraint-based models in particular play a key role in
the attempt to obtain a quantitative understanding of cellular metabolism at

an organism based on minimal assumptions that describe the steady states of the
underlying reaction network via suitable stoichiometric constraints,
specifically mass balance and energy balance (i.e. thermodynamic feasibility).
The implementation of these requirements to generate viable configurations of
reaction fluxes and/or to test given flux profiles for thermodynamic
feasibility can however prove to be computationally intensive. We propose here
a fast and scalable stoichiometry-based method to explore the Gibbs energy
landscape of a biochemical network at steady state. The method is applied to
the problem of reconstructing the Gibbs energy landscape underlying metabolic
activity in the human red blood cell, and to that of identifying and removing
thermodynamically infeasible reaction cycles in the Escherichia coli metabolic
network (iAF1260). In the former case, we produce consistent predictions for
chemical potentials (or log-concentrations) of intracellular metabolites; in
the latter, we identify a restricted set of loops (23 in total) in the
periplasmic and cytoplasmic core as the origin of thermodynamic infeasibility
in a large sample ($10^6$) of flux configurations generated randomly and
compatibly with the prior information available on reaction reversibility.

applications. They can be used for tasks which include state-dependent cloning

information encodings are not related by a unitary transform, such as
continuous-variable systems and finite-dimensional systems. In a probabilistic
transform, information may be lost or leaked, and we explain the concepts of
leak and redundancy. Following this, we show how the analysis of probabilistic
transforms significantly simplifies for symmetric source and target sets of
states. In particular, we give a simple linear program which solves the task of
finding optimal transforms, and a method of characterizing the introduced leak
and redundancy in information-theoretic terms. Using the developed techniques,
we analyse a class of transforms which convert coherent states with information
encoded in their relative phase to symmetric qubit states. Each of these sets
of states on their own appears in many well studied quantum information

a phase transition that separates two parametric regions, (i) a region of
unbroken PT symmetry in which the eigenvalues are all real, and (ii) a region
of broken PT symmetry in which some of the eigenvalues are complex. This
transition has recently been observed experimentally in a variety of physical
systems. Until now, theoretical studies of the PT phase transition have
generally been limited to one-dimensional models. Here, four nontrivial coupled
PT-symmetric Hamiltonians, $H=p^2/2+x^2/2+q^2/2+y^2/2+igx^2y$,

transition. The transitions are found to occur at $g\approx 0.1$, $g\approx
0.04$, $g\approx 0.1$, and $g\approx 0.05$. These results suggest that the PT
phase transition is a robust phenomenon not limited to systems having one

that the classical EM algorithm can be adapted to infer the model parameters.
For the initialisation step, starting from a large number of components, a

likelihood-based criteria to select the components to be combined are
discussed. To estimate the number of hidden states, BIC-like criteria are
derived. A simulation study is carried out both to determine the best

fullerenes within the spherically symmetric jellium model. This correction
represents a pseudopotential which originates from the comparison between an
accurate ab initio calculation and the jellium model calculation. It is shown
that such a correction to the jellium model allows one to account, at least
partly, for the sp2-hybridization of carbon atomic orbitals. Therefore, it may
be considered as a more physically meaningful correction as compared with a
structureless square-well pseudopotential which has been widely used earlier.

fast (beta>0.8), and the searches based on their delay in the time of flight or
their anomalous ionization become less effective. Such staus would be
identified as regular muons with the same linear momentum and a slightly
reduced energy. Compared to the usual SUSY models where a neutralino is the
LSP, this scenario implies (i) more leptons (the two staus at the end of the
decay chains), (ii) a strong e-mu asymmetry, and (iii) less missing E_T (just
from neutrinos, as the lightest neutralino decays into stau). We study the
bounds on this SUSY from current LHC analyses (same-sign dileptons and
multilepton events) and discuss the best strategy for its observation.

longitudinal field B_l = -97 kG, and NLTT 10480 (B_l=-212 kG). Also, we report
the possible identification of a very low-field white dwarf with B_l = -4.6 kG.
The observations show that ~5% of white dwarfs harbour low fields (~10 to ~10^2
kG) and that increased survey sensitivity may help uncover several new magnetic
white dwarfs with fields below ~1 kG. A series of observations of the high
field white dwarf NLTT 12758 revealed changes in polarity occurring within an
hour possibly associated to an inclined, fast rotating dipole. Also, the
relative strength of the pi and sigma components in NLTT 12758 possibly
revealed the effect of a field concentration (""spot""), or, most likely, the
presence of a non-magnetic white dwarf companion. Similar observations of NLTT
13015 also showed possible polarity variations, but without a clear indication
of the timescale. The survey data also proved useful in constraining the
chemical composition, age and kinematics of a sample of cool white dwarfs as
well as in constraining the incidence of double degenerates.

large-scale magnetic field would lead to X-ray emission, which should be
observable using current X-ray observatories. The aim of this work is to search
the archival data for AGB stars that are intrinsic X-ray emitters. We have
searched the ROSAT, CXO, and XMM archives for serendipitous X-ray observations
of a sample of ~500 AGB stars. We specifically searched for the AGB stars
detected with GALEX. The data is calibrated, analyzed and the X-ray
luminosities and temperatures are estimated as functions of the circumstellar
absorption. We identify 13 AGB stars as having either serendipitous or targeted
observations in the X-ray data archives, however for a majority of the sources
the detailed analysis show that the detections are questionable. Two new
sources are detected by ROSAT: T Dra and R UMa. The spectral analysis suggests
that the emission associated with these sources could be due to coronal
activity or interaction across a binary system. Further observations of the
detected sources are necessary to clearly determine the origin of the X-ray
emission. Moreover, additional objects should be subject to targeted X-ray
observations in order to achieve better constraints for the magnetic fields
around AGB stars.

parabolically trapped, collisionally inhomogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs) with spatially periodic variations of the scattering length. This
collisional inhomogeneity yields a nonlinear lattice, which we tune from a
small-amplitude, approximately sinusoidal structure to a periodic sequence of
densely spaced spikes. We start by investigating time-independent
inhomogeneities, and we subsequently examine the dynamical response when one
starts with a collisionally homogeneous BEC and then switches on an
inhomogeneity either adiabatically or nonadiabatically. Using Bogoliubov-de
Gennes linearization as well as direct numerical simulations of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we observe dark solitary waves, which can become
unstable through oscillatory or exponential instabilities. We find a critical
wavelength of the nonlinear lattice that is comparable to the healing length.
Near this value, the fundamental eigenmode responsible for the stability of the
dark solitary wave changes its direction of movement as a function of the
strength of the nonlinearity. When it increases, it collides with other
eigenmodes, leading to oscillatory instabilities; when it decreases, it
collides with the origin and becomes imaginary, illustrating that the
instability mechanism is fundamentally different in wide-well versus
narrow-well lattices. When starting from a collisionally homogeneous setup and
switching on inhomogeneities, we find that dark solitary waves are preserved
generically for aligned lattices. We briefly examine the time scales for the
onset of solitary-wave oscillations in this scenario.

  Boltzmann-equation solutions",,,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present work provides a definitive answer to the problem of quantifying
relaxation to equilibrium of the solution to the spatially homogeneous
Boltzmann equation for Maxwellian molecules. The beginning of the story dates
back to a pioneering work by Hilbert, who first formalized the concept of
linearization of the collision operator and pointed out the importance of its
eigenvalues with respect to a certain asymptotic behavior of the Boltzmann
equation. Under really mild conditions on initial data - close to being
necessary - and a weak, physically consistent, angular cutoff hypothesis, our
main result (Theorem 1.1) contains the first precise statement that the total
variation distance between the solution and the limiting Maxwellian
distribution admits an upper bound of the form C e^{Lambda_b t}, Lambda_b being
the least negative of the aforesaid eigenvalues and C a constant which depends
only on a few simple numerical characteristics (e.g. moments) of the initial
datum. The validity of this quantification was conjectured, about fifty years
ago, in a paper by Henry P. McKean but, in spite of several attempts, the best
answer known up to now consists in a bound with a rate which can be made
arbitrarily close to Lambda_b, to the cost of the ""explosion"" of the constant
C. Moreover, its deduction is subject to restrictive hypotheses on the initial
datum, besides the Grad angular cutoff condition. As to the proof of our
results, we have taken as point of reference an analogy between the problem of
convergence to equilibrium and the central limit theorem of probability theory,
highlighted by McKean. Our work represents in fact a confirmation of this
analogy, since the techniques we develop here crucially rely on certain
formulations of the central limit theorem.

with Chandra and Fermi, which, like Vela, powers a compact X-ray pulsar wind
nebula and X-ray-radio plerion associated with an extended TeV source. We
present our deep optical observations with the Very Large Telescope to search
for an optical counterpart of the pulsar and its nebula. We detected a
point-like source in V, R, and I bands whose position is in agreement with the
X-ray position of the pulsar, and whose colours are distinct from those of
ordinary stars. The tentative optical luminosity and efficiency of the source
are similar to those of the Vela pulsar, which also supports the optical
identification. However, the source spectrum is unusually steep, with a
spectral index of about 5, which is not typical of optical pulsars. The source
offset from the radio position of PSR J1357-6429, which is in line with the
corresponding offset of the X-ray position, implies the pulsar transverse
velocity of 1600-2000 km/s at the distance of 2-2.5 kpc, making it the fastest
moving pulsar known.

three-nucleon (3N) short-range correlations (SRC) and their mass dependence is
proposed. The proposed method relies on the concept of the ""universality"" or
""local nuclear character"" of the SRC. We quantify the SRC by computing the
number of independent-particle model (IPM) nucleon pairs and triples which
reveal beyond-mean-field behavior. It is argued that those can be identified by
counting the number of nucleon pairs and triples in a zero relative orbital
momentum state. A method to determine the quantum numbers of pairs and triples
in an arbitrary mean-field basis is outlined. The mass dependence of the 2N and
3N SRC is studied. The predictions are compared to measurements. This includes
the ratio of the inclusive inelastic electron scattering cross sections of
nuclei to 2H and 3He at large values of the Bjorken variable. Corrections
stemming from the center-of-mass motion of the pairs are estimated. We find
that the relative probability per nucleon for 2N and 3N SRC has a soft
dependence with mass number A and that the proton-neutron 2N SRC outnumber the
proton-proton (neutron-neutron) 2N SRC. A linear relationship between the
magnitude of the EMC effect and the predicted number of proton-neutron SRC
pairs is observed. This provides support for the role of local nuclear dynamics
on the EMC effect.

system we have chosen the three--dimensional suspension of monodisperse hard

fundamental measure theory, a second-order Taylor expansion thereof, and a
minimal phase-field crystal model. We have computed coexistence densities,
vacancy concentrations in the crystalline phase, interfacial tensions and

provide an effective means to characterize plants on the basis of leaf vein

clarified that the diffusion of a component causes a generation of another
component that is initially zero and, accordingly, that the magnetic force
lines are reconnected. For this reconnection to occur correctly, the initial
magnetic field must be directed oppositely in the two regions, e.g., $y>0$ and
$y<0$; must be concave (convex) for $y>0$ ($y<0$); and must be saturated for
$y$ far from the x axis, which would indicate the existence of the current
sheet. It will be clear that our comprehension based on diffusion runs parallel

spin and charge into two independent entities: The first, which derive from
uncharged spin-1/2 electrons, can travel at different velocities when compared
with the second, built from charged spinless electrons. Predicted theoretically
in the early sixties, the spin-charge separation has attracted renewed
attention since the first evidences of experimental observation, with usual
mentions as a possible explanation for high-temperature superconductivity. In
one-dimensional (1D) model systems, the spin-charge separation leads the
frequencies of Friedel oscillations to suffer a 2k_F -- 4k_F crossover, mainly
when dealing with strong correlations, where they are referred to as Wigner
crystal oscillations. In non-magnetized systems, the current density
functionals which are applied to the 1D Hubbard model are not seen to reproduce
this crossover, referring to a more fundamental question: Are the Wigner
crystal oscillations in 1D systems non-interacting v-representable? Or, is
there a spin-independent Kohn-Sham potential which is able to yield spin-charge
separation? Finding an appropriate answer to both questions is our main task
here. By means of exact and DMRG solutions, as well as, a new approach of
exchange-correlation potential, we show the answer to be positive.
Specifically, the v-representable 4k_F oscillations emerge from attractive
interactions mediated by positively charged spinless holes -- the holons -- as
an additional contribution to the repulsive on-site Hubbard interaction.

chains. We used turn-based stochastic parity games to define acceptance of
Markov chains by a subclass of p-automata. Definition of acceptance required a
cumbersome and complicated reduction to a series of turn-based stochastic
parity games. The reduction could not support acceptance by general p-automata,
which was left undefined as there was no notion of games that supported it.
  Here we generalize two-player games by adding a structural acceptance
condition called obligations. Obligations are orthogonal to the linear winning
conditions that define winning. Obligations are a declaration that player 0 can
achieve a certain value from a configuration. If the obligation is met, the
value of that configuration for player 0 is 1.
  One cannot define value in obligation games by the standard mechanism of
considering the measure of winning paths on a Markov chain and taking the
supremum of the infimum of all strategies. Mainly because obligations need
definition even for Markov chains and the nature of obligations has the flavor
of an infinite nesting of supremum and infimum operators. We define value via a
reduction to turn-based games similar to Martin's proof of determinacy of
Blackwell games with Borel objectives. Based on this definition, we show that
games are determined. We show that for Markov chains with Borel objectives and
obligations, and finite turn-based stochastic parity games with obligations
there exists an alternative and simpler characterization of the value function.
Based on this simpler definition we give an exponential time algorithm to
analyze finite turn-based stochastic parity games with obligations. Finally, we
show that obligation games provide the necessary framework for reasoning about
p-automata and that they generalize the previous definition.

  Auckland, New Zealand",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Symmetry of information establishes a relation between the information that x
has about y (denoted I(x : y)) and the information that y has about x (denoted
I(y : x)). In classical information theory, the two are exactly equal, but in
algorithmical information theory, there is a small excess quantity of
information that differentiates the two terms, caused by the necessity of
packaging information in a way that makes it accessible to algorithms. It was
shown in [Zim11] that in the case of strings with simple complexity (that is
the Kolmogorov complexity of their Kolmogorov complexity is small), the
relevant information can be packed in a very economical way, which leads to a
tighter relation between I(x : y) and I(y : x) than the one provided in the
classical symmetry-of-information theorem of Kolmogorov and Levin. We give here
a simpler proof of this result, using a suggestion of Alexander Shen. This
result implies a van Lambalgen- type theorem for finite strings and plain
complexity: If x is c-random and y is c-random relative to x, then xy is
O(c)-random. We show that a similar result holds for prefix-free complexity and
weak-K-randomness.

ionization with few cycle pulses, with particular emphasis on the dependence of
the electron-momentum distributions on the carrier-envelope phase. We focus on
the recollision-excitation with subsequent tunneling ionization (RESI) pathway,
in which a released electron, upon return to its parent ion, gives part of its
kinetic energy to promote a second electron to an excited state. At a
subsequent time, the second electron is freed through tunneling ionization. We
show that the RESI electron-momentum distributions vary dramatically with
regard to the carrier-envelope phase. By performing a detailed analysis of the
dynamics of the two active electrons in terms of quantum orbits, we relate the
shapes and the momentum regions populated by such distributions to the dominant
set of orbits along which rescattering of the first electron and ionization of
the second electron occurs. These orbits can be manipulated by varying the
carrier-envelope phase. This opens a wide range of possibilities for
controlling correlated attosecond electron emission by an adequate pulse
choice.

Particularly interesting is the problem of the stability of the solutions of
the Klein-Gordon equation, describing the propagation of a scalar field of mass
$\mu$ in the background of a rotating black hole. Rigorous results proof the
stability of the reduced, by separation in the azimuth angle in Boyer-Lindquist
coordinates, field for sufficiently large masses. Some, but not all, numerical
investigations find instability of the reduced field for rotational parameters
$a$ extremely close to 1. Among others, the paper derives a model problem for
the equation which supports the instability of the field down to $a/M \approx
0.97$.

the principal science goal of studying dark energy. Euclid is also expected to
undertake additional Legacy Science programmes. One proposal is the Exoplanet
Euclid Legacy Survey (ExELS) which will be the first survey able to measure the
abundance of exoplanets down to Earth mass for host separations from ~1AU out
to the free-floating (unbound) regime. The cold and free-floating exoplanet
regimes represent a crucial discovery space for testing planet formation
theories. ExELS will use the gravitational microlensing technique and will
detect 1000 microlensing events per month over 1.6 deg^2 of the Galactic bulge.
We assess how many of these events will have detectable planetary signatures
using a detailed multi-wavelength microlensing simulator (MABuLS) which
incorporates the Besancon Galactic model with 3D extinction. MABuLS is the
first theoretical simulation of microlensing to treat the effects of point
spread function (PSF) blending self-consistently with the underlying Galactic
model. We use MABuLS, together with current numerical models for the Euclid
PSFs, to explore a number of designs and de-scope options for ExELS, including
the exoplanet yield as a function of filter choice and slewing time, and the
effect of systematic photometry errors. Using conservative extrapolations of
current empirical exoplanet mass functions determined from ground-based
microlensing and radial velocity surveys, ExELS can expect to detect a few
hundred cold exoplanets around mainly G, K and M-type stellar hosts, including
~45 Earth-mass planets and ~6 Mars-mass planets for an observing programme
totalling 10 months. ExELS will be capable of measuring the cold exoplanet mass
function down to Earth mass or below, with orbital separations from ~1AU to the
free-floating regime. (Abridged)

probability functions of the original Markov process and the modified process

to major transitions of societies in modern history. The study of collective
human dynamics, including collective aggression, has been the focus of much
discussion in the context of modeling and identification of universal patterns
of behavior. In contrast, the possibility that civil unrest activities, across
countries and over long time periods, are governed by universal mechanisms has
not been explored. Here, we analyze records of civil unrest of 170 countries
during the period 1919-2008. We demonstrate that the distributions of the
number of unrest events per year are robustly reproduced by a nonlinear,
spatially extended dynamical model, which reflects the spread of civil disorder
between geographic regions connected through social and communication networks.
The results also expose the similarity between global social instability and
the dynamics of natural hazards and epidemics.
