systems on graphs with polynomially bounded growth of balls. Here the approach
of \cite{C12b} is extended to multi-particle Anderson Hamiltonians with

single-particle Hamiltonians. A simplified, fixed-energy multi-particle MSA
scheme was developed in our earlier work \cite{C08a}, based on a multi-particle
adaptation of techniques from Spencer's paper \cite{Sp88}. Combined with a
simplified variant of the Germinet--Klein argument \cite{GK01} described in

proof of multi-particle dynamical localization with the decay of eigenfunction
correlators faster than any power-law.

a class of non-stationary processes exhibiting frequency coupling, and proposes
a method of their estimation from repeated trials. Cyclostationary processes
also exhibit frequency correlation but have Loeve spectra whose support lies
only on parallel lines in the dual-frequency plane. Such extremely sparse
structure does not adequately represent many biological processes. Thus, we
propose a model that, in the time domain, modulates the covariance of
cyclostationary processes and consequently broadens their frequency support in
the dual-frequency plane. The spectra and the cross-coherence of the proposed
modulated cyclostationary process are first estimated using multitaper methods.
A shrinkage procedure is then applied to each trial-specific estimate to reduce
the estimation risk.
  Multiple trials of each series are observed. When combining information
across trials, we carefully take into account the bias that may be introduced
by phase misalignment and the fact that the Loeve spectra and cross-coherence
across replicates may only be ""similar"" - but not necessarily identical -
across replicates. The application of the inference methods developed for the
modulated cyclostationary model to EEG data also demonstrates that the proposed
model captures statistically significant cross-frequency interactions, that
ought to be further examined by neuroscientists.

scaling such as curvelets or shearlets have recently attracted significantly
increased attention due to the fact that they were shown to provide optimally
sparse approximations of functions exhibiting singularities on lower
dimensional embedded manifolds. The literature now contains various direct
proofs of this fact and of related sparse approximation results. However, it
seems quite cumbersome to prove such a canon of results for each system
separately, while many of the systems exhibit certain similarities.
  In this paper, with the introduction of the notion of {\em parabolic
molecules}, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework which includes
customarily employed representation systems based on parabolic scaling such as
curvelets and shearlets. It is shown that pairs of parabolic molecules have the
fundamental property to be almost orthogonal in a particular sense. This result
is then applied to analyze parabolic molecules with respect to their ability to
sparsely approximate data governed by anisotropic features. For this, the
concept of {\em sparsity equivalence} is introduced which is shown to allow the
identification of a large class of parabolic molecules providing the same
sparse approximation results as curvelets and shearlets. Finally, as another
application, smoothness spaces associated with parabolic molecules are
introduced providing a general theoretical approach which even leads to novel
results for, for instance, compactly supported shearlets.

paper develops a general semi-Markov theory for CTRW limit processes in

intervals. The particle jumps and waiting times can be coupled and vary with
space and time. By augmenting the state space to include the scaling limits of

Explicit analytic expressions for the transition kernels of these Markov
processes are then derived, which allow the computation of all finite
dimensional distributions for CTRW limits. Two examples illustrate the proposed
method.

restriction and show that the rate of convergence measured in relative entropy
is exponential for any mass in the subcritical range, and independent of the
mass. The proof relies on symmetrization techniques, which are adapted from a
paper of J.I. Diaz, T. Nagai, and J.-M. Rakotoson, and allow us to establish
uniform estimates for Lp norms of the solution. Exponential convergence is
obtained by the mean of a linearization in a space which is defined
consistently with relative entropy estimates and in which the linearized
evolution operator is self-adjoint. The core of proof relies on several new
spectral gap estimates which are of independent interest.

paper we study the case of isosceles (but not equilateral) ABC. We study three
possible forms of the tile: right-angled, or with one angle double another, or
with a 120 degree angle. In the case of a right-angled tile, we give a complete
characterization of the tilings, for N even, and prove that N must be even. In
the latter two cases we prove the ratios of the sides of the tile are rational,
and give a necessary condition for the existence of an N-tiling. For the case
when the tile has one angle double another, we prove N cannot be prime or even
squarefree.

challenging and can rarely be applied to complex systems common in biological

technique that greatly aids such analysis when rates of diffusion are
substantially different. This technique reduces a system of reaction diffusion
equations to a system of ordinary differential equations tracking the evolution
of a large amplitude, spatially localized perturbation of a homogeneous steady
state. Stability properties of this system, determined using standard
bifurcation techniques and software, describe both linear and non-linear
patterning regimes of the reaction diffusion system. I describe the class of
systems this method can be applied to and demonstrate its application. Analysis
of Schnakenberg and substrate inhibition models is performed to demonstrate the
methods capabilities in simplified settings and show that even these simple
models have non-linear patterning regimes not previously detected. Analysis of
a protein regulatory network related to chemotaxis shows its application in a
more complex setting where other non-linear methods become intractable.
Predictions of this method are verified against results of numerical

better and fits 99.955% of the data. However, the extreme tail of the

that the deformation potential interaction has contributions from both normal

vast region of the surface is required to bury the magnetic field into the
inner crust. When accretion stops, the field reemerges on a typical timescale
of 1-100 kyr, depending on the submergence conditions. After this stage, the
surface magnetic field is restored close to its birth values. A possible
observable consequence of the hidden magnetic field is the anisotropy of the
surface temperature distribution, in agreement with observations of several of
these sources. We conclude that the hidden magnetic field model is viable as
alternative to the anti-magnetar scenario, and it could provide the missing

black holes with two physical horizons. Under reasonable assumption, we prove
that the first law of thermodynamics of the outer horizon always indicates that
of the inner horizon. As a result, the fact that the area product being
mass-independent is equivalent to the relation $T_+S_+=T_-S_-$, with $T_\pm$
and $S_\pm$ being the Hawking temperatures and the entropies of the outer and

breaks down in general Myers-Perry black holes with spacetime dimension
$d\geq6$ and Kerr-AdS black holes with $d\geq4$.
  Moreover we discuss the implication of the first laws of the outer and inner
horizons on the thermodynamics of the right- and left-moving sectors of dual
CFT in Kerr/CFT correspondence. We show that once the relation $T_+S_+=T_-S_-$

the thermodynamics relations, we read the dimensionless temperatures of
microscopic CFT, which are in exact agreement with the ones obtained from
hidden conformal symmetry in the low frequency scattering off the black holes,
and then determine the central charges. This method works well in well-known
cases in Kerr/CFT correspondence, and reproduce successfully the holographic
pictures for 4D Kerr-Newman and 5D Kerr black holes. We go on to predict the

application is run several times with different sets of MapReduce configuration
parameters (here number of mappers and number of reducers) to profile the
network load of the application in the shuffle phase on a given cluster. Then,
the relation between these parameters and the network load is modeled by
multivariate linear regression. For evaluation, three applications (WordCount,
Exim Mainlog parsing, and TeraSort) are utilized to evaluate our technique on a
4-node MapReduce private cluster.

parameter phase winds non-trivially in momentum space. In recent years, a new
and promising route for realizing topological superconductors has opened due to
advances in the field of topological insulators. Current proposals are based on
semiconductor heterostructures, where spin-orbit coupled bands are split by a
band gap or Zeeman field and superconductivity is induced by proximity to a
conventional superconductor. Topological superconductivity is obtained in the
interface layer. The proposed heterostructures typically include two or three
layers of different materials. In the current work we propose a device based on
materials with inherent spin-orbit coupling and an intrinsic tendency for
superconductivity, eliminating the need for a separate superconducting layer.
We study a lattice model that includes spin-orbit coupling as well as on-site
and nearest neighbor interaction. Within this model we show that topological
superconductivity is possible in certain regions of parameter space. These
regions of non-trivial topology can be understood as a nodeless superconductor
with d-wave symmetry which, due to the spin-orbit coupling, acquires an extra
phase twist of $2\pi$.

systems, strengthening the suggestion of a binary origin for at least some
stripped SNe. We find a large plateau luminosity range for SNe IIP, while the

In particular, a set of qubits can be entangled by measurement of a joint

entanglement-by-measurement of solid-state qubits have been proposed, but the

we realize a two-qubit parity measurement on nuclear spins in diamond by
exploiting the electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center as readout ancilla.
The measurement enables us to project the initially uncorrelated nuclear spins
into maximally entangled states. By combining this entanglement with
high-fidelity single-shot readout we demonstrate the first violation of Bells

the various agents give rise to the study of methods for timely coordination of
these actions.
  In this work, we formulate and mathematically analyze ""Timely-Coordinated
Response"" - a novel multi-agent coordination problem in which the time
difference between each pair of actions may be constrained by upper and/or
lower bounds. This problem generalizes coordination problems previously studied
by Halpern and Moses and by Ben-Zvi and Moses.
  We optimally solve timely-coordinated response in two ways: using a
generalization of the fixed-point approach of Halpern and Moses, and using a
generalization of the ""syncausality"" approach of Ben-Zvi and Moses. We
constructively show the equivalence of the solutions yielded by both
approaches, and by combining them, derive strengthened versions of known
results for some previously-defined special cases of this problem.
  Our analysis is conducted under minimal assumptions: we work in a
continuous-time model with possibly infinitely many agents. The general results
we obtain for this model reduce to stronger ones for discrete-time models with
only finitely many agents. In order to distill the properties of such models
that are significant to this reduction, we define several classes of
naturally-occurring models, which in a sense separate the different results. We
present both a more practical optimal solution, as well as a surprisingly
simple condition for solvability, for timely coordinated response under these
models.

logic programming. To be useful in this way, logic has to provide a mechanism
for the definition of new functions and new relations on the basis of those
given in the interpretation of a logical theory. We provide this mechanism by
creating a compositional semantics on top of the classical semantics. In this
approach verification of computational results relies on a correspondence
between logic interpretations and a class definition in languages like Java or
C++. The advantage of this approach is the combination of an expressive medium
for the programmer with, in the case of C++, optimal use of computer resources.

natural and artificial defects. Results are obtained with a load ratio of R =
-1 for three different loadings: tension, torsion and combined tension-torsion.
The critical defect size determined is 400 \pm 100 \mum in A356-T6 under
multiaxial loading. Below this value, the microstructure governs the endurance
limit mainly through Secondary Dendrite Arm Spacing (SDAS). Four theoretical
approaches are used to simulate the endurance limit characterized by a Kitagawa
relationship are compared: Murakami relationships [Y Murakami, Metal Fatigue:
Effects of Small Defects and Nonmetallic Inclusions, Elsevier, 2002.],
defect-crack equivalency via Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), the
Critical Distance Method (CDM) proposed by Susmel and Taylor [L. Susmel, D.
Taylor. Eng. Fract. Mech. 75 (2008) 15.] and the gradient approach proposed by
Nadot [Y. Nadot, T. ~Billaudeau. Eng. Fract. Mech. 73 (2006) 1.]. It is shown
that the CDM and gradient methods are accurate; however fatigue data for three
loading conditions is necessary to allow accurate identification of an
endurance limit.

been characterized using compression tests performed over a wide range of
deformation temperatures (30-500{\deg}C) and strain rates (\approx0.1-10 /s).
This work is intended to support the development of process models for a wide
range of conditions including those relevant to casting, forging and machining.
The flow stress behavior as a function of temperature and strain rate has been
fit to a modified Johnson-Cook and extended Ludwik-Hollomon expression. The
data has also been assessed with both the strain-independent Kocks-Mecking and
Zener-Hollomon frameworks. The predicted plastic flow stress for each
expression are compared. The results indicate that the extended Ludwik-Hollomon
is best suited to describe small strain conditions (stage III hardening), while
the Kocks-Mecking is best employed for large strain (stage IV). At elevated
temperatures, it was found that the Zener-Hollomon model provides the best
prediction of flow stress.

cited by many authors because the dispersion relation in Tsallis formalism
present a good fit to the experimental data when q<1, while the classical
result based on Maxwellian distribution only provides a crude description.
However, the results obtained in this paper are problematic. In this comments
on the paper we shall derive the correct analytic formulas both for the
dispersion relation and Landau damping in Tsallis formalism. We hope that this
comments will be useful in providing the correct results.

complexes in a transient scenario and how that efficiency is affected by
environmental noise. Here, following a quantum master equation approach, we
study the energy and excitation transport in fully connected networks both in
general and in the particular case of the Fenna-Matthew-Olson complex. The
analysis is carried out for the steady state of the system where the excitation
energy is constantly ""flowing"" through the system. Steady state transport
scenarios are particularly relevant if the evolution of the quantum system is
not conditioned on the arrival of individual excitations. By adding dephasing
to the system, we analyse the possibility of noise-enhancement of the quantum
transport.
