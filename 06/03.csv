  models","18 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this contribution a numerical study of a turbulent jet flow is presented.
The simulation results of two different variants of the Lattice Boltzmann
method (LBM) are compared. The first is the well-established D3Q19 MRT model
extended by a Smagorinsky Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model. The second is the
D3Q27 Factorized Cascaded Lattice Boltzmann (FCLB) model without any additional
explicit turbulence model. For this model no studies of turbulent flow with
high resolution on nonuniform grids existed so far. The underlying
computational procedure uses a time nested refinement technique and a grid with
more than a billion DOF. The simulations were conducted with the parallel multi
physics solver VIRTUALFLUIDS. It is shown that both models are feasible for the
present flow case, but the FCLB outperforms the traditional approach in some
aspects.

reconnection can provide the additional energy input required to explain the up
to now only poorly understood ionization mechanism of the diffuse ionized gas
(DIG) in galaxies and its observed emission line spectra.
  Methods: We use a detailed non-LTE radiative transfer code that does not make
use of the usual restrictive gaseous nebula approximations to compute synthetic
spectra for gas at low densities. Excitation of the gas is via an additional
heating term in the energy balance as well as by photoionization. Numerical
values for this heating term are derived from three-dimensional resistive
magnetohydrodynamic two-fluid plasma--neutral-gas simulations to compute energy
dissipation rates for the DIG under typical conditions.
  Results: Our simulations show that magnetic reconnection can liberate enough
energy to by itself fully or partially ionize the gas. However, synthetic
spectra from purely thermally excited gas are incompatible with the observed
spectra; a photoionization source must additionally be present to establish the
correct (observed) ionization balance in the gas.

that a necessary condition for this to occur is the emergent Lorentz invariance

reservoir, in regions where C+ is abundant. We detected the J = 1-0 and J = 2-1
rotational lines of CF+ with high signal-to-noise ratio towards the PDR and
dense core positions in the Horsehead. Using a rotational diagram analysis, we
derive a column density of N(CF+) = (1.5 - 2.0) \times 10^12 cm^-2. Because of
the simple fluorine chemistry, the CF+ column density is proportional to the
fluorine abundance. We thus infer the fluorine gas-phase abundance to be F/H =

the layers where C+ is abundant. The emission arises in the UV illuminated skin
of the nebula, tracing the outermost cloud layers. Indeed, CF+ and C+ are the
only species observed to date in the Horsehead with a double peaked line

description of graphical models, called characteristic imsets. Compare with
standard imsets, characteristic imsets have several advantages: they are still
unique vector representative of conditional independence structures, they are
0-1 vectors, and they are more intuitive in terms of graphs than standard
imsets. After defining a characteristic imset polytope (cim-polytope) as the
convex hull of all characteristic imsets with a given set of nodes, they also
showed that a model selection in graphical models, which maximizes a quality
criterion, can be converted into a linear programming problem over the
cim-polytope. However, in general, for a fixed set of nodes, the cim-polytope
can have exponentially many vertices over an exponentially high dimension.
Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the family of directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) whose nodes have a fixed order. This family includes diagnosis models
which can be described by Bipartite graphs with a set of $m$ nodes and a set of
$n$ nodes for any $m, n \in \Z_+$. In this paper, we first consider
cim-polytopes for all diagnosis models and show that these polytopes are direct
products of simplices. Then we give a combinatorial description of all edges
and all facets of these polytopes. Finally, we generalize these results to the
cim-polytopes for all Bayesian networks with a fixed underlying ordering of
nodes with or without fixed (or forbidden) edges.

proposed recently. We prove that spinal codes achieve Shannon capacity for the
binary symmetric channel (BSC) and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel with an efficient polynomial-time encoder and decoder. They are the
first rateless codes with proofs of these properties for BSC and AWGN. The key
idea in the spinal code is the sequential application of a hash function over
the message bits. The sequential structure of the code turns out to be crucial
for efficient decoding. Moreover, counter to the wisdom of having an expander
structure in good codes, we show that the spinal code, despite its sequential
structure, achieves capacity. The pseudo-randomness provided by a hash function
suffices for this purpose. Our proof introduces a variant of Gallager's result
characterizing the error exponent of random codes for any memoryless channel.
We present a novel application of these error-exponent results within the
framework of an efficient sequential code. The application of a hash function
over the message bits provides a methodical and effective way to de-randomize

prevent the packet loss at each node. This results in congestion management in

Galaxy and its electron content. However, most distance measures to pulsars
have been derived from the absorption (or lack thereof) of pulsar emission by
Galactic HI gas, which typically implies that only upper or lower limits on the
pulsar distance are available. We present a critical analysis of all measured
HI distance limits to pulsars and other neutron stars, and translate these
limits into actual distance estimates through a likelihood analysis that
simultaneously corrects for statistical biases. We also apply this analysis to
parallax measurements of pulsars in order to obtain accurate distance estimates
and find that the parallax and HI distance measurements are biased in different
ways, because of differences in the sampled populations. Parallax measurements
typically underestimate a pulsar's distance because of the limited distance to
which this technique works and the consequential strong effect of the Galactic
pulsar distribution (i.e. the original Lutz-Kelker bias), in HI distance
limits, however, the luminosity bias dominates the Lutz-Kelker effect, leading
to overestimated distances because the bright pulsars on which this technique
is applicable are more likely to be nearby given their brightness.

important to understand how selfish and spatially distributed individuals will
share network resources without centralized coordinations. In this paper, we
introduce the graphical congestion game with weighted edges (GCGWE) as a
general theoretical model to study this problem. In GCGWE, we view the players
as vertices in a weighted graph. The amount of negative impact (e.g.
congestion) caused by two close-by players to each other is determined by the
weight of the edge linking them. The GCGWE unifies and significantly
generalizes several simpler models considered in the previous literature, and
is well suited for modeling a wide range of networking scenarios. One good
example is to use the GCGWE to model spectrum sharing in wireless networks,
where we can properly define the edge weights and payoff functions to capture
the rather complicated interference relationship between wireless nodes. By
identifying which GCGWEs possess pure Nash equilibria and the very desirable
finite improvement property, we gain insight into when spatially distributed
wireless nodes will be able to self-organize into a mutually acceptable
resource allocation. We also consider the efficiency of the pure Nash
equilibria, and the computational complexity of finding them.

support midgap Majorana states at critical points. We show that in the presence
of disorder these systems are prone to the buildup of a second bandcenter
anomaly, which is of different physical origin but shares key characteristics
with the Majorana state: it is narrow in width, insensitive to magnetic fields,
carries unit spectral weight, and is rigidly tied to the band center. Depending
on the parity of the number of subgap quasiparticle states, a Majorana mode
does or does not coexist with the impurity generated peak. The strong
'entanglement' between the two phenomena may hinder an unambiguous detection of
the Majorana by spectroscopic techniques.

immediately follows inflation, but precedes the epoch of reheating. During this
phase, the inflaton typically oscillates at the bottom of its potential and
gradually transfers its energy to radiation. At the same time, the amplitude of
the fields coupled to the inflaton may undergo parametric resonance and, as a
consequence, explosive particle production can take place. A priori, these
phenomena could lead to an amplification of the super-Hubble scale curvature
perturbations which, in turn, would modify the standard inflationary
predictions. However, remarkably, it has been shown that, although the
Mukhanov-Sasaki variable does undergo narrow parametric instability during
preheating, the amplitude of the corresponding super-Hubble curvature
perturbations remain constant. Therefore, in single field models, metric
preheating does not affect the power spectrum of the large scale perturbations.
In this article, we investigate the corresponding effect on the scalar
bi-spectrum. Using the Maldacena's formalism, we analytically show that, for
modes of cosmological interest, the contributions to the scalar bi-spectrum as
the curvature perturbations evolve on super-Hubble scales during preheating is
completely negligible. Specifically, we illustrate that, certain terms in the
third order action governing the curvature perturbations which may naively be
expected to contribute significantly are exactly canceled by other
contributions to the bi-spectrum. We corroborate selected analytical results by
numerical investigations. We conclude with a brief discussion of the results we
have obtained.

that are described by a single quantum wavefunction and are confined in a
weakly anharmonic trap. The echoes and revival echoes are induced by applying
two, successive temporally localized potential perturbations to the confining
potential, one at time $t=0$, and a smaller one at time $t=\tau$. Pulse-like
responses in the expectation value of position $<x(t)>$ are predicted at $t
\approx n\tau$ ($n=2,3,...$) and are particularly evident at $t \approx 2\tau$.
A novel result of our study is the finding of 'revival echoes'. Revivals (but
not echoes) occur even if the second perturbation is absent. In particular, in
the absence of the second perturbation, the response to the first perturbation
dies away, but then reassembles, producing a response at revival times $mT_x$
($m=1,2,...$). Including the second perturbation at $t=\tau$, we find
temporally localized responses, revival echoes, both before and after $t\approx
mT_x$, e.g., at $t\approx m T_x-n \tau$ (pre-revival echoes) and at $t\approx
mT_x+n\tau$, (post-revival echoes), where $m$ and $n$ are $1,2,...$ . Depending
on the form of the perturbations, the 'principal' revival echoes at $t \approx
T_x \pm \tau$ can be much larger than the echo at $t \approx 2\tau$. We develop
a perturbative model for these phenomena, and compare its predictions to the
numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger Equation. The scaling
of the size of the various echoes and revival echoes as a function of the
symmetry and size of the perturbations applied at $t=0$ and $t=\tau$ is
investigated. We also study the presence of revivals and revival echoes in
higher moments of position, $<x^p (t)>$, $p>1$, and the effect of atom-atom
interactions on these phenomena.

developing countries like India. This paper describes the various components of
our prototype implementation of a Real-time Passenger Information System
(RTPIS) for a public transport system like a fleet of buses. Vehicle-mounted
units, bus station units and a server located at the transport company premises
comprise the system. The vehicle unit reports the current position of the
vehicle to a central server periodically via General Packet Radio Service
(GPRS). An Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) algorithm running on the server
predicts the arrival times of buses at their stops based on real-time
observations of the buses' current Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates.
This information is displayed and announced to passengers at stops using
station units, which periodically fetch the required ETA from the server via
GPRS. Novel features of our prototype include: (a) a route creator utility
which automatically creates new routes from scratch when a bus is driven along
the new route, and (b) voice tagging of stops and points of interest along any
route. Besides, the prototype provides: (i) web-based applications for
passengers, providing useful information like a snapshot of present bus
locations on the streets, and (ii) web-based analysis tools for the transport
authority, providing information useful for fleet management, like number of
trips undertaken by a specific bus. The prototype has been demonstrated in a
campus environment, with four-wheelers and two-wheelers emulating buses. The
automatic real-time passenger information system has the potential of making
the public transport system an attractive alternative for city-dwellers,
thereby contributing to fewer private vehicles on the road, leading to lower
congestion levels and less pollution.

Angus Maddison. This dataset covers the period since 1870 with continuous
annual estimates in developed countries. All time series for individual
economies have a clear structural break between 1940 and 1950. The behavior
before 1940 and after 1950 can be accurately (R2 from 0.7 to 0.99) approximated
by linear time trends. The corresponding slopes of regressions lines before and
after the break differ by a factor of 4 (Switzerland) to 19 (Spain). We have
extrapolated the early trends into the second interval and obtained much lower
estimates of real GDP per capita in 2011: from 2.4 (Switzerland) to 5.0 (Japan)
times smaller than the current levels. When the current linear trends are
extrapolated into the past, they intercept the zero line between 1908
(Switzerland) and 1944 (Japan). There is likely an internal conflict between
the estimating procedures before 1940 and after 1950. A reasonable explanation
of the discrepancy is that the GDP deflator in developed countries has been
highly underestimated since 1950. In the USA, the GDP deflator is
underestimated by a factor of 1.4. This is exactly the ratio of the interest
rate controlled by the Federal Reserve and the rate of inflation. Hence, the
Federal Reserve actually retains its interest rate at the level of true price
inflation when corrected for the bias in the GDP deflator.

Implemented measurement schemes are the minimum-error measurement (known as
Helstrom measurement), unambiguous state discrimination using a standard
projective measurement, and optimal unambiguous state discrimination (known as
IDP measurement), which utilizes a three-dimensional Hilbert space. Measurement
efficiencies are found to be above 80% for all schemes and reach a value of 90%
for the IDP measurement

  Singularities","38 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a previous work we have introduced and studied the notion of embedded
$\mathbf{Q}$-resolution, which essentially consists in allowing the final
ambient space to contain abelian quotient singularities. Here we explicitly
compute an embedded $\mathbf{Q}$-resolution of a Yomdin-L\^e surface
singularity $(V,0)$ in terms of a (global) embedded $\mathbf{Q}$-resolution of
their tangent cone by means of just weighted blow-ups at points. The
generalized A'Campo's formula in this setting is applied so as to compute the
characteristic polynomial. As a consequence, an exceptional divisor in the
resolution of $(V,0)$, apart from the first one which might be special,
contributes to its complex monodromy if and only if so does the corresponding
divisor in the tangent cone. Thus the resolution obtained is optimal in the
sense that the weights can be chosen so that every exceptional divisor in the
$\mathbf{Q}$-resolution of $(V,0)$, except perhaps the first one, contributes
to its monodromy.

an augmented down-up (or ADU) algebra. We discuss how ADU algebras are related
to the down-up algebras defined by Benkart and Roby. For each ADU algebra we
give two presentations by generators and relations. We also display a
$Z$-grading and a linear basis. In addition we show that the center is
isomorphic to a polynomial algebra in two variables. We display seven families
of uniform posets and show that each gives an ADU algebra module in a natural
way. The main inspiration for the ADU algebra concept comes from the second
author's thesis concerning a type of uniform poset constructed using a dual
polar graph.

known as thrombocytes, play a key role in blood clotting which is a vital human
function. Furthermore, the role of these entities in strokes, myocardial
infarctions, and coronary artery disease add to the importance of blood
platelets.
  Analytical expressions for the structure of blood platelets in both their
inactivated and activated states were developed, beginning with randomized
two-dimensional models in polar coordinates. Weak frameworks in spherical and
cylindrical systems were then created. Next, using rotational matrices to
change the position and direction of a simple projection, useful, explicit,
parametric system of equations were attained in three-dimensional Cartesian
space which roughly approximate the structure of a blood platelet.
  Finally, a methodology to return the drag coefficient ($c_d$) for any
inputted set of blood platelet images was designed. This method was
incorporated into a C++ program returning the functional representation and
drag coefficient of any given platelet. This work has primary applications in
computational biophysics and fluid dynamics. Additionally, if the parameters of
the model are extended, there could be ramifications in other areas of
scientific modelling by connecting analytical expressions with instrinsic
characteristics.

models in which we observe independent copies of a random vector $X = AS$,
where $A$ is a non-singular matrix and $S$ has independent components. We
propose a new way of estimating the unmixing matrix $W = A^{-1}$ and the
marginal distributions of the components of $S$ using nonparametric maximum
likelihood. Specifically, we study the projection of the empirical distribution
onto the subset of ICA distributions having log-concave marginals. We show
that, from the point of view of estimating the unmixing matrix, it makes no
difference whether or not the log-concavity is correctly specified. The
approach is further justified by both theoretical results and a simulation
study.

analyses and by tracking the recent virulent strain and can be broadly
applicable with effective testing of vaccine efficacy. Every year World Health
Organization (WHO) reveals the administration of drug and vaccine to counter
arrest the spread of flu among the population. As there are recurrent failures
in priming the population, the complete eradication of the flu pandemic is
still appears to be an unresolved problem. To overcome the current scenario,
high level efforts with theoretical and practical research is required and it
can enhance the scope in this field. The recent advancements also allow the
researchers to endeavor effective vaccine to meet the emerging flu types. Only
the standardized vaccination among the population at the time of flu pandemics
will revolutionalize the current propositions against influenza virus. This
paper shows the deficiencies of vaccine fitness research as there are reported
failures and less efficacy of vaccine even after priming the population from
referred evidences and studies. It also shows simple experimental approach in
detecting the effective vaccine among the vaccines announced by WHO.
