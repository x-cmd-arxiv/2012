component separated by about 1.4 seconds of arc. The radial velocities were
calculated from the high-resolution spectra obtained with the 1.9-m

H_alpha emission lines. For the analysis we used V and I band photometry
obtained with the 1.0-m Elizabeth and robotic 0.41-m PROMPT telescopes,
supplemented with the publicly available ASAS light curve of the system.
  We found that ASAS J011328-3821.1 A is composed of two late-type dwarfs

radii of R_1 = 0.596 +/- 0.020 R_sun, R_2 = 0.445 +/- 0.024 R_sun, both show a
substantial level of activity, which manifests in strong H_alpha and H_beta
emission and the presence of cool spots. The influence of the third light on
the eclipsing pair properties was also evaluated and the photometric properties
of the component B were derived. Comparison with several popular stellar
evolution models shows that the system is on its main sequence evolution stage

embedded in a protoplanetary disk that is valid even at locations where the
surface density or temperature profile cannot be approximated by a power law,
such as an opacity transition. At such locations, the Lindblad torque is known
to suffer strong deviation from its standard value, with potentially important
implications for type I migration, but the full treatment of the tidal
interaction is cumbersome and not well suited to models of planetary population
synthesis. The expression that we propose retains the simplicity of the
standard Lindblad torque formula and gives results that accurately reproduce
those of numerical simulations, even at locations where the disk temperature
undergoes abrupt changes. Our study is conducted by means of customized
numerical simulations in the low-mass regime, in locally isothermal disks, and
compared to linear torque estimates obtained by summing fully analytic torque
estimates at each Lindblad resonance. The functional dependence of our modified
Lindblad torque expression is suggested by an estimate of the shift of the
Lindblad resonances that mostly contribute to the torque, in a disk with sharp
gradients of temperature or surface density, while the numerical coefficients
of the new terms are adjusted to seek agreement with numerics. As side results,
we find that the vortensity related corotation torque undergoes a boost at an
opacity transition that can counteract migration, and we find evidence from
numerical simulations that the linear corotation torque has a non-negligible
dependency upon the temperature gradient, in a locally isothermal disk.

galvanic power density exceeds 1 W cm^-2, which is twice previous literature
values. The precious metal loading of the chlorine electrode is below 0.15 mg
Ru cm^-2. Virtually no activation losses are observed, allowing the cell to run
at nearly 0.4 W cm^-2 at 90% voltage efficiency. We report the effects of fluid
pressure, electrolyte acid concentration, and hydrogen-side humidification on

conspicuously easy way, from a few simple postulates concerning abstract
probabilistic models (each defined by a set of basic measurements and a convex
set of states). The key assumption is that each system A can be paired with an
isomorphic $\textit{conjugate}$ system, $\overline{A}$, by means of a
non-signaling bipartite state $\eta_A$ perfectly and uniformly correlating each
basic measurement on A with its counterpart on $\overline{A}$. In the case of a
quantum-mechanical system associated with a complex Hilbert space $\mathcal H$,
the conjugate system is that associated with the conjugate Hilbert space
$\overline{\mathcal H}$, and $\eta_A$ corresponds to the standard maximally
entangled EPR state on ${\mathcal H} \otimes \overline{\mathcal H}$. A second
ingredient is the notion of a $\textit{reversible filter}$, that is, a
probabilistically reversible process that independently attenuates the
sensitivity of detectors associated with a measurement. In addition to offering
more flexibility than most existing reconstructions of finite-dimensional
quantum theory, the approach taken here has the advantage of not relying on any
form of the ""no restriction"" hypothesis. That is, it is not assumed that
arbitrary effects are physically measurable, nor that arbitrary families of
physically measurable effects summing to the unit effect, represent physically
accessible observables. An appendix shows how a version of Hardy's ""subspace
axiom"" can replace several assumptions native to this paper, although at the
cost of disallowing superselection rules.

photoemission and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism studies have recently shown
surface ferromagnetism in the temperature range 15 K $\leq T \leq 100$ K,

Secondary ion mass spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy reveal an
inhomogeneous distribution of Mn atoms, with a tendency to segregate towards

are insensitive to the high temperature ferromagnetism seen in surface studies,
revealing instead a low temperature ferromagnetic phase at $T \lesssim 5$ K.
The absence of both a magneto-optical Kerr effect and anomalous Hall effect
suggests that this low temperature ferromagnetism is unlikely to be a
homogeneous bulk phase but likely originates in nanoscale near-surface regions
of the bulk where magnetic atoms segregate during sample growth. Although the
samples are not ideal, with both bulk and surface contributions to electron
transport, we measure a magnetoconductance whose behavior is qualitatively
consistent with predictions that the opening of a gap in the Dirac spectrum
drives quantum corrections to the conductance in topological insulators from

Yet both direct detection as well as monochromatic gamma ray signatures depend
sensitively on the presence of such interactions. For a Dirac fermion,
electromagnetic dipoles are possible, but are very constrained. For Majorana
fermions, no such terms are allowed. We consider signals of an effective theory
with a Majorana dark matter particle and its couplings to photons. In the
presence of a nearby excited state, there is the possibility of a magnetic
dipole transition (Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter or MiDM), which yields both
direct and indirect detection signals, and, intriguingly, yields essentially
the same size over a wide range of dipole strengths. Absent an excited state,
the leading interaction of WIMPs is similar to the Rayleigh scattering of low
energy photons from neutral atoms, which may be captured by an effective
operator of dimension 7 of the form $\bar{\chi}\chi F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$.
While it can be thought of as a phase of the Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter
scenario where the excited state is much heavier than the ground state, it can
arise from other theories as well. We study the resulting phenomenology of this
scenario: gamma ray lines from the annihilation of WIMPs; nuclear recoils in
direct detection; and direct production of the WIMP pair in high-energy
colliders. Considering recent evidence in particular for a 130 GeV line from
the galactic center, we discuss the detection prospects at upcoming

four-momentum squared, $Q^2$, and in the inverse Bjorken $x$, while with the
design luminosity of $10^{33}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ the LHeC is projected to
exceed the integrated HERA luminosity by two orders of magnitude. The physics
programme is devoted to an exploration of the energy frontier, complementing
the LHC and its discovery potential for physics beyond the Standard Model with
high precision deep inelastic scattering measurements. These are designed to
investigate a variety of fundamental questions in strong and electroweak
interactions. The physics programme also includes electron-deuteron and
electron-ion scattering in a $(Q^2, 1/x)$ range extended by four orders of
magnitude as compared to previous lepton-nucleus DIS experiments for novel
investigations of neutron's and nuclear structure, the initial conditions of
Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and further quantum chromodynamic phenomena. The
LHeC may be realised either as a ring-ring or as a linac-ring collider. Optics
and beam dynamics studies are presented for both versions, along with technical
design considerations on the interaction region, magnets and further
components, together with a design study for a high acceptance detector. Civil
engineering and installation studies are presented for the accelerator and the
detector. The LHeC can be built within a decade and thus be operated while the
LHC runs in its high-luminosity phase. It thus represents a major opportunity
for progress in particle physics exploiting the investment made in the LHC.

criterion used for the selection of the optimal clusterings, based on a
quantitative measure of the degree of correlation between the cluster

employed for the clustering. In this paper we discuss the applications of
CLaSPS to two simple astronomical datasets, both composed of extragalactic
sources with photometric observations at different wavelengths from large area
surveys. The first dataset, CSC+, is composed of optical quasars
spectroscopically selected in the SDSS data, observed in the X-rays by Chandra
and with multi-wavelength observations in the near-infrared, optical and
ultraviolet spectral intervals. One of the results of the application of CLaSPS
to the CSC+ is the re-identification of a well-known correlation between the
alphaOX parameter and the near ultraviolet color, in a subset of CSC+ sources
with relatively small values of the near-ultraviolet colors. The other dataset
consists of a sample of blazars for which photometric observations in the
optical, mid and near infrared are available, complemented for a subset of the
sources, by Fermi gamma-ray data. The main results of the application of CLaSPS
to such datasets have been the discovery of a strong correlation between the
multi-wavelength color distribution of blazars and their optical spectral
classification in BL Lacs and Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars and a peculiar
pattern followed by blazars in the WISE mid-infrared colors space. This pattern
and its physical interpretation have been discussed in details in other papers

holes (SMBHs) within galactic nuclei. Yet, as stars evolve off the main
sequence their vulnerability to tidal disruption increases drastically as they
develop a bifurcated structure consisting of a dense core and a tenuous
envelope. Here we present the first hydrodynamic simulations of the tidal
disruption of giant stars and show that the core has a substantial influence on
the star's ability to survive the encounter. Stars with more massive cores
retain large fractions of their envelope mass, even in deep encounters.
Accretion flares resulting from the disruption of giant stars should last for
tens to hundreds of years. Their characteristic signature in transient searches
would not be the $t^{-5/3}$ decay typically associated with tidal disruption
events, but a correlated rise over many orders of magnitude in brightness on
months to years timescales. We calculate the relative disruption rates of stars
of varying evolutionary stages in typical galactic centers, then use our
results to produce Monte Carlo realizations of the expected flaring event
populations. We find that the demographics of tidal disruption flares are
strongly dependent on both stellar and black hole mass, especially near the
limiting SMBH mass scale of $\sim 10^8 M_\odot$. At this black hole mass, we
predict a sharp transition in the SMBH flaring diet beyond which all observable
disruptions arise from evolved stars, accompanied by a dramatic cutoff in the
overall tidal disruption flaring rate. Black holes less massive than this
limiting mass scale will show observable flares from both main sequence and
evolved stars, with giants contributing up to 10% of the event rate. The
relative fractions of stars disrupted at different evolutionary states can
constrain the properties and distributions of stars in galactic nuclei other

dust heating occurs in the central regions of galaxy spheroids that are
essentially devoid of young stars. We construct a dust temperature map of M31
through fitting modified blackbody SEDs to the Herschel data, and find that the
temperature within 2 kpc rises strongly from the mean value in the disk of 17
pm 1K to \sim35K at the centre. UV to near-IR imaging of the central few kpc
shows directly the absence of young stellar populations, delineates the radial
profile of the stellar density, and demonstrates that even the near-UV dust
extinction is optically thin in M31's bulge. This allows the direct calculation
of the stellar radiation heating in the bulge, U\ast(r), as a function of
radius. The increasing temperature profile in the centre matches that expected
from the stellar heating, i.e. that the dust heating and cooling rates track
each other over nearly two orders of magnitude in U\ast. The modelled dust
heating is in excess of the observed dust temperatures, suggesting that it is
more than sufficient to explain the observed IR emission. Together with the
wavelength dependent absorption cross section of the dust, this demonstrates
directly that it is the optical, not UV, radiation that sets the heating rate.
This analysis shows that neither young stellar populations nor stellar near-UV
radiation are necessary to heat dust to warm temperatures in galaxy spheroids.
Rather, it is the high densities of Gyr-old stellar populations that provide a
sufficiently strong diffuse radiation field to heat the dust. To the extent
which these results pertain to the tenuous dust found in the centres of
early-type galaxies remains yet to be explored.

develop an effective field theory formulated in terms of an IR effective fluid
characterized by several parameters, such as speed of sound and viscosity.
These parameters, determined by the UV physics described by the Boltzmann
equation, are measured from N-body simulations. We find that the speed of sound

are of the same order. The fluid describes all the relevant physics at long
scales k and permits a manifestly convergent perturbative expansion in the size
of the matter perturbations \delta(k) for all the observables. As an example,
we calculate the correction to the power spectrum at order \delta(k)^4. The

agreement with observation than standard cosmological perturbation theory,
already reaching percent precision at this order up to a relatively short scale

(2+1)-dimensional array of dissipative Josephson junctions. We find three
distinct stable quantum phases of the system. The most ordered state features
long-range spatial ordering in the phase $\theta$ of the superconducting order
parameter, but temporal ordering only in spatial gradients $\Delta \theta$, not
in $\theta$. Significantly, the most ordered state therefore does not have 3D
XY ordering. Rather, it features 2D spin waves coexisting with temporally
disordered phases $\theta$. There is also an intermediate phase featuring
quasi-long-range spatial order in $\theta$ coexisting with a gas of instantons
in $\Delta \theta$. We briefly discuss possible experimental signatures of such
a state, which may be viewed as a local metal and a global superconductor. The
most disordered state has phase disorder in all spatio-temporal directions, and
may be characterized as a gas of proliferated vortices coexisting with a gas of
$\Delta \theta$-instantons. The phase transitions between these phases are
discussed. The transition from the most ordered state to the intermediate state
is driven by proliferation of instantons in $\Delta \theta$. The transition
from the intermediate state to the most disordered state is driven by the
proliferation of spatial point vortices in the background of a proliferated
$\Delta \theta$-instanton gas, and constitutes a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition. The model also features a
direct phase transition from the most ordered state to the most disordered
state, and this transition is neither in the 2D XY nor in the 3D XY
universality class. It comes about via a simultaneous proliferation of point
vortices in two spatial dimensions and $\Delta \theta$-instantons, with a
complicated interplay between them.

Unfortunately, this tuning is often a ""black art"" that requires expert

more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can
optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In

correlations, implies an area law for the entanglement entropy of quantum
states defined on a line. The entropy bound is exponential in the correlation
length of the state, thus reproducing as a particular case Hastings proof of an
area law for groundstates of 1D gapped Hamiltonians.
  As a consequence, we show that 1D quantum states with exponential decay of
correlations have an efficient classical approximate description as a matrix
product state of polynomial bond dimension, thus giving an equivalence between
injective matrix product states and states with a finite correlation length.
  The result can be seen as a rigorous justification, in one dimension, of the
intuition that states with exponential decay of correlations, usually
associated with non-critical phases of matter, are simple to describe. It also
has implications for quantum computing: It shows that unless a pure state
quantum computation involves states with long-range correlations, decaying at
most algebraically with the distance, it can be efficiently simulated
classically.
  The proof relies on several previous tools from quantum information theory -
including entanglement distillation protocols achieving the hashing bound,
properties of single-shot smooth entropies, and the quantum substate theorem -
and also on some newly developed ones. In particular we derive a new bound on
correlations established by local random measurements, and we give a
generalization to the max-entropy of a result of Hastings concerning the
saturation of mutual information in multiparticle systems. The proof can also
be interpreted as providing a limitation on the phenomenon of data hiding in
quantum states.

that the matrix-vector product operation is at most $\slfrac{33p^2}{8}$ times
more expensive for the more continuous space, although for moderately low $p$,

the host galaxy gas. The model predicts UV luminosity functions for AGNs which
are in good agreement with those derived from the observations especially at
low and intermediate redshifts (z=3). At higher redshifts (z>5) the model tends
to overestimate the data at faint luminosities. Critical biases both in the

increased attention in recent years. In particular, recent work in algorithmic
mechanism design has produced mechanisms employing internal randomization,
partly in response to limitations on deterministic mechanisms imposed by
computational complexity. For many of these mechanisms, which are often
referred to as truthful-in-expectation, incentive compatibility is contingent
on the assumption that agents are risk-neutral. These mechanisms have been
criticized on the grounds that this assumption is too strong, because ""real""
agents are typically risk averse, and moreover their precise attitude towards
risk is typically unknown a-priori. In response, researchers in algorithmic
mechanism design have sought the design of universally-truthful mechanisms ---
mechanisms for which incentive-compatibility makes no assumptions regarding
agents' attitudes towards risk.
  We show that any truthful-in-expectation mechanism can be generically
transformed into a mechanism that is incentive compatible even when agents are
risk averse, without modifying the mechanism's allocation rule. The transformed
mechanism does not require reporting of agents' risk profiles. Equivalently,
our result can be stated as follows: Every (randomized) allocation rule that is
implementable in dominant strategies when players are risk neutral is also
implementable when players are endowed with an arbitrary and unknown concave
utility function for money.

fixed number of anchor nodes. The challenge is to overcome the
multipath-barrier with redundancy in order to provide the desired accuracies
especially under severe multipath conditions when the fraction of received
signals corrupted by multipath is dominating. We invoke a analytical graphical
model framework based on particle filtering and reveal its high accuracy
localization promise through simulations. We also address design questions such
as ""How many anchors and what fraction of line-of-sight (LOS) measurements are
needed to achieve a specified target accuracy?"", by analytically characterizing
the performance improvement in localization accuracy as a function of the
number of nodes in the network and the fraction of LOS measurements. In
particular, for a static node placement, we show that the Cramer-Rao Lower
Bound (CRLB), a fundamental lower bound on the localization accuracy, can be
expressed as a product of two factors - a scalar function that depends only on
the parameters of the noise distribution and a matrix that depends only on the
geometry of node locations and the underlying connectivity graph. Further, a
simplified expression is obtained for the CRLB that helps deduce the scaling
behavior of the estimation error as a function of the number of agents and
anchors in the network. The bound suggests that even a small fraction of LOS
measurements can provide significant improvements. Conversely, a small fraction
of NLOS measurements can significantly degrade the performance. The analysis is
extended to the mobile setting and the performance is compared with the derived
CRLB.

The quantities of interest -- means, variances, and other moments of the random

with the incidental parameter problem introduced by the noise of the
within-individual estimators in short panels, we develop bias corrections.
These corrections are based on higher-order asymptotic expansions of the GMM
estimators and produce improved point and interval estimates in moderately long

dimensions of the panel pass to infinity at the same rate, the uncorrected
estimator has an asymptotic bias of the same order as the asymptotic variance.
The bias corrections remove the bias without increasing variance. An empirical
example on cigarette demand based on Becker, Grossman and Murphy (1994) shows
significant heterogeneity in the price effect across U.S. states.

a collection of leaders compete in a Nash game constrained by the equilibrium
conditions of another Nash game amongst the followers. The resulting
equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints is complicated by nonconvex
agent problems and therefore providing tractable conditions for existence of
global or even local equilibria for it has proved challenging. Consequently,
much of the extant research on this topic is either model specific or relies on
weaker notions of equilibria. We consider a modified formulation in which every
leader is cognizant of the equilibrium constraints of all leaders. Equilibria
of this modified game contain the equilibria, if any, of the original game. The
new formulation has a constraint structure called shared constraints, and our
main result shows that if the leader objectives admit a potential function, the
global minimizers of the potential function over the shared constraint are
equilibria of the modified formulation. We provide another existence result
using fixed point theory that does not require potentiality. Additionally,
local minima, B-stationary, and strong-stationary points of this minimization
are shown to be local Nash equilibria, Nash B-stationary, and Nash
strong-stationary points of the corresponding multi-leader multi-follower game.
We demonstrate the relationship between variational equilibria associated with
this modified shared-constraint game and equilibria of the original game from
the standpoint of the multiplier sets and show how equilibria of the original
formulation may be recovered. We note through several examples that such
potential multi-leader multi-follower games capture a breadth of application
problems of interest and demonstrate our findings on a multi-leader
multi-follower Cournot game.

reconstruction error independent of the source. Dithered quantizers have
traditionally been considered within their natural setting of uniform
quantization. In this paper we extend conventional dithered quantization to
nonuniform quantization, via a subterfage: dithering is performed in the
companded domain. Closed form necessary conditions for optimality of the
compressor and expander mappings are derived for both fixed and variable rate
randomized quantization. Numerically, mappings are optimized by iteratively
imposing these necessary conditions. The framework is extended to include an
explicit constraint that deterministic or randomized quantizers yield
reconstruction error that is uncorrelated with the source. Surprising
theoretical results show direct and simple connection between the optimal
constrained quantizers and their unconstrained counterparts. Numerical results
for the Gaussian source provide strong evidence that the proposed constrained
randomized quantizer outperforms the conventional dithered quantizer, as well
as the constrained deterministic quantizer. Moreover, the proposed constrained
quantizer renders the reconstruction error nearly white. In the second part of
the paper, we investigate whether uncorrelated reconstruction error requires
random coding to achieve asymptotic optimality. We show that for a Gaussian
source, the optimal vector quantizer of asymptotically high dimension whose
quantization error is uncorrelated with the source, is indeed random. Thus,
random encoding in this setting of rate-distortion theory, is not merely a tool
to characterize performance bounds, but a required property of quantizers that
approach such bounds.

dark matter annihilation channel. In many popular models in which the
annihilation to a pair of light fermions is helicity suppressed, these
bremsstrahlung processes can lift the suppression and thus become the dominant
annihilation channels. The resulting dark matter annihilation products contain
a large, energetic, neutrino component. We consider solar WIMP annihilation in
the case where electroweak bremsstrahlung dominates, and calculate the
resulting neutrino spectra. The flux consists of primary neutrinos produced in
processes such as $\chi\chi\rightarrow \bar{\nu}\nu Z$ and $\chi\chi\rightarrow
\bar{\nu}\ell W$, and secondary neutrinos produced via the decays of gauge
bosons and charged leptons. After dealing with the neutrino propagation and
flavour evolution in the Sun, we consider the prospects for detection in
neutrino experiments on Earth. By comparing our signal with that for

that the dust bubble is interacting with CO at a kinematic distance of 3.4 kpc.
The bubble S51 structure, carried with shell and front side, is exhibited with
13CO and C18O emission. Both outflow and inflow may exist in sources in the

junction of the two bubbles. Several young stellar objects are distributed
along an arc-shaped structure near the S51 shell. They may represent a second
generation of stars whose formation was triggered by the bubble expanding into

of 1 kpc. Spectral energy distribution modelling of the new infrared images in
combination with archival optical, near- through mid-infrared images confirms
that both galaxies underwent a burst of star formation ~370-480 Myr ago and
provides spatially resolved maps of the stellar and dust mass surface
densities. The resulting average dust-to-stellar mass ratios are comparable to
other spiral and spheroidal galaxies studied with Herschel, with NGC 5194 at
log M(dust)/M(star)= -2.5+/-0.2 and NGC 5195 at log M(dust)/M(star)=
-3.5+/-0.3. The dust-to-stellar mass ratio is constant across NGC 5194
suggesting the stellar and dust components are coupled. In contrast, the mass
ratio increases with radius in NGC 5195 with decreasing stellar mass density.
Archival mass surface density maps of the neutral and molecular hydrogen gas
are also folded into our analysis. The gas-to-dust mass ratio, 94+/-17, is
relatively constant across NGC 5194. Somewhat surprisingly, we find the dust in
NGC 5195 is heated by a strong interstellar radiation field, over 20 times that
of the ISRF in the Milky Way, resulting in relatively high characteristic dust
temperatures (~30 K). This post-starburst galaxy contains a substantial amount
of low-density molecular gas and displays a gas-to-dust ratio (73+/-35) similar
to spiral galaxies. It is unclear why the dust in NGC 5195 is heated to such
high temperatures as there is no star formation in the galaxy and its active
galactic nucleus is 5-10 times less luminous than the one in NGC 5194, which
exhibits only a modest enhancement in the amplitude of its ISRF.

the Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (KLT) minimizes the mean square error

advances that provide some partial answers regarding KLT optimality. In this
paper, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality of a
transform when high resolution, variable rate quantizers are employed. We hence
present not only a complete characterization of when KLT is optimal, but also a
determining condition for optimality of a general (non-KLT) transform. This
necessary and sufficient condition is shown to have direct connections to the
well studied source separation problem. This observation can impact source
separation itself, as illustrated with a new optimality result. We combine the
transform optimality condition with algorithmic tools from source separation,
to derive a practical numerical method to search for the optimal transform in
source coding. Then, we focus on multiterminal settings, for which {\it
conditional} KLT was shown to possess certain optimality properties for
Gaussian sources. We derive the optimal orthogonal transform for the setting
where side information is only available to the decoder, along with new
specialized results specific to the conditions for optimality of conditional
KLT. Finally, we consider distributed source coding where two correlated
sources are to be transform coded separately but decoded jointly. We derive the
necessary and sufficient condition of optimality of the orthogonal transforms.
We specialize to find the optimal orthogonal transforms, in this setting, for

They determine the reciprocal space and correlate with the correlation entropy
different from zero. Alongside with the minimum entropy, action, and the
presence of the Winn-Ehrenfest adiabatic invariant (AI), the fluctuations
require the Gilbert information (probabilistic) space linking the physical and
the reciprocal ST. Physical quantities in the information space are represented
by linear Hermitian operators, which is due to the entropy production in the
presence of an AI. Evolution of a quantum system is described by the wave
functions having the meaning of information concerning all virtually possible
states of a quantum particle. The wave functions are the solutions to the
Schrodinger equation and represent a navigation 'roadmap' for the particle to
follow. A quantum system is in fact a classical Hamiltonian system in the space

demonstrated analytically that two-particle non-interacting quantum walks

numerically that three-particle non-interacting quantum walks have significant,

distinguishing power is possible, whereas it is forbidden for two-particle

find no difference in the distinguishing power of bosonic and fermionic walks.
In addition, we find that the four-fermion non-interacting walk has greater
distinguishing power than the three-particle walks on SRGs, showing that
increasing particle number increases distinguishing power. However, we also

geological deformations of crustal rock strata taking place immediately

vertically in between ground and sky. I conjecture, inspired by an observation
of strange patterns appearing on shaving foam, that this fast movement of air
fluid may produce unusual cloud patterns at interfaces between atmosphere
levels. This air movement is vertical and drastic, different from the
horizontal and moderate meteorological air movement, hence its caused cloud
patterns are expected to be different from meteorological cloud patterns. This
provides a possible origin for the so-called earthquake cloud. Recognition of
different earthquake cloud patterns may provide a practical way to estimate
location, magnitude and strength of geological deformations of rock strata, and
hence a method with support of physics for imminent earthquake prediction. In
the end of this paper an experiment has been designed to test the conjecture.

a significant increase in net data throughput, and thereby reduction in energy
consumption due to reduced communication time. On the other hand, on devices
with constrained computing resources, heavy coding operations cause packet
drops in higher layers and negatively affect the net throughput. We find from

used to describe the complete set of behaviours exhibited by simple structures.
The composition rules that result from this definition can be used to
automatically deduce the behaviour of more complex structures composed from
simpler structures. Several examples illustrate the method, and a software

differentiation of society against the threats posed by the possibilities of
modern information processing, and (2) countering undue information power by
organized social players. It could be, therefore, no surprise that the first
data protection law in the German state of Hesse contained rules to protect the
individual as well as the balance of power between the legislative and the
executive body of the state. Social networks like Facebook or Google+ do not
only endanger their users by exposing them to other users or the public. They
constitute, first and foremost, a threat to society as a whole by collecting
information about individuals, groups, and organizations from different social
systems and combining them in a centralized data bank. They transgress the
boundaries between social systems that act as a shield against total visibility
and transparency of the individual and protect the freedom and the autonomy of
the people. Without enforcing structural limitations on the organizational use
of collected data by the social network itself or the company behind it, social
networks pose the worst totalitarian peril for western societies since the fall

molecules is the lack of adequate knowledge of the rate co-efficients of
various reactions which take place in the Interstellar medium and molecular
clouds. Some of the theoretical models of rate coefficients do exist in the
literature for computing abundances of the complex pre-biotic molecules. So far
these have been used to study the abundances of these molecules in space.
However, in order to obtain more accurate final compositions in these media, we
find out the rate coefficients for the formation of some of the most important
interstellar pre-biotic molecules by using quantum chemical theory. We use
these rates inside our hydro-chemical model to find out the chemical evolution
and the final abundances of the pre-biotic species during the collapsing phase
of a proto-star. We find that a significant amount of various pre-biotic
molecules could be produced during the collapsing phase of a proto-star. We
study extensively the formation these molecules via successive neutral-neutral
and radical-radical/radical-molecular reactions. We present the time evolution
of the chemical species with an emphasis on how the production of these
molecules varies with the depth of a cloud. We compare the formation of adenine
in the interstellar space using our rate-coefficients and using those obtained
from the existing theoretical models. Formation routes of the pre-biotic
molecules are found to be highly dependent on the abundances of the reactive
species and the rate coefficients involved in the reactions. Presence of grains
strongly affect the abundances of the gas phase species. We also carry out a
comparative study between different pathways available for the synthesis of
adenine, alanine, glycine and other molecules considered in our network.

asymptotic approximation that is accurate even when the per-hop channel gains
adhere to completely different fading models. The main result contained in the
paper is a general expression for the outage probability, which is a functional
of the Mellin transforms of the per-hop channel gains. Furthermore, we
explicitly calculate the asymptotic outage probability for four different
systems, whereby in each system the per-hop channels adhere to either a
Nakagami-m, Weibull, Rician, or Hoyt fading profile, but where the
distributional parameters may differ from hop to hop. This analysis leads to
our second main result, which is a semi-general closed-form formula for the
outage probability of general fixed-gain AF multihop systems. We exploit this
formula to analyze an example scenario for a four-hop system where the per-hop
channels follow the four aforementioned fading models, i.e., the first channel
is Nakagami-m fading, the second is Weibull fading, and so on. Finally, we
provide simulation results to corroborate our analysis.

at the tips under simple models of site substitution. A central question is how
much sequence data is required to reconstruct a tree accurately? The answer
depends on the lengths of the branches (edges) of the tree, with very short and
very long edges requiring long sequences for accurate tree inference,
particularly when these branch lengths are arranged in certain ways. For
four-taxon trees, the sequence length question was settled for the case of a
rapid speciation event in the distant past. Here, we generalize this result and
show that the same sequence length requirement holds even when the speciation
event is recent, provided that at least one of the four taxa is distantly
related to the others. However, this equivalence disappears if a molecular
clock applies, since the length of the long outgroup edge becomes largely
irrelevant in the estimation of the tree topology for a recent (but not a deep)
divergence. We also show how our results can be extended to models in which
substitution rates vary across sites, and to settings where more than four taxa
are involved.

kind of problem has been rarely studied in control theory. In the specific case

action is on the horizontal component of the traction, and so it affects the
coefficients of the corresponding wave type equation, which will be time

to this case. For example at first sight it might seem that moment methods can
only be used in case of coefficients which are constant in time. Instead, we
shall see that moment methods can be extended to study controllability of a

study a controllability problem which is encountered in the solution of the

formed by low velocity collisions between asteroids of different mineralogies,

composition of 2008TC3 was a inherited from a time when the asteroid belt was
in a different dynamical state, most likely in the very early Solar System.
Because ureilites are fragments of a large, thermally metamorphosed asteroid,
this suggests that the phases of collisional erosion (the break-up of the

understand the characteristics of this radical. These bands are infrequently
encountered in astronomical sources but surprisingly were very prominent in the
spectra of two well-known, nova-like variables (V838 Mon and V4332 Sgr) thereby
motivating us to explore the physical conditions necessary for their
excitation. In this study, we present the detection of A-X bands in the spectra
of 13 out of 17 stars, selected on the basis of their J-K colors as potential
candidates for detection of these bands. The majority of the AlO detections are
in AGB stars viz. 9 OH/IR stars, 2 Mira variables and 2 bright infrared
sources. Our study shows that the A-X bands are fairly prevalent in sources
with low temperature and O-rich environments. Interesting variation in strength
of the AlO bands in one of the sources (IRAS 18530+0817) is reported and the
cause for this is examined. Possible applications of the present study are
discussed in terms of the role of AlO in alumina dust formation, the scope for
estimating the radioactive $^{26}$Al content in AGB stars from the A-X bands,
and providing possible targets for further mm/radio studies of AlO which has
recently been discovered at millimeter wavelengths.

providing a blue-print for a scalable spin-photon network. Furthermore, for

and partial exposure to complex open-ocean wave conditions makes diagnostic
wave modelling difficult.
  SWAN is set up on 500 m resolution and is nested in a 10 km version of WAM. A
model integration of more than one year is carried out to map the spatial
distribution of the wave field. The model correlates well with wave buoy
observations (0.96) but overestimates the wave height somewhat (18%, bias 0.29
m).
  To estimate wave height return values a much longer time series is required
and running SWAN for such a period is unrealistic in a REA setting. Instead we
establish a direction-dependent transfer function between an already existing
coarse open-ocean hindcast dataset and the high-resolution nested SWAN model.
Return values are estimated using ensemble estimates of two different
extreme-value distributions based on the full 52 years of statistically
downscaled hindcast data. We find good agreement between downscaled wave height
and wave buoy observations. The cost of generating the statistically downscaled
hindcast time series is negligible and can be redone for arbitrary locations
within the SWAN domain, although the sectors must be carefully chosen for each
new location.
  The method is found to be well suited to rapidly providing detailed wave
forecasts as well as hindcasts and return values estimates of partly sheltered
coastal regions.

separated by about 490 light years, revealed a merging event. This led us to
look for other evidences of galaxy collision and merging through the analysis
of the observed spectra in different frequency ranges. We found preshock
densities higher by a factor of about 10 in the NGC 3393 NLR than in other AGN
and patches of ionized matter beyond the observed NLR bulk. They can be
explained by compression and heating of the gas downstream of shock waves
created by collision. Metallicity in terms of the O/H relative abundance, is
about 0.78 solar. Mg/H depletion by a factor of about 3 compared with solar
cannot be explained by Mg trapping into dust grains, due to rather high shock
velocities. The low O/H and Mg/H abundances indicate mixing with external
matter during collision. Twice solar N/H is predicted by modelling the spectra
of high shock velocity clouds reached by a Ts =8.6 10^4 K black-body flux. This
suggests that Wolf-Rayet stars could be created by galaxy collision in the
central region.

adjusted automatically based on the average handoff blocking rate measured in

performance evaluation of the ACAS is done through simulation of nodes. The
result shows that the ACAS scheme outperforms the Static Channel Allocation

The proposed scheme achieves the optimal performance by maximizing the resource

spacetime, a spherically symmetric geometry that contains a naked singularity
and which matches smoothly with Schwarzschild metric beyond a finite radius.
This metric is a toy model which was shown recently to be the end state of
gravitational collapse. In the presence of the photon sphere gravitational
lensing signature of this spacetime is identical to that of Schwarzschild black
hole with infinitely many relativistic images and Einstein rings, all of them
located beyond a certain critical angle from optic axis and the inner
relativistic images all clumped together. However, in the absence of the photon
sphere, which is the case for a wide range of parameter values in this
spacetime, we show that we get finitely many relativistic images and Einstein
rings spaced reasonably apart from one another, some of which can be formed
inside the critical angle for the corresponding Schwarzschild black hole. This
study suggests that the observation of relativistic images and rings might, in
principle, allow us to unravel the existence of the naked singularity in the
absence of the photon sphere. The results obtained here are in contrast with
the earlier investigation on JNW naked singularities radial caustic was always
present in the absence of photon sphere, while it is absent in JMN geometry. We
also point out the practical difficulties that might be encountered in the
observation of the relativistic images and suggest that new dedicated

spectra taken before, during, and after its 2008 outburst. In quiescence and
outburst, the star presents many permitted emission lines, including typical
CTTS lines and numerous neutral and ionized metallic lines. During the
outburst, the number of emission lines increases to over a thousand, with
narrow plus broad component structure (NC+BC). The BC profile is highly
variable on short timescales (24-72h). An active chromosphere can explain the
metallic lines in quiescence and the outburst NC. The dynamics of the BC line
profiles suggest an origin in a hot, dense, non-axisymmetric, and non-uniform
accretion column that suffers velocity variations along the line-of-sight on
timescales of days. Assuming Keplerian rotation, the emitting region would be
located at ~0.1-0.2 AU, consistent with the inner disk rim, but the velocity
profiles of the lines reveal a combination of rotation and infall. Line ratios
of ions and neutrals can be reproduced with a temperature of T~6500 K for
electron densities of a few times 10$^{12}$cm$^{-3}$ in the line-emitting
region. The data confirm that the 2008 outburst was an episode of increased
accretion, albeit much stronger than previous EX Lupi and typical EXors
outbursts. The line profiles are consistent with the infall/rotation of a
non-axisymmetric structure that could be produced by clumpy accretion during
the outburst phase. A strong inner disk wind appears in the epochs of higher
accretion. The rapid recovery of the system after the outburst and the
similarity between the pre-outburst and post-outburst states suggest that the
accretion channels are similar during the whole period, and only the accretion
rate varies, providing a superb environment for studying the accretion
processes.

constitute an important class of multipartite states. Still, entanglement
properties of these states, in particular those with positive partial

have recently affirmatively answered the open question of existence of
four-qubit entangled symmetric states with positive partial transposition and
thoroughly characterized entanglement properties of such states [J. Tura et
al., Phys. Rev. A 85, 060302(R) (2012)] With the present contribution we
continue on characterizing PPT entangled symmetric states. On the one hand, we
present all the results of our previous work in a detailed way. On the other
hand, we generalize them to systems consisting of arbitrary number of qubits.
In particular, we provide criteria for separability of such states formulated
in terms of their ranks. Interestingly, for most of the cases, the symmetric
states are either separable or typically separable. Then, edge states in these
systems are studied, showing in particular that to characterize generic PPT
entangled states with four and five qubits, it is enough to study only those
that assume few (respectively, two and three) specific configurations of ranks.
Finally, we numerically search for extremal PPT entangled states in such
systems consisting of up to 23 qubits. One can clearly notice regularity behind
the ranks of such extremal states, and, in particular, for systems composed of
odd number of qubits we find a single configuration of ranks for which there
are extremal states.

topologically protected electronic surface states. Potential applications of
the surface states in low dissipation electronic devices have motivated efforts
to create nanoscale samples with large surface-to-volume ratios and highly
controlled stoichiometry. Se vacancies in Bi2Se3 give rise to bulk conduction,
which masks the transport properties of the surface states. We have therefore
developed a new route for the synthesis of topological insulator nanostructures
using metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). MOCVD allows for control
of the Se/Bi flux ratio during growth. With the aim of rational growth, we vary
the Se/Bi flux ratio, growth time, and substrate temperature, and observe
morphological changes which indicate a growth regime in which nanoribbon
formation is limited by the Bi precursor mass-flow. MOCVD growth of Bi2Se3
nanostructures occurs via a distinct growth mechanism that is nucleated by gold
nanoparticles at the base of the nanowire. By tuning the reaction conditions,
we obtain either single-crystalline ribbons up to 10 microns long or thin
micron-sized platelets.

of the most striking features of a regular sub-riemannian space is that it has
at any point a metric tangent space with the algebraic structure of a Carnot
group, hence a homogeneous Lie group. Siebert characterizes homogeneous Lie
groups as locally compact groups admitting a contracting and continuous
one-parameter group of automorphisms. Siebert result has not a metric

  In these notes I show that sub-riemannian geometry may be described by about
12 axioms, without using any a priori given differential structure, but using
dilation structures instead. Dilation structures bring forth the other
intrinsic ingredient, namely the dilations, thus blending Gromov metric point

exhibiting a quantum spin Hall effect poses fundamental challenges in terms of
phenomenological characterization and microscopic classification. In the limit
of infinite coupling U at half filling, the spin model Hamiltonians resulting
from a strong coupling expansion show various forms of magnetic ordering
phenomena depending on the underlying spin-orbit coupling terms. We investigate
the infinite U limit of the Kane-Mele Hubbard model with z-axis intrinsic
spin-orbit coupling as well as its generalization to a generically
multi-directional spin orbit term which has been claimed to account for the
physical scenario in monolayer Na2IrO3. We find that the axial spin symmetry
which is kept in the former but broken in the latter has a fundamental impact
on the magnetic phase diagram as we vary the spin orbit coupling strength.
While the Kane-Mele spin model shows a continuous evolution from conventional
honeycomb Neel to XY antiferromagnetism which avoids the frustration imposed by
the increased spin-orbit coupling, the multi-directional spin-orbit term
induces a commensurate to incommensurate transition at intermediate coupling
strength, and yields a complex spiral state with a 72 site unit cell in the
limit of infinite spin-orbit coupling. From our findings, we conjecture that in
the case of broken axial spin symmetry there is a large propensity for an
additional phase at sufficiently large spin-orbit coupling and intermediate U.

  After recalling in the introduction the early stages of the quantum

geometry, we survey in Sect. 2.2 the so called prequantization thus preparing
the ground for an outline of geometric quantization (Sect. 2.3). In Sect. 3 we
apply the general theory to the study of basic examples of quantization of
Kaehler manifolds. In Sect. 4 we review the Weyl and Wigner maps and the work
of Groenewold and Moyal that laid the foundations of quantum mechanics in phase
space, ending with a brief survey of the modern development of deformation
quantization. Sect. 5 provides a review of second quantization and its
mathematical interpretation. We point out that the treatment of
(nonrelativistic) bound states requires going beyond the neat mathematical
formalization of the concept of second quantization. An appendix is devoted to
Pascual Jordan, the least known among the creators of quantum mechanics and the
chief architect of the ""theory of quantized matter waves"".

with symmetry, which have symmetry protected gapless edge states around a
gapped bulk. Recently, we proposed a systematic construction of SPT phases in
interacting bosonic systems, however it is not very clear what is the form of
the low energy excitations on the gapless edge. In this paper, we answer this
question for two dimensional bosonic SPT phases with Z_N and U(1) symmetry. We
find that while the low energy modes of the gapless edges are non-chiral,
symmetry acts on them in a chiral way, i.e. acts on the right movers and the
left movers differently. This special realization of symmetry protects the
gaplessness of the otherwise unstable edge states by prohibiting a direct
scattering between the left and right movers. Moreover, understanding of the
low energy effective theory leads to experimental predictions about the SPT
phases. In particular, we find that all the 2D U(1) SPT phases have even
integer quantized Hall conductance.

phase space that restrict classical transport. Quantum mechanically the
transport is suppressed if Planck's constant h is large compared to the
classical flux, h >> Phi, such that wave packets and states are localized. In
contrast, classical transport is mimicked for h << Phi. Designing a quantum map
with an isolated partial barrier of controllable flux Phi is the key to
investigating the transition from this form of quantum localization to
mimicking classical transport. It is observed that quantum transport follows a
universal transition curve as a function of the expected scaling parameter
Phi/h. We find this curve to be symmetric to Phi/h=1, having a width of two
orders of magnitude in Phi/h, and exhibiting no quantized steps. We establish
the relevance of local coupling, improving on previous random matrix models
relying on global coupling. It turns out that a phenomenological 2x2-model
gives an accurate analytical description of the transition curve.

string states at strong coupling in N=4 super Yang-Mills. We treat the states
as point-like as they come in from the boundary but as strings in the
interaction region in the bulk. The interaction position is determined by
saddle point, which is equivalent to conservation of the canonical momentum for
the interacting particles, and leads to conservation of their conformal
charges. We further show that for large dimensions the rms size of the
interaction region is small compared to the radius of curvature of the AdS
space, but still large compared to the string Compton wave-length. Hence, one
can approximate the string vertex operators as flat-space vertex operators with
a definite momentum, which depends on the conformal and R-charges of the
operator. We then argue that the string vertex operator dual to a primary
operator is chosen by satisfying a twisted version of Q^L=Q^R, up to spurious
terms. This leads to a unique choice for a scalar vertex operator with the
appropriate charges at the first massive level. We then comment on some
features of the corresponding three-point functions, including the application
of these results to Konishi operators.

of concurrency that was named higher dimensional automata (HDAs) by Pratt. In
particular we investigate modal logics for such models and their expressive
power in terms of the bisimulation that can be captured. The geometric model of
concurrency is interesting from two main reasons: its generality and
expressiveness, and the natural way in which autoconcurrency and action
refinement are captured. Logics for this model, though, are not well
investigated, where a simple, yet adequate, modal logic over HDAs was only
recently introduced. As this modal logic, with two existential modalities,
during and after, captures only split bisimulation, which is rather low in the
spectrum of van Glabbeek and Vaandrager, the immediate question was what small
extension of this logic could capture the more fine-grained hereditary history
preserving bisimulation (hh)? In response, the work in this paper provides
several insights. One is the fact that the geometrical aspect of HDAs makes it
possible to use for capturing the hh-bisimulation, a standard modal logic that
does not employ event variables, opposed to the two logics (over less
expressive models) that we compare with. The logic that we investigate here
uses standard past modalities and extends the previously introduced logic
(called HDML) that had only forward, action-labelled, modalities. Besides, we
try to understand better the above issues by introducing a related model that

f-electron spins and those of itinerant electrons leads to the development of
low-energy fermionic excitations with a heavy effective mass. These excitations
are fundamental to the appearance of unconventional superconductivity and
non-Fermi-liquid behaviour observed in actinide- and lanthanide-based
compounds. Here we use spectroscopic mapping with the scanning tunnelling
microscope to detect the emergence of heavy excitations with lowering of
temperature in a prototypical family of cerium-based heavy-fermion compounds.
We demonstrate the sensitivity of the tunnelling process to the composite
nature of these heavy quasiparticles, which arises from quantum entanglement of
itinerant conduction and f electrons. Scattering and interference of the
composite quasiparticles is used to resolve their energy-momentum structure and
to extract their mass enhancement, which develops with decreasing temperature.
The lifetime of the emergent heavy quasiparticles reveals signatures of
enhanced scattering and their spectral lineshape shows evidence of
energy-temperature scaling. These findings demonstrate that proximity to a
quantum critical point results in critical damping of the emergent heavy
excitation of our Kondo lattice system.

shown that there is a constant $b$ such that ${\bf f}$ a.s. takes at most $b$

for each $t > 0$, ${\bf f}$ a.s. takes at most $td$ values.
  Determining $|{\cal F}|$ is equivalent both to counting the number of rank
functions on the Boolean lattice $2^{[d]}$ (functions $f \colon 2^{[d]}

to interpret and explain the large variability of colors, hence surface
composition. Are the colors mainly primordial and directly related to the
formation region, or are they the result of surface evolution processes? To
date, no mechanism has been found that successfully explains why Centaurs,
which are escapees from the Kuiper Belt, exhibit two distinct color groups,
whereas KBOs do not. In this letter, we readdress this issue using a carefully

phenomenon, common to both Centaurs and small KBOs, i.e. independent of
dynamical classification. Further, we find that large KBOs also exhibit a
bimodal behavior of surface colors, albeit distinct from the small objects and
strongly dependent on the `Haumea collisional family' objects. When plotted in
B-R, H({\alpha}) space, the colors of Centaurs and KBOs display a peculiar N

Structures in debris disks induced by planetdisk interaction are

debris disks induced by planet-disk interaction. Methods. The observability of
debris disks with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is
studied on the basis of a simple analytical disk model. Furthermore, N-body
simulations are used to model the spatial dust distribution in debris disks
under the influence of planet-disk interaction. Images at optical scattered
light to millimeter thermal re-emission are computed. Available information
about the expected capabilities of ALMA and the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) are used to investigate the observability of characteristic disk
structures through spatially resolved imaging. Results. Planet-disk interaction
can result in prominent structures. This provides the opportunity of detecting
and characterizing extrasolar planets in a range of masses and radial distances
from the star that is not accessible to other techniques. Facilities that will
be available in the near future are shown to provide the capabilities to
spatially resolve and characterize structures in debris disks. Limitations are
revealed and suggestions for possible instrument setups and observing
strategies are given. In particular, ALMA is limited by its sensitivity to
surface brightness, which requires a trade-off between sensitivity and spatial
resolution. Space-based midinfrared observations will be able to detect and
spatially resolve regions in debris disks even at a distance of several tens of
AU from the star, where the emission from debris disks in this wavelength range
is expected to be low. [Abridged]

general non-minimal kinetic couplings to itself and to the curvature. We study
the cosmological dynamics of the equation of state in this setup. The coupling
terms have the form $\xi_{1} R f(\phi)\partial_{\mu}\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi$ and
$\xi_{2} R_{\mu\nu}f(\phi)\partial^{\mu}\phi\partial^{\nu}\phi$ where $\xi_{1}$
and $\xi_{2}$ are coupling parameters and their dimensions depend on the type
of function $f(\phi)$. We obtain the conditions required for phantom divide
crossing and show numerically that a cosmological model with general
non-minimal derivative coupling to the scalar and Ricci curvatures can realize
such a crossing.

bioengineered and biomimetic solar energy and light detection technologies.
Recent evidence suggests some individual light harvesting protein complexes
(LHCs) and LHC subunits efficiently transfer excitons towards chemical reaction
centers (RCs) via an interplay between excitonic quantum coherence, resonant
protein vibrations, and thermal decoherence. The role of coherence in vivo is
unclear however, where excitons are transferred through multi-LHC/RC aggregates
over distances typically large compared with intra-LHC scales. Here we assess
the possibility of long-range coherent transfer in a simple chromophore network
with disordered site and transfer coupling energies. Through renormalization we
find that, surprisingly, decoherence is diminished at larger scales, and
long-range coherence is facilitated by chromophoric clustering. Conversely,
static disorder in the site energies grows with length scale, forcing
localization. Our results suggest sustained coherent exciton transfer may be
possible over distances large compared with nearest-neighbour (n-n) chromophore
separations, at physiological temperatures, in a clustered network with small
static disorder. This may support findings suggesting long-range coherence in
algal chloroplasts, and provides a framework for engineering large chromophore
or quantum dot high-temperature exciton transfer networks.

the Hamiltonian formulation of radiative transfer as the semiclassical limit of

reduction yields the traditional description over the space of ""positions and

oscillations of $\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau$ neutrinos and obtained expressions
for angle mixings and lengths of oscillations in dependence on components of
the nondiagonal mass matrix. Then analysis of these obtained results was done
by using modern experimental data on neutrino oscillations. It has been shown
that in this approach the lengths of neutrino oscillations $L_{2 3}$ and $L_{1
3}$ are not compulsory to be equal. It means that the angle mixing $\theta_{1
3}$ can be not very small, i.e., $L_{1 3}$ can be larger than $L_{2 3}$.
  In the conventional approach $L_{1 3} \approx L_{2 3}$ ($L_{1 2} \gg L_{2
3}$) and angle mixing of $\theta_{1 3}$ is very small. Angle mixings $\theta_{2
3}, \theta_{1 2}$ are big. Then there ia a problem: why is mixing angle
$\theta_{1 3}$ so small? A natural solution of the problem is to suppose that
$(m_2^2 - m_1^2) \neq (m_3^2 - m_1^2) - (m_3^2 - m_2^2)$, then $L_{1 3} > L_{2
3}$. It will be realized if there are 4 neutrino oscillations instead of 3
neutrino oscillations. Then the value of $\theta_{1 3}$ is necessary to search
at distances more than $L_{2 3}$.

networks is an evolving direction in personalized medicine. Among various
constraints in designing such a system, three important constraints are energy
consumption, data compression, and device cost. Conventional data compression
methodologies, although effective in data compression, consumes significant
energy and cannot reduce device cost. Compressed sensing (CS), as an emerging
data compression methodology, is promising in catering to these constraints.
However, EEG is non-sparse in the time domain and also non-sparse in
transformed domains (such as the wavelet domain). Therefore, it is extremely
difficult for current CS algorithms to recover EEG with the quality that
satisfies the requirements of clinical diagnosis and engineering applications.
Recently, Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) was proposed as a new method to
the CS problem. This study introduces the technique to the telemonitoring of
EEG. Experimental results show that its recovery quality is better than
state-of-the-art CS algorithms, and sufficient for practical use. These results
suggest that BSBL is very promising for telemonitoring of EEG and other
non-sparse physiological signals.

which instead of the Ricci scalar $R$, one uses the torsion scalar $T$ for the
Lagrangian density. Recently teleparallel dark energy has been proposed by Geng
et al. in (Geng et al., 2011). They have added quintessence scalar field,
allowing also a non-minimal coupling with gravity in the Lagrangian of
teleparallel gravity and found that such a non-minimally coupled quintessence
theory has a richer structure than the same one in the frame work of general
relativity. In the present work we are interested in tachyonic teleparallel
dark energy in which scalar field is responsible for dark energy in the frame
work of torsion gravity. We find that such a non-minimally coupled tachyon
gravity can realize the crossing of the phantom divide line for the effective
equation of state. Using the numerical calculations we display such a behavior
of the model explicitly.

in multi-armed bandits (MAB) models. Each player can pick among multiple arms.
When a player picks an arm, it gets a reward. We consider both i.i.d. reward
model and Markovian reward model. In the i.i.d. model each arm is modelled as
an i.i.d. process with an unknown distribution with an unknown mean. In the
Markovian model, each arm is modelled as a finite, irreducible, aperiodic and
reversible Markov chain with an unknown probability transition matrix and
stationary distribution. The arms give different rewards to different players.
If two players pick the same arm, there is a ""collision"", and neither of them
get any reward. There is no dedicated control channel for coordination or
communication among the players. Any other communication between the users is
costly and will add to the regret. We propose an online index-based distributed
learning policy called ${\tt dUCB_4}$ algorithm that trades off
\textit{exploration v. exploitation} in the right way, and achieves expected
regret that grows at most as near-$O(\log^2 T)$. The motivation comes from
opportunistic spectrum access by multiple secondary users in cognitive radio
networks wherein they must pick among various wireless channels that look
different to different users. This is the first distributed learning algorithm
for multi-player MABs to the best of our knowledge.
