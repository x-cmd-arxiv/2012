scattering are essentially restricted to horizontally stratified or spherically
symmetric geometries, with results also available for certain waveguide
geometries. However, there are a number of new problems in remote sensing and
classification of buried compact metallic targets that require a wider class of
solutions that, if not exact, at least support rapid numerical evaluation.
Here, the exact Chandrasekhar theory of the electrostatics of heterogeneously
charged \emph{ellipsoids} is used to develop a ""mean field"" perturbation theory
of low frequency electrodynamics of highly conducting ellipsoidal targets, in
insulating or weakly conducting backgrounds. The theory is based formally on an
expansion in the parameter $\eta_s = L_s/\delta_s(\omega)$, where $L_s$ is the
characteristic linear size of the scatterer and $\delta_s(\omega)$ is the
electromagnetic skin depth. The theory is then extended to a numerically
efficient description of the intermediate-to-late-time dynamics following an
excitation pulse. As verified via comparisons with experimental data taken
using artificial spheroidal targets, when combined with a previously developed
theory of the high frequency, early-time regime, these results serve to cover
the entire dynamic range encountered in typical measurements.

algorithms: the Pearl's belief propagation (BP) algorithm applied to Bayesian
networks without loops (i.e. polytree) and the Loopy belief propagation (LBP)
algorithm (inspired from the BP) which is applied to networks containing
undirected cycles. It is known that the BP algorithm, applied to Bayesian
networks with loops, gives incorrect numerical results i.e. incorrect posterior
probabilities. Murphy and al. [7] find that the LBP algorithm converges on
several networks and when this occurs, LBP gives a good approximation of the
exact posterior probabilities. However this algorithm presents an oscillatory
behaviour when it is applied to QMR (Quick Medical Reference) network [15].
This phenomenon prevents the LBP algorithm from converging towards a good
approximation of posterior probabilities. We believe that the translation of
the inference computation problem from the probabilistic framework to the
possibilistic framework will allow performance improvement of LBP algorithm. We
hope that an adaptation of this algorithm to a possibilistic causal network
will show an improvement of the convergence of LBP.

the proportional hazards model and the proportional odds model as sub-models,
and accommodates crossing survival curves. The model leaves the baseline hazard
unspecified and the two model parameters can be interpreted as the short-term

pseudo score approach. Although extension to accommodate covariates was
mentioned, no formal procedures have been provided or proved. Furthermore, the
pseudo score approach may not be asymptotically efficient. We study the
extension of the short-term and long-term hazard ratio model of Yang and

develop efficient likelihood-based estimation and inference procedures. The
nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators are shown to be consistent,
asymptotically normal, and asymptotically efficient. Extensive simulation

since 1961 (Chow, Tannenbaum) that the (exact values of the) Chow parameters of
any linear threshold function $f$ uniquely specify $f$ within the space of all
Boolean functions, but until recently (O'Donnell and Servedio) nothing was
known about efficient algorithms for \emph{reconstructing} $f$ (exactly or
approximately) from exact or approximate values of its Chow parameters. We
refer to this reconstruction problem as the \emph{Chow Parameters Problem.}
  Our main result is a new algorithm for the Chow Parameters Problem which,
given (sufficiently accurate approximations to) the Chow parameters of any
linear threshold function $f$, runs in time $\tilde{O}(n^2)\cdot
(1/\eps)^{O(\log^2(1/\eps))}$ and with high probability outputs a
representation of an LTF $f'$ that is $\eps$-close to $f$. The only previous
algorithm (O'Donnell and Servedio) had running time $\poly(n) \cdot

  As a byproduct of our approach, we show that for any linear threshold
function $f$ over $\{-1,1\}^n$, there is a linear threshold function $f'$ which
is $\eps$-close to $f$ and has all weights that are integers at most $\sqrt{n}
\cdot (1/\eps)^{O(\log^2(1/\eps))}$. This significantly improves the best
previous result of Diakonikolas and Servedio which gave a $\poly(n) \cdot
2^{\tilde{O}(1/\eps^{2/3})}$ weight bound, and is close to the known lower
bound of $\max\{\sqrt{n},$ $(1/\eps)^{\Omega(\log \log (1/\eps))}\}$ (Goldberg,

applications ranging from sensor networks and peer-to-peer networks to mobile

gossip algorithms. In this work we study finite-time convergence of
deterministic gossiping. We show that there exists a symmetric gossip algorithm
that converges in finite time if and only if the number of network nodes is a
power of two, while there always exists an asymmetric gossip algorithm with
finite-time convergence, independent of the number of nodes. For $n=2^m$ nodes,
we prove that a fastest convergence can be reached in $nm=n\log_2 n$ node
updates via symmetric gossiping. On the other hand, under asymmetric gossip
among $n=2^m+r$ nodes with $0\leq r<2^m$, it takes at least $mn+2r$ node
updates for achieving finite-time convergence. It is also shown that the
existence of finite-time convergent gossiping often imposes strong structural
requirements on the underlying interaction graph. Finally, we apply our results
to gossip algorithms in quantum networks, where the goal is to control the
state of a quantum system via pairwise interactions. We show that finite-time

the mean first passage time (MFPT) is a valid characteristic of the first

of the actual behaviour even in bounded domains, in which all moments of the

emission measures in flaring active region loops. To date, observations from
the X-Ray Sensor (XRS) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellite (GOES) have been used to derive these properties, but have been
limited by a number of factors, including the lack of a consistent background
subtraction method capable of being automatically applied to large numbers of
flares. In this paper, we describe an automated temperature and emission
measure-based background subtraction method (TEBBS), which builds on the
methods of Bornmann (1990). Our algorithm ensures that the derived temperature
is always greater than the instrumental limit and the pre-flare background
temperature, and that the temperature and emission measure are increasing
during the flare rise phase. Additionally, TEBBS utilizes the improved
estimates of GOES temperatures and emission measures from White et al. (2005).
TEBBS was successfully applied to over 50,000 solar flares occurring over
nearly three solar cycles (1980-2007), and used to create an extensive catalog
of the solar flare thermal properties. We confirm that the peak emission
measure and total radiative losses scale with background subtracted GOES X-ray
flux as power-laws, while the peak temperature scales logarithmically. As
expected, the peak emission measure shows an increasing trend with peak
temperature, although the total radiative losses do not. While these results
are comparable to previous studies, we find that flares of a given GOES class
have lower peak temperatures and higher peak emission measures than previously
reported. The resulting TEBBS database of thermal flare plasma properties is
publicly available on Solar Monitor (www.solarmonitor.org/TEBBS/) and will be
available on Heliophysics Integrated Observatory (www.helio-vo.eu).

sufficient) condition for the origin and early evolution of life. Although the
idea of autocatalytic sets was already conceived of many years ago, only
recently have they gained more interest, following advances in creating them
experimentally in the laboratory. In our own work, we have studied
autocatalytic sets extensively from a computational and theoretical point of
view.
  Results: We present results from an initial study of the dynamics of
self-sustaining autocatalytic sets (RAFs). In particular, simulations of
molecular flow on autocatalytic sets are performed, to illustrate the kinds of
dynamics that can occur. Next, we present an extension of our (previously
introduced) algorithm for finding autocatalytic sets in general reaction
networks, which can also handle inhibition. We show that in this case detecting
autocatalytic sets is fixed parameter tractable. Finally, we formulate a
generalized version of the algorithm that can also be applied outside the
context of chemistry and origin of life, which we illustrate with a toy example
from economics.
  Conclusions: Having shown theoretically (in previous work) that autocatalytic
sets are highly likely to exist, we conclude here that also in terms of
dynamics such sets are viable and outcompete non-autocatalytic sets.
Furthermore, our dynamical results confirm arguments made earlier about how
autocatalytic subsets can enable their own growth or give rise to other such
subsets coming into existence. Finally, our algorithmic extension and
generalization show that more realistic scenarios (e.g., including inhibition)
can also be dealt with within our framework, and that it can even be applied to
areas outside of chemistry, such as economics.

rare. We establish magnitude and separation limits for which companions can be
ruled out for each star in the sample, and then perform a comprehensive
sensitivity and completeness analysis for the subsample of 138 M dwarfs in 126

companions to M dwarfs in the separation range of 5 to 70 AU, and
2.3_{-0.7}^{+5.0}% for L and T companions to M dwarfs in the separation range

we argue that the so-called ""brown dwarf desert"" extends to binary systems with
low mass primaries and is largely independent of primary mass, mass ratio, and
separations. While focusing on companion properties, we discuss how the
qualitative agreement between observed companion mass functions and initial

Data' when the number of variables is massive. Commonly used independence
screening methods are based on marginal correlations or variations of it. In
many applications, researchers often have some prior knowledge that a certain
set of variables is related to the response. In such a situation, a natural
assessment on the relative importance of the other predictors is the
conditional contributions of the individual predictors in presence of the known
set of variables. This results in conditional sure independence screening
(CSIS). Conditioning helps for reducing the false positive and the false
negative rates in the variable selection process. In this paper, we propose and
study CSIS in the context of generalized linear models. For
ultrahigh-dimensional statistical problems, we give conditions under which sure
screening is possible and derive an upper bound on the number of selected
variables. We also spell out the situation under which CSIS yields model
selection consistency. Moreover, we provide two data-driven methods to select
the thresholding parameter of conditional screening. The utility of the
procedure is illustrated by simulation studies and analysis of two real data
sets.

explosive percolation. A recent proof demonstrates that a large class of
explosive percolation-type models does not, in fact, exhibit a discontinuous
transition[O. Riordan and L. Warnke, Science, {\bf 333}, 322 (2011)]. We, on
the other hand, discuss several correlated percolation models, the $k$-core
model on random graphs, and the spiral and counter-balance models in
two-dimensions, all exhibiting discontinuous transitions in an effort to
identify the needed ingredients for such a transition. We then construct
mixtures of these models to interpolate between a continuous transition and a
discontinuous transition to search for a tricritical point. Using a powerful
rate equation approach, we demonstrate that a mixture of $k=2$-core and
$k=3$-core vertices on the random graph exhibits a tricritical point. However,
for a mixture of $k$-core and counter-balance vertices, heuristic arguments and
numerics suggest that there is a line of continuous transitions as the fraction
of counter-balance vertices is increased from zero with the line ending at a
discontinuous transition only when all vertices are counter-balance. Our
results may have potential implications for glassy systems and a recent

the second-order perturbation theory we show that the coupling to
spin-polarized electrode results in an effective exchange field $B_{\rm eff}$
and an effective magnetic anisotropy $D_{\rm eff}$. Second, we confirm these
findings by using the numerical renormalization group method, which is employed
to study the dependence of the quantum dot spectral functions, as well as
quantum dot spin, on various parameters of the system. We show that the
underscreened Kondo effect is generally suppressed due to the presence of
effective exchange field and can be restored by tuning the anisotropy constant,
when $|D_{\rm eff}| = |B_{\rm eff}|$. The Kondo effect can also be restored by
sweeping an external magnetic field, and the restoration occurs twice in a
single sweep. From the distance between the restored Kondo resonances one can
extract the information about both the exchange field and the effective
anisotropy. Finally, we calculate the temperature dependence of linear
conductance for the parameters where the Kondo effect is restored and show that
the restored Kondo resonances display a universal scaling of $S=1/2$ Kondo

galaxies at all redshifts and their resulting stellar populations. Here we
present three adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamics simulations that
illustrate the impact of momentum transfer from ionising radiation to the
absorbing gas on star formation in high-redshift dwarf galaxies. Momentum
transfer is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation with a ray
tracing algorithm that is adaptive in spatial and angular coordinates. We find
that momentum input partially affects star formation by increasing the
turbulent support to a three-dimensional rms velocity equal to the circular
velocity of early haloes. Compared to a calculation that neglects radiation
pressure, the star formation rate is decreased by a factor of five to 1.8 x
10^{-2} Msun/yr in a dwarf galaxy with a dark matter and stellar mass of 2.0 x
10^8 and 4.5 x 10^5 solar masses, respectively, when radiation pressure is
included. Its mean metallicity of 10^{-2.1} Z_sun is consistent with the
observed dwarf galaxy luminosity-metallicity relation. However, what one may
naively expect from the calculation without radiation pressure, the central
region of the galaxy overcools and produces a compact, metal-rich stellar
population with an average metallicity of 0.3 Z_sun, indicative of an incorrect
physical recipe. In addition to photo-heating in HII regions, radiation
pressure further drives dense gas from star forming regions, so supernovae
feedback occurs in a warmer and more diffuse medium, launching metal-rich
outflows. Capturing this aspect and a temporal separation between the start of
radiative and supernova feedback are numerically important in the modeling of
galaxies to avoid the ""overcooling problem"". We estimate that dust in early
low-mass galaxies is unlikely to aid in momentum transfer from radiation to the
gas.

been cited as evidence for distinct formation mechanisms for brown dwarfs and
stars. In this paper, we explore the implications of the minimal hypothesis
that brown dwarfs in binary systems originate via the same fundamental
fragmentation mechanism as stars, within isolated, turbulent giant molecular
cloud cores. We demonstrate analytically that the scaling of specific angular
momentum with turbulent core mass naturally gives rise to the brown dwarf
desert, as well as wide brown-dwarf binary systems. Further, we show that the
turbulent core fragmentation model also naturally predicts that very low-mass
(VLM) binary and BD/BD systems are more tightly-bound than stellar systems. In
addition, in order to capture the stochastic variation intrinsic to turbulence,
we generate $10^4$ model turbulent cores with synthetic turbulent velocity
fields to show that the turbulent fragmentation model accommodates a small
fraction of binary brown dwarfs with wide separations, similar to observations.
Indeed, the picture which emerges from the turbulent fragmentation model is
that a single fragmentation mechanism may largely shape both stellar and brown
dwarf binary distributions during formation.

proposed to solve different anomalies observed in short-baseline oscillation
experiments. These neutrinos can also be produced by oscillations of the active
neutrinos in the early universe, leaving possible traces on different
cosmological observables. Here we perform an updated study of the neutrino
kinetic equations in (3+1) and (2+1) oscillation schemes, dynamically evolving
primordial asymmetries of active neutrinos and taking into account for the
first time CP-violation effects. In the absence of neutrino asymmetries,
eV-mass scale sterile neutrinos would be completely thermalized creating a
tension with respect to the CMB, LSS and BBN data. In the past literature,
active neutrino asymmetries have been invoked as a way to inhibit the sterile
neutrino production via the in-medium suppression of the sterile-active mixing
angle. However, neutrino asymmetries also permit a resonant sterile neutrino
production. We find that if the active species have equal asymmetries L, a
value |L|=10^{-3} is required to start suppressing the resonant sterile
production, roughly an order of magnitude larger than what previously expected.
When active species have opposite asymmetries the sterile abundance is further
enhanced, requiring an even larger |L|\simeq 10^{-2} to start suppressing their
production. In the latter case, CP-violation (naturally expected) further
exacerbates the phenomenon. Some consequences for cosmological observables are
briefly discussed: for example, it is likely that moderate suppressions of the
sterile species production are associated with significant spectral distortions
of the active neutrino species, with potentially interesting phenomenological
consequences especially for BBN.

explains the puzzling upturn in the mass-concentration relation reported in

against applying simple equilibrium models to describe the structure of rare,

show that major mergers are capable of triggering massive starbursts and
quasars. However, observations by the Herschel Space Observatory suggest that,
at least at high redshift, there may not always be a simple causal connection
between ULIRGs and mergers. Here, we combine an evolving merger-triggered AGN
luminosity function with a merger-triggered starburst model to calculate the
maximum contribution of major mergers to the ULIRG population. We find that
major mergers can account for the entire local population of ULIRGs hosting AGN
and ~25% of the total local ULIRG luminosity density. By z ~ 1, major mergers
can no longer account for the luminosity density of ULIRGs hosting AGN and
contribute \lesssim 12% of the total ULIRG luminosity density. This drop is
likely due to high redshift galaxies being more gas rich and therefore able to
achieve high star formation rates through secular evolution. Additionally, we
find that major mergers can account for the local population of warm ULIRGs.
This suggests that selecting high redshift warm ULIRGs will allow for the
identification of high redshift merger-triggered ULIRGs. As major mergers are
likely to trigger very highly obscured AGN, a significant fraction of the high
redshift warm ULIRG population may host Compton thick AGN.

the important cosmological role that these supernovae play. Kepler's Supernova
Remnant, the result of a Type Ia supernova, shows evidence for an interaction
with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), suggesting a single-degenerate
progenitor system. We present 7.5-38 $\mu$m infrared (IR) spectra of the
remnant, obtained with the {\it Spitzer Space Telescope}, dominated by emission
from warm dust. Broad spectral features at 10 and 18 $\mu$m, consistent with
various silicate particles, are seen throughout. These silicates were likely
formed in the stellar outflow from the progenitor system during the AGB stage
of evolution, and imply an oxygen-rich chemistry. In addition to silicate dust,
a second component, possibly carbonaceous dust, is necessary to account for the
short-wavelength IRS and IRAC data. This could imply a mixed chemistry in the
atmosphere of the progenitor system. However, non-spherical metallic iron
inclusions within silicate grains provide an alternative solution. Models of
collisionally-heated dust emission from fast shocks ($>$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$)
propagating into the CSM can reproduce the majority of the emission associated
with non-radiative filaments, where dust temperatures are $\sim 80-100$ K, but
fail to account for the highest temperatures detected, in excess of 150 K. We
find that slower shocks (a few hundred km s$^{-1}$) into moderate density
material ($n_{0} \sim 50-250$ cm$^{-3}$) are the only viable source of heating
for this hottest dust. We confirm the finding of an overall density gradient,
with densities in the north being an order of magnitude greater than those in

fractional topological insulators by combining the available experimental
information on potential host materials and the fundamental principles of
quantum field theory. This Lagrangian is a Landau-Ginzburg theory of spinor
fields, enhanced by a topological term that implements a state-dependent
fractional statistics of excitations whenever both particles and vortices are
incompressible. The spin-orbit coupling is captured by an external static SU(2)
gauge field. The presence of spin conservation or emergent U(1) symmetries
would reduce the topological term to the Chern-Simons effective theory tailored
to the ensuing quantum Hall state. However, the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in
solid-state materials does not conserve spin. We predict that it can
nevertheless produce incompressible quantum liquids with topological order but
without a quantized Hall conductivity. We discuss two examples of such liquids
whose description requires a generalization of the Chern-Simons theory. One is
an Abelian Laughlin-like state, while the other has a new kind of non-Abelian
many-body entanglement. Their quasiparticles exhibit fractional spin-dependent
exchange statistics, and have fractional quantum numbers derived from the
electron's charge and spin according to their transformations under
time-reversal. In addition to conventional phases of matter, the proposed
topological Lagrangian can capture a broad class of hierarchical Abelian and
non-Abelian topological states, involving particles with arbitrary spin or
general emergent SU(N) charges.

a result of less scattering by objects in the Galactic disk during the shorter
lifetime of their more massive progenitors. A direct result of this is that
white dwarfs with high mass have a reduced scale height, and hence their local
density is enhanced over their less massive counterparts. In addition, we have
investigated whether the kinematics of the highest mass white dwarfs

their arguments is important in understanding how public opinion is formed. In
this paper, we adopt the position that it is time for more
computationally-oriented research on problems involving framing. In the
interests of furthering that goal, we propose the following specific,
interesting and, we believe, relatively accessible question: In the controversy
regarding the use of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture, do
pro- and anti-GMO articles differ in whether they choose to adopt a
""scientific"" tone?
  Prior work on the rhetoric and sociology of science suggests that hedging may
distinguish popular-science text from text written by professional scientists
for their colleagues. We propose a detailed approach to studying whether hedge
detection can be used to understanding scientific framing in the GMO debates,
and provide corpora to facilitate this study. Some of our preliminary analyses
suggest that hedges occur less frequently in scientific discourse than in
popular text, a finding that contradicts prior assertions in the literature. We
hope that our initial work and data will encourage others to pursue this
promising line of inquiry.

quantum mechanics. It starts with a historical review of the difficulties found
by Louis de Broglie, David Bohm, and John S. Bell to convince the scientific
community about the validity and utility of Bohmian mechanics. Then, a formal
explanation of Bohmian mechanics for nonrelativistic, single-particle quantum
systems is presented. The generalization to many-particle systems, where the
exchange interaction and the spin play an important role, is also presented.
After that, the measurement process in Bohmian mechanics is discussed. It is
emphasized that Bohmian mechanics exactly reproduces the mean value and
temporal and spatial correlations obtained from the standard, that is the
Copenhagen or orthodox, formulation. The ontological characteristics of Bohmian
mechanics provide a description of measurements as another type of interaction
without the need for introducing the wave function collapse. Several solved
problems are presented at the end of the chapter, giving additional
mathematical support to some particular issues. A detailed description of
computational algorithms to obtain Bohmian trajectories from the numerical
solution of the Schrodinger or the Hamilton-Jacobi equations are presented in
an appendix. The motivation of this chapter is twofold: first, as a didactic
introduction to Bohmian formalism, which is used in the subsequent chapters,

preferentially escape during collapse without the energy downscattering on
electrons required to enhance neutrino escape and deleptonization for the
models with IPA nuclear EC. During shock breakout the primary influence on the
emergent neutrinos arises from NIS on electrons. For the accretion phase,
non-isoenergetic scattering on free nucleons and pair emission by $e^+e^-$
annihilation have the largest impact on the neutrino emission and shock
evolution. Other opacities evaluated, including nucleon--nucleon bremsstrahlung

contributions on the co-presence of both are sparse. Extrinsic noise is usually
modeled as an unbounded white or colored gaussian stochastic process, even
though realistic stochastic perturbations are clearly bounded. In this paper we
consider Gillespie-like stochastic models of nonlinear networks, i.e. the
intrinsic noise, where the model jump rates are affected by colored bounded
extrinsic noises synthesized by a suitable biochemical state-dependent Langevin
system. These systems are described by a master equation, and a simulation
algorithm to analyze them is derived. This new modeling paradigm should enlarge

To this end, in this paper, we develop a linear social influence model, named
Circuit due to its close relation to the circuit network. Based on the
predefined four axioms of social influence, we first demonstrate that our model
can efficiently measure the influence strength between any pair of nodes. Along
this line, an upper bound of the node(s)' influence is identified for potential
use, e.g., reducing the search space. Furthermore, we provide the physical

At last, the effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on the real-world

how learning rates are tuned and decreased over time. We propose a method to
automatically adjust multiple learning rates so as to minimize the expected
error at any one time. The method relies on local gradient variations across
samples. In our approach, learning rates can increase as well as decrease,
making it suitable for non-stationary problems. Using a number of convex and
non-convex learning tasks, we show that the resulting algorithm matches the

function in the time-domain, which reveals several universal features of wave
propagation in black hole spacetimes. We demonstrate the trapping of energy
near the photon sphere and confirm its exponential decay. The trapped wavefront
propagates through caustics resulting in echoes that propagate to infinity. The
arrival times and the decay rate of these caustic echoes are consistent with
propagation along null geodesics and the large l-limit of quasinormal modes. We
show that the four-fold singularity structure of the retarded Green function is
due to the well-known action of a Hilbert transform on the trapped wavefront at
caustics. A two-fold cycle is obtained for degenerate source-observer
configurations along the caustic line, where the energy amplification increases
with an inverse power of the scale of the source. Finally, we discuss the tail
piece of the solution due to propagation within the light cone, up to and
including null infinity, and argue that, even with ideal instruments, only a
finite number of echoes can be observed. Putting these pieces together, we
provide a heuristic expression that approximates the Green function with a few
free parameters. Accurate calculations and approximations of the Green function

this work is to derive the expansion properties of MCs in the inner heliosphere

in two subsets: those MCs with a velocity profile that is significantly
perturbed from the expected linear profile and those that are not. From the
slope of the \textit{in situ} measured bulk velocity along the Sun-Earth
direction, we compute an expansion speed with respect to the cloud center for
each of the analyzed MCs. We analyze how the expansion speed depends on the MC
size, the translation velocity, and the heliocentric distance, finding that all
MCs in the subset of non-perturbed MCs expand with almost the same
non-dimensional expansion rate ($\zeta$). We find departures from this general
rule for $\zeta$ only for perturbed MCs, and we interpret the departures as the
consequence of a local and strong SW perturbation by SW fast streams, affecting
the MC even inside its interior, in addition to the direct interaction region
between the SW and the MC. We also compute the dependence of the mean total SW
pressure on the solar distance and we confirm that the decrease of the total SW
pressure with distance is the main origin of the observed MC expansion rate. We
found that $\zeta$ was $0.91\pm 0.23$ for non-perturbed MCs while $\zeta$ was
$0.48\pm 0.79$ for perturbed MCs, the larger spread in the last ones being due

tree} (MST) problem: given a set $V$ of wireless nodes, compute a spanning tree
$T$, so that the total cost of $T$ is minimized. In recent years, there has
been a lot of interest in the physical interference model based on SINR
constraints. Distributed algorithms are especially challenging in the SINR
model, because of the non-locality of the model.
  In this paper, we develop a fast distributed approximation algorithm for MST
construction in an SINR based distributed computing model. For an $n$-node
network, our algorithm's running time is $O(D\log{n}+\mu\log{n})$ and produces
a spanning tree whose cost is within $O(\log n)$ times the optimal (MST cost),
where $D$ denotes the diameter of the disk graph obtained by using the maximum
possible transmission range, and $\mu=\log{\frac{d_{max}}{d_{min}}}$ denotes
the ""distance diversity"" w.r.t. the largest and smallest distances between two
nodes. (When $\frac{d_{max}}{d_{min}}$ is $n$-polynomial, $\mu = O(\log n)$.)
Our algorithm's running time is essentially optimal (upto a logarithmic
factor), since computing {\em any} spanning tree takes $\Omega(D)$ time; thus
our algorithm produces a low cost spanning tree in time only a logarithmic
factor more than the time to compute a spanning tree. The distributed
scheduling complexity of the spanning tree resulted from our algorithm is
$O(\mu \log n)$. Our algorithmic design techniques can be useful in designing
efficient distributed algorithms for related ""global"" problems in wireless
networks in the SINR model.

the time-reversal symmetry. Hence, a spin-polarized current can be induced in
the gap opened by the local exchange field in this two-terminal system. What is
important is that the spin-polarized current can be obtained even in the
absence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and in the case of the very weak exchange

can be easily realized experimentally.We also find that the spin-polarized

quantum cosmology is studied. By the well-established canonical theory, the
transition amplitude in the path integral representation of loop quantum
cosmology with alternative dynamics can be formulated through group averaging.
The effective action and Hamiltonian with higher-order quantum corrections are
thus obtained. It turns out that for a non-symmetric Hamiltonian constraint
operator, the Moyal (star)-product emerges naturally in the effective
Hamiltonian. For the corresponding symmetric Hamiltonian operator, the resulted
effective theory implies a possible quantum cosmological effect in large scale
limit in the alternative dynamical scenario, which coincides with the result in

contains the particular information of alternative dynamics and hence admits
the possible phenomenological distinction between the different proposals of

structural scaling relations of nearby galaxies and to determine how the
properties of the UV disk vary with atomic hydrogen content and environment. We
find a clear change of slope in the stellar mass vs. effective surface
brightness relation when moving from the optical to the UV, with more massive
galaxies having brighter optical but fainter UV surface brightnesses than
smaller systems. A similar change of slope is also seen in the radius vs.
surface brightness relation. By comparing our observations with the predictions
of a simple multi-zone chemical model of galaxy evolution, we show that these
findings are a natural consequence of a much more efficient inside-out growth
of the stellar disk in massive galaxies. We confirm that isophotal radii are
always a better proxy for the size of the stellar/star-forming disk than
effective quantities and we show that the extent of the UV disk (normalized to
the optical size) is strongly correlated to the integrated HI gas fraction.
This relation still holds even when cluster spirals are considered, with
HI-deficient systems having less extended star-forming disks than HI-normal
galaxies. Interestingly, the star formation in the inner part of HI-deficient
galaxies is significantly less affected by the removal of the atomic hydrogen,
as expected in a simple ram-pressure stripping scenario. These results suggest
that it is the amount of HI that regulates the growth of the star-forming disk

the effect of a possible change in the nucleon-nucleon interaction on nuclear

and complement earlier work on its effect on the binding energy of deuterium.
The reaction rates for He3(d,p)He4 and H3(d,n)He4 are dominated by the
properties of broad analog resonances in He-5 and Li-5 compound nuclei
respectively. While the triple alpha process is normally not effective in BBN,
its rate is very sensitive to the position of the ""Hoyle state"" and could in
principle be drastically affected if Be-8 were stable during BBN. The nuclear
properties (resonance energies in He-5 and Li-5 nuclei, and the binding
energies of Be-8 and D) are all computed in a consistent way using a
microscopic cluster model. The n(p,gamma)d, He3(d,p)He4 and H3(d,n)He4 and
triple-alpha reaction rates are subsequently calculated as a function of the
nucleon-nucleon interaction that can be related to the fundamental constants.
We found that the effect of the variation of constants on the He3(d,p)He4 and
H3(d,n)He4 and triple-alpha reaction rates is not sufficient to induce a
significant effect on BBN, even if Be-8 was stable. In particular, no
significant production of carbon by the triple alpha reaction is found when
compared to standard BBN. We also update our previous analysis on the effect of
a variation of constants on the n(p,gamma)d reaction rate.

simulations, the combination of dark matter and star distribution can be very
well described, for lens radii relevant to strong lensing, by a simple
power-law whose slope is very weakly dependent on the parameters characterizing
the global matter surface density profile and close to isothermal in agreement
with direct estimates for individual lens galaxies. Our simple treatment allows
an easy insight into the role of the different ingredients that determine the
lens cross section and the distribution of gravitational amplifications. They
also ease the reconstruction of the lens mass distribution from the observed
images and, vice-versa, allow a fast application of ray-tracing techniques to
model the effect of lensing on a variety of source structures. The maximum
amplification depends primarily on the source size. Amplifications larger than
~20 are indicative of compact source sizes at high-z, in agreement with
expectations if galaxies formed most of their stars during the dissipative
collapse of cold gas. Our formalism has allowed us to reproduce the counts of

modeling of massive corpora containing a large number of topics. To reduce the
space complexity, we propose a novel algorithm without storing previous
messages for training LDA: tiny belief propagation (TBP). The basic idea of TBP
relates the message passing algorithms with the non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) algorithms, which absorb the message updating into the
message passing process, and thus avoid storing previous messages. Experimental
results on four large data sets confirm that TBP performs comparably well or
even better than current state-of-the-art training algorithms for LDA but with
a much less memory consumption. TBP can do topic modeling when massive corpora
cannot fit in the computer memory, for example, extracting thematic topics from
7 GB PUBMED corpora on a common desktop computer with 2GB memory.

capable of measuring the coefficient of friction and detecting the acoustical

circumstellar disks based on Spitzer photometry and/or spectroscopy. The
objects with known spectral types range from M3 to M9.5.
  Four of the candidates were subsequently identified as extragalactic objects.
Of the remaining 47 we have successfully detected 36 at 70micron and 14 at
160micron with S/N greater than 3, as well as several additional possible
detections with low S/N. The objects exhibit a range of [24]--[70] micron
colors suggesting a range in mass and/or structure of the outer disk. We
present modeling of the spectral energy distributions of the sample and discuss
trends visible in the data. Using two Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes we
investigate disk masses and geometry. We find a very wide range in modeled
total disk masses from less than 1e-6 solar masses up to 1e-3 solar masses with
a median disk mass of order 3e-5 solar masses, suggesting that the median ratio
of disk mass to central object mass may be lower than for T Tauri stars. The
disk scale heights and flaring angles, however, cover a range consistent with
those seen around T Tauri stars. The host clouds in which the young brown
dwarfs and low-mass stars are located span a range in estimated age from ~1-3
Myr to ~10 Myr and represent a variety of star-forming environments. No obvious
dependence on cloud location or age is seen in the disk properties, though the
statistical significance of this conclusion is not strong.

precursor to the idea, and the first Query in his {\sl Opticks} is totally
unrelated to this phenomenon. We briefly review the roles of Voltaire, Marat,
Cavendish, Soldner and Einstein in their attempts to quantify the gravitational
deflection of light. The first, but unpublished, calculations of the lensing
effect produced by this deflection are found in Einstein's 1912 notebooks,
where he derived the lensing equation and the formation of images in a
gravitational lens. The brief 1924 paper by Chwolson which presents, without
calculations, the formation of double images and rings by a gravitational lens
passed mostly unnoticed. The unjustly forgotten and true pioneer of the subject
is F. Link, who not only published the first detailed lensing calculations in
1936, nine months prior to Einstein's famous paper in {\sl Science}, but also
extended the theory to include the effects of finite-size sources and lenses,
binary sources, and limb darkening that same year. Link correctly predicted
that the microlensing effect would be easier to observe in crowded fields or in
galaxies, as observations confirmed five decades later. The calculations made
by Link are far more detailed than those by Tikhov and Bogorodsky. We discuss
briefly some papers of the early 1960s which marked the renaissance of this
theoretical subject prior to the first detection of a gravitational lens in
1979, and we conclude with the unpublished chapter of Petrou's 1981 PhD thesis

therefore arise in a variety of different applications. For instance, signals
in neural or laser networks propagate at finite speed giving rise to delayed
connections. Such systems are often modeled by delay differential equations
with discrete delays. In realistic situations, these delays are not identical
on different connections. We show that by a componentwise timeshift
transformation it is often possible to reduce the number of different delays
and simplify the models without loss of information. We identify dynamic
invariants of this transformation, determine its capabilities to reduce the
number of delays and interpret these findings in terms of the topology of the
underlying graph. In particular, we show that networks with identical sums of
delay times along the fundamental semicycles are dynamically equivalent and we
provide a normal form for these systems. We illustrate the theory using a
network motif of coupled Mackey-Glass systems with 8 different time delays,
which can be reduced to an equivalent motif with three delays.

Namely, the average burst rate increases and the average burst duration
decreases compared to Ohmic conditions. Statistical properties are also
modified in the same way in both regimes. The reason is that biasing and
certain regimes of DED cause the modification of radial electric field which
affects similarly the dynamics of coherent turbulent structures and plasma

reconstruction approach in an ultrasound transmission tomography (UTT) setting,
which uses ray refracted paths instead of straight ray paths to recover
accurate SOS images of the subject. Subsequently, we use the SOS distribution
in a new 2-D iterative approach, where refraction of rays originating from PA
sources are accounted for in accurately retrieving the distribution of these
sources. Both the SOS reconstruction and SOS-compensated PA reconstruction
methods utilize the Eikonal equation to model acoustic wavefront propagation,
which is solved using a high accuracy fast marching method (HAFMM). We validate
the new reconstruction algorithms using numerical phantoms. For experiments we
use the PER-PACT method which can be used to simultaneously acquire SOS and PA
data from subjects. We test the reconstruction algorithms using experimental
data acquired with the PER-PACT setup from challenging physical phantoms. The
results show that it is important to take SOS inhomogeneities into account. The
iterative reconstruction algorithms, that model acoustic refractive effects,
yield artifact-free highly accurate images. Our approach of using the hybrid
measurement method and the new reconstruction algorithms, is successful in
substantially improving the quality of PA images with a minimization of
blurring and artefacts.

iron is in the Fe3+ oxidation state and accordingly that the films are rich in
oxygen vacancies (VO). VO favor the formation of the tetragonal phase in doped
zirconia (ZrO2:Fe) and affect the density of state at the Fermi level as well
as the local magnetization of Fe atoms. We also show that the Fe(2p) and Fe(3p)

strongly sensitive to the VO to Fe atoms ratio. A comparison of the theoretical

close to 0.5. Besides the interest in the material by itself, ZrO2:Fe
constitutes a test case for the application of DFT on transition metals
embedded in oxides. In ZrO2:Fe the inclusion of the Hubbard U correction
significantly changes the electronic properties of the system. However the
inclusion of this correction, at least for the value U = 3.3 eV chosen in the

binaries of earlier type stars. The shortest-period binary consists of two M4
type stars in a P=0.112 day orbit. The binaries are discovered as part of an
extensive search for short-period eclipsing systems in over 260,000 stellar
lightcurves, including over 10,000 M-dwarfs down to J=18 mag, yielding 25
binaries with P<0.23 days. In a popular paradigm, the evolution of short period
binaries of cool main-sequence stars is driven by loss of angular momentum
through magnetised winds. In this scheme, the observed P~0.22 day period
cut-off is explained as being due to timescales that are too long for
lower-mass binaries to decay into tighter orbits. Our discovery of low-mass
binaries with significantly shorter orbits implies that either these timescales
have been overestimated for M-dwarfs, e.g. due to a higher effective magnetic
activity, or that the mechanism for forming these tight M-dwarf binaries is
different from that of earlier type main-sequence stars.

diamond rely on the optical detection of electron spin resonance (ESR).
However, this technique is inherently limited to magnetic fields that are weak
enough to avoid electron spin mixing. Here we focus on the high off-axis
magnetic field regime for which spin mixing alters the NV defect spin dynamics.
We first study in a quantitative manner the dependence of the NV defect optical
properties on the magnetic field vector B. Magnetic-field-dependent
time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements are compared to a seven-level
model of the NV defect that accounts for field-induced spin mixing. The model
reproduces the decreases in (i) ESR contrast, (ii) PL intensity and (iii)
excited level lifetime with an increasing off-axis magnetic field. We next
demonstrate that those effects can be used to perform all-optical magnetic
imaging in the high off-axis magnetic field regime. Using a scanning NV defect
microscope, we map the stray field of a magnetic hard disk through both PL and
fluorescence lifetime imaging. This all-optical method for high magnetic field
imaging at the nanoscale might be of interest in the field of nanomagnetism,
where samples producing fields in excess of several tens of milliteslas are
typical.

renormalization group (QRG) method while in most previous literature barely
entanglement (concurrence) has been demonstrated. However, it is now well known
that entanglement is not the only signature of quantum correlations and a
variety of computable measures have been developed to characterize quantum
correlations in the composite systems. As an illustration, two cases are
elaborated: one dimensional anisotropic (i) XXZ model and (ii) XY model, with
various measures of quantum correlations, including quantum discord (QD),
geometric discord (GD), measure-induced disturbance (MID), measure-induced
nonlocality (MIN) and violation of Bell inequalities (eg. CHSH inequality). We
have proved that all these correlation measures can effectively detect the
quantum critical points associated with quantum phase transitions (QPT) after
several iterations of the renormalization in both cases. Nonetheless, it is
shown that some of their dynamical behaviors are not totally similar with
entanglement and even when concurrence vanishes there still exists some kind of
quantum correlations which is not captured by entanglement. Intriguingly, CHSH
inequality can never be violated in the whole iteration procedure, which
indicates block-block entanglement can not revealed by the CHSH inequality.
Moreover, the nonanalytic and scaling behaviors of Bell violation have also
been discussed in detail. As a byproduct, we verify that measure-induced
disturbance is exactly equal to the quantum discord measured by \sigma_z for
general X-structured states.

reliability/adequacy assessments of distributed generation (DG) systems have
been particularly focused on the probabilistic modeling of random behaviors,
given sufficient informative data. However, another type of uncertainty
(epistemic uncertainty) must be accounted for in the modeling, due to
incomplete knowledge of the phenomena and imprecise evaluation of the related
characteristic parameters. In circumstances of few informative data, this type
of uncertainty calls for alternative methods of representation, propagation,
analysis and interpretation. In this study, we make a first attempt to
identify, model, and jointly propagate aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in
the context of DG systems modeling for adequacy assessment. Probability and
possibility distributions are used to model the aleatory and epistemic
uncertainties, respectively. Evidence theory is used to incorporate the two
uncertainties under a single framework. Based on the plausibility and belief
functions of evidence theory, the hybrid propagation approach is introduced. A
demonstration is given on a DG system adapted from the IEEE 34 nodes
distribution test feeder. Compared to the pure probabilistic approach, it is
shown that the hybrid propagation is capable of explicitly expressing the
imprecision in the knowledge on the DG parameters into the final adequacy
values assessed. It also effectively captures the growth of uncertainties with
higher DG penetration levels.

advection-dominated accretion around a non-spinning black hole. The first
simulation was designed to avoid significant accumulation of magnetic flux
around the black hole. This simulation was run for a time of 200,000GM/c^3 and
achieved inflow equilibrium out to a radius \sim90GM/c^2. Even at this
relatively large radius, the mass outflow rate \dot{M}_{out} is found to be
only 60% of the net mass inflow rate \dot{M}_{BH} into the black hole. The
second simulation was designed to achieve substantial magnetic flux
accumulation around the black hole in a magnetically arrested disc. This
simulation was run for a shorter time of 100,000GM/c^3. Nevertheless, because
the mean radial velocity was several times larger than in the first simulation,
it reached inflow equilibrium out to a radius \sim170GM/c^2. Here,
\dot{M}_{out} becomes equal to \dot{M}_{BH} at r\sim 160GM/c^2. Since the mass
outflow rates in the two simulations do not show robust convergence with time,
it is likely that the true outflow rates are lower than our estimates. The
effect of black hole spin on mass outflow remains to be explored. Neither
simulation shows strong evidence for convection, though a complete analysis
including the effect of magnetic fields is left for the future.

the Subaru Telescope. UX Tau A has been classified as a pre-transitional disk
object, with a gap structure separating its inner and outer disks. Our imagery
taken with the 0.15 (21 AU) radius coronagraphic mask has revealed a strongly
polarized circumstellar disk surrounding UX Tau A which extends to 120 AU, at a
spatial resolution of 0.1 (14 AU). It is inclined by 46 \pm 2 degree as the
west side is nearest. Although SED modeling and sub-millimeter imagery
suggested the presence of a gap in the disk, with the inner edge of the outer
disk estimated to be located at 25 - 30 AU, we detect no evidence of a gap at
the limit of our inner working angle (23 AU) at the near-infrared wavelength.
We attribute the observed strong polarization (up to 66 %) to light scattering
by dust grains in the disk. However, neither polarization models of the
circumstellar disk based on Rayleigh scattering nor Mie scattering
approximations were consistent with the observed azimuthal profile of the
polarization degrees of the disk. Instead, a geometric optics model of the disk
with nonspherical grains with the radii of 30 micron meter is consistent with
the observed profile. We suggest that the dust grains have experienced frequent
collisional coagulations and have grown in the circumstellar disk of UX Tau A.

graphene by means of the complete active space self-consistent field approach,
additionally corrected by the second-order perturbation theory. The local
structure of graphene is modeled by a planar hydrocarbon cluster
(C$_{24}$H$_{12}$). Systematic treatment of the electron correlations and the
possibility to study excited states allow us to reproduce the potential energy
curves for different electronic configurations of Co. We find that upon
approaching the surface, the ground-state configuration of Co undergoes several
transitions, giving rise to two stable states. The first corresponds to the
physisorption of the adatom in the high-spin $3d^74s^2$ ($S=3/2$)
configuration, while the second results from the chemical bonding formed by
strong orbital hybridization, leading to the low-spin $3d^9$ ($S=1/2$) state.
Due to the instability of the $3d^9$ configuration, the adsorption energy of Co
is small in both cases and does not exceed 0.35 eV. We analyze the obtained
results in terms of a simple model Hamiltonian that involves Coulomb repulsion
($U$) and exchange coupling ($J$) parameters for the 3$d$ shell of Co, which we
estimate from first-principles calculations. We show that while the exchange
interaction remains constant upon adsorption ($\simeq1.1$ eV), the Coulomb
repulsion significantly reduces for decreasing distances (from 5.3 to
2.6$\pm$0.2 eV). The screening of $U$ favors higher occupations of the 3$d$
shell and thus is largely responsible for the interconfigurational transitions
of Co. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the approaches that are based on
density functional theory with respect to transition metal atoms on graphene,
and we conclude that a proper account of the electron correlations is crucial
for the description of adsorption in such systems.

primarily through an unoccupied molecular orbital that is partly hybridized

cannot be modeled by a single Lorentzian resonance, as our results show
evidence of quantum interference between an occupied and an unoccupied orbital.

spirit of the Mermin--Wagner theorem. In the model considered here (quantum
rotators) the phase space of a single spin is a $d-$dimensional torus, and
spins (or particles) are attached to sites of a graph satisfying a special
bi-dimensionality property. The kinetic energy part of the Hamiltonian is minus
a half of the Laplace operator. We assume that the interaction potential is
C$^2$-smooth and invariant under the action of a connected Lie group ${\ttG}$.
A part of our approach is to give a definition (and a construction) of a class
of infinite-volume Gibbs states for the systems under consideration (the class
$\fG$). This class contains the so-called limit Gibbs states, with or without
boundary conditions. We use ideas and techniques originated from various past
papers, in combination with the Feynman--Kac representation, to prove that any
state lying in the class $\fG$ (defined in the text) is ${\ttG}$-invariant. An
example is given where the interaction potential is singular and there exists a
Gibbs state which is not ${\ttG}$-invariant.

heterogeneous materials by means of a two-dimensional fuse network model. Our
results in the extreme disorder limit reveal that the backbone of the fracture
at collapse, namely the subset of the largest fracture that effectively halts
the global current, has a fractal dimension of $1.22 \pm 0.01$. This exponent
value is compatible with the universality class of several other physical
models, including optimal paths under strong disorder, disordered polymers,
watersheds and optimal path cracks on uncorrelated substrates, hulls of
explosive percolation clusters, and strands of invasion percolation fronts.
Moreover, we find that the fractal dimension of the largest fracture under
extreme disorder, $d_f=1.86 \pm 0.01$, is outside the statistical error bar of
standard percolation. This discrepancy is due to the appearance of trapped
regions or cavities of all sizes that remain intact till the entire collapse of
the fuse network, but are always accessible in the case of standard
percolation. Finally, we quantify the role of disorder on the structure of the
largest cluster, as well as on the backbone of the fracture, in terms of a
distinctive transition from weak to strong disorder characterized by a new
crossover exponent.

of $10^{-9} - 10^{-7}$ G. We investigate the morphology, regions of star

propagation of the studied gaseous properties (temperature, X-ray emission,
magnetic field strength and synchrotron intensity) is more efficient for the SQ

massive SQ model based on Hwang et al. shows generally similar effects but with
smaller efficiency. We show that the large shock found in observations of SQ is
most likely the result of a collision of the galaxy NGC 7318b with the IGM.
This large group-wide shock is clearly visible in the X-ray emission and
synchrotron intensity within the simulations of both SQ models. The order of

slightly better reproduced by the SQ model based on Renaud et al., whereas the

already identified by the CoRoT team. About 70% of the planet candidates in the
CoRoT IRa01 field are best fit with an impact parameter of b>0.85, while less

applying a cut at b<0.85, meaning that ~15% of the potential planet population

of 6 of those are best fit with such low host star densities that the
planet-to-star size ratii imply unrealistic planet radii of R>2RJup. Two of the
five remaining systems, CoRoT1b and CoRoT4b, have been identified as planets by

were obtained with VIMOS at VLT, at R~2000 and were analysed using the latest
version of the model atmosphere code FASTWIND, which includes N III Results. We
obtain the stellar parameters and conclude that the star follows the average
wind momentum-luminosity relationship (WLR) expected for its metallicity, but
with a high value for the exponent of the wind velocity law, beta. We suggest
that this high value may be reached because GHV-62024 could be a fast rotator
seen at a low inclination angle. While the derived beta value does not change
by adopting a lower wind terminal velocity, a wrong $V_\infty$ has a clear
impact on the position of the star in the WLR diagram. The N and He abundances
are very high, consistent with strong CNO mixing that could have been caused by
the fast rotation, although we cannot discard a different origin. We find again
the well-known mass-discrepancy. Conclusions. We conclude that the star follows
the WLR expected for its metallicity. The results are consistent with GHV-62024
being a fast rotator seen close to pole-on, contaminated at the surface with
CNO products and with a wind structure altered by the fast rotation without
modifying the global WLR. We suggest that this could be a general property of
fast rotators.

non-commutative space cannot yield complete information about the quantum state
of a particle. Indeed, the formalism used entails a description that is
non-local in that it requires all orders of positional derivatives through the
star product that is used ubiquitously to map operator multiplication onto
function multiplication in non-commutative systems. It will be shown that there
exist several equivalent local descriptions, which are arrived at via the
introduction of additional degrees of freedom. Consequently non-commutative
quantum mechanical position measurements necessarily confront us with some
additional structure which is necessary to specify quantum states completely.
The remainder of the thesis, will involve investigations into the physical
interpretation of these additional degrees of freedom. For one particular local
formulation, the corresponding classical theory will be used to demonstrate
that the concept of extended, structured objects emerges quite naturally and
unavoidably there. This description will be shown to be equivalent to one
describing a two-charge harmonically interacting composite in a strong magnetic
field found by Susskind. It will be argued that these notions also extend
naturally to the quantum level, and constraints will be shown to arise there. A
further local formulation will be introduced, with an interpretation in terms
of objects located at a point with a certain angular momentum about that point.
This again enforces the idea of particles that are not point-like. Both local
descriptions make explicit the additional structure which is encoded more
subtly in the non-local description. Additional degrees of freedom introduced
by local descriptions may also be thought of as gauge degrees of freedom in a
gauge-invariant formulation of the theory.

larger than 1e23/cm^2 over a region of 2.3 pc^2. It shows substructured column
density profiles and branching into two major filaments in the north. The
masses in the studied filaments range between 130 and 1400 Msun whereas the
mass in the ridge is 15000 Msun. The accretion of these filaments onto the DR21
ridge, suggested by a previous molecular line study, could provide a continuous
mass inflow to the ridge. In contrast to the striations seen in e.g., the
Taurus region, these filaments are gravitationally unstable and form cores and
protostars. These cores formed in the filaments potentially fall into the
ridge. Both inflow and collisions of cores could be important to drive the
observed high-mass star formation. The evolutionary gradient of star formation
running from DR21 in the south to the northern branching is traced by
decreasing dust temperature. This evolution and the ridge structure can be
explained by two main filamentary components of the ridge that merged first in
the south.

associated photon-dominated region (PDR) can be resolved with Herschel. Due to
its brightness and proximity, it is the best source to investigate the
chemistry and physics of highly UV-irradiated PDRs. Aims. Our goal is to
estimate the abundance of H2O and NH3 in this region and investigate their
origin. Methods. We present new observations obtained with HIFI and the
IRAM-30m telescope. Using a large velocity gradient approach, we model the line
intensities and derive an average abundance of H2O and NH3 across the region.
Finally, we model the line profiles with a non-local radiative transfer model
and compare these results with the abundance predicted by the Meudon PDR code.
Results. The variations of the line profiles and intensities indicate complex
geometrical and kinematical patterns. The H2O lines present a strong absorption
at the ambient velocity and emission in high velocity wings towards the HII
region. The spatial distribution of the o-H2^18O line shows that the its
emission arises in the PDR surrounding the HII region. By modeling the o-H2^18O
emission we derive a mean abundance of o-H2O of ~10^-8 relative to H2. The
ortho-H2O abundance is however larger, ~1x10^-7, in the high velocity wings.
Possible explanations for this larger abundance include an expanding hot PDR
and/or an outflow. Ammonia seems to be present only in the envelope with an
average abundance of ~2x10^-9 relative to H2. Conclusions. The Meudon PDR code
can account for the measured water abundance in the high velocity gas as long
as we assume that it originates from a <1 mag hot expanding layer of the PDR,
i.e. that the outflow has only a minor contribution to this emission. To
explain the abundances in the rest of the cloud the molecular freeze out and
grain surface chemistry would need to be included.

  (Springer)",,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ion channels are proteins with holes down their middle that control the flow
of ions and electric current across otherwise impermeable biological membranes.
The flow of sodium, potassium, calcium (divalent), and chloride ions have been
central issues in biology for more than a century. The flow of current is
responsible for the signals of the nervous system that propagate over long
distances (meters). The concentration of divalent calcium ions is a 'universal'
signal that controls many different systems inside cells. The concentration of
divalent calcium and other messenger ions has a role in life rather like the
role of the voltage in different wires of a computer. Ion channels also help
much larger solutes (e.g., organic acid and bases; perhaps polypeptides) to
cross membranes but much less is known about these systems. Ion channels can
select and control the movement of different types of ions because the holes in
channel proteins are a few times larger than the (crystal radii of the) ions
themselves. Biology uses ion channels as selective valves to control flow and
thus concentration of crucial chemical signals. For example, the concentration
of divalent calcium ions determines whether muscles contract or not. Ion
channels have a role in biology similar to the role of transistors in computers
and technology. Ion Channels Control Concentrations Important To Life The Way
Computers Control Voltages Important To Computers.

electroweak structure of heavy-light mesons within constituent-quark models. To
this aim the physical processes in which the structure is measured, i.e.
electron-meson scattering and semileptonic weak decays, are treated in a
Poincar\'e invariant way by making use of the point-form of relativistic
quantum mechanics. The electromagnetic and weak meson currents are extracted
from the 1-$\gamma$ and 1-$W$-exchange amplitudes that result from a
Bakamjian-Thomas type mass operator for the respective systems. The covariant
decomposition of these currents provides the electromagnetic and weak
(transition) form factors. Problems with cluster separability, which are
inherent in the Bakamjian-Thomas construction, are discussed and it is shown
how to keep them under control. It is proved that the heavy-quark limit of the
electroweak form factors leads to one universal function, the Isgur-Wise
function, confirming that the requirements of heavy-quark symmetry are
satisfied. A simple analytical expression is given for the Isgur-Wise function
and its agreement with a corresponding front-form calculation is verified
numerically. Electromagnetic form factors for $B^-$ and $D^+$ and weak
$B\rightarrow D^{(\ast)}$-decay form factors are calculated with a simple
harmonic-oscilllator wave function and heavy-quark symmetry breaking due to
finite masses of the heavy quarks is discussed.

tends to bring smoothness and robustness in the network performance. The aim is
to provide a new approach for decision under uncertainty that combines three

functions near to the critical point are approximately independent of
frequency. In the case of a quantum liquid this would imply that classical
hydrodynamics breaks down near to the critical point, revealing the underlying
quantum degrees of freedom. An opportunity to see this effect for the first
time in the laboratory may be provided by relativistic heavy ion collisions
that are tuned so that the quark-gluon plasma passes through its critical point
forming a closed critical surface. In this note we point out that in certain
kinds of quantum fluids the temperature of a spherical critical surface will be
proportional to (radius)-1 and the entropy inside the surface will be close to
the Bekenstein bound. In these cases the breakdown in hydrodynamics near to the
critical point might serve as a model for the behavior of quantum gravity near
to an event horizon. Such a possibility is a fortiori notable because general
relativity predicts that nothing should happen at an event horizon.

Examples of these systems are gravitational and charged (non-electroneutral).
In this work we propose two alternative methodologies to avoid these
difficulties and capture some of the properties of the original potential. The
first one consists in expressing the original potential in terms of a finite
sum of hard-core Yukawa potentials. In the second one, the potential is
rewritten as a damped potential, using a damping function with a parameter that
controls the range of the interaction. These new potentials, which mimic the
original one, can now be treated by conventional statistical mechanics methods.
