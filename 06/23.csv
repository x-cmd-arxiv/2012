one-dimensional disordered potential in the presence of a weak position
measurement of the atoms. We specifically consider this position measurement to
be realized by a combination of an external laser and a periodic array of
optical microcavities along a waveguide. The position information is acquired
through the scattering of a near-resonant laser photon into a specific
eigenmode of one of the cavities. The time evolution of the atomic density in
the presence of this light scattering mechanism is described within a Lindblad
master equation approach, which is numerically implemented using the Monte
Carlo wave function technique. We find that an arbitrarily weak rate of photon
emission leads to a breakdown of Anderson localization of the atoms.

  equations","PhD Thesis, University of Graz (2012)",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis the covariant Bethe-Salpeter equation formalism is used to
study some properties of ground-state baryons. This formalism relies on the
knowledge of the interaction kernel among quarks and of the full quark
propagator. For the interaction kernel, which is in principle a sum of
infinitely many diagrams, I use the Ladder truncation. It amounts to reduce the
interaction to a flavor-blind quark-mass independent vector-vector interaction
between two quarks, mediated by a dressed gluon. The irreducible three-body
interactions are neglected. The full quark propagator is obtained as a solution
of the quark Dyson-Schwinger equation which is truncated such that, together
with the truncation in the interaction kernel, chiral symmetry is correctly
implemented. It is called Rainbow truncation, and together with the truncated
kernel equation it constitutes the Rainbow-Ladder truncation of the
Bethe-Salpeter equation.
  Any truncation induces the introduction of a model to account for the
properties of the full system. The main goal of this thesis is to evaluate the
model dependence of corrsponding results and, as a consequence, to isolate the
features related to the truncation itself. To this end two non-related models
are used to calculate the baryon spectra, from light to heavy quarks, and the
electromagnetic properties of the Delta(1232). From these results one concludes
a qualitative model independence, and that a Rainbow-Ladder truncated
bound-state calculation reproduces the physical results with an accuracy of
~10%.
  Covariant bound-state equations are not limited to the study of hadronic
bound states. As an example, in a further chapter of this thesis a
Bethe-Salpeter equation for glueballs is proposed, and the main steps for a
consistent resolution of the equation are described. However, to obtain this
solution is beyond the scope of this work.

density and the equation of state parameter at the current epoch, $\Omega_{de}$
and $w_0$, and the asymptotic value of the equation of state parameter at
$a\rightarrow\infty$, $c_a^2$. Their best-fit values are determined jointly
with all other cosmological parameters by the MCMC method using observational
data on CMB anisotropies and polarization, SNe Ia luminosity distances, BAO

current data slightly prefer the phantom model, but the differences in the
maximum likelihoods are not statistically significant. It is also shown that
the phantom dark energy with monotonically increasing density in future will
cause the decay of large scale linear matter density perturbations due to the
gravitational domination of dark energy perturbations long before the Big Rip

car's acceleration depends on its own speed, the headway ahead of it, and the
rate of change of headway, with only minimal assumptions about the functional
form of that dependence. The velocity of uniform steady flow is found
implicitly from the acceleration function, and its linear stability criterion
can be expressed simply in terms of it. Crucially, unlike in previously
analyzed car-following models, the threshold of absolute stability does not
generally coincide with an inflection point in the steady velocity function.
The Burgers and KdV equations can be derived under the usual assumptions, but
the mKdV equation arises only when absolute stability does coincide with an
inflection point. Otherwise, the KdV equation applies near absolute stability,
while near the inflection point one obtains the mKdV equation plus an extra,
quadratic term. Corrections to the KdV equation ""select"" a single member of the
one-parameter set of soliton solutions. In previous models this has always
marked the threshold of a finite- amplitude instability of steady flow, but
here it can alternatively be a stable, small-amplitude jam. That is, there can
be a forward bifurcation from steady flow. The new, augmented mKdV equation
which holds near an inflection point admits a continuous family of kink
solutions, like the mKdV equation, and we derive the selection criterion
arising from the corrections to this equation.

methods to explore the sensitivity of f_NL, n_s and r to the reheating process,
and present simple qualitative arguments to explain our results. In general, if
a large non-Gaussian signal exists at the start of reheating, it will remain
non zero at the end of reheating. Unless all isocurvature modes have completely
decayed before the start of reheating, we find that the non-linearity
parameter, f_NL, can be sensitive to the reheating timescale, and that this
dependence is most appreciable for `runaway' inflationary potentials that only
have a minimum in one direction. For potentials with a minimum in both
directions, f_NL can also be sensitive to reheating if a mild hierarchy exists
between the decay rates of each field. Within the class of models studied, we
find that the spectral index n_s, is fairly insensitive to large changes in the
field decay rates, indicating that n_s is a more robust inflationary
observable, unlike the non-linearity parameter f_NL. Our results imply that the
statistics of \zeta, especially f_NL, can only be reliably used to discriminate
between models of two-field inflation if the physics of reheating are properly

transformations that rotate two orthogonal one-particle states into each other.
In light of these observations, possible restrictions on the allowed types of
intervention are considered. A more physical approach to such questions is to
construct explicit models of the interventions as interactions between the
field and other quantum systems such as detectors. The prototypical
Unruh-DeWitt detector couples to the field operator itself and so most likely
respects relativistic causality. On the other hand, detector models which
couple to a finite set of frequencies of field modes are shown to lead to
superluminal signalling. Such detectors do, however, provide successful

evaporation, is key to interpreting fluvial erosion and other indicators of the
surface-atmosphere exchange of liquids. But the mechanisms behind the
occurrence of large cloud outbursts and precipitation on Titan have been
disputed. A gobal- and annual-mean estimate of surface fluxes indicated only 1%
of the insolation, or $\sim$0.04 W/m$^2$, is exchanged as sensible and/or
latent fluxes. Since these fluxes are responsible for driving atmospheric
convection, it has been argued that moist convection should be quite rare and
precipitation even rarer, even if evaporation globally dominates the
surface-atmosphere energy exchange. In contrast, climate simulations that allow
atmospheric motion indicate a robust methane cycle with substantial cloud
formation and/or precipitation. We argue the top-of-atmosphere radiative
imbalance -- a readily observable quantity -- is diagnostic of horizontal heat
transport by Titan's atmosphere, and thus constrains the strength of the
methane cycle. Simple calculations show the top-of-atmosphere radiative
imbalance is $\sim$0.5-1 W/m$^2$ in Titan's equatorial region, which implies
2-3 MW of latitudinal heat transport by the atmosphere. Our simulation of
Titan's climate suggests this transport may occur primarily as latent heat,
with net evaporation at the equator and net accumulation at higher latitudes.

observations given the hidden states. It may be considered an instance of
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and it involves the introduction of
auxiliary variables valued in the same space as the observations. The quality
of the approximation may be controlled to arbitrary precision through a
parameter \epsilon>0 . We provide theoretical results which quantify, in terms
of \epsilon, the ABC error in approximation of expectations of additive
functionals with respect to the smoothing distributions. Under regularity
assumptions, this error is O(n\epsilon), where n is the number of time steps
over which smoothing is performed. For numerical implementation we adopt the
forward-only sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) scheme of [16] and quantify the
combined error from the ABC and SMC approximations. This forms some of the
first quantitative results for ABC methods which jointly treat the ABC and
simulation errors, with a finite number of data and simulated samples. When the
HMM has unknown static parameters, we consider particle Markov chain Monte
Carlo [2] (PMCMC) methods for batch statistical inference.

phones has made the Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) popular in the recent
years. Nowadays, WLANs have become widely accepted in both private and public
sectors due to ease of installation, reasonable prices and high data rates that
can support real time applications. However, fast handoff required for such
real-time applications is not provided in the current IEEE 802.11
specifications. Consequently, providing seamless mobility in these WLANs is an
important issue. To solve this problem, a new fast handoff scheme called
Advanced Neighbor Discovery with Caching (ANDWC) is proposed. This new
mechanism is based on the user's mobility between two or more different Basic
Service Sets (Layer 2 mobility). ANDWC can eliminate scanning delay (which
contributes up to 90% of the total handoff latency) to provide seamless handoff
by using pre-neighbor-discovery and caching mechanisms.

to propose a five-dimensional extension of the Standard Model where the mass
hierarchy of the four-dimensional effective field theory is obtained only using
localizations parameters of order 1. We consider a bulk custodial gauge
symmetry group together with an Abelian $Z_4$ group: the model turns out to
yield a rather minimal extension of the SM as it only requires two brane Higgs
fields to provide the desired Yukawa interactions and the required spontaneous
symmetry breaking pattern. In fact, the presence of an extra-dimension allows
the use of the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism to contribute to the breaking of the
bulk custodial group down to the SM gauge symmetry. Moreover, no right-handed
neutrinos are present and neutrino masses are generated radiatively with the
help of a bulk charged scalar field that provides the Lepton-number violation.
Using experimental inputs from the Global Neutrino Analysis and recent Daya Bay
results, a numerical analysis is performed and allowed parameter regions are
displayed.

coexistence (up to 150 dB/cm). We show that the giant magnetocaloric effect of

describe the temperature and the external magnetic field dependence of such a
huge ultrasound attenuation. Strain-manipulation of the magnetocaloric effect

used to describe these filters show a remarkable ability to 'shadow' the
Tangent map when the polygon in question is regular.
  In this paper we describe a specific digital filter map (Df) that appears to
have dynamics which are conjugate to the Tangent map for a regular N-gon with N
even. When N is odd, there is evidence of another conjugacy between the Tangent
map dynamics of N and the matching 2N-gon, so a case like N = 7 can be studied
with the Df map in the context of N = 14. This provides a many-fold increase in
efficiency, and also allows us to generalize the Tangent map to obtain 'step-k'
versions - which have dynamics that are unexplored.
  We also present some related maps, including Chua and Lin's 3-dimensional
version of Df, an Analog to Digital Converter from Orla Feely, a sawtooth
version of the Standard Map by Peter Ashwin and various kicked harmonic
oscillators. All of these seem to shadow the Tangent map in some form.

potential (BOP) to enable accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for
predicting defect formation during multilayer growth. A detailed comparison of
our MD simulations to high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
experiments verifies the accuracy and predictive power of our approach. Our

significantly more complex than a simple dipole and can vary markedly between
sources. We collect and summarize the magnetic field topology information
obtained to date and present Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams for the stars in
the sample. Intriguingly, the large scale field topology of a given pre-main
sequence (PMS) star is strongly dependent upon the stellar internal structure,
with the strength of the dipole component of its multipolar magnetic field
decaying rapidly with the development of a radiative core. Using the
observational data as a basis, we argue that the general characteristics of the
global magnetic field of a PMS star can be determined from its position in the
HR diagram. Moving from hotter and more luminous to cooler and less luminous
stars across the PMS of the HR diagram, we present evidence for four distinct
magnetic topology regimes. Stars with large radiative cores, empirically
estimated to be those with a core mass in excess of ~40 per cent of the stellar
mass, host highly complex and dominantly non-axisymmetric magnetic fields,
while those with smaller radiative cores host axisymmetric fields with field
modes of higher order than the dipole dominant (typically, but not always, the
octupole). Fully convective stars stars above ~0.5 MSun appear to host
dominantly axisymmetric fields with strong (kilo-Gauss) dipole components.
Based on similarities between the magnetic properties of PMS stars and main
sequence M-dwarfs with similar internal structures, we speculate that a
bistable dynamo process operates for lower mass stars (<~0.5 MSun at an age of
a few Myr) and that they will be found to host a variety of magnetic field
topologies. If the magnetic topology trends across the HR diagram are confirmed
they may provide a new method of constraining PMS stellar evolution models.

conditions, and a background for various processes of solar activity. Therefore
understanding of properties and dynamics of this `basic' state is important for
investigation of more complex phenomena, formation and development of observed
phenomena in the photosphere and atmosphere. For characterization of the
turbulent properties we compare kinetic energy spectra on granular and
sub-granular scales obtained from infrared TiO observations with the New Solar
Telescope (Big Bear Solar Observatory) and from 3D radiative MHD numerical
simulations ('SolarBox' code). We find that the numerical simulations require a
high spatial resolution with 10 - 25 km grid-step in order to reproduce the
inertial (Kolmogorov) turbulence range. The observational data require an
averaging procedure to remove noise and potential instrumental artifacts. The
resulting kinetic energy spectra show a good agreement between the simulations
and observations, opening new perspectives for detailed joint analysis of more
complex turbulent phenomena on the Sun, and possibly on other stars. In
addition, using the simulations and observations we investigate effects of
background magnetic field, which is concentrated in self-organized complicated
structures in intergranular lanes, and find an increase of the small-scale
turbulence energy and its decrease at larger scales due to magnetic field
effects.

LHC constraints, but natural electroweak symmetry breaking still remains the
most powerful motivation for superpartner masses within experimental reach. If
naturalness is the wrong criterion then what determines the mass scale of the
superpartners? We motivate supersymmetry by (1) gauge coupling unification, (2)
dark matter, and (3) precision b-tau Yukawa unification. We show that for an
LSP that is a bino-Higgsino admixture, these three requirements lead to an
upper-bound on the stop and sbottom masses in the several TeV regime because
the threshold correction to the bottom mass at the superpartner scale is
required to have a particular size. For tan beta about 50, which is needed for
t-b-tau unification, the stops must be lighter than 2.8 TeV when A_t has the
opposite sign of the gluino mass, as is favored by renormalization group
scaling. For lower values of tan beta, the top and bottom squarks must be even
lighter. Yukawa unification plus dark matter implies that superpartners are
likely in reach of the LHC, after the upgrade to 14 (or 13) TeV, independent of
any considerations of naturalness. We present a model-independent, bottom-up
analysis of the SUSY parameter space that is simultaneously consistent with
Yukawa unification and the hint for m_h = 125 GeV. We study the flavor and dark
matter phenomenology that accompanies this Yukawa unification. A large portion
of the parameter space predicts that the branching fraction for B_s to mu^+

LCDM, we show that it is possible to achieve the required percent level
accuracy in the halo mass function with gravity-only cosmological simulations,
and we provide simulation start and run parameter guidelines for doing so. Some
previous works have had sufficient statistical precision, but lacked robust
verification of absolute accuracy. Convergence tests of the mass function with,
for example, simulation start redshift can exhibit false convergence of the
mass function due to counteracting errors, potentially misleading one to infer
overly optimistic estimations of simulation accuracy. Percent level accuracy is
possible if initial condition particle mapping uses second order Lagrangian
Perturbation Theory, and if the start epoch is between 10 and 50 expansion
factors before the epoch of halo formation of interest. The mass function for
halos with fewer than ~1000 particles is highly sensitive to simulation
parameters and start redshift, implying a practical minimum mass resolution
limit due to mass discreteness. The narrow range in converged start redshift
suggests that it is not presently possible for a single simulation to capture
accurately the cluster mass function while also starting early enough to model
accurately the numbers of reionisation era galaxies, whose baryon feedback
processes may affect later cluster properties. Ultimately, to fully exploit
current and future cosmological surveys will require accurate modeling of
baryon physics and observable properties, a formidable challenge for which
accurate gravity-only simulations are just an initial step.

is constrained from above by direct stop and chargino searches and by
electroweak precision tests. Naturalness, in particular in demanding that rare
B decays remain consistent with experiment without fine-tuned cancellations,
provides a lower (upper) bound to the stop contribution to the Higgs-gluon

the presence of loop induced non-holomorphic Yukawa couplings. Generic classes

Homes' law and to find a universal relation governing strongly correlated
quantum matter. We calculate diffusive processes, including the backreaction of
the gravitational matter fields on the geometry. We consider both holographic
s-wave and p-wave superconductors. We show that a particular form of Homes' law
holds in the absence of backreaction. Moreover, we suggest further steps to be
taken for holographically realizing Homes' law more generally in the presence

phase-space density or velocity anisotropy profiles, however, the origin of
these universalities remains a mystery. Any equilibrated dark matter structure
can be fully described by two functions, namely the radial and the tangential
velocity distribution functions (VDF), and when we will understand these two
then we will understand all the observed universalities. Here we demonstrate
that if we know the radial VDF, then we can derive and understand the
tangential VDF. This is based on simple dynamical arguments about properties of
collisionless systems. We use a range of controlled numerical simulations to
demonstrate the accuracy of this result. We therefore boil the question of the
dark matter structural properties down to understanding the radial VDF.

linear matter power spectrum at high redshift from the cosmic microwave
background (CMB), anisotropic clustering of the CMASS DR9 galaxies alone
constrains $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.308 \pm 0.022$ and $100\Omega_{\rm k} = 5.9 \pm
4.8$ for $w = -1$, or $w = -0.91 \pm 0.12$ for $\Omega_k = 0$. When combined
with the full CMB likelihood, the addition of the anisotropic clustering
measurements to the spherically-averaged BAO location increases the
constraining power on dark energy by a factor of 4 in a flat CDM cosmology with
constant dark energy equation of state $w$ (giving $w = -0.87 \pm 0.05$). This
impressive gain depends on our measurement of both the growth of structure and
Alcock-Paczynski effect, and is not realised when marginalising over the
amplitude of redshift space distortions. Combining with both the CMB and
Supernovae Type Ia (SNeIa), we find $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.281 \pm 0.014$ and
$1000\Omega_{\rm k}=-9.2\pm5.0$ for $w = -1$, or $w_0 = -1.13 \pm 0.12$ and
$w_{\rm a}=0.65 \pm 0.36$ assuming $\Omega_k = 0$. Finally, when a $\Lambda$CDM
background expansion is assumed, the combination of our estimate of the growth
rate with previous growth measurements provides tight constraints on the
parameters describing possible deviations from GR giving $\gamma = 0.64 \pm
0.05$. For one parameter extensions of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we find a
$\sim 2\sigma$ preference either for $w > -1$ or slower growth than in GR.
However, the data is fully consistent with the concordance model, and the
evidence for these additional parameters is weaker than $2\sigma$.

of spin polarization and spin-orbit coupling. For neutral and negatively
charged Mn12 SMMs with acetate or benzoate ligands the model yields the total
SMM spin, the spins of the individual Mn ions, the magnetic easy axis
orientation, the size of the magnetic anisotropy barrier and the size of the
HOMO-LUMO gap consistent with experiment. For neutral molecules the predicted
spins and spatial locations of the HOMO are consistent with the results of
density functional calculations. For the total spin and location of the LUMO
density functional theory-based calculations yield varied results while the
present model yield results consistent with experiments on negatively charged
molecules. For Mn12 SMMs with thiolate- and methylsulphide-terminated benzoate
ligands (Mn12-Ph-Th) we find the HOMO to be located on the magnetic core of the
molecule, but (unlike for the Mn12 SMMs that have previously been studied
theoretically), we predict the LUMO and near LUMO orbitals of Mn12-Ph-Th to be
located on ligands. Therefore we predict that for these Mn12 SMMs resonant and
off-resonant coherent transport via near-LUMO orbitals, not subject to Coulomb
blockade, should occur. We propose that this effect can be used to identify
specific experimentally realized SMM transistors in which the easy axis and
magnetic moment are approximately parallel to the direction of the current
flow. We also predict effective spin filtering by these SMMs to occur at low
bias whether the transport is mediated by the HOMO that is on the magnetic core

Lorentz symmetry have been investigated only for flat (Minkowskian) spacetimes
represents a very significant limitation, since for propagation over
cosmological distances the curvature/expansion of spacetime is evidently
tangible. We here provide a significant step toward filling this gap by
exhibiting an explicit example of Planck-scale-deformed relativistic symmetries
of a spacetime with constant rate of expansion (deSitterian). Technically we
obtain the first ever example of a relativistic theory of worldlines of
particles with 3 nontrivial relativistic invariants: a large speed scale
(""speed-of-light scale""), a large distance scale (inverse of the
""expansion-rate scale""), and a large momentum scale (""Planck scale""). We
address some of the challenges that had obstructed success for previous
attempts by exploiting the recent understanding of the connection between
deformed Lorentz symmetry and relativity of spacetime locality. We also offer a
preliminary analysis of the differences between the scenario we here propose

first study of the spectra of two-component neural networks was carried out by

'inhibitory', and strengths of synapses from different types of neurons have
Gaussian distributions with different means and variances. A surprising finding
by Rajan and Abbott is that the eigenvalue spectra of these types of random
synaptic matrices do not depend on the mean values of their elements. In this
paper we prove that this is true even for a much more general type of random
neural network, where there is a finite number of types of neurons, and their
synaptic strengths have correlated distributions. Furthermore, using the
diagrammatic techniques, we calculate the explicit formula for the spectra of

lensing measures to inform the precision of lens optical alignment, with
specific reference to the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We compute optics spot
diagrams and calculate the shear and flexion of the PSF as a function of
position on the focal plane. For perfect optical alignment we verify the high
quality of the DES optical design, finding a maximum PSF contribution to the
weak lensing shear of 0.04 near the edge of the focal plane. However this can
be increased by a factor of approximately three if the lenses are only just
aligned within their maximum specified tolerances. We calculate the E and
B-mode shear and flexion variance as a function of de-centre or tilt of each
lens in turn. We find tilt accuracy to be a few times more important than
de-centre, depending on the lens considered. Finally we consider the compound
effect of de-centre and tilt of multiple lenses simultaneously, by sampling
from a plausible range of values of each parameter. We find that the compound
effect can be around twice as detrimental as when considering any one lens
alone. Furthermore, this combined effect changes the conclusions about which

on the effects of the quenched disordered shell bonds, as well as interface
bonds on the magnetic properties of the system. A complete picture of the phase
diagrams and magnetization profiles has been represented. It has been shown
that for the antiferromagnetic nanowire system, the magnetization curves can be
classified according to N\'{e}el theory of ferrimagnetism and it has been found
that under certain conditions, the magnetization profiles may exhibit Q-type,
P-type, N-type and L-type behaviors. The observed L-type behavior has not been
reported in the literature before for the equilibrium properties of nanoscaled
magnets. As another interesting feature of the system, it has been found that a
compensation point can be induced by a bond dilution process in the surface.
Furthermore, we have not found any evidence of neither the first order phase
transition characteristics, nor the reentrance phenomena.

energy-efficient photonic communication networks in future high-performance

the power consumption of optical transmitters via the resonant circulation of
light. However, resonant modulators have traditionally suffered from a
trade-off between their power consumption and maximum operation bit rate, which
were thought to depend oppositely upon the cavity linewidth. Here, we break
this linewidth limitation using a silicon microring. By controlling the rate at
which light enters and exits the microring, we demonstrate modulation free of
the parasitic cavity linewidth limitations at up to 40 GHz, more than 6x the
cavity linewidth. The device operated at 28 Gb/s using single-ended drive
signals less than 1.5 V. The results show that high-Q resonant modulators can
be designed to be simultaneously low-power and high-speed, features which are

stellar wind of nearby stars around Sgr A*. The accretion flow with the
plausible parameters is non-stationary and an irregularly oscillating shock is
formed in the inner region of a few tens to a hundred and sixty Schwarzschild
radii. Due to the oscillating shock, the luminosity and the mass-outflow rate
are modulated by several per cent to a factor of 5 and a factor of 2-7,
respectively, on time-scales of an hour to ten days. The flows are highly
advected and the radiative efficiency of the accreting matter into radiation is
very low, 10^{-5}--$10^{-3}, and the input accretion rate of 4.0* 10^{-6} solar
mass/yr results in the observed luminosities -- 10^{36} erg/s of Sgr A* if a
two-temperature model and the synchrotron emission are taken into account. The
mass-outflow rate of the gas originating in the post-shock region increases
with the increasing input specific angular momentum and ranges from a few to 99
per cent of the input accreting matter, depending on the input angular
momentum. The oscillating shock is necessarily triggered if the specific
angular momentum and the specific energy belong to or are located just nearby
in the range of parameters responsible for a stationary shock in rotating
inviscid and adiabatic accretion flow. The time variability may be relevant to
the flare activity of Sgr A*.

dissipation of energy, the decay of coherences, the relaxation to an
equilibrium or non-equilibrium stationary state, and the transport of
excitations in complex structures are of central importance in many
applications of quantum mechanics. The theoretical description, analysis and
control of non-Markovian quantum processes play an important role in this
context. While in a Markovian process an open system irretrievably loses
information to its surroundings, non-Markovian processes feature a flow of
information from the environment back to the open system, which implies the
presence of memory effects and represents the key property of non-Markovian
quantum behavior. Here, we review recent ideas developing a general
mathematical definition for non-Markoviantiy in the quantum regime and a
measure for the degree of memory effects in the dynamics of open systems which
are based on the exchange of information between system and environment. We
further study the dynamical effects induced by the presence of

KOIs as eclipsing binaries, update the ephemeris for five KOIs and otherwise
discuss yet other objects. Interestingly, about 1/3 of the newly detected
candidates participate in period commensurabilities. Finally, we discuss the
possible overestimation of parameter errors in the current list of KOIs.
  Conclusions. Our results strengthen previous analyses of the multi-transiting
ensemble. Nevertheless, we conclude that despite the phenomenal success of the
Kepler mission, parallel analysis of the data by multiple teams is required to
make full use of the data. [ABRIDGED]

many and discussed in detail in for example the remarkable work Winning Ways by
Conway, Berlekamp and Guy. We describe how comply variations of these games,
similar to those introduced by Holshouser, Reiter, Smith, St\u{a}nic\u{a}, can
be defined as having its sets of winning positions identical to well-known sets
avoiding arithmetic progressions such as $x+z=2y$, studied by Szerkeres, Erd\H
os and Tur\'an, and many others, thus exploring a new territory combining ideas
from combinatorial games and combinatorial number theory. The sets we have in
mind are greedy, that is, for our example: recursively a new nonnegative
integer is included to the set if and only if it does not form a three term
arithmetic progression with the smaller entries. It is known that the set thus
obtained is equivalent to the following log-linear time closed expression: each
winning position contains exclusively the digits 0 and 1 in base 3 expansion.
In fact this set is impossible as a set of winning positions for a classical
subtraction game, in a sense introduced recently by Duch\^ene and Rigo.
Therefore our comply-rule generalization of the subtraction games can be seen
to resolve new classes of sets as winning positions for heap games. In this
context the $\star$-operator for invariant subtraction games was introduced by
Larsson, Hegarty and Fraenkel. We define a similar operator for our game. Our
comply games generalize into several dimensions. In two dimensions the winning
positions can be represented by certain greedy permutations avoiding arithmetic
progressions, one of which was recently introduced by Hegarty; while others
generalize classical combinatorial games such as Nim and Wythoff Nim.

communication networks with packet loss compared with routing. However, using
network coding usually incurs high computational and storage costs in the
network devices and terminals. For example, some network coding schemes require
the computational and/or storage capacities of an intermediate network node to
increase linearly with the number of packets for transmission, making such
schemes difficult to be implemented in a router-like device that has only
constant computational and storage capacities. In this paper, we introduce
BATched Sparse code (BATS code), which enables a digital fountain approach to
resolve the above issue. BATS code is a coding scheme that consists of an outer
code and an inner code. The outer code is a matrix generation of a fountain
code. It works with the inner code that comprises random linear coding at the
intermediate network nodes. BATS codes preserve such desirable properties of
fountain codes as ratelessness and low encoding/decoding complexity. The
computational and storage capacities of the intermediate network nodes required
for applying BATS codes are independent of the number of packets for
transmission. Almost capacity-achieving BATS code schemes are devised for
unicast networks, two-way relay networks, tree networks, a class of three-layer
networks, and the butterfly network. For general networks, under different
optimization criteria, guaranteed decoding rates for the receiving nodes can be
obtained.

far-IR transmittance, low resistivity, and excellent ohmic contact. The
Al-doped Ge layer has the far-IR transmittance of >95 % within the wavelength

observation of non-Fermi-liquid behavior of dense 3He films at low
temperatures. Abnormal behavior of the specific heat C(T) of two-dimensional
liquid 3He is demonstrated in the occurrence of a T-independent term in C(T).
To uncover the origin of this phenomenon, we have considered the group velocity
of transverse zero sound propagating in a strongly correlated Fermi liquid. For
the first time, it is shown that if two-dimensional liquid 3He is located in
the vicinity of the quantum critical point associated with a divergent
quasiparticle effective mass, the group velocity depends strongly on
temperature and vanishes as T is lowered toward zero. The predicted vigorous
dependence of the group velocity can be detected in experimental measurements
on liquid 3He films. We have demonstrated that the contribution to the specific
heat coming from the boson part of the free energy due to the transverse
zero-sound mode follows the Dulong-Petit Law. In the case of two-dimensional
liquid 3He, the specific heat becomes independent of temperature at some
characteristic temperature of a few mK.

undergoes a topological phase transition to a band insulator under an external
electric field. The spin polarization is unique and opposite at the K and K'
points due to the spin-orbit coupling. Accordingly, silicene exhibits a strong
circular dichroism with respect to optical absorption, obeying a certain
spin-valley selection rule. It is remarkable that this selection rule is
drastically different between these two types of insulators owing to a band
inversion taking place at the phase transition point. Hence we can tell
experimentally whether silicene is in the topological or band insulator phase
by circular dichroism. Furthermore the selection rule enables us to excite
electrons with definite spin and valley indices by optical absorption.
Photo-induced current is spin polarized, where the spin direction is different
between the topological and band insulators. It is useful for future
spintronics applications.

the stability and macroscopic behavior of polycrystalline materials. The
research objective in this work is to better characterize the energetics and
length scales involved with the process of solute and impurity segregation to
grain boundaries. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to calculate the
segregation energies for carbon within multiple grain boundary sites over a
database of 125 symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Fe. The simulation results
show that the majority of atomic sites near the grain boundary have segregation
energies lower than in the bulk. Moreover, depending on the boundary, the
segregation energies approach the bulk value approximately 5-12 \AA\ away from
the center of the grain boundary, providing an energetic length scale for
carbon segregation. A subsequent data reduction and statistical representation
of this dataset provides critical information such as about the mean
segregation energy and the associated energy distributions for carbon atoms as
a function of distance from the grain boundary, which quantitatively informs
higher scale models with energetics and length scales necessary for capturing
the segregation behavior of impurities in Fe. The significance of this research
is the development of a methodology capable of ascertaining segregation
energies over a wide range of grain boundary character (typical of that
observed in polycrystalline materials), which herein has been applied to carbon
segregation in a specific class of grain boundaries in iron.

type system feature requires extending the metatheory and implementation, which
are often complicated and fragile. To ease this process, we would like to
provide general mechanisms that subsume many different features.
  In modern type systems, parametric polymorphism is fundamental, but
intersection polymorphism has gained little traction in programming languages.
Most practical intersection type systems have supported only refinement
intersections, which increase the expressiveness of types (more precise
properties can be checked) without altering the expressiveness of terms;
refinement intersections can simply be erased during compilation. In contrast,
unrestricted intersections increase the expressiveness of terms, and can be
used to encode diverse language features, promising an economy of both theory
and implementation.
  We describe a foundation for compiling unrestricted intersection and union
types: an elaboration type system that generates ordinary lambda-calculus
terms. The key feature is a Forsythe-like merge construct. With this construct,
not all reductions of the source program preserve types; however, we prove that
ordinary call-by-value evaluation of the elaborated program corresponds to a
type-preserving evaluation of the source program.
  We also describe a prototype implementation and applications of unrestricted
intersections and unions: records, operator overloading, and simulating dynamic
typing.

a specified length and no memory across the blocks. The multi-user model is
called an information network with in-block memory (NiBM). It is shown that
block-fading channels, channels with state known causally at the encoder, and
relay networks with delays are NiBMs. A cut-set bound is developed for NiBMs
that unifies, strengthens, and generalizes existing cut bounds for discrete
memoryless networks. The bound gives new finite-letter capacity expressions for
several classes of networks including point-to-point channels, and certain
multiaccess, broadcast, and relay channels. Cardinality bounds on the random
coding alphabets are developed that improve on existing bounds for channels
with action-dependent state available causally at the encoder and for relays
without delay. Finally, quantize-forward network coding is shown to achieve
rates within an additive gap of the new cut-set bound for linear, additive,
Gaussian noise channels, symmetric power constraints, and a multicast session.

(MSSMS), which generalizes two well-known problems -- the $k$-server problem,
and metrical service systems. The MSSMS problem is to service requests, each of
which is an $l$-point subset of a metric space, using $k$ servers, with the
objective of minimizing the total distance traveled by the servers.
  Feuerstein initiated a study of this problem by proving upper and lower
bounds on the deterministic competitive ratio for uniform metric spaces. We
improve Feuerstein's analysis of the upper bound and prove that his algorithm
achieves a competitive ratio of $k({{k+l}\choose{l}}-1)$. In the randomized
online setting, for uniform metric spaces, we give an algorithm which achieves
a competitive ratio $\mathcal{O}(k^3\log l)$, beating the deterministic lower
bound of ${{k+l}\choose{l}}-1$. We prove that any randomized algorithm for
MSSMS on uniform metric spaces must be $\Omega(\log kl)$-competitive. We then
prove an improved lower bound of ${{k+2l-1}\choose{k}}-{{k+l-1}\choose{k}}$ on
the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm for $(k,l)$-MSSMS, on
general metric spaces. In the offline setting, we give a pseudo-approximation
algorithm for $(k,l)$-MSSMS on general metric spaces, which achieves an
approximation ratio of $l$ using $kl$ servers. We also prove a matching
hardness result, that a pseudo-approximation with less than $kl$ servers is
unlikely, even for uniform metric spaces. For general metric spaces, we
highlight the limitations of a few popular techniques, that have been used in
algorithm design for the $k$-server problem and metrical service systems.

orbits together with extended chaotic regions. Numerical experiments suggest,
that the degree of chaos increases rapidly, as the energy of the test particle
increases. About 97% of the phase plane of the 2D system is covered by chaotic
orbits for large energies. The regular or chaotic character of the 2D orbits is
checked using the S(c) dynamical spectrum, while for the 3D potential we use
the S(c) spectrum, along with the P(f) spectral method. Comparison with other

normalized log density (NLD), is considered. Poltyrev's capacity for this
channel is the highest achievable NLD, at possibly large block length, that
guarantees a vanishing error probability. For a given finite block length n and
a fixed error probability, there is a gap between the highest achievable NLD
and Poltyrev's capacity. As in other channels, this gap asymptotically vanishes
as the square root of the channel dispersion V over n, multiplied by the
inverse Q-function of the allowed error probability. This dispersion, derived
in the paper, equals the dispersion of the power constrained fast fading
channel at the high SNR regime. Connections to the error exponent of the peak
power constrained fading channel are also discussed.

30 GeV was severely constrained in the minimal supersymmetric standard model
(MSSM), unless it annihilates via a light stau and thus yields the observed
dark matter abundance. In such a scenario, while the stau is the
next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP), the charginos and the other
neutralinos as well as sleptons of the first two families are also likely to be
not too far above the mass bounds laid down by the Large Electron Positron
(LEP) collider. As the branching ratios of decays of the charginos and the
next-to-lightest neutralino into staus are rather large, one expects
significant rates of tau-rich final states in such a case. With this in view,
we investigate the same-sign ditau and tri-tau signals of this scenario at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for two MSSM benchmark points corresponding to
light neutralino dark matter. The associated signal rates for these channels
are computed, for the centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. We find that both
channels lead to appreciable rates if the squarks and the gluino are not too
far above a TeV, thus allowing to probe scenarios with light neutralinos in the
