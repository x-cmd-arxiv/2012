different substrates (i.e., MgO (001), MgAl2O4 (001) and Al2O3 (0001)) with
thicknesses varying from 50 to 350 nm. Atomic Force Microscopy analysis
indicated a granular nature of the samples, irrespective of the synthesis
conditions (precursor and deposition temperature, Tpre) and substrate. Despite
the similar morphology of the films, magnetic and transport properties were
found to depend on the precursor used for deposition. Using [FeIIFe2III(OBut)8]
as precursor resulted in lower resistivity, higher MS and a sharper
magnetization decrease at the Verwey transition (TV). The temperature
dependence of resistivity was found to depend on the precursor and Tpre. We
found that the transport is dominated by the density of antiferromagnetic
antiphase boundaries (AF-APB's) when [FeIIFe2III(OBut)8] precursor and Tpre =
363 K are used. On the other hand, grain boundary-scattering seems to be the
main mechanism when [Fe2III(OBut)6] is used. The Magnetoresistance (MR(H))

key construction is a map, given by Knutson and Hausmann using the Hopf map on

polygon space is defined by pushing forward Haar measure on the Stiefel
manifold by this map. A similar construction yields a probability measure on
plane polygons which comes from a real Stiefel manifold.
  The edgelengths of polygons sampled according to our measures obey beta
distributions. This makes our polygon measures different from those usually
studied, which have Gaussian or fixed edgelengths. One advantage of our
measures is that we can explicitly compute expectations and moments for
chordlengths and radii of gyration. Another is that direct sampling according
to our measures is fast (linear in the number of edges) and easy to code.
  Some of our methods will be of independent interest in studying other
probability measures on polygon spaces. We define an edge set ensemble (ESE) to
be the set of polygons created by rearranging a given set of n edges. A key
theorem gives a formula for the average over an ESE of the squared lengths of
chords skipping k vertices in terms of k, n, and the edgelengths of the
ensemble. This allows one to easily compute expected values of squared
chordlengths and radii of gyration for any probability measure on polygon space

has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and
uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design
and analysis of ""big data"" measurements.
  This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical
systems, based on the ""dynamics of observables"" picture. The central object is
the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is
nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of
this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers
and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the
Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise
manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would
like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to
provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was
described in detail.
  We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman
eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept we
provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them,
numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when
possible, applications that made use of them.
  The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic
and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its
strengths, in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas
where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as
an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.

bound convective velocity magnitudes in the solar interior, as a function of
depth and spherical-harmonic degree $\ell$. Within the wavenumber band
$\ell<60$, Convective velocities are 20-100 times weaker than current

turbulence from that predicted by existing models, prompting the question: what
mechanism transports the heat flux of a solar luminosity outwards? Advection is
dominated by Coriolis forces for wavenumbers $\ell<60$, with Rossby numbers
smaller than $\sim10^{-2}$ at $r/R_\odot=0.96$, suggesting that the Sun may be
a much faster rotator than previously thought, and that large-scale convection

localization transition is observed at large disorder, in agreement with
Anderson localization on the Cayley tree.

the process of Bose-Einstein (BE) condensation of a dilute cold gas is
considered. If the particle flux into the low-energy modes, induced, e.g., by a
cooling quench, is sufficiently strong, the Bose gas develops a characteristic
power-law single-particle spectrum $n(k)\sim k^{-5}$, and critical slowing down
in time occurs. The fixed point is shown to be marked by the creation and
dilution of tangled vortex lines. Alternatively, for a weak cooling quench and
particle flux, the condensation process runs quasi adiabatically, passing by
the fixed point in far distance, and signatures of critical scaling remain
absent.

of threads, whose activation is exclusive and controlled by a cooperative
scheduling policy: threads execute, without any interruption, until they either
terminate or yield the control explicitly to the scheduler. The formal
verification of such software poses significant challenges. On the one side,
each thread may have infinite state space, and might call for abstraction. On
the other side, the scheduling policy is often important for correctness, and
an approach based on abstracting the scheduler may result in loss of precision
and false positives. Unfortunately, the translation of the problem into a
purely sequential software model checking problem turns out to be highly
inefficient for the available technologies. We propose a software model
checking technique that exploits the intrinsic structure of these programs.
Each thread is translated into a separate sequential program and explored
symbolically with lazy abstraction, while the overall verification is
orchestrated by the direct execution of the scheduler. The approach is
optimized by filtering the exploration of the scheduler with the integration of
partial-order reduction. The technique, called ESST (Explicit Scheduler,
Symbolic Threads) has been implemented and experimentally evaluated on a
significant set of benchmarks. The results demonstrate that ESST technique is
way more effective than software model checking applied to the sequentialized
programs, and that partial-order reduction can lead to further performance
improvements.

that M is symplectic and the action is Hamiltonian. If the manifold satisfies
an extra ""positivity condition"" this algorithm determines a family of vector
spaces which contain the admissible lattices of weights.
  When the number of fixed points is minimal, this positivity condition is
necessarily satisfied whenever dim(M)< 8, and, when dim(M)=8, whenever the
S^1-action extends to an effective Hamiltonian T^2-action, or none of the

via a direct calculation of the impurity internal energy requiring only the
evaluation of local quantities within a single numerical renormalization group
(NRG) calculation for the total system. For the Anderson impurity model, we
show that the impurity internal energy can be expressed as a sum of purely
local static correlation functions and a term that involves also the impurity
Green function. The temperature dependence of the latter can be neglected in
many cases, thereby allowing the impurity specific heat, $C_{\rm imp}$, to be
calculated accurately from local static correlation functions; specifically via
$C_{\rm imp}=\frac{\partial E_{\rm ionic}}{\partial T} + 1/2\frac{\partial
E_{\rm hyb}}{\partial T}$, where $E_{\rm ionic}$ and $E_{\rm hyb}$ are the
energies of the (embedded) impurity and the hybridization energy, respectively.
The term involving the Green function can also be evaluated in cases where its
temperature dependence is non-negligible, adding an extra term to $C_{\rm
imp}$. For the non-degenerate Anderson impurity model, we show by comparison
with exact Bethe ansatz calculations that the results recover accurately both
the Kondo induced peak in the specific heat at low temperatures as well as the
high temperature peak due to the resonant level. The approach applies to
multiorbital and multichannel Anderson impurity models with arbitrary local
Coulomb interactions. An application to the Ohmic two state system and the
anisotropic Kondo model is also given, with comparisons to Bethe ansatz

Appeared in Electronic Journal of Probability in 2007",,,,"math.CO cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that if $\gS=(V,E)$ is a regular bipartite graph for which the
expansion of subsets of a single parity of $V$ is reasonably good and which
satisfies a certain local condition (that the union of the neighbourhoods of
adjacent vertices does not contain too many pairwise non-adjacent vertices),
and if $\cM$ is a Markov chain on the set of proper 3-colourings of $\gS$ which
updates the colour of at most $\rho|V|$ vertices at each step and whose
stationary distribution is uniform, then for $\rho \approx .22$ and $d$
sufficiently large the convergence to stationarity of $\cM$ is (essentially)
exponential in $|V|$. In particular, if $\gS$ is the $d$-dimensional hypercube
$Q_d$ (the graph on vertex set $\{0,1\}^d$ in which two strings are adjacent if
they differ on exactly one coordinate) then the convergence to stationarity of
the well-known Glauber (single-site update) dynamics is exponentially slow in
$2^d/(\sqrt{d}\log d)$. A combinatorial corollary of our main result is that in
a uniform 3-colouring of $Q_d$ there is an exponentially small probability (in
$2^d$) that there is a colour $i$ such the proportion of vertices of the even
subcube coloured $i$ differs from the proportion of the odd subcube coloured
$i$ by at most $.22$. Our proof combines a conductance argument with
combinatorial enumeration methods.

under separation conditions, Kumar and Kannan[2010] introduced a deterministic
condition for clustering datasets. They showed that this single deterministic
condition encompasses many previously studied clustering assumptions. More
specifically, their proximity condition requires that in the target
$k$-clustering, the projection of a point $x$ onto the line joining its cluster
center $\mu$ and some other center $\mu'$, is a large additive factor closer to
$\mu$ than to $\mu'$. This additive factor can be roughly described as $k$
times the spectral norm of the matrix representing the differences between the
given (known) dataset and the means of the (unknown) target clustering.
Clearly, the proximity condition implies center separation -- the distance
between any two centers must be as large as the above mentioned bound.
  In this paper we improve upon the work of Kumar and Kannan along several
axes. First, we weaken the center separation bound by a factor of $\sqrt{k}$,
and secondly we weaken the proximity condition by a factor of $k$. Using these
weaker bounds we still achieve the same guarantees when all points satisfy the
proximity condition. We also achieve better guarantees when only
$(1-\epsilon)$-fraction of the points satisfy the weaker proximity condition.
The bulk of our analysis relies only on center separation under which one can
produce a clustering which (i) has low error, (ii) has low $k$-means cost, and
(iii) has centers very close to the target centers.
  Our improved separation condition allows us to match the results of the
Planted Partition Model of McSherry[2001], improve upon the results of
Ostrovsky et al[2006], and improve separation results for mixture of Gaussian
models in a particular setting.

$G$. Levit and Mandrescu have conjectured that for all bipartite $G$ the
sequence $(i_t(G))_{t \geq 0}$ (the {\em independent set sequence} of $G$) is
unimodal. We provide evidence for this conjecture by showing that is true for
almost all equibipartite graphs. Specifically, we consider the random
equibipartite graph $G(n,n,p)$, and show that for any fixed $p\in(0,1]$ its
independent set sequence is almost surely unimodal, and moreover almost surely
log-concave except perhaps for a vanishingly small initial segment of the

  We also consider the problem of estimating $i(G)=\sum_{t \geq 0} i_t(G)$ for
$G$ in various families. We give a sharp upper bound on the number of
independent sets in an $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree $\delta$, for all

bright stars. Here we show through simulation and theory that an adaptive pupil
mask can be used to reduce these speckles and increase the visibility of faint
companions. This is achieved by placing an adaptive mask in the conjugate pupil
plane of the telescope. The mask consists of a number of independently
controllable elements which can either allow the light in the subaperture to
pass or block it. This actively changes the shape of the telescope pupil and
hence the diffraction pattern in the focal plane. By randomly blocking
subapertures we force the quasi-static speckles to become dynamic. The long
exposure PSF is then smooth, absent of quasi-static speckles. However, as the
PSF will now contain a larger halo due to the blocking, the signal to noise
ratio (SNR) is reduced requiring longer exposure times to detect the companion.
For example, in the specific case of a faint companion at 5xlambda/D the
exposure time to achieve the same SNR will be increased by a factor of 1.35. In
addition, we show that the visibility of companions can be greatly enhanced in
comparison to long-exposures, when the dark speckle method is applied to short
exposure images taken with the adaptive pupil mask. We show that the contrast
ratio between PSF peak and the halo is then increased by a factor of
approximately 100 (5 magnitudes), and we detect companions 11 magnitudes

an arbitrary single-qubit circuit to this canonical form. We focus on the

high-temperature superconductors (HTSC) is studied for various
heterostructures. We first consider a ballistic planar junction between a HTSC
and a metallic ferromagnet. We assume that inversion symmetry breaking at the
tunnel barrier gives rise to Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the barrier and
allows equal-spin triplet superconductivity to exist in the ferromagnet.
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations are obtained by explicitly modeling the barrier,
and taking account of the transport anisotropy in the HTSC. By making use of
the self-consistent boundary conditions and solutions for the barrier and HTSC
regions, an effective equation of motion for the ferromagnet is obtained where
Andreev scattering at the barrier is incorporated as a boundary condition for
the ferromagnetic region. For a ferromagnet layer deposited on a (100) facet of
the HTSC, triplet p-wave superconductivity is induced. For the layer deposited
on a (110) facet, the induced gap does not have the p-wave orbital character,
but has an even orbital symmetry and an odd dependence on energy. For the layer
on the (001) facet, an exotic f-wave superconductivity is induced. We also
consider the induced triplet gap in a one-dimensional half-metallic nanowire
deposited on a (001) facet of a HTSC. We find that for a wire axis along the
a-axis, a robust triplet p-wave gap is induced. For a wire oriented 45 degrees
away from the a-axis the induced triplet p-wave gap vanishes. For the
appropriately oriented wire, the induced p-wave gap should give rise to
Majorana fermions at the ends of the half-metallic wire. Based on our result,
topological superconductivity in a semi-conductor nanowire may also be possible
given that it is oriented along the a-axis of the HTSC.

extrasolar planets. This has become possible with measurements of radii and

planets. Uniting all this observational data into one coherent picture to
better understand planet formation is an important, but difficult undertaking.
Our approach is to develop a model which can make testable predictions for all
these observational methods. We continue to describe how we have extended our
formation model into a self-consistently coupled formation and evolution model.
We show how we calculate the internal structure of the solid core and
radiogenic heating. We also improve the protoplanetary disk model. Finally, we
conduct population synthesis calculations. We present how the planetary
mass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H/He envelopes forms and
evolves in time. The basic shape of the M-R relation can be understood from the
core accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while
super-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to
""forbidden"" zones in the M-R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable
diversity of radii. We compare the synthetic M-R relation with the observed
one, finding good agreement for a>0.1 AU. The synthetic radius distribution is
characterized by a strong increase towards small R, and a second, lower local
maximum at ~1 Jovian radius. The increase towards small radii reflects the
increase of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to
the fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. A
comparison of the synthetic radius distribution with Kepler data shows
agreement for R>2 Earth radii, but divergence for smaller radii. We predict
that in the next few years, Kepler should find the second, local maximum at ~1

inflation and differentiate among different scenarios. The scale-dependent
imprint of PNG on the large-scale clustering of galaxies and quasars has
already been used to place significant constraints on the level of PNG in our
observed Universe. Such measurements depend upon an accurate and robust theory
of how PNG affects the bias of galactic halos relative to the underlying matter
density field. We improve upon previous work by employing a more general
analytical method - the path-integral extension of the excursion set formalism
- which is able to account for the non-Markovianity caused by PNG in the
random-walk model used to identify halos in the initial density field. This
non-Markovianity encodes information about environmental effects on halo
formation which have so far not been taken into account in analytical bias
calculations. We compute both scale-dependent and -independent corrections to
the halo bias, along the way presenting an expression for the conditional
collapsed fraction for the first time, and a new expression for the conditional

coverage, and develop a method for inferring the true host galaxy properties.
We compare AGN host galaxy properties to those of a sample of UV-selected,
star-forming non-AGNs in the same redshift range, including a subsample
carefully matched in stellar mass. Although the AGNs have higher masses and
SFRs than the full non-active sample, their stellar population properties are
consistent with those of the mass-selected sample, suggesting that the presence
of an AGN is not connected with the cessation of star-formation activity in
star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2 - 3. We suggest that a correlation between M_BH

evolution of stars. However, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport in
stars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account in
stellar models. To achieve a better understanding of these processes, we
desperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars,
which until very recently were restricted to the Sun. In this paper, we report
the detection of mixed modes - i.e. modes that behave both as g modes in the
core and as p modes in the envelope - in the spectrum of the early red giant
KIC7341231, which was observed during one year with the Kepler spacecraft. By
performing an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show that
its non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able to
determine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes. We then find a
stellar model that reproduces very well the observed atmospheric and seismic
properties of the star. We use this model to perform inversions of the internal
rotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of the
star is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. This will shed
new light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. In
particular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angular
momentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, which
could help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed over
the last decades.

propose the momentum-space entanglement spectrum as a means of characterizing
disordered models. We show that localization in 1D arises from the momentum
space entanglement between left and right movers and illustrate our methods
using explicit models with spatially correlated disorder that exhibit phases
which avoid complete Anderson localization. The momentum space entanglement
spectrum clearly reveals the location of delocalized states in the energy
spectrum and can be used as a signature of the phase transition between a
delocalized and localized phase.

RM distribution about the Galactic plane. This is consistent with a disk field
in the Perseus arm of even parity across the Galactic mid-plane. In the range
15<|b|<30 degs, we find median rotation measures of -15+/-4 rad/m^2 and -62+/-5
rad/m^2 in the northern and southern Galactic hemispheres, respectively. If the
RM distribution is a signature of the large-scale field parallel to the
Galactic plane, this suggests that the halo magnetic field toward the outer
Galaxy does not reverse direction across the mid-plane. The variation of RM as
a function of Galactic latitude in this longitude range is such that RMs become
more negative at larger |b|. This is consistent with an azimuthal magnetic
field of strength 2 microGauss (7 microGauss) at a height 0.8-2 kpc above

statistical distributions of simultaneous MASS--DIMM seeing measurements, in
order to investigate the nightly, monthly, seasonal, annual and global
behaviour, as well as possible hourly seeing trends. Although this campaign
covers five years, the sampling is uneven, being 2006 and 2007 the best sampled

of 0.78 (DIMM), 0.37 (MASS) and 0.59 arcsec (GL). The strongest contribution to

Velocity fields in a vertical and a horizontal plane are measured in the

libration frequency $\sigma_0$ is smaller than twice the mean rotation rate
$\Omega_0$, inertial waves can propagate in the interior of the fluid. At
arbitrary excitation frequencies $\sigma_0<2\Omega_0$, the oscillating flow
shows two contributions: (i) a basic flow induced by the libration motion, and
(ii) inertial wave beams propagating obliquely upward and downward from the

modes may also be excited at some specific resonant frequencies. We
characterize in particular the resonance of the mode of lowest order compatible

the Chandra ephemeris reported earlier and the spectral properties remained
constant. The source luminosity decreased to a level of 1.6x10^34 erg s^-1
following a decay trend of $\propto t^{-0.5}$. Our spatial analysis of the
source environment revealed the presence of two extended emission regions
around the source. The first (Region A) is a symmetric ring around the point
source, starting at 25arcsec and extending to ~50arcsec. We argue that Region A
is a dust scattering halo. The second (Region B) has an asymmetrical shape
extending between 50arcsec and 150arcsec, and is detected both in the pre- and

energy loss is substantially higher than those of rotation powered pulsars:
$\eta_{\rm X}\equiv L_{\rm MWN,0.5-8 keV}/\dot{E}_{\rm rot}\approx0.7$. The

resemble the shape of the Initial Mass Function (IMF). A similar result is
observed for the dust clumps in high-mass star forming regions, although at
spatial scales of clusters that do not resolve the substructure found in them.
The region IRAS 19410+2336 is one exception, having been observed at spatial
scales on the order of ~2500AU, resolving the clump substructure into
individual cores.
  We mapped that region with the PdBI in the 1.4mm and 3mm continuum and
several transitions of H2CO and CH3CN. The H2CO transitions were also observed
with the IRAM 30m Telescope. We detected 26 continuum sources at 1.4mm with a
spatial resolution down to ~2200 AU, distributed in two protoclusters. With the
lines emission we derived the temperature structure of the region, ranging from
35 to 90K. With them we calculated the core masses of the detected sources,
ranging from ~0.7 to ~8 M_sun. These masses were strongly (~90%) affected by
the interferometer spatial filtering. Considering only the detected dense cores
we derived a CMF with a power-law index b=-2.3+-0.2. We resolve the Jeans
length of the protoclusters by one order of magnitude, and only find little
velocity dispersion between the different subsources.
  Since we cannot unambiguously differentiate protostellar and prestellar
cores, the derived CMF is not prestellar. Also, because of the large missing
flux, we cannot establish a firm link between the CMF and the IMF. This implies
that future high-mass CMF studies will need to complement the interferometer
continuum data with the short spacing data, a task suitable for ALMA. We note
that the method of extracting temperatures using H2CO lines becomes less
applicable when reaching the dense core scales of the interferometric
observations because most of the H2CO appears to originate in the envelope
structure.

viewing the Milky Way from outside at various inclinations as spiral galaxies
are observed. When seen edge-on the synchrotron emission from the Milky Way has
an exponential scale-height of about 0.74 kpc, which is much smaller than the
values obtained from previous models. We find that current analysis methods
overestimate the scale-height of synchrotron emission of galaxies by about 10%
at an inclination of 80 degree and about 40% at an inclination of 70 degree

derived from high-frequency polarisation measurements approximate to the
Faraday depths (FDs) when scaled by a factor of two. For edge-on galaxies, the
observed RMs are indicative of the orientation of the large-scale magnetic
field, but are not well related with the FDs. Assuming energy equipartition
between the magnetic field and particles for the Milky Way results in an
average magnetic-field strength, which is about two times larger than the
intrinsic value for a K factor of 100. The number distribution of the
integrated polarisation percentages of a large sample of unresolved
Milky-Way-like galaxies peaks at about 4.2% at 4.8 GHz and at about 0.8% at

that WRF-Sfire is capable of providing realistic head fire rate-of-spread and
the vertical temperature structure of the fire plume, and, up to 10 m above
ground level, fire-induced surface flow and vertical velocities within the
plume. The model captured the changes in wind speed and direction before,
during, and after fire front passage, along with arrival times of wind speed,
temperature, and updraft maximae, at the two instrumented flux towers used in
FireFlux. The model overestimated vertical velocities and underestimated
horizontal wind speeds measured at tower heights above the 10 m, and it is
hypothesized that the limited model resolution over estimated the fire front
depth, leading to too high a heat release and, subsequently, too strong an
updraft. However, on the whole, WRF-Sfire fire plume behavior is consistent
with the interpretation of FireFlux observations. The study suggests optimal

The central object of this nebula has previously been described as a late-type
K giant barium star with a possible hot companion, most likely a young
pre-white dwarf. UVOT photometry shows that while the optical photometry is
consistent with a large cool object, the near-ultraviolet (UV) photometry shows
far more UV flux than could be produced by any late-type object. Using model
stellar atmospheres and a comparison to UVOT photometry for the pre-white dwarf
PG 1159-035, we find that the companion has a temperature of at least 40,000 K
and a radius of, at most, 0.056 R_sun. While the temperature and radius are
consistent with a hot compact stellar remnant, they are lower and larger,
respectively, than expected for a typical young pre-white dwarf. This likely
indicates a deficiency in the assumed UV extinction curve. We find that higher
temperatures more consistent with expectations for a pre-white dwarf can be
derived if the foreground dust has a strong ""blue bump"" at 2175 AA and a lower
R_V. Our results demonstrate the ability of Swift to both uncover and
characterize hot hidden companion stars and to constrain the UV extinction
properties of foreground dust based solely on UVOT photometry.

Fifth problem. In a separate development, we construct a nontrivial topology

the theory of (local) nonstandard Lie groups and within that framework prove a
nonstandard result that implies that a family of local Lie groups that converge
in a pointwise sense must then differentiability converge, up to coordinate
change, to an analytic local Lie group, see corollary 6.1. The second result
essentially says that a pair of mappings that almost satisfy the properties
defining a local Lie group must have a local Lie group nearby, see proposition
7.1. Pairing the above two results, we get the principal standard consequence
of the above work, corollary 7.2, which can be roughly described as follows. If
we have pointwise equicontinuous family of mapping pairs (potential local
Euclidean topological group structures), pointwise approximating a (possibly
differentiably unbounded) family of differentiable (suffi- ciently approximate)
almost groups, then the original family has, after appropriate coordinate
change, a local Lie group as a limit point. The third set of results give
nonstandard renditions of equicontinuity criteria for families of
differentiable functions, see theorem 9.1. These results are critical in the
proofs of the principal results of this thesis as well as the standard
interpretations of the main results here. Following this material, we have a

necessary to achieve performance goals in a wireless network. The problem of
determining the feasibility and stability of cooperation between rational nodes
in a wireless network is of great importance in understanding cooperative
behavior. This paper addresses the stability of the grand coalition of
transmitters signaling over a multiple access channel using the framework of
cooperative game theory. The external interference experienced by each TX is
represented accurately by modeling the cooperation game between the TXs in
\emph{partition form}. Single user decoding and successive interference
cancelling strategies are examined at the receiver. In the absence of
coordination costs, the grand coalition is shown to be \emph{sum-rate optimal}
for both strategies. Transmitter cooperation is \emph{stable}, if and only if
the core of the game (the set of all divisions of grand coalition utility such
that no coalition deviates) is nonempty. Determining the stability of
cooperation is a co-NP-complete problem in general. For a single user decoding
receiver, transmitter cooperation is shown to be \emph{stable} at both high and
low SNRs, while for an interference cancelling receiver with a fixed decoding
order, cooperation is stable only at low SNRs and unstable at high SNR. When
time sharing is allowed between decoding orders, it is shown using an
approximate lower bound to the utility function that TX cooperation is also
stable at high SNRs. Thus, this paper demonstrates that ideal zero cost TX
cooperation over a MAC is stable and improves achievable rates for each
individual user.

statistics, a ""super statistics"". We consider first, the Gamma, log-normal and
$F$-distributions of $\beta$. It is assumed that they depend only on $p_l$, the
probability associated with the microscopic configuration of the system. For
each of the three $\beta-$distributions we calculate the Boltzmann factors and
show that they coincide for small variance of the fluctuations. For the Gamma
distribution it is possible to calculate the entropy in a closed form,
depending on $p_l$, and to obtain then an equation relating $p_l$ with $\beta
E_l$. We also propose, as other examples, new entropies close related with the
Kaniadakis and two possible Sharma-Mittal entropies. The entropies presented in
this work do not depend on a constant parameter $q$ but on $p_l$. For the
$p_l$-Gamma distribution and its corresponding $B_{p_l}(E)$ Boltzmann factor
and the associated entropy, we show the validity of the saddle-point
approximation. We also briefly discuss the generalization of one of the four
Khinchin axioms to get this proposed entropy.

overcome the Maratos effect, the higher-order correction direction is obtained

of varying the area fraction of the smaller component on structure,
compressibility factor and dynamics of the highly size-asymmetric binary

are only weakly perturbed by adding small disks. The higher-order static
correlations of the large disks, by contrast, can be strongly affected. The
compressibility factor of the system first decreases and then increases upon
increasing the area fraction of the small disks and separating different
contributions to it allows to rationalize this non-monotonic phenomenon.
Furthermore, adding small disks can influence dynamics of the system in
quantitative and qualitative ways. For the large disks, the structural
relaxation time increases monotonically with increasing the area fraction of
the small disks at low and moderate area fractions of the large disks. In
particular, ""reentrant"" behavior appears at sufficiently high area fractions of
the large disks, strongly resembling the reentrant glass transition in
short-ranged attractive colloids and the inverted glass transition in binary
hard spheres with large size disparity. By tuning the area fraction of the
small disks, relaxation process for the small disks shows concave-to-convex
crossover and logarithmic decay behavior, as found in other binary mixtures
with large size disparity. Moreover, diffusion of both species is suppressed by
adding small disks. Long-time diffusion for the small disks shows
power-law-like behavior at sufficiently high area fractions of the small disks,
which implies precursors of a glass transition for the large disks and a
localization transition for the small disks. Therefore, our results demonstrate
the generic dynamic features in highly size-asymmetric binary mixtures.

originating call in the cell coverage area also uses these guard channels if
they are unused. Our basic idea is to allow Guard channels to be shared between
new calls and handoff calls. This approach maximizes the channel utilization.
The simulation results prove that the channel borrowing scheme improves the
overall throughput.

of systems that are driven far out of equilibrium, and they provide strong
constraints on the fraction of trajectories that behave atypically in light of
the second law. They have mainly been derived for a predetermined external
drive applied to the system. However, to improve the efficiency of a process,
one needs to incorporate protocols that are modified by receiving feedbacks
about the recent state of the system, during its evolution. In such a case, the
forms of the conventional fluctuation theorems get modified, the correction
term involving terms that depend on the way the reverse/conjugate process is
defined, namely, the rules of using feedback in order to generate the exact
time-reversed/conjugate protocols. We show in this paper that this can be done
in a large number of ways, and in each case we would get a different expression
for the correction terms. This would in turn lead to several lower bounds on
the mean work that must be performed on the system, or on the entropy changes.
Here we analyze a form of the extended fluctuation theorems that involves the
efficacy parameter, and find that this form gives rise to a lower bound for the
mean work that retains a consistent physical meaning regardless of the design
of feedback along the conjugate process, as opposed to the case of the
previously mentioned form of the modified fluctuation theorems.

three commonly encountered rare event probabilities associated with random

deviation probabilities, 2) the level crossing probabilities, and 3) the level
crossing probabilities within a regenerative cycle. Exponential twisting based
state-independent methods, which are effective in efficiently estimating these
probabilities for light-tailed increments are not applicable when the
increments are heavy-tailed. To address the latter case, more complex and
elegant state-dependent efficient simulation algorithms have been developed in
the literature over the last few years. We propose that by suitably decomposing
these rare event probabilities into a dominant and further residual components,
simpler state-independent importance sampling algorithms can be devised for
each component resulting in composite unbiased estimators with desirable
efficiency properties. When the increments have infinite variance, there is an
added complexity in estimating the level crossing probabilities as even the
well known zero-variance measures have an infinite expected termination time.
We adapt our algorithms so that this expectation is finite while the estimators
remain strongly efficient. Numerically, the proposed estimators perform at
least as well, and sometimes substantially better than the existing
state-dependent estimators in the literature.

and proper motions of the jet and counterjet knots. Our results show that the
motion of the knots is essentially ballistic, with the exception of the
farthest knots, which trace the large scale C-shape bending of the jet. The
observed bending of the jet can be produced by a relative motion of the HH 30
star with respect to its surrounding environment, caused either by a possible
proper motion of the HH 30 star, or by the entrainment of environment gas by
the red lobe of the nearby L1551-IRS 5 outflow. Alternatively, the bending can
be produced by the stellar wind from a nearby CTTS, identified in the 2MASS
catalog. The proper motion velocities of the knots of the counterjet show more
variations than those of the jet. In particular, we identify two knots of the
counterjet that have the same kinematic age but whose velocities differ by
almost a factor of two. Thus, it appears that counterjet knots launched
simultaneously can be ejected with very different velocities. We confirm that
the observed wiggling of the jet and counterjet arises from the orbital motion
of the jet source in a binary system. Precession is of secondary importance in
shaping the jet. We derive an orbital period $\tau_o=114\pm2$ yr and a mass
function $m\mu_c^3=0.014\pm0.006$ $M_\odot$. For a mass of the system of
$m=0.45\pm0.04$ $M_\odot$ (the value inferred from the disk kinematics) we
obtain a mass $m_j=0.31\pm0.04$ $M_\odot$ for the jet source, a mass
$m_c=0.14\pm0.03$ $M_\odot$ for the companion, and a binary separation of
$a=18.0\pm0.6$ AU. This binary separation coincides with the value required to
account for the size of the inner hole observed in the disk, attributed to
tidal truncation in a binary system.

In the compute-and-forward strategy, the relay computes a function of the two

transmitted by user nodes in a Gaussian multiple access (MAC) channel, and the
computed function value is forwarded to the user nodes in an ensuing broadcast
phase. In this paper, we study the problem under an additional security
constraint, which requires that each user's message be kept secure from the
relay. We consider two types of security constraints: perfect secrecy, in which
the MAC channel output seen by the relay is independent of each user's message;
and strong secrecy, which is a form of asymptotic independence. We propose a
coding scheme based on nested lattices, the main feature of which is that given
a pair of nested lattices that satisfy certain ""goodness"" properties, we can
explicitly specify probability distributions for randomization at the encoders
to achieve the desired security criteria. In particular, our coding scheme
guarantees perfect or strong secrecy even in the absence of channel noise. The
noise in the channel only affects reliability of computation at the relay, and
for Gaussian noise, we derive achievable rates for reliable and secure
computation. We also present an application of our methods to the multi-hop
line network in which a source needs to transmit messages to a destination

Segregation corresponds to the degree of network modularity, while integration
is expressed in terms of the algebraic connectivity of an associated
hyper-graph. The rigorous treatment of the simplified case of cliques of equal
size that are gradually rewired until they become completely merged, allows us
to show that this topological crossover can be made to coincide with a
dynamical crossover from cluster to global synchronization of a system of
coupled phase oscillators. The dynamical crossover is signaled by a peak in the
product of the measures of intra-cluster and global synchronization, which we
propose as a dynamical measure of complexity. This quantity is much easier to
compute than the entropy (of the average frequencies of the oscillators), and
displays a behavior which closely mimics that of the dynamical complexity index
based on the latter. The proposed toplogical measure simultaneously provides
information on the dynamical behavior, sheds light on the interplay between
modularity vs total integration and shows how this affects the capability of
the network to perform both local and distributed dynamical tasks.

goal is to provide a sample of lenses with a broad range of different
morphologies and lens-source brightness contrast in order estimate a lower
limit to the number of galaxy-scale strong lenses in the future Euclid survey
in its VIS band. Our criteria to select lenses are purely morphological as we
do not use any colour or redshift information.The final candidate selection is
very conservative hence leading to a nearly pure but incomplete sample. We find
49 new lens candidates: 40 in the ACS images and 9 in the WFC3 images. Out of
these, 16 candidates are secure lenses owing to their striking morphology, 21
more are very good candidates, and 12 more have morphologies compatible with
gravitational lensing but also compatible with other astrophysical objects. It
is therefore insensitive to cosmic variance and allows to estimate the number
of galaxy-scale strong lenses on the sky for a putative survey depth, which is
the main result of the present work. Because of the incompleteness of the
sample, the estimated lensing rates should be taken as lower limits. Using
these, we anticipate that a 15 000 square degrees space survey such as Euclid
will find at least 60 000 galaxy-scale strong lenses down to a limiting AB
magnitude of I = 24.5 (10-sigma) or I = 25.8 (3-sigma).

multiorbital Hubbard models is studied within a dynamical mean field theory
framework. Comparison of static magnetic susceptibilities and local densities
of states of two- and three-orbital models of a complete rotationally invariant
Coulomb interaction and a ""density-density"" Hartree type interaction shows the
different role of spin-flip interactions for different band fillings. In the
particle-hole symmetric case the Mott-Hubbard physics dominates due to the
strong effective Coulomb interaction, while for the multiple electronic
configurations away from half-filling (two electrons in the three band model)
the formation of local magnetic moments due to Hund's exchange interaction
becomes the most significant effect for itinerant magnetic systems. A shift of
the temperature of magnetic ordering due to the rotationally-invariant Hund's
rule coupling is found to be the largest in a three-orbital model with a
two-electron occupancy where the single particle spectrum is metallic and is
not sensitive to different forms of the Coulomb vertex. A larger enhancement of
the effective mass in a model with a rotationally-invariant interaction is
discussed. In the half-filled case we find a drastic change in the density of
states close to the Mott transition which is related to the spin-flip Kondo
fluctuations in a degenerate orbital case, while the corresponding shift of the
magnetic transition temperature is relatively small. It is shown that a change
in the ground state degeneracy due to a different symmetry of the Coulomb
interaction in the density-density model leads to a breakdown of the
quasiparticle peak at the Fermi level in the proximity of a Mott transition on
the metallic side. We discuss the relevance of rotationally-invariant Hund's
interaction in the transition metal magnetism.

case, first, representation of the $\pi\pi$ background is unsatisfactory;
second, the data on the coupled process $\pi\pi\to K\bar{K}$ are not well
described even qualitatively above 1.15 GeV when using the resonance parameters
from the only $\pi\pi$ scattering analysis. The combined analysis of these
coupled processes is needed, which is carried out satisfactorily. Then both
above-indicated flaws, related to the analysis of solely the
$\pi\pi$-scattering, are cured. The most remarkable change of parameters with
respect to the values of only $\pi\pi$ scattering analysis appears for the mass
of the $f_0 (600)$ which is now in some accordance with the Weinberg prediction
on the basis of mended symmetry and with an analysis using the large-$N_c$
consistency conditions between the unitarization and resonance saturation. The
obtained $\pi\pi$-scattering length $a_0^0$ in case when we restrict to the
analysis of the $\pi\pi$ scattering or consider so-called A-solution (with a
lower mass and width of $f_0(600)$ meson) agrees well with prediction of chiral
perturbation theory (ChPT) and with data extracted at CERN by the NA48/2

We find that the system develops a steady-state orbital magnetic moment in the
presence of a static magnetic field. Very significantly, the sign of the
orbital magnetic moment turns out to be {\it paramagnetic} for our choice of
parameters, varied over a wide range. This is shown specifically for the case
of classical dynamics driven by a Kubo-Anderson type non-markovian noise.
Natural spatial boundary condition was imposed through (1) a soft (harmonic)
confining potential, and (2) a hard potential, approximating a reflecting wall.
There was no noticeable qualitative difference. What appears to be crucial to
the orbital magnetic effect noticed here is the non-markovian property of the
driving noise chosen. Experimental realization of this effect on the laboratory
scale, and its possible implications are briefly discussed. We would like to
emphasize that the above steady-state classical orbital paramagnetic moment
complements, rather than contradicts the Bohr-van Leeuwen (BvL) theorem on the
absence of classical orbital diamagnetism in thermodynamic equilibrium.

gauge bosons and one multiplet of vector and axial-vector massive resonance
states. Using the dispersive representation of Peskin and Takeuchi and imposing
the short-distance constraints dictated by the operator product expansion, we
obtain S at the NLO in terms of a few resonance parameters. In
asymptotically-free gauge theories, the final result only depends on the
vector-resonance mass and requires M_V > 1.8 TeV (3.8 TeV) to satisfy the
experimental limits at the 3 \sigma (1\sigma) level; the axial state is always
heavier, we obtain M_A > 2.5 TeV (6.6 TeV) at 3\sigma (1\sigma). In
strongly-coupled models, such as walking or conformal technicolour, where the
second Weinberg sum rule does not apply, the vector and axial couplings are not
determined by the short-distance constraints; but one can still derive a lower
bound on S, provided the hierarchy M_V < M_A remains valid. Even in this less
constrained situation, we find that in order to satisfy the experimental limits
at 3\sigma one needs M_{V,A} > 1.8 TeV.

gas-phase metallicities of star-forming galaxies depend on environment. We find
that satellite and central galaxies follow a qualitatively similar stellar mass
(M_*) - gas-phase metallicity relation. Satellites, though, have higher
gas-phase metallicities than equally massive centrals, and this difference
increases with decreasing M_*. We also find that the gas-phase metallicity of
satellites increases with halo mass at fixed stellar mass. This increment is
more pronounced for less massive galaxies. We also show that low mass satellite
galaxies have higher gas-phase metallicities than central galaxies of the same
stellar metallicity. This difference becomes negligible for more massive
galaxies of roughly solar metallicity. We demonstrate that the observed
differences in gas-phase metallicity between centrals and satellites at fixed
M_* are not a consequence of stellar mass stripping (advocated by Pasquali et
al. in order to explain similar differences but in stellar metallicity), nor to
the past star formation history of these galaxies as quantified by their
surface mass density or gas mass fraction. Rather, we argue that these trends
probably originate from a combination of three environmental effects: (i)
strangulation, which prevents satellite galaxies from accreting new, low
metallicity gas which would otherwise dilute their ISM, (ii) ram-pressure
stripping of the outer gas disk, thereby inhibiting radial inflows of
low-metallicity gas, and (iii) external pressure provided by the hot gas of the
host halo which prevents metal-enriched outflows from escaping the galaxies.

naturally avoided by using the full information from the search, considering
both the selected data and our ignorance of the data that are thrown away, and
considering all relevant signal and noise models. This approach produces
unbiased estimates of parameters even in the presence of false alarms and

these spectra we measure general metallicities, abundances of Fe and the
alpha-elements, and radial velocities (RV) of the stars. These measurements as
well as photometric data are compared to simulations with the Besancon and
TRILEGAL models of the Galaxy. We confirm the presence of two populations among
our sample stars: i) a metal-rich one at [M/H] ~+0.3, comprising about 30% of
the sample, with low RV dispersion and low alpha-abundance, and ii) a
metal-poor population at [M/H] ~-0.6 with high RV dispersion and high
alpha-abundance. The metal-rich population could be connected to the Galactic
bar. We identify this population as the carrier of the double RC feature. We do
not find a significant difference in metallicity or RV between the two RCs, a
small difference in metallicity being probably due to a selection effect. The
RV dispersion agrees well with predictions of the Besancon Galaxy model, but
the metallicity of the ""thick bulge"" model component should be shifted to lower
metallicity by 0.2 to 0.3dex to well reproduce the observations. We present
evidence that the metallicity distribution function depends on the evolutionary
state of the sample stars, suggesting that enhanced mass loss preferentially

similar to that obtained around Minkowski. We take great care at exploring the
partially massless limit and define the unique fully non-linear candidate
theory that is free of the helicity-0 mode in the decoupling limit, and which

different from that of partially massless gravity. As a result, there is no
discontinuity between massive gravity and its partially massless limit, just in
the same way as there is no discontinuity in the massless limit of massive
gravity. The usual bounds on the graviton mass could therefore equivalently
well be interpreted as bounds on m^2-2H^2. When dealing with the exact
partially massless parameters, on the other hand, the symmetry at m^2=2H^2

show that for circumbinary planetesimals, in addition to secular forcing,
eccentricities evolve on a dynamical timescale, which leads to orbital
crossings even in the presence of gas drag. This makes the current locations of
the circumbinary Kepler planets hostile to planetesimal accretion. We then
present results from simulations including planetesimal formation and dust
accretion, and show that even in the most favourable case of 100% efficient
dust accretion, in situ growth starting from planetesimals smaller than ~10 km
is difficult for Kepler 16b, Kepler 34b and Kepler 35b. These planets were
likely assembled further out in the disk, and migrated inward to their current
location.

consider developing practical models for the deterministic, slow/coarse
behavior of the ODE system. Two types of coarse variables are considered. The
first type consists of running finite time averages of phase functions.
Approaches to construct the coarse evolution equation for this type are
discussed and implemented on a 'Forced' Lorenz system and a singularly
perturbed system whose fast flow does not necessarily converge to an
equilibrium. We explore two strategies. In one, we compute (locally) invariant
manifolds of the fast dynamics, parameterized by the slow variables. In the
other, the choice of our coarse variables automatically guarantees them to be
'slow' in a precise sense. This allows their evolution to be phrased in terms
of averaging utilizing limit measures (probability distributions) of the fast
flow. Coarse evolution equations are constructed based on these approaches and
tested against coarse response of the 'microscopic' models. The second type of
coarse variables are defined as (non-trivial) scalar state functions that are
required by design to evolve autonomously, to the extent possible, with the
goal of being candidate state functions for unambiguously initializable coarse
dynamics. The question motivates a mathematical restatement in terms of a
first-order PDE. A computational approximation is developed and tested on the
Lorenz system and the Hald Hamiltonian system.

functions that deviate slightly from Maxwellian. Of interest are undamped waves
that are the small amplitude limit of nonlinear excitations, such as electron
acoustic waves (EAWs). A deviation consisting of a small plateau, a region with
zero velocity derivative over a width that is a very small fraction of the
electron thermal speed, is shown to give rise to new undamped modes, which here
are named {\it corner modes}. The presence of the plateau turns off Landau
damping and allows oscillations with phase speeds within the plateau. These
undamped waves are obtained in a wide region of the $(k,\omega_{_R})$ plane
($\omega_{_R}$ being the real part of the wave frequency and $k$ the
wavenumber), away from the well-known `thumb curve' for Langmuir waves and EAWs
based on the Maxwellian. Results of nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson simulations that
corroborate the existence of these modes are described. It is also shown that
deviations caused by fattening the tail of the distribution shift roots off of
the thumb curve toward lower $k$-values and chopping the tail shifts them
toward higher $k$-values. In addition, a rule of thumb is obtained for
assessing how the existence of a plateau shifts roots off of the thumb curve.
Suggestions are made for interpreting experimental observations of
electrostatic waves, such as recent ones in nonneutral plasmas.

framework to represent and treat functional shapes, i.e. sub-manifold supported
signals. It is motivated by the growing occurrence, in medical imaging and
computational anatomy, of what can be described as geometrico-functional data,
that is a data structure that involves a deformable shape (roughly a finite
dimensional sub manifold) together with a function defined on this shape taking
value in another manifold.
  Indeed, if mathematical currents have already proved to be very efficient
theoretically and numerically to model and process shapes as curves or
surfaces, they are limited to the manipulation of purely geometrical objects.
We show that the introduction of the concept of functional currents offers a
genuine solution to the simultaneous processing of the geometric and signal
information of any functional shape. We explain how functional currents can be
equipped with a Hilbertian norm mixing geometrical and functional content of
functional shapes nicely behaving under geometrical and functional
perturbations and paving the way to various processing algorithms. We
illustrate this potential on two problems: the redundancy reduction of
functional shapes representations through matching pursuit schemes on
functional currents and the simultaneous geometric and functional registration
of functional shapes under diffeomorphic transport.

  Framework and Application to Identity Management",,,,,"cs.CR cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the growing amount of personal information exchanged over the Internet,
privacy is becoming more and more a concern for users. One of the key
principles in protecting privacy is data minimisation. This principle requires
that only the minimum amount of information necessary to accomplish a certain
goal is collected and processed. ""Privacy-enhancing"" communication protocols
have been proposed to guarantee data minimisation in a wide range of
applications. However, currently there is no satisfactory way to assess and
compare the privacy they offer in a precise way: existing analyses are either
too informal and high-level, or specific for one particular system. In this
work, we propose a general formal framework to analyse and compare
communication protocols with respect to privacy by data minimisation. Privacy
requirements are formalised independent of a particular protocol in terms of
the knowledge of (coalitions of) actors in a three-layer model of personal
information. These requirements are then verified automatically for particular
protocols by computing this knowledge from a description of their
communication. We validate our framework in an identity management (IdM) case
study. As IdM systems are used more and more to satisfy the increasing need for
reliable on-line identification and authentication, privacy is becoming an
increasingly critical issue. We use our framework to analyse and compare four
identity management systems. Finally, we discuss the completeness and
(re)usability of the proposed framework.
