population of the family and its dynamical clustering are preserved over Gyr
timescales. We find that the family is not younger than 100 Myr, and its age is
at least 1 Gyr with 95% confidence. We find that for initial velocity
dispersions of 50-400 m/s, approximately 20-45% of the family members are lost
to close encounters with Neptune after 3.5 Gyr of orbital evolution. We apply
these loss rates to two proposed models for the formation of the Haumea family,
a graze-and-merge type collision between two similarly sized, differentiated
KBOs or the collisional disruption of a satellite orbiting Haumea. For the
graze-and-merge collision model, we calculate that >85% of the expected mass in
surviving family members within 150 m/s of the collision has been identified,
but that one to two times the mass of the known family members remains to be
identified at larger velocities. For the satellite-break-up model, we estimate
that the currently identified family members account for ~50% of the expected
mass of the family. Taking observational incompleteness into account, the
observed number of Haumea family members is consistent with either formation
scenario at the 1 sigma level, however both models predict more objects at

atmospheres of galaxy clusters over more than three quarters of the age of the
Universe. Our sample was drawn from eight major X-ray cluster surveys, and
includes 685 clusters in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.6 that overlap the area
covered by the NVSS. The radio AGN mechanical power was estimated from the
radio luminosity of central NVSS sources, using the relation of Cavagnolo et
al. 2010 that is based on mechanical powers determined from the enthalpies of
X-ray cavities. We find only a weak correlation between radio luminosity and
cluster X-ray luminosity, although the most powerful radio sources resides in
luminous clusters. The average AGN mechanical power of 3x10^{44} erg/s exceeds
the X-ray luminosity of 44% of the clusters, indicating that the accumulation
of radio-AGN energy is significant in these clusters. Integrating the AGN
mechanical power to redshift z=2, using simple models for its evolution and
disregarding the hierarchical growth of clusters, we find that the AGN energy
accumulated per particle in low luminosity X-ray clusters exceeds 1 keV per
particle. This result represents a conservative lower limit to the accumulated
thermal energy. The estimate is comparable to the level of energy needed to
""preheat"" clusters, indicating that continual outbursts from radio-AGN are a
significant source of gas energy in hot atmospheres. Assuming an average mass
conversion efficiency of $\eta=0.1$, our result implies that the supermassive
black holes that released this energy did so by accreting an average of ~10^9
M_{sun} over time, which is comparable to the level of growth expected during
the quasar era.

Entropy follows $\frac{dS}{dt}=e_p^{\#}-h_d^{\#}$. Our formulation is shown to
be consistent with an earlier theory of P. Ao. Its contradistinctions to other

of inflation that accounts for dissipative effects, to provide an explicit
proof to leading (non-trivial) order in the generalized slow roll parameters
and mixing with gravity scales. Our results illustrate the conditions necessary
for the validity of the consistency relation in situations with many degrees of
freedom relevant during inflation, namely that there is a preferred clock.
Departures from this condition in forthcoming experiments would rule out not
only single field but also a large class of multi-field models.

below 650 K, which is attributed to the Burns temperature (TB). On the other
hand, the line width of the longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon mode exhibits a
sharp Landau-Khalatnikov-like maximum and an accompanying anomaly in the LA
mode frequency around 463 K, the tetragonal-cubic phase transition temperature
(Ttc). In addition, a broad central peak, found below the characteristic
intermediate temperature T* ~ 525 K, exhibits critical slowing down upon
approaching Ttc indicating an order-disorder nature of the phase transition.
The relaxation time of polar nano regions estimated from the broad central peak
is found to be same as that obtained for LA phonon mode suggesting an
electrostrictive coupling between strain and polarization fluctuations. The
activation energy for the PNRs relaxation-dynamics is found to be ~236 meV.
Polarized nature of the central peak suggests that the polar nano regions have
the tendency to form long-range polar ordering.

upon Co substitution and how it coexists with superconductivity. In the
non-superconducting samples at 0 < x < 0.04 the antiferromagnetic order
parameter is only moderately suppressed. With the onset of superconductivity
this suppression becomes faster and it is most rapid between x = 0.045 and
0.05. As was previously demonstrated by muSR at x = 0.055 [P. Marsik et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 57001 (2010)], the strongly weakened antiferromagnetic
order is still a bulk phenomenon that competes with superconductivity. The
comparison with neutron diffraction data suggests that the antiferromagnetic
order remains commensurate whereas the amplitude exhibits a spatial variation
that is likely caused by the randomly distributed Co atoms. A different kind of
magnetic order that was also previously identified [C. Bernhard et al., New J.
Phys. 11, 055050 (2009)] occurs at 0.055 < x < 0.075 where Tc approaches the
maximum value. The magnetic order develops here only in parts of the sample
volume and it seems to cooperate with superconductivity since its onset
temperature coincides with Tc. Even in the strongly overdoped regime at x =
0.11, where the static magnetic order has disappeared, we find that the low
energy spin fluctuations are anomalously enhanced below Tc. These findings
point toward a drastic change in the relationship between the magnetic and
superconducting orders from a competitive one in the strongly underdoped regime
to a constructive one in near optimally and overdoped samples.

The latest results obtained by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the HiRes

fluctuations of the atmospheric depth at which the showers reach the maximum
development, Xmax, are inconsistent. From comparison with air shower
simulations it can be seen that, while the Auger data may be interpreted as a
gradual transition to heavy nuclei for energies larger than ~ 2-3x10^18 eV, the
HiRes data are consistent with a composition dominated by protons. In Ref. [1]
it is suggested that a possible explanation of the observed deviation of the
mean value of Xmax from the proton expectation, observed by Auger, could
originate in a statistical bias arising from the approximated exponential shape
of the Xmax distribution, combined with the decrease of the number of events as
a function of primary energy. In this paper we consider a better description of
the Xmax distribution and show that the possible bias in the Auger data is at
least one order of magnitude smaller than the one obtained when assuming an
exponential distribution. Therefore, we conclude that the deviation of the
Auger data from the proton expectation is unlikely explained by such
statistical effect.

separately and then collect the results assuming that the electron-phonon

study the derivation of the equations of motion for the classical spin vector

high temperature limit. At finite temperatures we show that the Markovian
approximation for the fluctuations is not correct for time scales below some
thermal correlation time $\tau_{Th}$. For the case of electrons we workout a
perturbative expansion of the Feynman-Vernon functional. We find the expression
for the random field correlation function. The composite model (as well as the
individual models) is shown to satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation theorem for

these last results are independent of the characteristic of the ground field.
Our techniques involve the Eisenbud-Sturmfels theory of binomial ideals and
Laurent polynomial rings, together with theory of Smith Normal Form and of

Thermal ionization of alkali metals in such gas exceeds non-thermal ionization
when temperatures climb above roughly 1000 K. As a result, the conductiv- ity,
proportional to the ionization fraction, gains a strong, positive dependence on
temperature. In this paper, we demonstrate that this relation between the
temperature and the conductivity triggers an exponential instability that acts
similarly to an electrical short, where the increased conductivity concentrates
the current and locally increases the Ohmic heating. This contrasts with the
resistiv- ity increase expected in an ideal magnetic reconnection region. The
instability acts to focus narrow current sheets into even narrower sheets with
far higher currents and temparatures. We lay out the basic principles of this
behavior in this paper using protoplanetary disks as our example host system,
motivated by observations of chondritic meteorites and their ancestors, dust
grains in protoplanetary disks, that reveal the existence of strong, frequent
heating events that this instability could explain.

to many H II regions, whose free-free absorption blocks low frequency radio

of starbursts assume a uniform medium of ionized gas, if they include the
absorption at all. I calculate the effective absorption coefficient of H II
regions in starbursts, which is ultimately a cross section times the density of
H II regions. The cross sections are calculated by assuming that H II regions

part way into the starburst's synchrotron emitting material. Considering
Str\""omgren spheres around either OB stars or Super Star Clusters, I
demonstrate the method by fitting to the low frequency radio spectrum of M82. I
discuss implications of the results for synchrotron spectrum shape, H II region
pressure, and free-free emission as a star-formation rate indicator. However,
these results are preliminary, and could be affected by systematics. I argue
that there is no volume-filling warm ionized medium in starbursts, and that H
II regions may be the most important absorption process down to ~10 MHz. Future
data at low and high radio frequency will improve our knowledge of the ionized

isomorphic to a given graph H in a given graph G such that there are no edges

Independent Set and Induced Matching problems, among several other problems. We
show that Induced Graph Matching is fixed-parameter tractable in k on claw-free
graphs when H is a fixed connected graph, and even admits a polynomial kernel
when H is a complete graph. Both results rely on a new, strong, and generic
algorithmic structure theorem for claw-free graphs.
  Complementing the above positive results, we prove W[1]-hardness of Induced
Graph Matching on graphs excluding K_1,4 as an induced subgraph, for any fixed
complete graph H. In particular, we show that Independent Set is W[1]-hard on
K_1,4-free graphs.
  Finally, we consider the complexity of Induced Graph Matching on a large
subclass of claw-free graphs, namely on proper circular-arc graphs. We show
that the problem is either polynomial-time solvable or NP-complete, depending
on the connectivity of H and the structure of G.

channeled polarimetry, is to encode the polarization information at each
wavelength along the spatial dimension of a 2D data array using static, robust
optical components. A single two-dimensional data frame contains the full
polarization information and can be configured to measure either two or all of
the Stokes polarization parameters. By acquiring full polarimetric information
in a single observation, we simplify polarimetry of transient sources and in
situations where the instrument and target are in relative motion. The
robustness and simplicity of the approach, coupled to its potential for high

useful for applications in challenging environments such as space.

further elucidation. We now see Newtonian mass as an emergent property. Most of
the mass of standard matter, by far, arises dynamically, from back-reaction of
the color gluon fields of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The equations for
massless particles support extra symmetries - specifically scale, chiral, and
gauge symmetries. The consistency of the standard model relies on a high degree
of underlying gauge and chiral symmetry, so the observed non-zero masses of
many elementary particles ($W$ and $Z$ bosons, quarks, and leptons) requires
spontaneous symmetry breaking. Superconductivity is a prototype for spontaneous
symmetry breaking and for mass-generation, since photons acquire mass inside
superconductors. A conceptually similar but more intricate form of
all-pervasive (i.e. cosmic) superconductivity, in the context of the
electroweak standard model, gives us a successful, economical account of $W$
and $Z$ boson masses. It also allows a phenomenologically successful, though
profligate, accommodation of quark and lepton masses. The new cosmic
superconductivity, when implemented in a straightforward, minimal way, suggests
the existence of a remarkable new particle, the so-called Higgs particle. The
mass of the Higgs particle itself is not explained in the theory, but appears
as a free parameter. Earlier results suggested, and recent observations at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may indicate, the actual existence of the Higgs
particle, with mass $m_H \approx 125$ GeV. In addition to consolidating our
understanding of the origin of mass, a Higgs particle with $m_H \approx 125$
GeV could provide an important clue to the future, as it is consistent with
expectations from supersymmetry.

observations of GJ 676A, a nearby M dwarf with one reported gas giant
companion. We re-derived Doppler measurements using the template matching
method (HARPS-TERRA). We used refined versions of periodograms to assess the
presence of additional low-mass companions. We analyse the same dataset with
Bayesian tools and compared the performance of both approaches. We confirm the
reported massive gas giant candidate and a long period trend, whose curvature
is now well detected. We also find very secure evidence of two new candidates
in close-in orbits and masses in the super-Earth mass regime. Despite the
increased sensitivity of the new periodogram tools, we find that Bayesian
methods are more sensitive in the early detection of candidate signals. While
hardware development is important, development of data analysis techniques can
help to reveal new results from existing data sets with significantly fewer
resources. This new system holds the record of minimum-mass range (from Msin i

social dilemma. Yet the reality is much less clear-cut. Between the two
extremes lies an interval of ambivalent choices, which may be captured
theoretically by means of continuous strategies defining the extent of the
contributions of each individual player to the common pool. If strategies are
chosen from the unit interval, where 0 corresponds to pure defection and 1
corresponds to the maximal contribution, the question is what is the
characteristic level of individual investments to the common pool that emerges
if the evolution is guided by different benefit functions. Here we consider the
steepness and the threshold as two parameters defining an array of generalized
benefit functions, and we show that in a structured population there exist
intermediate values of both at which the collective contributions are maximal.
However, as the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation increases the
characteristic threshold decreases, while the corresponding steepness
increases. Our observations remain valid if more complex sigmoid functions are
used, thus reenforcing the importance of carefully adjusted benefits for high
levels of public cooperation.

fast and accurate computational tool to determine the gravitational waveforms
yielded by generic spinning binaries of neutron stars and/or black holes on
eccentric orbits. This is done within the post-Newtonian (PN) framework by
integrating the equations of motion and the spin precession equations while the
radiation field is determined by a simultaneous evaluation of the analytic
waveforms. In applying CBwaves various physically interesting scenarios have
been investigated. In particular, we have studied the appropriateness of the
adiabatic approximation, and justified that the energy balance relation is
indeed insensitive to the specific form of the applied radiation reaction term.
By studying eccentric binary systems it is demonstrated that circular template
banks are very ineffective in identifying binaries even if they possess tiny
residual orbital eccentricity. In addition, by investigating the validity of
the energy balance relation we show that, on contrary to the general
expectations, the post-Newtonian approximation should not be applied once the
post-Newtonian parameter gets beyond the critical value $\sim 0.08-0.1$.
Finally, by studying the early phase of the gravitational waves emitted by
strongly eccentric binary systems---which could be formed e.g. in various
many-body interactions in the galactic halo---we have found that they possess
very specific characteristics which may be used to identify these type of
binary systems.

high-quality spectroscopic redshifts in the completed zCOSMOS-bright survey.
The catalog published herein contains 1498 groups in total and 192 groups with
more than five observed members. The catalog includes both group properties and
the identification of the member galaxies. Based on mock catalogs, the
completeness and purity of groups with three and more members should be both
about 83% with respect to all groups that should have been detectable within
the survey, and more than 75% of the groups should exhibit a one-to-one
correspondence to the ""real"" groups. Particularly at high redshift, there are
apparently more galaxies in groups in the COSMOS field than expected from mock
catalogs. We detect clear evidence for the growth of cosmic structure over the
last seven billion years in the sense that the fraction of galaxies that are
found in groups (in volume-limited samples) increases significantly with cosmic
time. In the second part of the paper, we develop a method for associating
galaxies that only have photo-z to our spectroscopically identified groups. We
show that this leads to improved definition of group centers, improved
identification of the most massive galaxies in the groups, and improved
identification of central and satellite galaxies, where we define the former to
be galaxies at the minimum of the gravitational potential wells. Subsamples of
centrals and satellites in the groups can be defined with purities up to 80%,
while a straight binary classification of all group and non-group galaxies into
centrals and satellites achieves purities of 85% and 75%, respectively, for the
spectroscopic sample.

analysis of the abundance of galaxies, galaxy clustering, and the galaxy-galaxy
weak lensing signal in order to simultaneously constrain the halo occupation
statistics (i.e., galaxy bias) and the cosmological parameters of interest. We
parameterize the halo occupation distribution of galaxies in terms of the
conditional luminosity function and use the analytical framework of the halo
model described in our companion paper (van den Bosch et al. 2012), to predict
the relevant observables. By performing a Fisher matrix analysis, we show that
a joint analysis of these observables, even with the precision with which they
are currently measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, can be used to obtain
tight constraints on the cosmological parameters, fully marginalized over
uncertainties in galaxy bias. We demonstrate that the cosmological constraints
from such an analysis are nearly uncorrelated with the halo occupation
distribution constraints, thus, minimizing the systematic impact of any
imperfections in modeling the halo occupation statistics on the cosmological
constraints. In fact, we demonstrate that the constraints from such an analysis
are both complementary to and competitive with existing constraints on these
parameters from a number of other techniques, such as cluster abundances,
cosmic shear and/or baryon acoustic oscillations, thus paving the way to test

the zCOSMOS groups increases with group richness as expected by the theory of
cosmic structure formation and yields masses that are reasonably consistent

at high redshift (estimated to be more massive than 10^13.5 M_sun), for which

Way-massed disk galaxies, we demonstrate that supernovae feedback and tidal
stripping lower the central masses of bright (-15 < M_V < -8) satellite
galaxies. These simulations resolve high density regions, comparable to giant
molecular clouds, where stars form. This resolution allows us to adopt a
prescription for H_2 formation and destruction that ties star formation to the
presence of shielded, molecular gas. Before infall, supernova feedback from the
clumpy, bursty star formation captured by this physically motivated model leads
to reduced dark matter (DM) densities and shallower inner density profiles in
the massive satellite progenitors (Mvir > 10^9 Msun, Mstar > 10^7 Msun)
compared to DM-only simulations. The progenitors of the lower mass satellites
are unable to maintain bursty star formation histories, due to both heating at
reionization and gas loss from initial star forming events, preserving the
steep inner density profile predicted by DM-only simulations. After infall,
tidal stripping acts to further reduce the central densities of the luminous
satellites, particularly those that enter with cored dark matter halos,
increasing the discrepancy in the central masses predicted by baryon+DM and
DM-only simulations. We show that DM-only simulations, which neglect the
baryonic effects described in this work, produce denser satellites with larger
central velocities. We provide a simple correction to the central DM mass
predicted for satellites by DM-only simulations. We conclude that DM-only
simulations should be used with great caution when interpreting kinematic
observations of the Milky Way's dwarf satellites.

X-ray Binary XMMU J013236.7+303228 in M33. Based on spectra taken at multiple
epochs of the 1.73d binary orbital period we determine physical as well as
orbital parameters for the donor star. We find the donor to be a B1.5IV
sub-giant with effective temperature T=22,000-23,000 K. From the luminosity,
temperature and known distance to M33 we derive a radius of R = 8.9 \pm 0.5
R_sun. From the radial--velocity measurements, we determine a velocity
semi-amplitude of K_opt = 63 \pm 12 km/sec. Using the physical properties of
the B-star determined from the optical spectrum, we estimate the star's mass to
be M_opt = 11 \pm 1 M_sun. Based on the X-ray spectrum, the compact companion
is likely a neutron star, although no pulsations have yet been detected. Using
the spectroscopically derived B-star mass we find the neutron star companion
mass to be M_X = 2.0 \pm 0.4 M_sun, consistent with the neutron star mass in
the HMXB Vela X-1, but heavier than the canonical value of 1.4 M_sun found for
many millisecond pulsars. We attempt to use as an additional constraint that
the B star radius inferred from temperature, flux, and distance, should equate
the Roche radius, since the system accretes by Roche lobe overflow. This leads
to substantially larger masses, but from trying to apply the technique to known
systems, we find that the masses are consistently overestimated. Attempting to
account for that in our uncertainties, we derive M_X = 2.2^{+0.8}_{-0.6} M_sun
and M_opt =13 \pm 4 M_sun. We conclude that precise constraints require
detailed modeling of the shape of the Roche surface.

reducing the hierarchical multiple to an effective binary by means of
recursively replacing the inner binary by an effective star at the center of
mass of that binary. We apply our method to a hierarchical triple system
similar to the progenitor of PSR J1903+0327 suggested by Portegies Zwart et al.

from a hierarchical triple that became unstable and ejected the secondary star

mass accreted onto the neutron star to the mass lost by the secondary would
most likely be between 0.35 and 0.5

studies showed that the resulting positron spectrum at the SNR shock is harder
than the primary proton spectrum, and proposed that the positron excess
observed by PAMELA can be explained with this process. We calculate the energy
spectra of CR protons and secondary CR positrons running away from the SNR into
the interstellar medium according to the phenomenological model of
energy-dependent CR escape. We show that, on the contrary to the results
presented previously, the observed spectra of secondary CR particles generated

the rise in the positron fraction cannot be reproduced by this model.

close to the center of the solar disk typically results in a shock at Earth in
2-3 days and hence can be used to predict shock arrival at Earth. However, a
significant fraction (about 28%) of such CMEs producing type II bursts were not
associated with shocks at Earth. We examined a set of 21 type II bursts
observed by the Wind/WAVES experiment at decameter-hectometric (DH) wavelengths
that had CME sources very close to the disk center (within a central meridian
distance of 30 degrees), but did not have a shock at Earth. We find that the
near-Sun speeds of these CMEs average to ~644 km/s, only slightly higher than
the average speed of CMEs associated with radio-quiet shocks. However, the
fraction of halo CMEs is only ~30%, compared to 54% for the radio-quiet shocks
and 91% for all radio-loud shocks. We conclude that the disk-center radio-loud
CMEs with no shocks at 1 AU are generally of lower energy and they drive shocks
only close to the Sun and dissipate before arriving at Earth. There is also
evidence for other possible processes that lead to the lack of shock at 1 AU:
(i) overtaking CME shocks merge and one observes a single shock at Earth, and
(ii) deflection by nearby coronal holes can push the shocks away from the
Sun-Earth line, such that Earth misses these shocks. The probability of
observing a shock at 1 AU increases rapidly above 60% when the CME speed
exceeds 1000 km/s and when the type II bursts propagate to frequencies below 1
MHz.

by single bacteriophages have only been made in vitro. Here, we present direct

minutes with significant cell-to-cell variability, including pausing events. In
contrast, corresponding in vitro single-molecule ejections take only 10 seconds

that the velocity of ejection for two different genome lengths collapses onto a
single curve. This suggests that in vivo ejections are controlled by the amount
of DNA ejected, in contrast with in vitro DNA ejections, which are governed by
the amount of DNA left inside the capsid. This analysis provides evidence
against a purely intrastrand repulsion based mechanism, and suggests that
cell-internal processes dominate. This provides a picture of the early stages
of phage infection and sheds light on the problem of polymer translocation.

requiring the uniform asymptotic stability of every trajectory, rather than
that of an equilibrium point or a particular time-varying trajectory. Similarly
to stability, Lyapunov functions and contraction metrics play important roles
in the study of incremental stability. In this paper, we provide
characterizations and descriptions of incremental stability in terms of
existence of coordinate-invariant notions of incremental Lyapunov functions and
contraction metrics, respectively. Most design techniques providing controllers
rendering control systems incrementally stable have two main drawbacks: they
can only be applied to control systems in either parametric-strict-feedback or
strict-feedback form, and they require these control systems to be smooth. In
this paper, we propose a design technique that is applicable to larger classes
of (not necessarily smooth) control systems. Moreover, we propose a recursive
way of constructing contraction metrics (for smooth control systems) and
incremental Lyapunov functions which have been identified as a key tool
enabling the construction of finite abstractions of nonlinear control systems,
the approximation of stochastic hybrid systems, source-code model checking for
nonlinear dynamical systems and so on. The effectiveness of the proposed
results in this paper is illustrated by synthesizing a controller rendering a
non-smooth control system incrementally stable as well as constructing its

For
decades, key decision makers in the public and private sectors have considered
cost-effectiveness in healthcare a top priority. Their actions have focused on
putting a limit on fees, services, or care options. However, they have met with
limited success as costs have increased rapidly while the quality isn't
commensurate with the high costs. A new approach is needed. Here we provide
eight scientifically-based steps for improving the healthcare system. The core
of the approach is promoting the best use of resources by matching the people
and organization to the tasks they are good at, and providing the right
incentive structure. Harnessing costs need not mean sacrificing quality.
Quality service and low costs can be achieved by making sure the right people
and the right organizations deliver services. As an example, the frequent use
of emergency rooms for non-emergency care demonstrates the waste of resources
of highly capable individuals and facilities resulting in high costs and
ineffective care. Neither free markets nor managed care guarantees the best use
of resources. A different oversight system is needed to promote the right
incentives. Unlike managed care, effective oversight must not interfere with
the performance of care. Otherwise, cost control only makes care more
cumbersome. The eight steps we propose are designed to dramatically improve the
effectiveness of the healthcare system, both for those who receive services and
those who provide them.

quadratic lattices [arXiv:1204.2328]. Our study treats one special case of such
lattices - the $q$-linear lattice - through a natural generalisation of the big
$q$-Jacobi weight. As a by-product of our construction we derive the coupled
first-order $q$-difference equations for the $E^{(1)}_6 $ $q$-Painlev\'e

probability one. The first case is when each node's filtering list contains
only itself, that is, D(v)={v}. Moreover, with positive probability every

second case is when all the filtering lists are empty, that is,

which wind around the black hole nearly on the photon sphere, which are called
relativistic Einstein rings. This is also the case for the lensing by a

the configuration of the gravitational lensing and the radii of the Einstein
ring and relativistic Einstein rings, we can distinguish between a black hole

Einstein rings by wormholes which have the radii of the throat $a\simeq 0.5$pc
at a galactic center with the distance 10Mpc and which have $a\simeq 10$AU in
our galaxy using by the most powerful modern instruments which have the
resolution of $10^{-2}$arcsecond such as a 10-meter optical-infrared telescope.
The black holes which make the Einstein rings of the same size as the ones by
the wormholes are galactic supermassive black holes and the relativistic
Einstein rings by the black holes are too small to measure at this moment. We
may test some hypotheses of astrophysical wormholes by using the Einstein ring

processor, the meanings of Turing machines could change. In this manuscript, we
discuss persistently evolutionary intensions. We introduce a new semantics,
called persistently evolutionary semantics, for predicate logic that the
meaning of function and predicate symbols are not already predetermined, and
predicate and function symbols find their meaning through the interaction of
the subject with the language. In (classic) model theory, the mathematician who
studies a structure is assumed as a god who lives out of the structure, and the
study of the mathematician does not effect the structure. The meaning of
predicate and function symbols are assumed to be independent of the
mathematician who does math. The persistently evolutionary semantics could be
regarded as a start of ""Interactive Model Theory"" as a new paradigm in model
theory (similar to the paradigm of interactive computation). In interactive
model theory, we suppose that a mathematical structure should consist of two
parts: 1) an intelligent agent (a subject), and 2) an environment (language),
and every things should find its meaning through the interaction of these two
parts. We introduce persistently evolutionary Kripke structure for
propositional and predicate logic. Also, we propose a persistently evolutionary
Kripke semantics for the notion of computation, where the intension of a code
of a Turing machine persistently evolve. We show that in this Kripke model the

This paper contributes to the mathematical understanding of this phenomenon and
helps define better justified sampling algorithms for deep learning based on

Gaussian whose mean and covariance matrix depend on the previous state, defines
through its asymptotic distribution a target density. First, we show that good

Then we show that an auto-encoder with a contractive penalty captures
estimators of these local moments in its reconstruction function and its

maximum-likelihood density estimation, which we call local moment matching. It
also justifies a recently proposed sampling algorithm for the Contractive

\Omega)q_2^2 +\frac{\lambda_1}{q_1^2}+\frac{\lambda_2}{q_2^2}$ is presented.
The resulting generalized Hamiltonian H_\kappa\ depends explicitly on the
constant Gaussian curvature \kappa\ of the underlying space, in such a way that
all the results here presented hold simultaneously for S^2 (\kappa>0), H^2
(\kappa<0) and E^2 (\kappa=0). Moreover, H_\kappa\ is explicitly shown to be
integrable for any values of the parameters \delta, \Omega, \lambda_1 and
\lambda_2. Therefore, H_\kappa\ can also be interpreted as an anisotropic
generalization of the curved Higgs oscillator, that is recovered as the
isotropic limit \Omega=0 of H_\kappa. Furthermore, numerical integration of
some of the trajectories for H_\kappa\ are worked out and the dynamical
features arising from the introduction of a curved background are highlighted.
  The superintegrability issue for H_\kappa\ is discussed by focusing on the
value \Omega=3\delta, which is one of the cases for which the Euclidean
Hamiltonian H is known to be superintegrable (the 1:2 oscillator). We show
numerically that for \Omega=3\delta\ the curved Hamiltonian H_\kappa\ presents
nonperiodic bounded trajectories, which seems to indicate that H_\kappa\
provides a non-superintegrable generalization of H. We compare this result with
a previously known superintegrable curved analogue H'_\kappa\ of the 1:2
Euclidean oscillator showing that the \Omega=3\delta\ specialization of
H_\kappa\ does not coincide with H'_\kappa. Finally, the geometrical
interpretation of the curved ""centrifugal"" terms appearing in H_\kappa\ is also
discussed in detail.

operator(s) we reexamine the possibility that the model parameters for which
the right number density of relic particles is predicted are compatible with
the first order phase transition that could lead to electroweak baryogenesis.
We find, taking into account recent indications from the LHC and the
constraints from the electroweak precision data, that for a light DM (40-60
GeV) particle and heavy almost degenerate additional scalars $H^\pm$ and $A^0$
this is indeed possible but the two parameters most important for the strength
of the phase transition: the common mass of $H^\pm$ and $A^0$ and the trilinear
coupling of the Higgs-like particle to DM are strongly constrained. $H^\pm$ and
$A^0$ must weight less than $\sim440$ GeV if the inert minimum is to be the
lowest one and the value of the coupling is limited by the XENON 100 data. We
stress the important role of the zero temperature part of the potential for the
strength of the phase transition.

a method to derive the gas infall rate in a galaxy disc as a function of time
and radius, and we apply it to the disc of the Milky Way and 21 galaxies from
the THINGS sample. For the Milky Way, we found that the ratio between the past
and current star formation rates is about 2-3, averaged over the disc, but it
varies substantially with radius. In the other disc galaxies there is a clear
dependency of this ratio with galaxy stellar mass and Hubble type, with more
constant star formation histories for small galaxies of later type. The gas
accretion rate follows very closely the SFR for every galaxy and it dominates
the evolution of these systems. The Milky Way has formed two thirds of its
stars after z=1, whilst the mass of cold gas in the disc has remained fairly
constant with time. In general, all discs have accreted a significant fraction
of their gas after z=1. Accretion moves from the inner regions of the disc to
the outer parts, and as a consequence star formation moves inside-out as well.
At z=0 the peak of gas accretion in the Galaxy is at about 6-7 kpc from the
centre.

This model has motivations both from the field of strongly correlated systems
with orbital degeneracy and from that of solid-state based devices proposed for
quantum computing. We find that the high degeneracy of ground states of the
compass model is fragile and changes into twofold degenerate ground states for
any finite amplitude of Heisenberg coupling. By computing the spin structure
factors of finite clusters with Lanczos diagonalization, we evidence a rich
variety of phases characterized by Z2 symmetry, that are either ferromagnetic,
C-type antiferromagnetic, or of Neel type, and analyze the effects of quantum
fluctuations on phase boundaries. In the ordered phases the anisotropy of
compass interactions leads to a finite excitation gap to spin waves. We show
that for small nanoscale clusters with large anisotropy gap the lowest
excitations are column-flip excitations that emerge due to Heisenberg
perturbations from the manifold of degenerate ground states of the compass
model. We derive an effective one-dimensional XYZ model which faithfully
reproduces the exact structure of these excited states and elucidates their
microscopic origin. The low energy column-flip or compass-type excitations are
robust against decoherence processes and are therefore well designed for
storing information in quantum computing. We also point out that the dipolar

fundamentally important problem with modern applications in, e.g., particle
physics. The discreteness of the Poisson distribution makes this problem
surprisingly challenging, even in the large-sample case. Here we propose a new
approach, based on the recently developed framework of inferential models
(IMs). Specifically, we construct optimal, or at least approximately optimal,
IMs for two important classes of assertions/hypotheses about the Poisson mean.
For point assertions, we develop a novel recursive sorting algorithm to
construct this optimal IM. Numerical comparisons of the proposed method to
existing methods are given, for both the mean and the more challenging
mean-plus-background problem.

CMS detector, during 7 TeV proton-proton operations of the CERN LHC. The
existence of such particles could be inferred from observation of their decays
when there were no proton-proton collisions in the CMS detector, namely during
gaps between LHC beam crossings. Using a data set in which CMS recorded an
integrated luminosity of 4.0 inverse femtobarns, and a search interval
corresponding to 246 hours of trigger live time, 12 events are observed, with a
mean background prediction of 8.6 +/- 2.4 events. Limits are presented at 95%
confidence level on long-lived gluino and stop production, over 13 orders of
magnitude of particle lifetime. Assuming the ""cloud model"" of R-hadron
interactions, a gluino with mass below 640 GeV and a stop with mass below 340
GeV are excluded, for lifetimes between 10 microseconds and 1000 seconds.

Kirby-Siebenmann invariant of a 4--manifold in terms of a quadratic refinement

intersection invariants of Whitney towers studied by the authors, particularly
for the 4--ball.
  In the second part of this paper, a general theory of quadratic forms is
developed and then specialized from the non-commutative to the commutative to
finally, the symmetric settings. The intersection invariant for twisted Whitney
towers is shown to be the universal symmetric refinement of the framed
intersection invariant. As a corollary we obtain a short exact sequence that
has been essential in the understanding of Whitney towers in the 4--ball.

the material as soon as a critical strain, independent of the elastic modulus,
is exceeded. Their width depends non-linearly on the distance between the
confining glass plates. A key element in the driving force of the instability
is the adhesion of layers of gels to the plates, which results in a
considerable expense of elastic energy during the growth of the air bubble.
