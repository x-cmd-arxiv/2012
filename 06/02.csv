maximal clique of G induces a subtree in T. This paper investigates the
Colourability problem on dually chordal graphs. It will show that it is
NP-complete in case of four colours and solvable in linear time with a simple

and in general effective operators, to take into account effects not included
in calculations. These include effects due to the truncation to finite model
spaces where a numerical calculation is tractable, as well as physical terms
not included in the description in the first place. In the no-core shell model
(NCSM) framework, we discuss two approaches to the effective interactions based
on (i) unitary transformations and (ii) effective field theory (EFT)
principles. Starting from a given Hamiltonian, the unitary transformation
approach is designed to take into account effects induced by the truncation to
finite model spaces in which a numerical calculation is performed. This
approach was widely applied to the description of nuclear properties of light
nuclei; we review the theory and present representative results. In the EFT
approach, a Hamiltonian is always constructed in a truncated model space
according to the symmetries of the underlying theory, making use of power
counting to limit the number of interactions included in the calculations.
Hence, physical terms not explicitly included in the calculation are treated on
the same footing with the truncation to a finite model space. In this approach,
we review results for both nuclear and trapped atomic systems, for which the
effective theories are formally similar, albeit describing different underlying
physics. Finally, the application of the EFT method of constructing effective
interactions to Gamow shell model is briefly discussed.

self-financing trading strategy whose final wealth has maximal mean and minimal

random and time-dependent) closed cone. We first prove existence of a solution
for convex constraints by showing that the space of constrained terminal gains,
which is a space of stochastic integrals, is closed in L^2. Then we use
stochastic control methods to describe the local structure of the optimal

linear-quadratic optimal control problem is decomposed into a sum with two
opportunity processes L^{\pm} appearing as coefficients. The martingale
optimality principle translates into a drift condition for the semimartingale
characteristics of L^{\pm} or equivalently into a coupled system of backward

both characterise and construct optimal strategies. Our results explain and
generalise all the results available in the literature so far. Moreover, we

strongly localized even without extrinsic disorder taken into account.
Accordingly, the translation symmetry is spontaneously broken at ground state.
Such an exotic localization is distinct from Anderson localization and
essentially rooted in intrinsic Mott physics of the t$-$J model. Finally, a
finite-temperature phase diagram is proposed. The metal-insulator transition
observed in in-plane resistivity measurement is identified to a
confinement-deconfinement transition from the perspective of gauge theory. The

problems using variational regularization techniques. Recently, using similar
sparsity-constraints in the Bayesian framework for inverse problems by encoding
them in the prior distribution has attracted attention. Important questions
about the relation between regularization theory and Bayesian inference still
need to be addressed when using sparsity promoting inversion. A practical
obstacle for these examinations is the lack of fast posterior sampling
algorithms for sparse, high-dimensional Bayesian inversion: Accessing the full
range of Bayesian inference methods requires being able to draw samples from
the posterior probability distribution in a fast and efficient way. This is
usually done using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms. In this
article, we develop and examine a new implementation of a single component
Gibbs MCMC sampler for sparse priors relying on L1-norms. We demonstrate that
the efficiency of our Gibbs sampler increases when the level of sparsity or the
dimension of the unknowns is increased. This property is contrary to the
properties of the most commonly applied Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling
schemes: We demonstrate that the efficiency of MH schemes for L1-type priors
dramatically decreases when the level of sparsity or the dimension of the
unknowns is increased. Practically, Bayesian inversion for L1-type priors using
MH samplers is not feasible at all. As this is commonly believed to be an
intrinsic feature of MCMC sampling, the performance of our Gibbs sampler also
challenges common beliefs about the applicability of sample based Bayesian
inference.

derive an approximate but accurate likelihood function. We discuss the impact
on the global fit of a possible Higgs boson with mass near 125 GeV, as implied
by recent data, and of a new improved limit on BR(B_s->\mu\mu). We identify
high posterior probability regions of the CMSSM parameters as the
stau-coannihilation and the A-funnel region, with the importance of the latter
now being much larger due to the combined effect of the above three LHC results
and of dark matter relic density. We also find that the focus point region is
now disfavored. Ensuing implications for superpartner masses favor even larger
values than before, and even lower ranges for dark matter spin-independent
cross section, \sigma^{SI}_p<10^{-9} pb. We also find that relatively minor
variations in applying experimental constraints can induce a large shift in the
location of the best-fit point. This puts into question the robustness of
applying the usual chisquare approach to the CMSSM. We discuss the
goodness-of-fit and find that, while it is difficult to calculate a p-value,
the g-2 constraint makes, nevertheless, the overall fit of the CMSSM poor. We
consider a scan without this constraint, and we allow \mu\ to be either
positive or negative. We find that the global fit improves enormously for both
signs of \mu, with a slight preference for \mu<0 caused by a better fit to
BR(b->s\gamma) and BR(B_s->\mu\mu).

recover the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxy

However, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of an
axisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particular
to inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant for
general axisymmetric modelling methods. We run N-body collisionless simulations
to build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimic
real individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. The final result of our
evolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. The
JAM method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatially
constant M/L and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_R^2 distributions. The
models are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity moments
V_rms=sqrt(V^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (position
angle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). We find that the inclination
is generally well recovered by the JAM models, for both barred and unbarred
simulations. For unbarred simulations the M/L is also accurately recovered,
with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just Delta(M/L)<1.5% when
the galaxy is not too close to face on. At very low inclinations (i<30 deg) the
M/L can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can be
larger for very face-on views). For barred simulations the M/L is on average
(when PA=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimation
of up to Delta(M/L)=15% in our tests. The sign of the M/L bias depends on the
position angle of the bar as expected. [Abridged]

which is accreted from other galaxies is between 15 and 40% and increases with
stellar mass. The accreted fraction does not depend strongly on environment at
a given stellar mass, but the galaxies in groups and cluster environments are
older and underwent mergers earlier than galaxies in lower density
environments. On average, the accreted stars are ~2.5 Gyrs older, and ~0.15 dex
more metal poor than the stars formed in-situ. Accreted stellar material
typically lies on the outskirts of galaxies; the average half-light radius of
the accreted stars is 2.6 times larger than that of the in-situ stars. This
leads to radial gradients in age and metallicity for massive galaxies, in
qualitative agreement with observations. Massive galaxies grow by mergers at a
rate of approximately 2.6% per Gyr. These mergers have a median (mass-weighted)
mass ratio less than 0.26 \pm 0.21, with an absolute lower limit of 0.20, for

proximity of these planets to their host star and the strong radiation the
planetary atmosphere receives. On Earth, a major contribution to the
acceleration of atmospheric ions comes from the vertical separation of ions and
electrons, and the generation of the ambipolar electric field. This process,
known as the ""polar wind"", is responsible for the transport of ionospheric
constituents to the Earth's magnetosphere, where they are well observed. The
polar wind can also be enhanced by a relatively small fraction of super-thermal
electrons (photoelectrons) generated by photoionization. We formulate a
simplified calculation of the effect of the ambipolar electric field and the
photoelectrons on the ion scale-height in a generalized manner. We find that
the ion scale-height can be increased by a factor of 2-15 due to the polar wind
effects. We also estimate a lower limit of an order of magnitude increase of
the ion density and the atmospheric mass-loss rate when polar wind effects are
included.

bright supernova, which distinguishes itself by its relatively short T90 ~ 5 s
and an energetic X-ray tail. We analyze the Swift BAT and XRT data and discuss
the physical implications. We show that the early steep decline in the X-ray
light curve can be interpreted as the curvature tail of a late emission episode
around 58-86 s, with a curved instantaneous spectrum at the end of the emission
episode. Together with the main activity in the first ~ 20 s and the weak
emission from 40 s to 60 s, the prompt emission is variable, which points
towards a central engine origin, in contrast to the shock breakout origin as
invoked to interpret some other nearby low-luminosity supernova GRBs. The
curvature effect interpretation and interpreting the early shallow decay as the
coasting external forward shock emission in a wind medium both give a
constraint on the bulk Lorentz factor \Gamma to be around several. Comparing
the properties of GRB 120422A and other supernova GRBs, we found that the main
criterion to distinguish engine-driven GRBs from the shock breakout GRBs is the
time-averaged luminosity, with a separation line of about ~ 10^48 erg s^-1.

case of 3D halo formation we find that initially cold, nearly homogeneous
particle distributions collapse to approach a final equilibrium state with a
universal density profile. At small radii, this attractor exhibits a power-law
behavior in density, {\rho}(x) \propto |x|^(-{\gamma}_crit), {\gamma}_crit
\simeq 0.47, slightly but significantly shallower than the value {\gamma} = 1/2
suggested previously. This state develops from the initial conditions through a
process of phase mixing and violent relaxation. This process preserves the
energy ranks of particles. By warming the initial conditions, we illustrate a
cross-over from this power-law final state to a final state containing a
homogeneous core. We further show that inhomogeneous but cold power-law initial
conditions, with initial exponent {\gamma}_i > {\gamma}_crit, do not evolve
toward the attractor but reach a final state that retains their original

range of drugs formally studied is dwarfed by the number of written
descriptions of the many drugs taken by people. Analysis of these descriptions
using machine-learning techniques can provide a framework for learning about
these drug use experiences. Methods: We collected 1000 reports of 10 drugs from
the drug information website Erowid.org and formed a term-document frequency
matrix. Using variable selection and a random-forest classifier, we identified
a subset of words that differentiated between drugs. Results: A random forest
using a subset of 110 predictor variables classified with accuracy comparable
to a random forest using the full set of 3934 predictors. Our estimated
accuracy was 51.1%, which compares favorably to the 10% expected from chance.

problems in which the number of variables p exceeds the number of observations

not have a unique minimum. An important question is: when is the lasso solution
well-defined (unique)? We review results from the literature, which show that
if the predictor variables are drawn from a continuous probability
distribution, then there is a unique lasso solution with probability one,
regardless of the sizes of n and p. We also show that this result extends
easily to $\ell_1$ penalized minimization problems over a wide range of loss
functions.

non-uniqueness in lasso solutions? In light of the aforementioned result, this

when some post-processing has been performed on continuous predictor
measurements. Though we certainly cannot claim to provide a complete answer to

algorithm works for any predictor matrix. Next, we derive a simple method for
computing the component-wise uncertainty in lasso solutions of any given

polynomial optimization problems globally. This paper studies the relationship
between optimality conditions in nonlinear programming theory and finite

hierarchy has finite convergence when the constraint qualification, strict
complementarity and second order sufficiency conditions hold at every global
minimizer, under the standard archimedean assumption; the proof uses a result
of Marshall on boundary hessian conditions. ii) these optimality conditions are
all satisfied at every local minimizer if a finite set of polynomials, which
are in the coefficients of input polynomials, do not vanish at the input data
(i.e., they hold in a Zariski open set). This implies that Lasserre's hierarchy

respectively, are revealing an intriguing discrepancy (nearly 9% or 2.4sigma)
that is challenging astronomers and theoretical cosmologists. In order to shed
some light on this problem, here we discuss a new determination of H_0 at
intermediate redshifts (z ~ 1), using the following four cosmic probes: (i)
measurements of the angular diameter distances (ADD) for galaxy clusters based
on the combination of Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and X-ray data (0.14 < z <
0.89$), (ii) the inferred ages of old high redshift galaxies (OHRG) (0.62 < z <
1.70), (iii) measurements of the Hubble parameter H(z) (0.1 < z < 1.8), and
(iv) the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature (z=0.35). In our analysis,
assuming a flat LCDM cosmology and considering statistical plus systematic
errors we obtain H_0 = 74.1^{+2.2}_{-2.2} km/s.Mpc (1sigma) which is a 3%
determination of the Hubble constant at intermediate redshifts. We stress that
each individual test adopted here has error bars larger than the ones appearing
in the calibration of the extragalactic distance ladder. However, the
remarkable complementarity among the four tests works efficiently in reducing
greatly the possible degeneracy on the space parameter (Omega_m,h) ultimately
providing a value of H_0 that is in excellent agreement with the determination
using recessional velocities and distances to nearby objects.

detected around newly-discovered Neptune-mass and super-Earth planets. We
conclude that moons are more stable when the planet/moon systems are further
from the parent star, the planets are heavier, or the parent stars are lighter.
Inclusion of lunar tides allows for significantly longer lifetimes for a
massive moon relative to prior formulations. We expect that the semi-major axis
of the planet hosting the first detected exomoon around a G-type star is
0.4-0.6 AU and is 0.2-0.4 AU for an M-type star.

  Categorization",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hierarchical Text Categorization (HTC) is becoming increasingly important
with the rapidly growing amount of text data available in the World Wide Web.
Among the different strategies proposed to cope with HTC, the Local Classifier
per Node (LCN) approach attains good performance by mirroring the underlying
class hierarchy while enforcing a top-down strategy in the testing step.
However, the problem of embedding hierarchical information (parent-child
relationship) to improve the performance of HTC systems still remains open. A
confidence evaluation method for a selected route in the hierarchy is proposed
to evaluate the reliability of the final candidate labels in an HTC system. In
order to take into account the information embedded in the hierarchy, weight
factors are used to take into account the importance of each level. An
acceptance/rejection strategy in the top-down decision making process is
proposed, which improves the overall categorization accuracy by rejecting a few
percentage of samples, i.e., those with low reliability score. Experimental
results on the Reuters benchmark dataset (RCV1- v2) confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed method, compared to other state-of-the art HTC methods.

is found to be quite steep with the power-law index of $\beta\sim 1.5$ when the

We study here a particular neoclassical field model of a particle governed by a

this trajectory and the energy must satisfy the relativistic version of

limitations are an important concern for many applications such as spectral

distribution is used to model these observations, and the inherent
heteroscedasticity of the data combined with standard noise removal methods
yields significant artifacts. This paper introduces a novel denoising algorithm
for photon-limited images which combines elements of dictionary learning and
sparse patch-based representations of images. The method employs both an
adaptation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Poisson noise and recently
developed sparsity-regularized convex optimization algorithms for
photon-limited images. A comprehensive empirical evaluation of the proposed

enough magnetic fields, leptonic models can reproduce the few seconds delay of
the onset of GeV photon emission observed by Fermi-LAT, due to the slow growth
of the target photon field for inverse Compton scattering. However, even for
stronger magnetic fields, the GeV delay can be explained with hadronic models,
due to the long acceleration timescale of protons and the continuous photopion
production after the end of the particle injection. While the FWHMs of the MeV
and GeV lightcurves are almost the same in one-zone leptonic models, the FWHM
of the 1--30 GeV lightcurves in hadronic models are significantly wider than
those of the 0.1--1 MeV lightcurves. The amount of the GeV delay depends on the
importance of the Klein--Nishina effect in both the leptonic and hadronic
models. In our examples of hadronic models the energies of the escaped neutrons
are comparable to the gamma-ray energy, although their contribution to the
ultra high-energy cosmic rays is still subdominant. The resulting neutrino
spectra are hard enough to avoid the flux limit constraint from IceCube. The
delay of the neutrino emission onset is up to several times longer than the
corresponding delay of the GeV photon emission onset. The quantitative
differences in the lightcurves for various models may be further tested with
future atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes whose effective area is larger than

deduced from its behaviour under discrete symmetry transformations such as time
reversal, parity and chirality. Here we review basic symmetry properties of the
relativistic quantum theories for free electrons in (2+1)- and
(1+1)-dimensional spacetime. Additional flavour degrees of freedom are
necessary to properly define symmetry operations in (2+1) dimensions and are
generally present in physical realisations of such systems, e.g., in single
sheets of graphite. We find that there exist two possibilities for defining any
flavour-coupling discrete symmetry operation of the two-flavour
(2+1)-dimensional Dirac theory. Physical implications of this previously
unnoticed duplicity are discussed.

soundness of our generic induction rule by reducing induction to iteration. We
then show how our generic induction rule can be instantiated to give induction
rules for the data types of rose trees, finite hereditary sets, and
hyperfunctions. The first of these lies outside the scope of Hermida and
Jacobs' work because it is not polynomial, and as far as we are aware, no

of a given protein in a cell. This problem has already been addressed in the
past and closed-form expressions of the mean and variance have been obtained
for a simplified stochastic model of the gene expression. These results have
been obtained under the assumption that the duration of all the protein
production steps are exponentially distributed. In such a case, a Markovian
approach (via Fokker-Planck equations) is used to derive analytic formulas of
the mean and the variance of the number of proteins at equilibrium. This
assumption is however not totally satisfactory from a modeling point of view
since the distribution of the duration of some steps is more likely to be
Gaussian, if not almost deterministic. In such a setting, Markovian methods can
no longer be used. A finer characterization of the fluctuations of the number
of proteins is therefore of primary interest to understand the general economy
of the cell. In this paper, we propose a new approach, based on marked Poisson
point processes, which allows to remove the exponential assumption. This is
applied in the framework of the classical three stages models of the
literature: transcription, translation and degradation. The interest of the
method is shown by recovering the classical results under the assumptions that
all the durations are exponentially distributed but also by deriving new
analytic formulas when some of the distributions are not anymore exponential.
Our results show in particular that the exponential assumption may,
surprisingly, underestimate significantly the variance of the number of
proteins when some steps are in fact not exponentially distributed. This
counter-intuitive result stresses the importance of the statistical assumptions
in the protein production process.

(fundamental vs. first overtone), and the damping times of the standing slow

effects of optically thin radiation, compressive viscosity, and thermal
conduction are considered. The linearized one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) equations (under low-$\beta$ condition) were reduced to a fourth--order
ordinary differential equation for the perturbed velocity. The numerical
results indicate that the periods of non-isothermal loops (i.e. temperature
increases from the loop base to apex) are smaller compared to those of
isothermal loops. In the presence of radiation, viscosity, and thermal
conduction, an increase in the temperature gradient is followed by a monotonic
decrease in the periods (compared with the isothermal case), while the period
ratio turns out to be a sensitive function of the gradient of the temperature
and the loop lengths. We verify that radiative dissipation is not a main
cooling mechanism of both isothermal and non-isothermal hot coronal loops and
has a small effect on the periods. Thermal conduction and compressive viscosity
are primary mechanisms in the damping of slow modes of the hot coronal loops.
The periods and damping times in the presence of compressive viscosity and/or
thermal conduction dissipation are consistent with the observed data in
specific cases. By tuning the dissipation parameters, the periods and the
damping times could be made consistent with the observations in more general
cases.

algebraic combinatorics. In particular, it has been successfully used for
proving a number of results about the relation between the (adjacency matrix or
Laplacian) spectrum of a graph and some of its properties. For instance, some
characterizations of regular partitions, and bounds for some parameters, such
as the independence and chromatic numbers, the diameter, the bandwidth, etc.,
have been obtained. For each parameter of a graph involving the cardinality of
some vertex sets, we can define its corresponding weight parameter by giving
some ""weights"" (that is, the entries of the positive eigenvector) to the
vertices and replacing cardinalities by square norms. The key point is that
such weights ""regularize"" the graph, and hence allow us to define a kind of
regular partition, called ""pseudo-regular,"" intended for general graphs. Here
we show how to use interlacing for proving results about some weight parameters
and pseudo-regular partitions of a graph. For instance, generalizing a
well-known result of Lov\'asz, it is shown that the weight Shannon capacity
$\Theta^*$ of a connected graph $\G$, with $n$ vertices and (adjacency matrix)
eigenvalues $\lambda_1>\lambda_2\ge\...\ge \lambda_n$, satisfies $$ \Theta\le
\Theta^* \le \frac{\|\vecnu\|^2}{1-\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_n}} $$ where
$\Theta$ is the (standard) Shannon capacity and $\vecnu$ is the positive
eigenvector normalized to have smallest entry 1. In the special case of regular
graphs, the results obtained have some interesting corollaries, such as an
upper bound for some of the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of a
distance-regular graph. Finally, some results involving the Laplacian spectrum

consuming and costly. The time and required effort to do sufficient testing
grow, as the size and complexity of the software grows, which may cause overrun
of the project budget, delay in the development of software system or some test
cases may not be covered. During SDLC (software development life cycle),
generally the software testing phase takes around 40-70% of the time and cost.
State-based testing is frequently used in software testing. Test data
generation is one of the key issues in software testing. A properly generated
test suite may not only locate the errors in a software system, but also help
in reducing the high cost associated with software testing. It is often desired
that test data in the form of test sequences within a test suite can be
automatically generated to achieve required test coverage. This paper proposes
an optimization approach to test data generation for the state-based software
testing. In this paper, first state transition graph is derived from state
chart diagram. Then, all the required information are extracted from the state
chart diagram. Then, test cases are generated. Lastly, a set of test cases are
minimized by calculating the node coverage for each test case. It is also
determined that which test cases are covered by other test cases. The advantage
of our test generation technique is that it optimizes test coverage by
minimizing time and cost. The proposed test data generation scheme generates
test cases which satisfy transition path coverage criteria, path coverage
criteria and action coverage criteria. A case study on Automatic Ticket Machine
(ATM) has been presented to illustrate our approach.

which induces a topic dictionary from the input corpus (examples include e.g.,
latent semantic analysis, group-structured dictionaries or latent Dirichlet
allocation), and (ii) a semantic similarity measure of word pairs. Our method
can (i) generate automatically a large number of proper word puzzles of
different types, including the odd one out, choose the related word and
separate the topics puzzle. (ii) It can easily create domain-specific puzzles
by replacing the corpus component. (iii) It is also capable of automatically
generating puzzles with parameterizable levels of difficulty suitable for,

so. However, most models are limited in their scope and as a result only
capture general features of spreading phenomena. Here, we propose and study a
model of spreading which takes into account the strength or quality of
contagions as well as the local (probabilistic) dynamics occurring at various
nodes. Transmission occurs only after the quality-based fitness of the
contagion has been evaluated by the local agent. The model exhibits
quality-dependent exponential time scales at early times leading to a slowly
evolving quasi-stationary state. Low prevalence is seen for a wide range of
contagion quality for arbitrary large networks. We also investigate the
activity of nodes and find a power-law distribution with a robust exponent
independent of network topology. Our results are consistent with recent
empirical observations.

agent's set of strategic choices consists of the security payoffs and the
pricing kernel that are consistent with the optimal-sharing rules; while in the
incomplete setting, agents respond via demand functions on a vector of given
tradeable securities. It is shown that at the (Nash) risk-sharing equilibrium,
the sharing securities are suboptimal, since agents submit for sharing
different risk exposures than their true endowments. On the other hand, the
Nash equilibrium prices stay unaffected by the game only in the special case of
agents with the same risk aversion. In addition, agents with sufficiently lower
risk aversion act as predatory traders, since they absorb utility surplus from
the high risk averse agents and reduce the efficiency of sharing. The main
results of the paper also hold under the generalized models that allow the

previous near-IR determinations and consistent with the $H$ and $K$ band

overall scatter in $R_e$ about the FP is $\sigma_r$,=,29%, and is the
quadrature sum of an 18% scatter due to observational errors and a 23%
intrinsic scatter. Because of the distribution of galaxies in FP space,
$\sigma_r$ is not the distance error, which we find to be $\sigma_d$,=,23%.
Using group richness and local density as measures of environment, and
morphologies based on visual classifications, we find that the FP slopes do not
vary with environment or morphology. However, for fixed velocity dispersion and
surface brightness, field galaxies are on average 5% larger than galaxies in
higher-density environments, and the bulges of early-type spirals are on
average 10% larger than ellipticals and lenticulars. The residuals about the FP
show significant trends with environment, morphology and stellar population.
The strongest trend is with age, and we speculate that age is the most
important systematic source of offsets from the FP, and may drive the other
trends through its correlations with environment, morphology and metallicity.

along the surface, but for higher temperatures the sliding is replaced by
rocking and rolling. Modeling of the buckyball with an included metal ion, such
as Fe@C60, demonstrates that this molecular complex undergoes a rolling motion
along the nanoribbon with the constant velocity under the action of a constant
electric field. The similar effect is observed in the presence of the heat
gradient applied to the nanoribbon, but mobility of carbon structures in this
case depends largely on their size and symmetry, such that larger and more
asymmetric structures demonstrate much lower mobility. Our results suggest that
both electorphoresis and thermophoresis can be employed to control the motion
of carbon molecules and fullerenes and, for example, sort them by their size,
shape, and possible inclusions.
