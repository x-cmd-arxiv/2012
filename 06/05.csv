fixed point and possess long classical regimes where the effective average

application we study the spectral dimension of the effective QEG spacetimes
resulting from these trajectories, establishing that the picture of a

be attributed to universal features of RG fixed points or singular loci in the

of observers -- a unit timelike vector field that also transforms under local
Lorentz transformations. On one hand, all fields are spacetime fields,
covariant under spacetime symmeties. On the other, when the observer field is
normal to a spatial foliation, the fields automatically fall into Hamiltonian
form, recovering the Ashtekar formulation. We argue this provides a bridge
between Ashtekar variables and covariant phase space methods. We also outline a
framework where the 'space of observers' is fundamental, and spacetime geometry

Classical methods exploit the sparsity in one domain to formulate the L0 norm

multiple domains. To further improve the signal reconstruction performance, we
can exploit this multi-sparsity to generate a new convex programming model. The
latter is formulated with multiple sparsity constraints in multiple domains and
the linear measurement fitting constraint. It improves signal recovery
performance by additional a priori information. Since some EMG signals exhibit

associated to new mathematical invariants for spaces, while for physicists

applicable, for instance, to topological Casimir effect calculations). We show
that elliptic genera can be conveniently transformed into product expressions

(SNR_Ia) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). This
analysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additional
photometrically identified SNe Ia within the redshift range 0.1<z<1.1. The
volumetric SNR_Ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z~1.0 that follows a
power-law of the form (1+z)^alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. This evolutionary
trend in the SNLS rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmic
star-formation history over the same redshift range. We combine the SNLS rate
measurements with those from other surveys that complement the SNLS redshift
range, and fit various simple SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD) models to the
combined data. A simple power-law model for the DTD (i.e., proportional to
t^-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending on
the parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. A two-component
model, where SNR_Ia is dependent on stellar mass (Mstellar) and star formation
rate (SFR) as SNR_Ia(z)=AxMstellar(z) + BxSFR(z), yields the coefficients
A=1.9+/-0.1 SNe/yr/M_solar and B=3.3+/-0.2 SNe/yr/(M_solar/yr). More general
two-component models also fit the data well, but single Gaussian or exponential
DTDs provide significantly poorer matches. Finally, we split the SNLS sample
into two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that the
general behavior in the rates of faster-declining SNe Ia (0.8<s<1.0) is
similar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects
(1.0<s<1.3) out to z~0.8.

superposition states can propagate. Characterization of these states is a
fundamental problem important in waveguide design and testing, especially for
optical applications. In this work, I have developed a novel interferometric
method that provides complete characterization of optical waveguide modes and
their superposition states. The basic idea of the method is to study the
interference of the beam radiated from an optical waveguide with an external
reference beam, and detect different waveguide modes in the time-domain by
changing the relative optical paths of the two beams. In particular, this
method, called cross-correlation or C$^2$-imaging, provides the relative
amplitudes of the modes and their group delays. For every mode, one can
determine the dispersion, intensity and phase distributions, and also local
polarization properties. As a part of this work, I have developed the
mathematical formalism of C$^2$-imaging and built an experimental setup
implementing the idea. I have carried out an extensive program of experiments,
confirming the ability of the method to completely characterize waveguide
properties.

orders of knots in the topological concordance group C. The techniques
currently available in the literature are either too theoretical, applying to
only a small number of knots, or are designed to only deal with a specific
knot. The thesis builds on the results of Herald, Kirk and Livingston [HKL10]
and Tamulis [Tam02] to give a series of criteria, using twisted Alexander
polynomials, for determining whether a knot is of infinite order in C.
  There are two immediate applications of these theorems. The first is to give
the structure of the subgroups of the concordance group C and the algebraic
concordance group G generated by the prime knots of 9 or fewer crossings. This
should be of practical value to the knot-theoretic community, but more
importantly it provides interesting examples of phenomena both in the algebraic
and geometric concordance groups. The second application is to find the
concordance orders of all prime knots with up to 12 crossings. At the time of
writing of this thesis, there are 325 such knots listed as having unknown
concordance order. The thesis includes the computation of the orders of all
except two of these.
  In addition to using twisted Alexander polynomials to determine the
concordance order of a knot, a theorem of Cochran, Orr and Teichner [COT03] is
applied to prove that the n-twisted doubles of the unknot are not slice for n
not 0 or 2. This technique involves analysing the `second-order' invariants of
a knot; that is, slice invariants (in this case, signatures) of a set of
metabolising curves on a Seifert surface for the knot. The thesis extends the
result to provide a set of criteria for the n-twisted double of a general knot
K to be slice; that is, of order 0 in C.

particular, the probe state is allowed to have any number of signal and
ancillary modes, and to be pure or mixed. Our results are based on a simple
criterion that partitions the set of pure probe states into equivalence classes
with the same error probability performance. Under an energy constraint, we
find the explicit form of the state that minimizes the error probability. This
state is an unentangled but nonclassical single-mode state. The error
performance of the optimal state is compared with several standard states in
quantum optics. We also show that discrimination with zero error is possible
only beyond a threshold energy of (M - 1)/2. For the M = 2 case, we show that
the optimum performance is readily demonstrable with current technology. While
transmission loss and detector inefficiencies lead to a nonzero erasure
probability, the error rate conditional on no erasure is shown to remain the

gauge fields on a noncommutative spacetime. But this construction can be
inverted to find corresponding U(1) gauge fields on a (generalized) Poisson
manifold given a Riemannian metric (M, g). We examine this bottom-up approach
with the LeBrun metric which is the most general scalar-flat Kahler metric with
a U(1) isometry and contains the Gibbons-Hawking metric, the real heaven as
well as the multi-blown up Burns metric which is a scalar-flat Kahler metric on
C^2 with n points blown up. The bottom-up approach clarifies some important
issues in emergent gravity.

physics experiments. A lot of ""off-the-shelf"" TDCs can be employed but the
necessity of a custom DAta acQuisition (DAQ) system makes the TDCs implemented
on the Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) desirable. Most of the
architectures developed so far are based on the tapped delay lines with
precision down to 10 ps, obtained with high FPGA resources usage and
non-linearity issues to be managed. Often such precision is not necessary; in
this case TDC architectures with low resources occupancy are preferable
allowing the implementation of data processing systems and of other utilities
on the same device. In order to reconstruct gamma-gamma physics events tagged
with High Energy Tagger (HET) in the KLOE-2 (K LOng Experiment 2), we need to
measure the Time Of Flight (TOF) of the electrons and positrons from the KLOE-2
Interaction Point (IP) to our tagging stations (11 m apart). The required
resolution must be better than the bunch spacing (2.7 ns). We have developed
and implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA a 32 channel TDC with a precision of
255 ps and low non-linearity effects along with an embedded data acquisition
systems and the interface to the online FARM of KLOE-2.

the use of algorithmic execution dividing the volume in many transactions in
order to minimize costs due to market impact. A proper design of an optimal
execution strategy strongly depends on a careful modeling of market impact,
i.e. how the price reacts to trades. In this paper we consider a recently
introduced market impact model (Bouchaud et al., 2004), which has the property
of describing both the volume and the temporal dependence of price change due
to trading. We show how this model can be used to describe price impact also in
aggregated trade time or in real time. We then solve analytically and calibrate
with real data the optimal execution problem both for risk neutral and for risk
averse investors and we derive an efficient frontier of optimal execution. When
we include spread costs the problem must be solved numerically and we show that
the introduction of such costs regularizes the solution.

surface of tensile strained HgTe, which is obtained by stretching the
zincblende lattice along the (111) axis. Tensile strained HgTe is a semimetal
with pointlike accidental degeneracies between a mirror symmetry protected
twofold degenerate band and two nondegenerate bands near the Fermi level. The
Fermi surface consists of two ellipsoids which contact at the point where the
Fermi level crosses the twofold degenerate band along the (111) axis. However,
the spin texture of occupied states indicates that neither ellipsoid carries a
compensating Chern number. Consequently, the spin texture is locked in the
plane perpendicular to the (111) axis, exhibits a nonzero winding number in
that plane, and changes winding number from one end of the Fermi ellipsoids to
the other. The change in the winding of the spin texture suggests the existence
of singular points. An ordered alloy of HgTe with ZnTe has the same effect as
stretching the zincblende lattice in the (111) direction. We present ab initio
calculations of ordered Hg_xZn_1-xTe that confirm the existence of a spin
texture locked in a 2D plane on the Fermi surface with different winding

medium scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) with the Very Large
Array (VLA) in New Mexico and nearby ionosondes in Texas and Colorado are
presented. Using 132, 20-minute observations, several instances of MSTIDs were
detected, all having wavefronts aligned northwest to southeast and mostly
propagating toward the southwest, consistent with previous studies of MSTIDs.
However, some were also found to move toward the northeast. It was found that
both classes of MSTIDs were only found when sporadic-E (Es) layers of moderate
peak density (1.5<foEs<3 MHz) were present. Limited fbEs data from one
ionosonde suggests that there was a significant amount of structure with the Es
layers during observations when foEs>3 MHz that was not present when 1.5<foEs<3
MHz. No MSTIDs were observed either before midnight or when the F-region height
was increasing at a relatively high rate, even when these Es layers were
observed. Combining this result with AE indices which were relatively high at
the time (an average of about 300 nT and maximum of nearly 700 nT), it is
inferred that both the lack of MSTIDs and the increase in F-region height are
due to substorm-induced electric fields. The northeastward-directed MSTIDs were
strongest post-midnight during times when the F-region was observed to be
collapsing relatively quickly. This implies that these two occurrences are
related and likely both caused by rare shifts in F-region neutral wind
direction from southwest to northwest.

sources. For ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs), the mass transfer rate is
expected to be a strong function of orbital period, predicting persistent
sources at short periods and transients at long periods. Aims. For 14 UCXBs
including two candidates, we investigate the long-term variability and average
luminosity with the purpose of learning how often a source can be expected to
be visible above a given luminosity, and we compare the derived luminosities
with the theoretical predictions. Methods. We use data from the RXTE All-Sky
Monitor because of its long-term, unbiased observations. Many UCXBs are faint,
i.e., they have a count rate at the noise level for most of the time. Still,
information can be extracted from the data, either by using only reliable data
points or by combining the bright-end variability behavior with the
time-averaged luminosity. Results. Luminosity probability distributions show
the fraction of time that a source emits above a given luminosity. All UCXBs
show significant variability and relatively similar behavior, though the
time-averaged luminosity implies higher variability in systems with a period
longer than 40 min. Conclusions. There is no large difference in the
statistical luminosity behavior of what we usually call persistent and
transient sources. UCXBs with a period below ~30 min have a time-averaged
bolometric luminosity that is in reasonable agreement with estimates based on
the theoretical mass transfer rate. Around 40 min the lower bound on the
time-averaged luminosity is similar to the luminosity based on the theoretical
mass transfer rate, suggesting these sources are indeed faint when not
detected. Above 50 min some systems are much brighter than the theoretical mass

which are well suited for both signal and image processing and analysis.
One-dimensional sinlets are related to specific solutions of the time-dependent
harmonic oscillator equation. By construction, each sinlet is infinitely
differentiable and has a well-defined and smooth instantaneous frequency known
in analytical form. For square-integrable transient signals with infinite
support, one-dimensional sinlet basis provides an advantageous alternative to
the Fourier transform by rendering accurate signal representation via a
countable set of real-valued coefficients. The properties of sinlets make them
suitable for analyzing many real-world signals whose frequency content changes
with time including radar and sonar waveforms, music, speech, biological
echolocation sounds, biomedical signals, seismic acoustic waves, and signals
employed in wireless communication systems. One-dimensional sinlet bases can be
used to construct two- and higher-dimensional bases with variety of potential
applications including image analysis and representation.

itself, a natural map to be considered on that object is the involution that
interchanges the coordinates, i.e. that maps (x, y) to (y, x). The so-called
'symmetric squaring construction' in \v{C}ech homology with Z/2-coefficients
was introduced by Schick et al. 2007 as a map from the k-th \v{C}ech homology
group of a space X to the 2k-th \v{C}ech homology group of X \times X divided
by the above mentioned involution. It turns out to be a crucial construction in
the proof of a parametrised Borsuk-Ulam Theorem. The symmetric squaring
construction can be generalized to give a map in bordism, which will be the
main topic of this thesis. More precisely, it will be shown that there is a
well-defined, natural map from the k-th singular bordism group of X to the
2k-th bordism group of X \times X divided by the involution as above. Moreover,
this squaring really is a generalisation of the \v{C}ech homology case since it
is compatible with the passage from bordism to homology via the fundamental
class homomorphism. On the way to this result, the concept of \v{C}ech bordism
is first defined as a combination of bordism and \v{C}ech homology and then
compared to \v{C}ech homology.

in a three hour minicourse at ""V International Course of Mathematical Analysis

exposition of the properties of derivations on various algebras and triple
systems in finite and infinite dimensions, the primary questions addressed
being whether the derivation is automatically continuous and to what extent it
is an inner derivation. Part II discusses cohomology theory of algebras and
triple systems, in both finite and infinite dimensions. Although the cohomology
of associative and Lie algebras is substantially developed, in both finite and
infinite dimensions, the same could not be said for Jordan algebras. Moreover,
the cohomology of triple systems has a rather sparse literature which is
essentially non-existent in infinite dimensions. Thus, one of the goals of this
paper is to encourage the study of continuous cohomology of some Banach triple
systems. Part III discusses three topics, two very recent, which involve the
interplay between Jordan theory and operator space theory (quantum functional
analysis). The first one, a joint work of the author, discusses the structure
theory of contractively complemented Hilbertian operator spaces, and is
instrumental to the third topic, which is concerned with some recent work on
enveloping TROs and K-theory for JB*-triples. The second topic presents some
very recent joint work by the author concerning quantum operator algebras. One
section in Part III is devoted to the subject of contractive projections, which
play an important role in the structure theory of Jordan triples.

the Collapsar model that explains how the collapse of massive stars produces a
GRB is the emergence of a relativistic jet that penetrates the stellar
envelope. The condition that the emerging jet penetrates the envelope poses
strong constraints on the system. Using these constraints we show that: (i) Low
luminosity GRBs (llGRBs), a sub population of GRBs with a very low luminosities
(and other peculiar properties: single peaked, smooth and soft) cannot be
formed by Collapsars. llGRBs must have a different origin (most likely a shock
breakout). (ii) On the other hand regular LGRBs must be formed by Collapsars.
(iii) While for BATSE the dividing duration between Collapsars and
non-Collapsar is indeed at $\sim 2$ sec, the dividing duration is different for
other GRBs detectors. In particular most Swift bursts longer than 0.8 sec are
of a Collapsar origin. This last results requires a revision of many
conclusions concerning the origin of Swift SGRBs which were based on the
commonly used 2 sec limit.

applied sciences (e.g., heat transfer and mass transfer), and are parabolic
partial differential equations. It is well-known that, under certain
assumptions on the input data, these equations satisfy important mathematical
properties like maximum principles and the non-negative constraint, which have
implications in mathematical modeling. However, existing numerical formulations
for these types of equations do not, in general, satisfy maximum principles and
the non-negative constraint. In this paper, we present a methodology for
enforcing maximum principles and the non-negative constraint for transient
anisotropic diffusion equation. The method of horizontal lines (also known as
the Rothe method) is applied in which the time is discretized first. This
results in solving steady anisotropic diffusion equation with decay equation at
every discrete time level. The proposed methodology for transient anisotropic
diffusion equation will satisfy maximum principles and the non-negative
constraint on general computational grids, and with no additional restrictions
on the time step. We illustrate the performance and accuracy of the proposed
formulation using representative numerical examples. We also perform numerical
convergence of the proposed methodology. For comparison, we also present the
results from the standard single-field semi-discrete formulation and the
results from a popular software package, which all will violate maximum
principles and the non-negative constraint.

confusing and non-unique at present with conflicting interpretations even after
a long history of the first law in terms of exchange heat and work, and is far
from settled. Moreover, the exchange quantities lack certain symmetry. By
generalizing the traditional concept to also include their time-dependent
irreversible components allows us to express the first law in a symmetric form
dE(t)= dQ(t)-dW(t) in which dQ(t) and work dW(t) appear on an equal footing and
possess the symmetry. We prove that irreversible work turns into irreversible
heat. Statistical analysis in terms of microstate probabilities p_{i}(t)
uniquely identifies dW(t) as isentropic and dQ(t) as isometric (see text)
change in dE(t); such a clear separation does not occur for exchange
quantities. Hence, our new formulation of the first law provides tremendous
advantages and results in an extremely useful formulation of non-equilibrium
thermodynamics, as we have shown recently. We prove that an adiabatic process
does not alter p_{i}. All these results remain valid no matter how far the
system is out of equilibrium. When the system is in internal equilibrium,
dQ(t)\equivT(t)dS(t) in terms of the instantaneous temperature T(t) of the
system, which is reminiscent of equilibrium. We demonstrate that p_{i}(t) has a
form very different from that in equilibrium. The first and second laws are no
longer independent so that we need only one law, which is again reminiscent of
equilibrium. The traditional formulas like the Clausius inequality
{\oint}d_{e}Q(t)/T_{0}<0, etc. become equalities {\oint}dQ(t)/T(t)\equiv0, etc,
a quite remarkable but unexpected result in view of irreversibility. We
determine the irreversible components in two simple cases to show the
usefulness of our approach; here, the traditional formulation is of no use.

possible to make predictions for the detectable rate of compact binary
coalescences in gravitational-wave detectors. These estimates rely crucially on
the growing consensus that short gamma-ray bursts are associated with the
merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole, but otherwise
make no assumptions beyond the observed rate of short GRBs. In particular, our
results do not assume coincident gravitational wave and electromagnetic
observations. We show that the non-detection of mergers in the existing
LIGO/Virgo data constrains the progenitor masses and beaming angles of
gamma-ray bursts. For future detectors, we find that the first detection of a
NS-NS binary coalescence associated with the progenitors of short GRBs is
likely to happen within the first 16 months of observation, even in the case of
a modest network of observatories (e.g., only LIGO-Hanford and LIGO-Livingston)
operating at modest sensitivities (e.g., advanced LIGO design sensitivity, but
without signal recycling mirrors), and assuming a conservative distribution of
beaming angles (e.g. all GRBs beamed at \theta=30 deg). Less conservative
assumptions reduce the waiting time until first detection to weeks to months.
Alternatively, the compact binary coalescence model of short GRBs can be ruled
out if a binary is not seen within the first two years of operation of a
LIGO-Hanford, LIGO-Livingston, and Virgo network at advanced design
sensitivity. We also demonstrate that the rate of GRB triggered sources is less
than the rate of untriggered events if \theta<30 deg, independent of the noise
curve, network configuration, and observed GRB rate. Thus the first detection
in GWs of a binary GRB progenitor is unlikely to be associated with a GRB.

the solar diameter. Through the W parameter, the logarithmic derivative of the
radius with respect to the luminosity, the past values of the solar luminosity
can be recovered. The black drop phenomenon affects the evaluation of the
instants of internal and external contacts between the planetary disk and the
solar limb. With these observed instants compared with the ephemerides the
value of the solar diameter is recovered. The black drop and seeing effects are
overcome with two fitting circles, to Venus and to the Sun, drawn in the
undistorted part of the image. The corrections of ephemerides due to the
atmospheric refraction will also be taken into account. The forthcoming transit
of Venus will allow an accuracy on the diameter of the Sun better than 0.01
arcsec, with good images of the ingress and of the egress taken each second.
Chinese solar observatories are in the optimal conditions to obtain valuable
data for the measurement of the solar diameter with the Venus transit of 5/6
June 2012 with an unprecedented accuracy, and with absolute calibration given
by the ephemerides. Fruitful observations can be obtained also by amateur

such serve as excellent probes of the effects of Lorentz Invariance Violations,
which are expected to increase with energy. This general paradigm is
investigated in this paper by studying the effects of such violations within
the Coleman-Glashow model in which each particle species may have its own
maximum attainable velocity, even exceeding that of light \textit{in vacuo}.
The particular focus here is that the muon neutrino may have the maximum speed
exceeding that of light. We show that such an assumption leads to the
elongation of the decay lifetime of the pion that increases with energy over
and above the time dilation effects. We provide a transparent analytical
derivation of the spectral intensities of muon neutrinos and muons generated in
the Earth's atmosphere by cosmic rays. In this derivation we not only account
for elongation of the pion lifetime, but also for the loss of energy by the
neutrinos by radiation of the electron-positron pairs through the Cohen-Glashow
process, during their propagation. We then compare the theoretical spectra with
observations of neutrinos and muons from large instruments like IceCube and
BUST to set a limit of $\sim10^{-13}$ on the fractional excess speed of
neutrinos over that of light. We also show that the ratio of the spectral
intensities of downward and upward moving neutrinos at various angles
constitute a diagnostic exclusively for the Cohen-Glashow process, which may be
searched for in the IceCube data set. We conclude the paper with several
comments, including those related to improvements of these tests when definite
signals of GZK neutrinos will be observed.

Moreover, it is known that there are two CFT duals (pictures) to describe the

electric charge $Q$ of the black hole. Furthermore these two pictures can be
incorporated by the CFT duals (general picture) that are generated by

revealed by looking at charged scalar wave equation in some appropriate values
of frequency and charge. In this regard, we consider the wave equation of a

the ""near region"", the wave equation can be reproduced by the Casimir operator

They are served by a single server which provides service according to a
general distribution G, with independent service times. The exact model is

is observed to be a function of a Brownian motion and a Brownian bridge
process, and is given by a 'netput' process and a directional derivative of the
Skorokhod reflected fluid netput in the direction of a diffusion refinement of
the netput process. We also observe what may be interpreted as a transient

broad line emitting gas in quasars, using near-infrared hydrogen emission
lines. Unlike higher ionisation species, hydrogen is an efficient line emitter
for a very wide range of photoionisation conditions, and the observed line
ratios depend strongly on the density and photoionisation state of the gas
present. A locally optimally emitting cloud model of the broad emission line
region was compared to measured emission lines of four nearby ($z\approx0.2$)
quasars that have optical and NIR spectra of sufficient signal-to-noise to
measure their Paschen lines. The model provides a good fit to three of the
objects, and a fair fit to the fourth object, a ULIRG. We find that low
incident ionising fluxes ($\phih<10^{18}$\cmsqs), and high gas densities
($\nh>10^{12}$\cmcu) are required to reproduce the observed hydrogen emission
line ratios. This analysis demonstrates that the use of composite spectra in
photoionisation modelling is inappropriate; models must be fitted to the
individual spectra of quasars.

quantum Hall ferromagnetism, the mean-field quasiparticle spectrum of the CAF
phase neglecting the modification of the order parameter at the edge. We
demonstrate that, at a fixed perpendicular component $B_\perp$ of the magnetic
field, the gap $\Delta_\text{edge}$ in the edge excitation spectrum gradually
decreases upon increasing the parallel component $B_\parallel$, as the CAF
phase continuously transforms to the fully spin-polarized ferromagnetic (F)
phase. The edge gap closes completely ($\Delta_\text{edge}=0$) once the F
phase, characterized by gapless counter-propagating edge excitations, is
reached at some finite $B_\perp$-dependent value $B_\parallel^*$ and remains
closed upon further increase of $B_\parallel$. This results in an gradual
insulator-metal transition, in which the conductance $G \sim (e^2/h)
\exp(-\Delta_\text{edge}/T)$ grows exponentially with $B_\parallel$ in the
range $0<B_\parallel<B_\parallel^*$, while in the gapped CAF phase, and
saturates to a metallic value $G \sim e^2/h$ in the F phase at

understanding of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The observed Ly-alpha
emission line strength - quantified by its restframe equivalent width (EW) -
provides a valuable diagnostic of stellar populations and dust in galaxies
during and after the EoR. In this paper we quantify the effects of star
formation stochasticity on the predicted Ly-alpha EW in dwarf galaxies, using
the publicly available code SLUG ('Stochastically Light Up Galaxies'). We
compute the number of hydrogen ionizing photons, as well as flux in the Far UV
for a set of models with star formation rates (SFR) in the range 10-3-1
Msol/yr. From these fluxes we compute the luminosity, L-alpha, and the EW of
the Ly-alpha line. We find that stochasticity alone induces a broad
distribution in L-alpha and EW at a fixed SFR, and that the widths of these
distributions decrease with increasing SFR. We parameterize the EW probability
density function (PDF) as an SFR-dependent double power law. We find that it is
possible to have EW as low as ~EW0/4 and as high as ~3 times the EW0, where EW0
denotes the expected EW in the absence of stochasticity. We argue that
stochasticity may therefore be important when linking drop-out and narrow-band
selected galaxies, when identifying population III galaxies, and that it may
help to explain the large EW (EW > 100 - 200 A) observed for a fraction of
Ly-alpha- selected galaxies. Finally, we show that stochasticity can also

particular, we argue that stochasticity may simultaneously explain the observed

resolving subsurface structural properties. Homomorphic deconvolution using
cepstrum analysis has been an effective method for wavelet estimation for
decades. In general, the inverse of the Fourier transform of the logarithm of a
signal's Fourier transform is the cepstral domain representation of that
signal. The convolution operation of two signals in the time domain becomes an
addition in the cepstral domain. The fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is the
generalization of the standard Fourier transform (FT). In an FRFT, the
transformation kernel is a set of linear chirps whereas the kernel is composed
of complex sinusoids for the FT. Depending on the fractional order, signals can
be represented in multiple domains. This gives FRFT an extra degree of freedom
in signal analysis over the standard FT. In this paper, we have taken advantage
of the multidomain nature of the FRFT and applied it to cepstral analysis. We
term this combination the Fractional-Cepstrum (FC). We derive the real FC
formulation, and give an example using wavelets to show the multidomain
representation of the traditional cepstrum with different fractional orders of
the FRFT.

evolution strategy (CMA-ES) from the information geometry viewpoint.
  To establish a theoretical foundation for the CMA-ES, we focus on a geometric
structure of a Riemannian manifold of probability distributions equipped with
the Fisher metric. We define a function on the manifold which is the
expectation of fitness over the sampling distribution, and regard the goal of
update of the parameters of sampling distribution in the CMA-ES as maximization
of the expected fitness. We investigate the steepest ascent learning for the
expected fitness maximization, where the steepest ascent direction is given by
the natural gradient, which is the product of the inverse of the Fisher
information matrix and the conventional gradient of the function.
  Our first result is that we can obtain under some types of parameterization
of multivariate normal distribution the natural gradient of the expected
fitness without the need for inversion of the Fisher information matrix. We
find that the update of the distribution parameters in the CMA-ES is the same
as natural gradient learning for expected fitness maximization. Our second
result is that we derive the range of learning rates such that a step in the
direction of the exact natural gradient improves the parameters in the expected
fitness. We see from the close relation between the CMA-ES and natural gradient
learning that the default setting of learning rates in the CMA-ES seems
suitable in terms of monotone improvement in expected fitness. Then, we discuss
the relation to the expectation-maximization framework and provide an
information geometric interpretation of the CMA-ES.

the different sizes of the corresponding emitting region. Chromatic changes are
expected to be observed in the continuum while the emission lines should be
deformed as a function of the size, geometry and kinematics of the regions from
which they originate. Microlensing of the emission lines has been reported only
in a handful of systems so far. In this paper we search for microlensing
deformations of the optical spectra of pairs of images in 17 lensed quasars.
This sample is composed of 13 pairs of previously unpublished spectra and four
pairs of spectra from literature. Our analysis is based on a spectral
decomposition technique which allows us to isolate the microlensed fraction of
the flux independently of a detailed modeling of the quasar emission lines.
Using this technique, we detect microlensing of the continuum in 85% of the
systems. Among them, 80% show microlensing of the broad emission lines.
Focusing on the most common lines in our spectra (CIII] and MgII) we detect
microlensing of either the blue or the red wing, or of both wings with the same
amplitude. This observation implies that the broad line region is not in
general spherically symmetric. In addition, the frequent detection of
microlensing of the blue and red wings independently but not simultaneously
with a different amplitude, does not support existing microlensing simulations
of a biconical outflow. Our analysis also provides the intrinsic flux ratio
between the lensed images and the magnitude of the microlensing affecting the
continuum. These two quantities are particularly relevant for the determination
of the fraction of matter in clumpy form in galaxies and for the detection of
dark matter substructures via the identification of flux ratio anomalies.

observable Universe and will reach to high redshifts, making them potentially
powerful probes of dark energy, modified gravity and non-Gaussianity. Here we
extend recent works by analyzing the general relativistic (GR) corrections to
the angular power spectrum. These GR corrections to the standard Newtonian
analysis of the power spectrum become significant on scales near and beyond the
Hubble scale at each redshift. We consider the continuum surveys with LOFAR,
WSRT and ASKAP, and examples of continuum surveys with the SKA. We find that
the GR corrections are at most percent-level in LOFAR, WODAN and EMU surveys,
but they can produce $O(10%)$ changes for high enough sensitivity SKA continuum
surveys. The signal is however dominated by cosmic variance, and
multiple-tracer observations will be needed to overcome this problem. The GR
corrections are suppressed in continuum surveys because of the integration over
redshift -- we expect that GR corrections will be enhanced for future SKA HI
surveys in which the source redshifts will be known. We also provide
predictions for the angular power spectra in the case where the primordial
perturbations have local non-Gaussianity. We find that non-Gaussianity
dominates over GR corrections, and rises above cosmic variance when $f_{\rm
NL}\gtrsim5$ for SKA continuum surveys.

sample of 483 galaxies at 6<z<8. These galaxies were selected from new deep

contrast to the majority of previous analyses, which assume that the
distribution of galaxy ultraviolet (UV) luminosities follows a Schechter
distribution, and that the distribution continues to luminosities far below our
observable limit, we investigate the contribution to reionization from galaxies
which we can observe, free from these assumptions. We find that the observable
population of galaxies can sustain a fully reionized IGM at z=6, if the average
ionizing photon escape fraction (f_esc) is ~30%. A number of previous studies
have measured UV luminosity densities at these redshifts that vary by 5X, with
many concluding that galaxies could not complete reionization by z=6 unless a
large population of galaxies fainter than the detection limit were invoked, or
extremely high values of f_esc were present. The observed UV luminosity density
from our observed galaxy samples at z=7-8 is not sufficient to maintain a fully
reionized IGM unless f_esc>50%. Combining our observations with constraints on
the emission rate of ionizing photons from Ly-alpha forest observations at z=6,
we can constrain f_esc<34% (2-sigma) if the observed galaxies are the only
contributors to reionization, or <13% (2-sigma) if the luminosity function
extends to M_UV = -13. These escape fractions are sufficient to complete
reionization by z=6. These constraints imply that the volume ionized fraction
of the IGM becomes less than unity at z>7, consistent with a number of
complementary reionization probes. If faint galaxies dominate reionization,
future JWST observations will probe deep enough to see them, providing an
indirect constraint on the ionizing photon escape fraction [abridged].

phenomenology of X-ray states. The soft states range from the low variability,
accretion disc dominated thermal state (TD) to the higher variability,
non-thermal steep power law state (SPL). The disc component in all states is
typically modeled with standard thin disc accretion theory. However, this
theory is inconsistent with optical/UV spectral, variability, and gravitational
microlensing observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the supermassive
analogs of BHBs. An inhomogeneous disc (ID) model with large (~0.4 dex)
temperature fluctuations in each radial annulus can qualitatively explain all
of these AGN observations. The inhomogeneity may be a consequence of
instabilities in radiation dominated discs, and therefore may be present in
BHBs as well. We show that ID models can explain many features of the TD and
SPL states of BHBs. The observed relationships between spectral hardness, disc
fraction, and rms variability amplitude in BHBs are reproduced with temperature
fluctuations similar to those inferred in AGNs, suggesting a unified picture of
luminous accretion discs across orders of magnitude in black hole mass. This
picture can be tested with spectral fitting of ID models, X-ray polarization
observations, and radiation MHD simulations. If BHB accretion discs are indeed
inhomogeneous, only the most disc dominated states (disc fraction > 0.95) can
be used to robustly infer black hole spin using current continuum fitting

metallicities. Thin disc stars are young (<6.6 Gyr), possess low velocity

primarily in-situ during an early merger epoch. Gas-rich mergers during this
epoch play a major role in fuelling the formation of the old disc stars (the
thick disc). This is consistent with studies which show that cold accretion is
the main source of a disc galaxy's baryons. Our simulation initially forms a
relatively short (scalelength \sim1.7 kpc at z=1) and kinematically hot disc,
primarily from gas accreted during the galaxy's merger epoch. Far from being a
competing formation scenario, migration is crucial for reconciling the short,
hot, discs which form at high redshift in {\Lambda}CDM, with the properties of
the thick disc at z=0. The thick disc, as defined by its abundances maintains
its relatively short scale-length at z = 0 (2.31 kpc) compared with the total
disc scale-length of 2.73 kpc. The inside-out nature of disc growth is
imprinted the evolution of abundances such that the metal poor {\alpha}-young

and would be detectable for an instrument such as LISA. Most studies have
calculated the expected gravitational wave signal under the assumption that the
binary white dwarf system can be represented by two point masses in orbit. We
discuss the accuracy of this approximation for real astrophysical systems. For
non-relativistic binaries in circular orbit the gravitational wave signal can
easily be calculated. We show that for these systems the point mass
approximation is completely justified when the individual stars are
axisymmetric irrespective of their size. We find that the signal obtained from
Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of tidally deformed, Roche-lobe
filling white dwarfs, including one case when an accretion disc is present, is
consistent with the point mass approximation. The difference is typically at
the level of one per cent or less in realistic cases, yielding small errors in
the inferred parameters of the binaries.

obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two years
of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission. While investigating the
previously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in optical
polarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respect
to the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. X-ray observations reveal a pair of
`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/optical
counterparts. The spectral structure measured by Spitzer reveals a synchrotron
component peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at the
far-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in the
mm/sub-mm band in the low state. Selected spectral energy distributions are
fitted with leptonic models including Comptonization of external radiation
produced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. Adopting the interpretation
of the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along a
curved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectra
during the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~
4 pc from the central black hole. On the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare is
generated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, the
far-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. We also
model the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotron
component, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-Compton component
explains the steady X-ray emission.

conducted in November 2011. The high-resolution echelle spectrograph MIKE was
used on the 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope to obtain 13 spectra spanning
planetary orbital phases of 0.7-1.4, while the X-ray Telescope on Swift

cores of the Ca II H and K lines do not show significant variability over
multiple orbits spanning ~8 d, in contrast to the expectation of
phase-dependent chromospheric activity enhancements for efficient star-planet
interaction. The star is also X-ray faint, with log Lx < 27.6 erg/s (0.3-2
keV), indicating that coronal activity is likewise low. The lack of detectable
star-planet interaction in this extreme system requires that any such effect
must here be transient, if indeed present. We demonstrate that searches for Ca
II H and K variability can potentially mistake a stellar hotspot, if observed
over a short segment of the rotation period, for planet-induced activity. Taken
together, these results suggest that the utility of star-planet interaction as
a robust method of estimating exoplanet magnetic field strengths may be
limited.

diffusion of the energy deposited by the explosion shock in optically thick
circumstellar matter (CSM). Recently, it was shown that the radiation-mediated
and -dominated shock in an optically thick wind must transform into a
collisionless shock and can produce hard X-rays. The X-rays are expected to
peak at late times, relative to maximum visible light. Here we report on a
search, using Swift and Chandra, for X-ray emission from 28 SNe that belong to
classes whose progenitors are suspected to be embedded in dense CSM
(IIn/Ibn/SLSN-I). Two SNe in our sample have X-ray properties that are roughly
consistent with the expectation for X-rays from a collisionless shock in
optically thick CSM. Therefore, we suggest that their optical light curves are
powered by shock breakout in CSM. We show that two other events were too X-ray
bright during the SN maximum optical light to be explained by the shock
breakout model. We conclude that the light curves of some, but not all,
type-IIn/Ibn SNe are powered by shock breakout in CSM. For the rest of the SNe
in our sample, including all the SLSN-I events, our X-ray limits are not deep
enough and were typically obtained at too early times to conclude about their
nature. We argue that the optical light curves of SNe, for which the X-ray
emission peaks at late times, are likely powered by the diffusion of shock
energy from a dense CSM. We comment about the possibility to detect some of
these events in radio.

require an end to the 40-year hiatus of lunar surface exploration, and the
placing of new scientific instruments on, and the return of additional samples
from, the surface of the Moon. Some of these objectives can be achieved
robotically (e.g. through targeted sample return, the deployment of geophysical

would benefit significantly from renewed human operations on the lunar surface.
For these reasons it is highly desirable that current plans for renewed robotic

compactifications as superpartners of U(1) gauge fields. Unlike their vector
counterparts, the photini can acquire weak-scale masses from soft SUSY breaking
and lead to observable signatures at the LHC through mass mixing with the bino.
In this work we investigate the collider consequences of adding photini to the
neutralino sector of the MSSM. Relatively large mixing of one or more photini
with the bino can lead to prompt decays of the lightest ordinary supersymmetric
particle; these extra cascades transfer most of the energy of SUSY decay chains
into Standard Model particles, diminishing the power of missing energy as an
experimental handle for signal discrimination. We demonstrate that the missing
energy in SUSY events with photini is reduced dramatically for supersymmetric
spectra with MSSM neutralinos near the weak scale, and study the effects on
limits set by the leading hadronic SUSY searches at ATLAS and CMS. We find that
in the presence of even one light photino the limits on squark masses from
hadronic searches can be reduced by 400 GeV, with comparable (though more
modest) reduction of gluino mass limits. We also consider potential discovery
channels such as dilepton and multilepton searches, which remain sensitive to
SUSY spectra with photini and can provide an unexpected route to the discovery
of supersymmetry. Although presented in the context of photini, our results
apply in general to theories in which additional light neutral fermions mix

so-called A-square term, just in the vicinity of the critical point, becomes
relevant enough to prevent the system from undergoing a phase transition. At
variance with this common belief, in this paper we prove that the Dicke model
does give a consistent description of the interaction of light field with the
internal excitation of atoms, but in the dipole gauge of quantum
electrodynamics. The phase transition cannot be excluded by principle and a
spontaneous transverse-electric mean field may appear. We point out that the
single-mode approximation is crucial: the proper treatment has to be based on
cavity QED, wherefore we present a systematic derivation of the dipole gauge
inside a perfect Fabry-P\'erot cavity from first principles. Besides the impact
on the debate around the Dicke phase transition, such a cleanup of the
theoretical ground of cavity QED is important because currently there are many
emerging experimental approaches to reach strong or even ultrastrong coupling
between dipoles and photons, which demand a correct treatment of the Dicke

photometric uncertainty better than 0.04 mag. On the basis of near-infrared
excesses from disks, we identify 30 pre-main sequence stars, including 24 which
are newly discovered. We analyze those stars and find the NIR excesses are
significantly variable.
  All 9,200 stars were monitored for photometric variability; among the field
star population, about 160 exhibited near-infrared variability (1.7% of the
sample). Of the 30 YSOs (young stellar objects), 28 of them (93%) are variable
at a significant level. 25 of the 30 YSOs have near-infrared excess consistent
with simple disk-plus-star classical T Tauri models. Nine of these (36%) drift
in color space over the course of these observations and/or since 2MASS
observations such that they cross the boundary defining the NIR excess
criteria; effectively, they have a transient near-infrared excess. About half
of the YSOs have color-space variations parallel to either the classical T
Tauri star locus or a hybrid track which includes the dust reddening
trajectory. This indicates that the NIR variability in YSOs that possess
accretion disks arises from a combination of variable extinction and changes in
the inner accretion disk: either in accretion rate, central hole size and/or
the inclination of the inner disk. While some variability may be due to stellar
rotation, the level of variability on the individual stars can exceed a
magnitude. This is a strong empirical suggestion that protoplanetary disks are
quite dynamic and exhibit more complex activity on short timescales than is
attributable to rotation alone or captured in static disk models.

  We extend this result to a large class of noetherian (but not strongly

k-algebra, where k is an uncountable algebraically closed field. Let Y denote
the parameter space (or stack or proscheme) parameterizing R-point modules, and
suppose there is a projective variety X that is a coarse moduli space for tails
of points. There is a canonical map p: Y -> X. If the indeterminacy locus of
p^{-1} is 0-dimensional and X satisfies a mild technical assumption, we show
that there is a homomorphism g: R -> B(X, L, s), and that g(R) is, up to finite

the star-forming universe is unresolved and thus contributes to the
extragalactic gamma ray background (EGB). Here, we calculate the contribution
from star-forming galaxies to the EGB in the Fermi range from 100 MeV to 100
GeV, due to inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of the interstellar photon field by
cosmic-ray electrons. We first construct a one-zone model for a single
star-forming galaxy, assuming supernovae power the acceleration of cosmic rays.
The same IC interactions leading to gamma rays also substantially contribute to
the energy loss of the high-energy cosmic-ray electrons. Consequently, a
galaxy's IC emission is determined by the relative importance of IC losses in
the cosmic-ray electron energy budget (""partial calorimetry""). We use our
template for galactic IC luminosity to find the cosmological contribution of
star-forming galaxies to the EGB. For all of our models, we find the IC EGB
contribution is almost an order of magnitude less than the peak of the emission
due to cosmic-ray ion interactions (mostly pionic p_cr p_ism \rightarrow \pi_0
\rightarrow \gamma \gamma); even at the highest Fermi energies, IC is
subdominant. Moreover, the flatter IC spectrum increases the high-energy signal
of the pionic+IC sum, bringing it into better agreement with the EGB spectral
index observed by Fermi . Partial calorimetry ensures that the overall IC
signal is well constrained, with only modest uncertainties in the amplitude and
spectral shape for plausible model choices. Partial calorimetry of cosmic-ray
electrons should hold true in both normal and starburst galaxies, and thus we
include starbursts in our calculation. We conclude with a brief discussion on
how the pionic spectral feature and other methods can be used to measure the
star-forming component of the EGB.

galaxies in the MeV range, and other emission processes could be present. We
investigate the MeV background from star-forming galaxies by running one-zone
models of cosmic ray populations, including Inverse Compton and bremsstrahlung,
as well as nuclear lines (including $^{26}$Al), emission from core-collapse
supernovae, and positron annihilation emission, in addition to the pionic
emission. We use the Milky Way and M82 as templates of normal and starburst

find that (1) higher gas densities in high-z normal galaxies lead to a strong
pion bump, (2) starbursts may have significant MeV emission if their magnetic
field strengths are low, and (3) cascades can contribute to the MeV emission of
starbursts if they emit mainly hadronic $\gamma$-rays. Our fiducial model
predicts that most of the unresolved GeV background is from star-forming
galaxies, but this prediction is uncertain by an order of magnitude. About ~2%
of the claimed 1 MeV background is diffuse emission from star-forming galaxies;

known to exhibit low amplitude non-radial p-mode oscillations at about
0.1-percent semi-amplitude. We detect stellar oscillations in all of our

eclipse. The oscillation amplitude, in all infrared bands except Ks, is about
the same as in the optical. However, the stellar oscillations in Ks band have
about twice the amplitude as seen in the optical, possibly because the
Brackett-gamma line falls in this bandpass. We use our best-fit values for the
eclipse depth, as well as the 0.9 micron eclipse observed by Smith et al., to
explore possible states of the exoplanetary atmosphere, based on the method of
Madhusudhan and Seager. On this basis we find two possible states for the
atmospheric structure of WASP-33b. One possibility is a non-inverted
temperature structure in spite of the strong irradiance, but this model
requires an enhanced carbon abundance (C/O>1). The alternative model has solar
composition, but an inverted temperature structure. Spectroscopy of the planet
at secondary eclipse, using a spectral resolution that can resolve the water
vapor band structure, should be able to break the degeneracy between these very
different possible states of the exoplanetary atmosphere. However, both of
those model atmospheres absorb nearly all of the stellar irradiance with
minimal longitudinal re-distribution of energy, strengthening the hypothesis of
Cowan et al. that the most strongly irradiated planets circulate energy poorly.

limit. The big blue bump, footprint of the accretion disk, is absent for the
majority of low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs). Moreover, recent simulations suggest
that the torus, a keystone in the Unified Model, vanishes for nuclei with L_bol
< 10^42 erg/s. However, the study of LLAGN is a complex task due to the
contribution of the host galaxy, which light swamps these faint nuclei. This is
specially critical in the IR range, at the maximum of the torus emission, due
to the contribution of the old stellar population and/or dust in the nuclear
region. Adaptive optics imaging in the NIR (VLT/NaCo) together with diffraction
limited imaging in the mid-IR (VLT/VISIR) permit us to isolate the nuclear
emission for some of the nearest LLAGNs in the Southern Hemisphere. These data
were extended to the optical/UV range (HST), radio (VLA, VLBI) and X-rays
(Chandra, XMM-Newton, Integral), in order to build a genuine spectral energy
distribution (SED) for each AGN with a consistent spatial resolution (< 0.5"")
across the whole spectral range. From the individual SEDs, we construct an
average SED for LLAGNs sampled in all the wavebands mentioned before. Compared
with previous multiwavelength studies of LLAGNs, this work covers the mid-IR
and NIR ranges with high-spatial resolution data. The LLAGNs in the sample

Lefschetz number L(T) of an endomorphism T with the sum of the degrees i(x) of
simplices in G which are fixed by T. The degree i(x) of x with respect to T is
defined as a graded sign of the permutation T induces on the simplex x
multiplied by -1 if the dimension of x is odd. The Lefschetz number is defined
as in the continuum as the super trace of T induced on cohomology. In the
special case where T is the identity, the formula becomes the Euler-Poincare
formula equating combinatorial and cohomological Euler characteristic. The
theorem assures in general that if L(T) is nonzero, then T has a fixed clique.
A special case is a discrete Brouwer fixed point theorem for graphs: if T is a
graph endomorphism of a connected graph G, which is star-shaped in the sense
that only the zeroth cohomology group is nontrivial, like for connected trees
or triangularizations of star shaped Euclidean domains, then there is clique x
which is fixed by T. Unlike in the continuum, the fixed point theorem proven
here looks for fixed cliques, complete subgraphs which play now the role of
""points"" in the graph. Fixed points can so be vertices, edges, fixed triangles
etc. If A denotes the automorphism group of a graph, we also look at the
average Lefschetz number L(G) which is the average of L(T) over A. We prove
that this is the Euler characteristic of the graph G/A and especially an
integer. We also show that as a consequence of the Lefschetz formula, the zeta
function zeta(T,z) is a product of two dynamical zeta functions and therefore
has an analytic continuation as a rational function which is explicitly given
by a product formula involving only the dimension and the signature of prime
orbits of simplices in G.

operations, programming language constructs, and the like, makes it easy to
forget that computation is a physical process. Our cherished notions of
computation and information are grounded in classical mechanics, but the
physics underlying our world is quantum. In the early 80s researchers began to
ask how computation would change if we adopted a quantum mechanical, instead of
a classical mechanical, view of computation. Slowly, a new picture of
computation arose, one that gave rise to a variety of faster algorithms, novel
cryptographic mechanisms, and alternative methods of communication. Small
quantum information processing devices have been built, and efforts are
underway to build larger ones. Even apart from the existence of these devices,
the quantum view on information processing has provided significant insight
into the nature of computation and information, and a deeper understanding of
the physics of our universe and its connections with computation.
  We start by describing aspects of quantum mechanics that are at the heart of
a quantum view of information processing. We give our own idiosyncratic view of
a number of these topics in the hopes of correcting common misconceptions and
highlighting aspects that are often overlooked. A number of the phenomena
described were initially viewed as oddities of quantum mechanics. It was
quantum information processing, first quantum cryptography and then, more
dramatically, quantum computing, that turned the tables and showed that these
oddities could be put to practical effect. It is these application we describe
next. We conclude with a section describing some of the many questions left for
future work, especially the mysteries surrounding where the power of quantum
information ultimately comes from.

experimental feasibility. Qubits are fragile and sophisticated quantum error
correction is required to achieve reliable quantum computation. The surface
code is a promising quantum error correction code, requiring only a physically
reasonable 2-D lattice of qubits with nearest neighbor interactions. However,
existing proofs that reliable quantum computation is possible using this code
assume the ability to measure four-body operators and, despite making this
difficult to realize assumption, require that the error rate of these operator
measurements is less than 10^-9, an unphysically low target. High error rates
have been proved tolerable only when assuming tunable interactions of strength
and error rate independent of distance, which is also unphysical. In this work,
given a 2-D lattice of qubits with only nearest neighbor two-qubit gates, and
single-qubit measurement, initialization, and unitary gates, all of which have
error rate p, we prove that arbitrarily reliable quantum computation is
possible provided p<7.4x10^-4, a target that many experiments have already

attractive for physical RNGs due to their fundamental randomness and immunity
to attack [1]- [5]. Optical parametric down conversion is an essential element
in most quantum optical experiments including optical squeezing [9], and
generation of entangled photons [10]. In an optical parametric oscillator
(OPO), photons generated through spontaneous down conversion of the pump
initiate the oscillation in the absence of other inputs [11, 12]. This quantum
process is the dominant effect during the oscillation build-up, leading to
selection of one of the two possible phase states above threshold in a
degenerate OPO [13]. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel all-optical
quantum RNG in which the photodetection is not a part of the random process,
and no post processing is required for the generated bit sequence. We implement
a synchronously pumped twin degenerate OPO, which comprises two identical
independent OPOs in a single cavity, and measure the relative phase states of
the OPO outputs above threshold as a bit value. We show that the outcome is
statistically random with 99% confidence. With the use of micro- and nanoscale
OPO resonators, this technique offers a promise for simple, robust, and

interstellar medium (ISM) by using a chemical evolution model of galaxy with
metals (elements heavier than helium) in dust phase in addition to the total
amount of metals. We consider asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, type II
supernovae (SNe II) and the dust mass growth in the ISM as the sources of dust,
and SN shocks as the destruction mechanism of dust. Further, to describe the
dust evolution precisely, our model takes into account the age and metallicity
(the ratio of metal mass to ISM mass) dependence of the sources of dust. We
particularly focused on the dust mass growth, and found that the dust mass
growth in the ISM is regulated by the metallicity. To quantify this aspect, we
introduce a ""critical metallicity"", which is a metallicity at which the
contribution of stars (AGB stars and SNe II) equals that of the dust mass
growth in the ISM. If the star formation timescale is shorter, the value of the
critical metallicity is higher, but the galactic age at which the metallicity
reaches the critical metallicity is shorter. From observations, it was expected
that the dust mass growth was the dominant source of dust in the Milky Way and
dusty QSOs at high redshifts. By introducing the critical metallicity, it is
clearly shown that the dust mass growth is the main source of dust in such
galaxies with various star formation timescales and ages. The dust mass growth
in the ISM is regulated by metallicity, and we stress that the critical
metallicity works as an indicator to judge whether the grain growth in the ISM
is dominant source of dust in a galaxy, especially because of the strong and
nonlinear dependence on the metallicity.

spaces equipped with a star product to study the asymptotic properties of
certain matrix sequences in which the matrix dimension $D$ tends to infinity.
Our approach is based on the $su(2)$ coherent states which allow for a
systematic 1/D expansion of the star product. This produces a trace formula for
functions of the matrix sequence elements in the large-$D$ limit which includes
higher order (finite-$D$) corrections. From this a variety of analytic results
pertaining to the asymptotic properties of the density of states, eigenstates
and expectation values associated with the matrix sequence follows. It is shown
how new and existing results in the settings of collective spin systems and
orthogonal polynomial sequences can be readily obtained as special cases. In
particular, this approach allows for the calculation of higher order
corrections to the zero distributions of a large class of orthogonal
polynomials.

serendipitously harmless at this level. This suggests an alternative to the
Hartle-Hawking approach, where the pre-fixed $a(t)$ and its derivatives are
treated as explicit functions of time, leaving $n(t)$ and a now mandatory
$\phi(t)$ to serve as canonical variables. The naive gauge pre-fix $a(t)=const$
is clearly forbidden, causing evolution to freeze altogether, so pre-fixing the
scale factor, say $a(t)=t$, necessarily introduces explicit time dependence
into the Lagrangian. Invoking Dirac's prescription for dealing with

star formation rate compared to other disk galaxies with similar stellar mass.
It also shows a steep metallicity gradient. We construct a chemical evolution
model to explore its growth history by assuming its disk grows gradually from
continuous gas infall, which is shaped by a free parameter -- the infall-peak
time. By adopting the recently observed molecular surface density related star
formation law, we show that a late infall-peak time can naturally explain the
observed high neutral gas content, while an inside-out disk formation scenario
can fairly reproduce the steep oxygen abundance gradient. Our results show that
most of the observed features of UGC8802 can be well reproduced by simply
`turning the knob' on gas inflow with one single parameter, which implies that
the observed properties of gas-rich galaxies could also be modelled in a

the ridge regression estimator when the projection vector is sparse in the

explicit form and is easy to use in application. Asymptotic properties such as
the consistency of variable selection and estimation and the convergence rate

because of its high compression capability. Accordingly, in this paper a method
which adds secrecy to this well-known source code is proposed. Finite state
arithmetic code (FSAC) is used as source code to add security. Its finite state
machine (FSM) characteristic is exploited to insert some random jumps during
source coding process. In addition, a Huffman code is designed for each state
to make decoding possible even in jumps. Being Prefix free, Huffman codes are
useful in tracking correct states for an authorized user when s/he decodes with
correct symmetric pseudo random key. The robustness of our proposed scheme is
further reinforced by adding another extra uncertainty by swapping outputs of
Huffman codes in each state. Several test images are used for inspecting the
validity of the proposed Huffman Finite State Arithmetic Coding (HFSAC). The
results of several experimental, key space analyses, statistical analysis, key
sensitivity and plaintext sensitivity tests show that HFSAC with a little
effect on compression efficiency for image cryptosystem provides an efficient

additional degree of freedom into the problem, in the form of an unknown
""inner"" depolarization constant. Two coupled self-consistent equations
determine the latter and the permittivity in terms of the dielectric contrast
and the volume fractions. One of them generalizes the usual Coherent Potential
condition to many-body interactions between single-phase clusters of
polarizable matter elements, while the other one determines the effective
medium in which clusters are embedded. The latter is in general different from
the overall permittivity. The proposed approach allows for many-body
corrections to the Bruggeman-Landauer (BL) scheme to be handled in a
multiple-scattering framework. Four parameters are used to adjust the degree of
self-consistency and to characterize clusters in a schematic geometrical way.
Given these parameters, the resulting theory is ""exact"" to second order in the
volume fractions. For suitable parameter values, reasonable to excellent
agreement is found between theory and simulations of random-resistor networks

fluorescence time series exhibit nonintuitive dependence on ligand
concentration. Here we examine several possible mechanistic and technical
origins that may induce ligand dependence of rate constants. Using aggregated
Markov models, we show under the condition of detailed balance that
non-fluorescent bindings and missed events due to transient interactions,
instead of conformation fluctuations, may underly the dependence of waiting
times and thus apparent rate constants on ligand concentrations. In general,
waiting times are rational functions of ligand concentration. The shape of
concentration dependence is qualitatively affected by the number of binding
sites in the single molecule and is quantitatively tuned by model parameters.
We also show that ligand dependence can be caused by non-equilibrium conditions
which result in violations of detailed balance and require an energy source. As
to a different but significant mechanism, we examine the effect of ambient
buffers that can substantially reduce the effective concentration of ligands
that interact with the single molecules. To demonstrate the effects by these
mechanisms, we applied our results to analyze the concentration dependence in a

avoid this inconsistency by representing each quantum channel with a single

discuss composite Higgs boson in various models of our own for the dynamical

walking technicolor (WTC) with $\gamma_m \simeq 1$, the $\bar t t$ composite
(""top-Higgs"") in the top-quark condensate model with $\gamma_m \simeq 2$, and
their variants in the models with $1<\gamma_m <2$ (strong ETC Technicolor,
etc.). Among others we will focus on WTC which has an approximate scale
symmetry in the region relevant to the dynamical mass generation. Such a
conformal gauge dynamics is characterized by the essential singularity scaling,
breakdown of the Ginzburg-Landau/Gell-Mann-Levy effective theory, and also by a
large anomalous dimension $\gamma_m =1$. In contrast to the folklore that
Technicolor is a ""Higgsless theory"", there exists a composite Higgs,
techni-dilaton, in the WTC as a composite pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson
associated with the spontaneously broken (approximate) scale symmetry, with its
mass only arising from the (nonperturbative) scale anomaly and hence being much
smaller than those of other techni-hadrons. The techni-dilaton has a mass
typically of order $500-600 {\rm GeV}$ and can be discovered at LHC. We shall
also touch upon the endeavor to discover WTC on the lattice.

constitutes one of the cornerstone tools. However, the computation of its
quantiles under the null or the alternative requires complex analytic
approximations and more importantly, these distributional approximations are
feasible only for moderate dimension of the dependent variable, say $p\le 20$.
On the other hand, assuming that the data dimension $p$ as well as the number
$q$ of regression variables are fixed while the sample size $n$ grows, several
asymptotic approximations are proposed in the literature for Wilk's $\bLa$
including the widely used chi-square approximation. In this paper, we consider
necessary modifications to Wilk's test in a high-dimensional context,
specifically assuming a high data dimension $p$ and a large sample size $n$.
Based on recent random matrix theory, the correction we propose to Wilk's test
is asymptotically Gaussian under the null and simulations demonstrate that the
corrected LRT has very satisfactory size and power, surely in the large $p$ and
large $n$ context, but also for moderately large data dimensions like $p=30$ or
$p=50$. As a byproduct, we give a reason explaining why the standard chi-square
approximation fails for high-dimensional data. We also introduce a new
procedure for the classical multiple sample significance test in MANOVA which
is valid for high-dimensional data.

astrophysical context, namely the evaluation of photometric redshifts, of
MLPQNA, a machine learning method based on Quasi Newton Algorithm. Methods.
Theoretical methods for photo-z's evaluation are based on the interpolation of
a priori knowledge (spectroscopic redshifts or SED templates) and represent an
ideal comparison ground for neural networks based methods. The MultiLayer
Perceptron with Quasi Newton learning rule (MLPQNA) described here is a
computing effective implementation of Neural Networks for the first time
exploited to solve regression problems in the astrophysical context and is
offered to the community through the DAMEWARE (DAta Mining & ExplorationWeb
Application REsource) infrastructure. Results. The PHAT contest (Hildebrandt et
al. 2010) provides a standard dataset to test old and new methods for
photometric redshift evaluation and with a set of statistical indicators which
allow a straightforward comparison among different methods. The MLPQNA model
has been applied on the whole PHAT1 dataset of 1984 objects after an
optimization of the model performed by using as training set the 515 available
spectroscopic redshifts. When applied to the PHAT1 dataset, MLPQNA obtains the
best bias accuracy (0.0006) and very competitive accuracies in terms of scatter
(0.056) and outlier percentage (16.3%), scoring as the second most effective
empirical method among those which have so far participated to the contest.
MLPQNA shows better generalization capabilities than most other empirical
methods especially in presence of underpopulated regions of the Knowledge Base.

flow (QIF) analysis that invites the community to bound the leakage, reported
by QIF quantifiers, by a range consistent with the size of a program's secret
input instead of by a mathematically sound (but counter-intuitive) upper bound
of that leakage. To substantiate our position, we present a refinement of a
recent QIF metric that appears in the literature. Our refinement is based on
slight changes we bring into the design of that metric. These changes do not
affect the theoretical premises onto which the original metric is laid.
However, they enable the natural association between flow results and the
exhaustive search effort needed to uncover a program's secret information (or
the residual secret part of that information) to be clearly established. The
refinement we discuss in this paper validates our perspective and demonstrates
its importance in the future design of QIF quantifiers.

environmental variables are likely to be under selection and this is the
rationale of recent methods of identifying selected loci and retrieving
functional information about them. To be efficient, such methods need to be
able to disentangle the potential effect of environmental variables from the
confounding effect of population history. For the routine analysis of
genome-wide datasets, one also needs fast inference and model selection
algorithms. We propose a method based on an explicit spatial model which is an
instance of spatial generalized linear mixed model (SGLMM). For inference, we
make use of the INLA-SPDE theoretical and computational framework developed by
Rue et al. (2009) and Lindgren et al (2011). The method we propose allows one
to quantify the correlation between genotypes and environmental variables. It
works for the most common types of genetic markers, obtained either at the
individual or at the population level. Analyzing simulated data produced under
a geostatistical model then under an explicit model of selection, we show that
the method is efficient. We also re-analyze a dataset relative to nineteen pine
weevils (Hylobius abietis}) populations across Europe. The method proposed
appears also as a statistically sound alternative to the Mantel tests for
testing the association between genetic and environmental variables.

also apply to phase field crystal (PFC) models of solidification. As the
solidification front advances into the unstable liquid phase, the density
profile behind the advancing front develops density modulations and the
wavelength of these modulations is a dynamically chosen quantity. For shallow
quenches, the selected wavelength is precisely that of the crystalline phase
and so well-ordered crystalline states are formed. However, when the system is
deeply quenched, we find that this wavelength can be quite different from that
of the crystal, so that the solidification front naturally generates disorder
in the system. Significant rearrangement and ageing must subsequently occur for
the system to form the regular well-ordered crystal that corresponds to the
free energy minimum. Additional disorder is introduced whenever a front
develops from random initial conditions. We illustrate these findings with
results obtained from the PFC.

dominate visible and infrared images of faint dust rings. Finally, we present
full stability maps for Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune with

L^p$ and $b^2_Q\in L^q$ such that $1_{2Q}Tb^1_Q\in L^{q'}$ and
$1_{2Q}T^*b^2_Q\in L^{p'}$, with appropriate uniformity and scaling of the
norms. This is sufficient for the $L^2$-boundedness of the Calderon-Zygmund
operator $T$, for any $p,q\in(1,\infty)$, a result previously unknown for
simultaneously small values of $p$ and $q$. We obtain this as a corollary of a
local $Tb$ theorem for the maximal truncations $T_{\#}$ and $(T^*)_{\#}$: for
the $L^2$-boundedness of $T$, it suffices that $1_Q T_{\#}b^1_Q$ and $1_Q

represented by local necessity-valued knowledge base. Data in properties are
interpreted as set of valuated formulas. In our contribution possibilistic
Bayesian networks have a qualitative part and a quantitative part, represented
by local knowledge bases. The general idea is to study how a fusion of these

problems for knowledge representation. We show how to apply possibility and
necessity measures to the problem of knowledge representation with large scale

the pertinent of some indicating objects and/or goals extracted by the system.
Obviously the user cannot mark objects and/or goals as pertinent until some are
extracted, so the first search has to be initiated by a query and the initial
query specification has to be good enough to pick out some pertinent objects
and/or goals from the Semantic Network. In this paper we present a short survey
of fuzzy and Semantic approaches to Knowledge Extraction. The goal of such
approaches is to define flexible Knowledge Extraction Systems able to deal with
the inherent vagueness and uncertainty of the Extraction process. It has long
been recognised that interactivity improves the effectiveness of Knowledge
Extraction systems. Novice user's queries are the most natural and interactive
medium of communication and recent progress in recognition is making it
possible to build systems that interact with the user. However, given the
typical novice user's queries submitted to Knowledge Extraction Systems, it is
easy to imagine that the effects of goal recognition errors in novice user's
queries must be severely destructive on the system's effectiveness. The
experimental work reported in this paper shows that the use of possibility
theory in classical Knowledge Extraction techniques for novice user's query
processing is more robust than the use of the probability theory. Moreover,
both possibilistic and probabilistic pertinence feedback can be effectively
employed to improve the effectiveness of novice user's query processing.

with the SFH allows us to describe the chemical evolution in the nearby
universe (z < 0.25) in a manner which is consistent with the formation of their
stellar populations and morphologies. A 45% of the SFGs in our sample show an
excess of abundance in nitrogen relative to their metallicity. We also find
this excess to be accompanied by a deficiency of oxygen, which suggests that
this could be the result of effective starburst winds. However, we find no
difference in the mode of star formation of the nitrogen rich and nitrogen poor
SFGs. Our analysis suggests they all form their stars through a succession of
bursts of star formation extended over a few Gyr period. What produces the
chemical differences between these galaxies seems therefore to be the intensity
of the bursts: the galaxies with an excess of nitrogen are those that are
presently experiencing more intense bursts, or have experienced more intense
bursts in their past. We also find evidence relating the chemical evolution
process to the formation of the galaxies: the galaxies with an excess of
nitrogen are more massive, have more massive bulges and earlier morphologies
than those showing no excess. As a possible explanation we propose that the
lost of metals consistent with starburst winds took place during the formation
of the galaxies, when their potential wells were still building up, and
consequently were weaker than today, making starburst winds more efficient and
independent of the final mass of the galaxies. In good agreement with this
interpretation, we also find evidence consistent with downsizing, according to
which the more massive SFGs formed before the less massive ones.

on the suppression of the field build-up within a microcavity due to
non-degenerate two-photon absorption. This experiment used one beam in a
resonator and one in free-space due to limitations related to device physics.
These results suggest that a similar scheme with both beams resonant in the
cavity would correspond to input power levels near 20 nW.

are typically based on a combination of theoretical models and empirical data,
and focus on single species population dynamics. Of course, species also
interact with each other, forming more or less complex networks of
interactions. Models to assess extinction risk often lack explicit
incorporation of these interspecific interactions. We study a birth and death
process in which the death rate includes an effect from predation. This
predation rate is included via a general nonlinear expression for the
functional response of predation to prey density. We investigate the effects of
the foraging parameters (e.g. attack rate and handling time) on the mean time
to extinction. Mean time to extinction varies by orders of magnitude when we
alter the foraging parameters, even when we exclude the effects of these
parameters on the equilibrium population size. In particular we observe an
exponential dependence of the mean time to extinction on handling time. These
findings clearly show that accounting for the nature of interspecific
interactions is likely to be critically important when estimating extinction
risk.

associated with a relative motion of two masses of solid $^4$He in contact. The
situation where ""two masses"" coupled only by friction exists emerges
spontaneously during a disordering of a single crystal contained inside a
annular sample space of torsional oscillator (TO). Under the torque applied by
the oscillating walls of the the TO these ""masses"" move relative to each other,
generating measurable dissipation at their interface. We studied this
dissipation between 0.5K and 1.8K in solid samples grown from commercially pure
$^4$He and from a 100 ppm $^3$He-$^4$He mixture. The data were analyzed by
modelling the TO as a driven harmonic oscillator. In this model, analysis of
the resonant frequency and amplitude of the TO yields the temperature
dependence of the friction coefficient. By fitting the data to specific forms,
we found that over our temperature range, the dominant friction mechanism
associated with the interfacial motion results from climb of individual
dislocations. The characteristic energy scale associated with this internal
friction is between 3K and 6K, depending on the sample. The fact that a single
value of this energy accounts for the data of a given sample supports the idea
that the interface between the moving and static solid is well oriented. The
relative motion of the solid in this case can perhaps be described as the low
limit of ""slip-stick"" motion.

obtain spatial correlation function parameters from power law fits to the
angular correlation function. We confirm an increase in clustering strength for
sub-L* red galaxies compared with ~L* red galaxies at small scales in all
redshift bins, whereas for the blue population the correlation length is almost
independent of luminosity for ~L* galaxies and fainter. A linear relation
between relative bias and log luminosity is found to hold down to luminosities
L~0.03L*. We find that the redshift dependence of the bias of the L* population

branching events correspond to the splitting of the sequence due to
recombination. With the help of a decomposition of the trees into subtrees, we
calculate the probabilities of the topologies of the ancestral trees. At the

dynamical system that emerges from the Wright-Fisher model via a law of large

distinguish between codes that can be decoded directly and those that require
that the decoder knows the current generation to successfully decode the state
of the memory. A widely used approach to construct WOM codes is to design first
nondecodable codes that approach the boundaries of the capacity region, and
then make them decodable by appending additional cells that store the current
generation, at an expense of a rate loss. In this paper, we propose an
alternative method to make nondecodable WOM codes decodable by appending cells
that also store some additional data. The key idea is to append to the original
(nondecodable) code a short synchronous WOM code and write generations of the
original code and of the synchronous code simultaneously. We consider both the
binary and the nonbinary case. Furthermore, we propose a construction of
synchronous WOM codes, which are then used to make nondecodable codes
decodable. For short-to-moderate block lengths, the proposed method
significantly reduces the rate loss as compared to the standard method.

inclusion of local chemical potential and driving velocity fields as a gauge
field allows derivation of the hydrodynamic equations of motion for the driven
macroscopic phase differences across simple aperture arrays. For a single
aperture, the current-phase equation for driven flow contains sinusoidal,
linear, and current-bias contributions. We compute the renormalization group
(RG) beta function of the periodic potential in the effective action for small

low-energy current-phase relation, with application to the transition from
linear to sinusoidal current-phase behavior observed in experiments by
Hoskinson et al. \cite{packard} for liquid $^{4}$He driven through nanoaperture
arrays. Extension of the microscopic theory to a two-aperture array shows that
interference between the microscopic tunneling contributions for individual
apertures leads to an effective coupling between apertures which amplifies the
Josephson oscillations in the array. The resulting multi-aperture current-phase
equations are found to be equivalent to a set of equations for coupled pendula,

module. It supports the curation, documentation, version control, and update of
individual modules and the subsequent automatic composition of complex models,
without requiring mathematical skills. Modules can be (semi-) automatically

Knowledge Extraction. The goal of such approaches is to define flexible
Knowledge Extraction Systems able to deal with the inherent vagueness and
uncertainty of the Extraction process. It has long been recognised that
interactivity improves the effectiveness of Knowledge Extraction systems.
Novice user's queries is the most natural and interactive medium of
communication and recent progress in recognition is making it possible to build
systems that interact with the user. However, given the typical novice user's
queries submitted to Knowledge Extraction systems, it is easy to imagine that
the effects of goal recognition errors in novice user's queries must be
severely destructive on the system's effectiveness. The experimental work
reported in this paper shows that the use of classical Knowledge Extraction
techniques for novice user's query processing is robust to considerably high
levels of goal recognition errors. Moreover, both standard relevance feedback
and pseudo relevance feedback can be effectively employed to improve the
effectiveness of novice user's query processing.

which consist of spin waves, orbital waves, and joint spin-orbital excitations.
Among the latter we identify strongly entangled spin-orbital bound states which
appear as peaks in the von Neumann entropy (vNE) spectral function introduced
in this work. The strong entanglement of bound states is manifested by a
universal logarithmic scaling of the vNE with system size, while the vNE of
other spin-orbital excitations saturates. We suggest that spin-orbital
entanglement can be experimentally explored by the measurement of the dynamical
spin-orbital correlations using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, where
strong spin-orbit coupling associated with the core hole plays a role.

  Mathematics","11 pages, 3 tables",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Natural phenomenon of coevolution is the reciprocally induced evolutionary
change between two or more species or population. Though this biological
occurrence is a natural fact, there are only few attempts to use this as a
simile in computation. This paper is an attempt to introduce reciprocally
induced coevolution as a mechanism to counter problems faced by a typical
genetic algorithm applied as an optimization technique. The domain selected for
testing the efficacy of the procedure is the process of finding numerical
solutions of Diophantine equations. Diophantine equations are polynomial
equations in Mathematics where only integer solutions are sought. Such
equations and its solutions are significant in three aspects-(i) historically
they are important as Hilbert's tenth problem with a background of more than
twenty six centuries; (ii) there are many modern application areas of
Diophantine equations like public key cryptography and data dependency in super
computers (iii) it has been proved that there does not exist any general method
to find solutions of such equations. The proposed procedure has been tested
with Diophantine equations with different powers and different number of
variables.

understand possible tilings by completely characterizing the triples (ABC, T,

enable us to specify for which N there exists a tile T and a triangle ABC that

N-tile ABC. This is the fifth paper in a series of papers on this subject. The
previous papers have reduced the problem the case when T has a 120 degree angle
and integer side lengths. That is the problem we take up in this paper. We are
still not able to completely solve the problem, but we prove that if there are
any N-tilings by such tiles, then N is at least 96. Combining this results with
our earlier work, we can remove the exception for a tile with a 120 degree
angle, obtaining definitive non-existence results. For example, there is no
7-tiling, no 11-tiling, no 14-tiling, no 19-tiling, no 31-tiling, no 41-tiling,
etc.
  Regarding the number N=96: There are several possible shapes of ABC, and for
each shape, we exhibit the smallest N for which it is presently unknown whether
there is an N-tiling. For example, for equilateral ABC, the simplest unsolved
case as of May, 2012 is N=135. For each of these minimal-N examples, the tile
would have to have sides (3,5,7).

  ""necessary and sufficient"" instead of just ""necessary""",,,,"math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An $N$-tiling of triangle $ABC$ by triangle $T$ (the `tile') is a way of
writing $ABC$ as a union of $N$ copies of $T$ overlapping only at their
boundaries. Let the tile $T$ have angles $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$, and sides
$(a,b,c)$. This paper takes up the case when $3\alpha + 2\beta = \pi$. Then
there are (as was already known) exactly five possible shapes of $ABC$: either
$ABC$ is isosceles with base angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, or $\alpha+\beta$, or
the angles of $ABC$ are $(2\alpha,\beta,\alpha+\beta)$, or the angles of $ABC$
are $(2\alpha, \alpha, 2\beta)$. In each of these cases, we have discovered,
and here exhibit, a family of previously unknown tilings. These are tilings
that, as far as we know, have never been seen before. We also discovered, in
each of the cases, a Diophantine equation involving $N$ and the (necessarily
rational) number $s = a/c$ that has solutions if there is a tiling using tile
$T$ of some $ABC$ not similar to $T$. By means of these Diophantine equations,
some conclusions about the possible values of $N$ are drawn; in particular
there are no tilings possible for values of $N$ of certain forms. We prove, for
example, that there is no $N$-tiling with $N$ prime when $3\alpha + 2\beta =
\pi$. These equations also imply that for each $N$, there is a finite set of
possibilities for the tile $(a,b,c)$ and the triangle $ABC$. (Usually, but not
always, there is just one possible tile.) These equations provide necessary,
and in three of the five cases sufficient, conditions for the existence of
$N$-tilings.

triangle T is the ""tile"".
  The tile may or may not be similar to ABC . We wish to understand possible
tilings by completely characterizing the triples (ABC, T, N) such that ABC can
be N -tiled by T. In particular, this understanding should enable us to specify
for which N there exists a tile T and a triangle ABC that is N-tiled by T; or
given N, determine which tiles and triangles can be used for N-tilings; or
given ABC, to determine which tiles and N can be used to N-tile ABC. This is
the second of four papers on this subject. In the first paper, we dealt with
the case when ABC is similar to T, and the case when T is a right triangle. In
this paper, we assume that ABC is not similar to T, and T is not a right
triangle, and furthermore that if T has a 120 degree angle, then T is
isosceles.
  Under those hypotheses, there are only two families of tilings. There are
tilings of an equilateral triangle ABC by an isosceles tile with base angles 30
degrees, and there are newly-discovered ""triquadratic tilings"", which are
treated in the third paper in this series. These arise in the special case that
3\alpha + 2\beta = \pi or 3\beta+ 2\alpha = \pi with \alpha not a rational
multiple of \pi, where \alpha and \beta are the two smallest angles of the
tile, and the sides of the tile have rational ratios.
  The case when the tile has a 120 degree angle and is not isosceles is taken
up in a subsequent paper.
  We use techniques from linear algebra and elementary field theory, and in one
case we use some algebraic number theory. We use some counting arguments and
some elementary geometry and trigonometry.

  The tile may or may not be similar to ABC . This paper is the first of
several papers, which together seek a complete characterization of the triples
(ABC,N,T) such that ABC can be N -tiled by T . In this paper, we consider the
case in which the tile is similar to ABC, the case in which the tile is a right
triangle, and the case when ABC is equilateral.
  We use (only) techniques from linear algebra and elementary field theory, as
well as elementary geometry and trigonometry.
  Our results (in this paper) are as follows: When the tile is similar to ABC,
we always have ""quadratic tilings'"" when N is a square. If the tile is similar
to ABC and is not a right triangle, then N is a square. If N is a sum of two
squares, N = e^2 + f^2, then a right triangle with legs e and f can be N -tiled
by a tile similar to ABC ; these tilings are called ""biquadratic"". If the tile
and ABC are 30-60-90 triangles, then N can also be three times a square. If T
is similar to ABC, these are all the possible triples (ABC, T, N) .
  If the tile is a right triangle, of course it can tile a certain isosceles
triangle when N is twice a square, and in some cases when N is six times a
square.
  Equilateral triangles can be 3-tiled and 6-tiled and hence they can also be
3n^2 and 6n^2 tiled for any n . We also discovered a family of tilings when N
is 3 times a square, which we call the ""hexagonal tilings."" These tilings
exhaust all the possible triples (ABC, T, N) in case T is a right triangle or
is similar to ABC . Other cases are treated in subsequent papers.
