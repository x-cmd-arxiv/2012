gensets etc. Several designs of variable compression ratio two stroke engines
are commercially available for analysis purpose. In this present investigation
a novel method of changing the compression ratio is proposed, applied, studied
and analyzed. The clearance volume of the engine is altered by introducing a
metal plug into the combustion chamber. This modification permitted to have
four different values of clearance value keeping in view of the studies
required the work is brought out as two sections. The first part deals with the
design, modification, engine fabrication and testing at different compression
ratios for the study of performance of the engine. The second part deals with
the combustion in engine using FLUENT and analysis of exhaust gases. Increase
in compression ratio improves fuel efficiency and power output. The novelty in
this work is to permit the two wheeler driver to change the compression ratio.

Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) Deep Extragalactic Observations
(VIDEO) survey. VIDEO is a ~12degree^2 survey in the near-infrared Z,Y,J,H and
K_s bands, specifically designed to enable the evolution of galaxies and large
structures to be traced as a function of both epoch and environment from the
present day out to z=4, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the most massive
galaxies up to and into the epoch of reionization. With its depth and area,
VIDEO will be able to fully explore the period in the Universe where AGN and
starburst activity were at their peak and the first galaxy clusters were
beginning to virialize. VIDEO therefore offers a unique data set with which to
investigate the interplay between AGN, starbursts and environment, and the role
of feedback at a time when it was potentially most crucial.
  We provide data over the VIDEO-XMM3 tile, which also covers the
Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope Legacy Survey Deep-1 field (CFHTLS-D1). The
released VIDEO data reach a 5-sigma AB-magnitude depth of Z=25.7, Y=24.5,
J=24.4, H=24.1 and K_s=23.8 in 2 arcsec diameter apertures (the full depth of
Y=24.6 will be reached within the full integration time in future releases).
The data are compared to previous surveys over this field and we find good
astrometric agreement with the Two-Micron All Sky Survey, and source counts in
agreement with the recently released UltraVISTA survey data. The addition of
the VIDEO data to the CFHTLS-D1 optical data increases the accuracy of
photometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophic
outliers over the redshift range 0<z<1 from 5.8 to 3.1 per cent in the absence
of an i-band luminosity prior. (Truncated Abstract)

determination of the slope of conventionally defined straight lines fitted to
stress-strain curves in a given range of elongations. This paper describes the
approach allowing for a correct measurement of the instantaneous elastic
modulus of polymers in a tensile test. It is based on the use of an appropriate
reduced model to describe the behavior of the material. The model comes a
thermodynamical framework and allows to reproduce the behavior of an HDPE
Polymer until large strains, covering the elastoviscoplastic and hardening
regimes. Well-established principles of parameter estimation in engineering
science are used to found the identification procedure. It will be shown that
three parameters only are necessary to model experimental tensile signals: the
instantaneous ('Young's') modulus, the maximum relaxation time of a linear
distribution (described with a universal shape) and a strain hardening modulus
to describe the 'relaxed' state. The paper ends with an assessment of the
methodology. Our results of instantaneous modulus measurements are compared

in several applications such as the colour diversity problem and graphical
games. We demonstrate ensembles of random graphs, including regular
connectivity graphs, that have a periodic variation of free energy, with either
the ratio of nearest to next nearest couplings, or the mean number of nearest
neighbours. When the coupling ratio is integer paramagnetic phases can be found
at zero temperature. This is shown to be related to the locked or unlocked
nature of the interactions. For anti-ferromagnetic couplings, spin glass phases
are demonstrated at low temperature. The interaction structure is formulated as
a factor graph, the solution on a tree is developed. The replica symmetric and
energetic one-step replica symmetry breaking solution is developed using the
cavity method. We calculate within these frameworks the phase diagram and
demonstrate the existence of dynamical transitions at zero temperature for
cases of anti-ferromagnetic coupling on regular and inhomogeneous random

  version: minor corrections. To appear in International Journal of Mathematics",,,,"math.AG math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main result is a wall crossing formula for central projections defined on
submanifolds of a real projective space. Our formula gives the jump of the
degree of such a projection when the center of the projection varies. The fact
that the degree depends on the projection is a new phenomenon, specific to real
algebraic geometry. We illustrate this phenomenon in many interesting
situations. The crucial assumption on the class of maps we consider is relative
orientability, a condition which allows us to define a $\Z$-valued degree map
in a coherent way. We end the article with several examples, e.g. the pole
placement map associated with a quotient, the Wronski map, and a new version of
the real subspace problem.

sum rates are achieved when the relays are jointly optimized with the transmit
strategy. Unfortunately, interference couples the links together making joint
optimization challenging. Further, the end-to-end multi-hop performance is
sensitive to rate mismatch, when some links have a dominant first link while
others have a dominant second link. This paper proposes an algorithm for
designing the linear transmit precoders at the transmitters and relays of the
relay interference broadcast channel, a generic model for relay-based cellular
systems, to maximize the end-to-end sum-rates. First, the relays are designed
to maximize the second-hop sum-rates. Next, approximate end-to-end rates that
depend on the time-sharing fraction and the second-hop rates are used to
formulate a sum-utility maximization problem for designing the transmitters.
This problem is solved by iteratively minimizing the weighted sum of mean
square errors. Finally, the norms of the transmit precoders at the transmitters
are adjusted to eliminate rate mismatch. The proposed algorithm allows for
distributed implementation and has fast convergence. Numerical results show
that the proposed algorithm outperforms a reasonable application of single-hop
interference management strategies separately on two hops.

according to the value of risk aversion and initial expectation, the

expectation, the probability of returns is maximal, while, in the opposite
case, the probability for the agents to remain abroad is very high. In between,
when the two values are comparable, it does exist a broad intertwined region

cosmic origins spectrograph (COS) FUV-UV spectra of the bright, nearby Cepheids
Polaris, {\delta} Cep and {\beta} Dor. Previous studies made with the
international ultraviolet explorer (IUE) showed a limited number of UV emission
lines in Cepheids. The well-known problem presented by scattered light
contamination in IUE spectra for bright stars, along with the excellent
sensitivity & resolution combination offered by HST/COS, motivated this study,
and the spectra obtained were much more rich and complex than we had ever
anticipated. Numerous emission lines, indicating 10^4 K up to ~3 x 10^5 K
plasmas, have been observed, showing Cepheids to have complex, dynamic outer
atmospheres that also vary with the photospheric pulsation period. The FUV line
emissions peak in the phase range {\phi} ~ 0.8-1.0 and vary by factors as large
as 10x. A more complete picture of Cepheid outer atmospheres is accomplished
when the HST/COS results are combined with X-ray observations that we have
obtained of the same stars with XMM-Newton & Chandra. The Cepheids detected to
date have X-ray luminosities of log Lx ~ 28.5-29.1 ergs/sec, and plasma
temperatures in the 2-8 x 10^6 K range. Given the phase-timing of the enhanced
emissions, the most plausible explanation is the formation of a
pulsation-induced shocks that excite (and heat) the atmospheric plasmas
surrounding the photosphere. A pulsation-driven {\alpha}^2 equivalent dynamo
mechanism is also a viable and interesting alternative. However, the tight
phase-space of enhanced emission (peaking near 0.8-1.0 {\phi}) favor the shock
heating mechanism hypothesis.

extract any potential information about the QCD critical point. We demonstrate
that for a wide range of the true cumulant ratios K_{n}/K_{m} the measured

We estimate the various forces acting on the CME as predicted by three

provides the best agreement with the observations. With the flux rope model, we
are able to predict the internal magnetic field of the CME near Earth from the

random-phase-approximation in the superconducting state using a two band model
and show that a collective mode in the multi-orbital channel arises at Q=0.
This mode splits in energy, yet remains at Q\sim0 as the pseudogap develops
breaking both translational and time-reversal symmetries in the spin-channel,
and thus gap out the electrnic states. The observations of the dynamical mode
and static moment in the pseudogap state are in good accord with experimental
observations. A verifiable prediction of this proposal is the development of
magnetic order also in the Hg-O layer. Detection of Hg-O band via optical

produced at CERN and aimed to a set of seven possible underground sites in
Europe with distances ranging from 130 km to 2300 km. Studies on the
feasibility of a next generation very massive neutrino observatory have been
performed for these sites in the context of the first phase of the LAGUNA
design study. We consider specific scenarios for the proton driver (a high
power proton driver at 4.5 GeV for the shortest baseline and a 50 GeV machine
for longer baselines) and the far detector (a Water Cherenkov for the shortest
baseline and a LAr TPC for longer baselines). The flux simulation profits of a
full GEANT4 simulation. The optimization has been performed before the recent
results on nu_e appearance by reactor and accelerator experiments and hence it
is based on the maximization of the sensitivity on theta13. Nevertheless the
optimized fluxes have been widely used since their publication on the internet
(2010). This work is therefore mainly intended as a documentation of the
adopted method and at the same time as an intermediate step towards future
studies which will put the emphasis on the performances of beams for the study
of delta_CP.

SEDs and find that higher [O II] EW galaxies have somewhat bluer continua. SED
model-fitting shows that they have on average half the stellar mass of galaxies

19<m_r'<21.5, and the `red' and `blue' samples, whose lensing signals are
dominated by massive low-redshift early-type and late-type galaxies,
respectively. To study the environmental dependence of the lensing signal, we
separate each lens sample into an isolated and clustered part and analyse them
separately. We also measure the azimuthal dependence of the distribution of
physically associated galaxies around the lens samples. We find that these
satellites preferentially reside near the major axis of the lenses, and
constrain the angle between the major axis of the lens and the average location
of the satellites to <theta>=43.7 deg +/- 0.3 deg for the `all' lenses,
<theta>=41.7 deg +/- 0.5 deg for the `red' lenses and <theta>=42.0 deg +/- 1.4
deg for the `blue' lenses. For the `all' sample, we find that the anisotropy of
the galaxy-mass cross-correlation function <f-f_45>=0.23 +/- 0.12, providing
weak support for the view that the average galaxy is embedded in, and
preferentially aligned with, a triaxial dark matter halo. Assuming an
elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, we find that the ratio of the
dark matter halo ellipticity and the galaxy ellipticity
f_h=e_h/e_g=1.50+1.03-1.01, which for a mean lens ellipticity of 0.25
corresponds to a projected halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38+0.26-0.25 if the halo
and the lens are perfectly aligned. For isolated galaxies of the `all' sample,
the average shear anisotropy increases to <f-f_45>=0.51+0.26-0.25 and
f_h=4.73+2.17-2.05, whilst for clustered galaxies the signal is consistent with
zero. (abridged)

classification techniques on stars and galaxies with intrinsic FWHM < 0.2
arcsec. We consider unsupervised spectral energy distribution template fitting
and supervised, data-driven Support Vector Machines (SVM). For template
fitting, we use a Maximum Likelihood (ML) method and a new Hierarchical
Bayesian (HB) method, which learns the prior distribution of template
probabilities from the data. SVM requires training data to classify unknown
sources; ML and HB don't. We consider i.) a best-case scenario (SVM_best) where
the training data is (unrealistically) a random sampling of the data in both
signal-to-noise and demographics, and ii.) a more realistic scenario where
training is done on higher signal-to-noise data (SVM_real) at brighter apparent
magnitudes. Testing with COSMOS ugriz data we find that HB outperforms ML,
delivering ~80% completeness, with purity of ~60-90% for both stars and
galaxies, respectively. We find no algorithm delivers perfect performance, and
that studies of metal-poor main-sequence turnoff stars may be challenged by
poor star-galaxy separation. Using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve,
we find a best-to-worst ranking of SVM_best, HB, ML, and SVM_real. We conclude,
therefore, that a well trained SVM will outperform template-fitting methods.
However, a normally trained SVM performs worse. Thus, Hierarchical Bayesian
template fitting may prove to be the optimal classification method in future
surveys.

on the parsec-scale level and study the circumnuclear dust distribution,

1/type 2 dichotomy of AGN. We used the mid-IR beam combiner MIDI together with
the 8m telescopes at the VLTI to observe the nucleus of the Seyfert 2 galaxy
NGC 424, achieving an almost complete coverage of the uv-plane accessible by
the available telescope configurations. We detect extended mid-IR emission with
a relatively baseline- and model-independent mid-IR half-light radius of (2.0
\pm 0.2) pc \times (1.5 \pm 0.3) pc (averaged over the 8-13 {\mu}m wavelength
range). The extended mid-IR source shows an increasing size with wavelength.
The orientation of the major axis in position angle -27deg is closely aligned
with the system axis as set by optical polarization observations. Torus models
typically favor extension along the mid-plane at mid-IR wavelengths instead.
Therefore, we conclude that the majority of the pc-scale mid-IR emission
(>~60%) in this type 2 AGN originates from optically-thin dust in the polar
region of the AGN, a scenario consistent with the near- to far-IR SED. We
suggest that a radiatively-driven dusty wind, possibly launched in a puffed-up
region of the inner hot part of the torus, is responsible for the polar dust.
In this picture, the torus dominates the near-IR emission up to about 5 {\mu}m,
while the polar dust is the main contributor to the mid-IR flux. Our results of
NGC 424 are consistent with recent observations of the AGN in the Circinus
galaxy and resemble large-scale characteristics of other objects. If our
results reflect a general property of the AGN population, the current paradigm
for interpreting and modeling the IR emission of AGN have to be revised.

gamma-ray source spatially coincident with the Galactic center. Recently, a
compelling model for the broad-band gamma-ray emission has been formulated
which posits that high energy protons emanating from Sgr A* could produce
gamma-rays through pion decays resulting from inelastic collisions with the
traversed interstellar gas in the region. Models of the gas distribution in the
Galactic center region imply that the resulting gamma-ray morphology would be
observed as a point source with all current telescopes, but that the upcoming
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) may be able to detect an extended emission
profile with an unmistakable morphology. Here, we critically evaluate this
claim, employing a three dimensional gas distribution model and a detailed
Monte Carlo simulation, and using the anticipated effective area and angular
resolution of CTA. We find that the impressive angular resolution of CTA will
be key to test hadronic emission models conclusively against, for example,
point source or dark matter annihilation scenarios. We comment on the relevance
of this result for searches for dark matter annihilation in the Galactic center

universal, but rather is correlated with galaxy stellar mass, stellar velocity
dispersion, or morphological type. In this paper, we investigate variations of
the IMF within individual galaxies. For this purpose, we use strong lensing and
gas kinematics to measure independently the normalisation of the IMF of the
bulge and disk components of a sample of 5 massive spiral galaxies with
substantial bulge components taken from the SWELLS survey. We find that the
stellar mass of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematic
data. A comparison with masses based on stellar population synthesis models
fitted to optical and near infrared photometry favors a Salpeter-like
normalisation of the IMF. Conversely, the disk masses are less well constrained
due to degeneracies with the dark matter halo, but are consistent with Milky
Way type IMFs in agreement with previous studies. The disks are submaximal at

Velocity dispersions, ages and element abundances for these galaxies have been
previously determined from optical data. By stacking the FMOS spectra in the
rest frame, removing sky-subtraction residuals and other artefacts fixed in the
observed frame, we derive composite spectra in the 9600-10500 Angstrom range
for galaxies grouped according to their velocity dispersion or Mg/Fe ratio. We
measure the Wing-Ford band of FeH and a new index centred on a CaI line at
10345 Angstrom; these features are strong in cool dwarf stars, and hence
reflect the form of the IMF at low mass (<0.5M_sun) The CaI line, unlike the
Wing-Ford band and other `classical' IMF indicators (NaI doublet, CaII
triplet), is unaffected by the abundance of sodium. We compare the measured
indices against predictions from spectral synthesis models matched to the
element abundances estimated from the optical data. Binning galaxies by
velocity dispersion, we find that both the Wing-Ford and CaI index measurements
are best reproduced by models with the Salpeter IMF. There is no clear evidence
for an increase in dwarf-star content with velocity dispersion. Binning the
observed galaxies instead by Mg/Fe ratio, the behaviour of both indices implies
a trend of IMF from Chabrier-like, at abundance ratios close to solar, to
Salpeter or heavier for highly alpha-enhanced populations. At face value, this
suggests that the IMF depends on the mode of star formation, with intense rapid
star-bursts generating a larger population of low-mass stars.

divide the cross section into exclusive jet bins to maximize the sensitivity in
different production and decay channels. For a given jet category, the veto on
additional jets introduces sensitivity to soft and collinear emissions, which
causes logarithms in the perturbative expansion that need to be resummed to
obtain precise predictions. We study the higher-order resummation properties of
several conceptually distinct kinematic variables that can be used to veto jets
in hadronic collisions. We consider two inclusive variables, the scalar sum
over pT and beam thrust, and two corresponding exclusive variables based on jet
algorithms, namely the largest pT and largest beam thrust of a jet. The
inclusive variables can, in principle, be resummed to higher orders. We show
that for the jet-based variables, there are dual effects due to clustering in
the jet algorithm for both large and small jet radius R that make a complete
resummation at or beyond next-to-leading logarithmic order (NLL) challenging.
For R~1, the clustering of soft and collinear emissions gives O(1)
contributions starting at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order that are
not reproduced by an all-orders soft-collinear factorization formula and
therefore are not automatically resummed by it. For R<<1, clustering induces
logarithms of R that contribute at NLL in the exponent of the cross section,
which cannot be resummed with currently available methods. We explicitly
compute the leading jet clustering effects at two loops and comment on their
numerical size.

both predict the existence of cool cores and explain their structure. Our
models are directly applicable to semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy
formation. We have previously argued that filaments of cold (~10^4 K) gas
condense out of the intracluster medium (ICM) in hydrostatic and thermal
equilibrium when the ratio of the thermal instability timescale to the
free-fall time $t_{TI}/t_{ff}$ falls below 5-10. This criterion corresponds to
an upper limit on the density of the ICM and motivates a model in which a
density core forms wherever $t_{TI}/t_{ff} \lesssim 10$. Consistent with
observations and numerical simulations, this model predicts larger and more
tenuous cores for lower-mass halos---while the core density in a cluster may be
as large as ~ 0.1 cm^{-3}, the core density in the Galactic halo should not
exceed ~ 10^{-4} cm^{-3}. We can also explain the large densities in smaller
mass halos (galactic `coronae') if we include the contribution of the central
galaxy to the gravitational potential. Our models produce a favorable match to
the observational X-ray luminosity-temperature (Lx-Tx) relation. For halo
masses $\lesssim 10^{13}$ Msun the core size approaches the virial radius.
Thus, most of the baryons in such halos cannot be in the hot ICM, but either in
the form of stars or in the form of hot gas beyond the virial radius. Because
of the smaller mass in the ICM and much larger mass available for star
formation, the majority of the baryons in low mass halos ($\lesssim 10^{13}$
Msun) can be expelled beyond the virial radius due to supernova feedback. This
can account for the baryons `missing' from low mass halos, such as the Galactic
halo.

phase space where the General Relativity timescales are several orders of

can excite eccentricities. In particular, for systems where the General
Relativity timescale is comparable to the secular Newtonian timescales, the
three-body interactions give rise to a resonant-like eccentricity excitation.
Furthermore, for triples with a comparable-mass inner binary, where the
eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism is suppressed, post-Newtonian corrections can
further increase the eccentricity and lead to orbital flips even when the
timescale of the former is much longer than the timescale of the secular

find Macc to increase with stellar mass, and decrease over evolutionary time,

In this paper
we generate two new, very large, sets of pMSSM models with sparticle masses
extending up to 4 TeV, where the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is
either a neutralino or gravitino. The existence of a gravitino LSP necessitates
a detailed study of its cosmological effects and we find that Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis places strong constraints on this scenario. Both sets are
subjected to a global set of theoretical, observational and experimental
constraints resulting in a sample of \sim 225k viable models for each LSP type.
The characteristics of these two model sets are briefly compared. We confront
the neutralino LSP model set with searches for SUSY at the 7 TeV LHC using both
the missing (MET) and non-missing ET ATLAS analyses. In the MET case, we employ
Monte Carlo estimates of the ratios of the SM backgrounds at 7 and 8 TeV to
rescale the 7 TeV data-driven ATLAS backgrounds to 8 TeV. This allows us to
determine the pMSSM parameter space coverage for this collision energy. We find
that an integrated luminosity of \sim 5-20 fb^{-1} at 8 TeV would yield a
substantial increase in this coverage compared to that at 7 TeV and can probe
roughly half of the model set. If the pMSSM is not discovered during the 8 TeV
run, then our model set will be essentially void of gluinos and lightest first
and second generation squarks that are \lesssim 700-800 GeV, which is much less
than the analogous mSUGRA bound. Finally, we demonstrate that non-MET SUSY
searches continue to play an important role in exploring the pMSSM parameter
space. These two pMSSM model sets can be used as the basis for investigations

we find that bulge-dominated objects in particular show evidence for a growing
bimodality in the size-mass relation with increasing z, and by z > 2 the
compact bulges display effective radii a factor ~4 smaller than local
ellipticals of comparable mass. These trends appear to extend to the bulge
components of disk-dominated galaxies, and vice versa. We also find that, while
such massive galaxies at low z are bulge-dominated, at 1 < z < 2 they are
predominantly mixed bulge+disk systems, and by z > 2 they are mostly
disk-dominated. The majority of the disk-dominated galaxies are actively
forming stars, but this is also true for many of the bulge-dominated systems.

bulge-dominated, we find that a significant fraction (25-40%) of the most

slightly enlarged if one allows a metastable vacuum with a lifetime longer than

important problem that arise in vision sensor networks. This paper concentrates
on the joint reconstruction problem where the distributively compressed
correlated images are jointly decoded in order to improve the reconstruction
quality of all the compressed images. We consider a scenario where the images
captured at different viewpoints are encoded independently using common coding
solutions (e.g., JPEG, H.264 intra) with a balanced rate distribution among
different cameras. A central decoder first estimates the underlying correlation
model from the independently compressed images which will be used for the joint
signal recovery. The joint reconstruction is then cast as a constrained convex
optimization problem that reconstructs total-variation (TV) smooth images that
comply with the estimated correlation model. At the same time, we add
constraints that force the reconstructed images to be consistent with their
compressed versions. We show by experiments that the proposed joint
reconstruction scheme outperforms independent reconstruction in terms of image
quality, for a given target bit rate. In addition, the decoding performance of
our proposed algorithm compares advantageously to state-of-the-art distributed
coding schemes based on disparity learning and on the DISCOVER.

contextualize their display. This approach can increase ad efficacy for two
main reasons: peers' affiliations reflect unobserved consumer characteristics,
which are correlated along the social network; and the inclusion of social cues
(i.e., peers' association with a brand) alongside ads affect responses via
social influence processes. For these reasons, responses may be increased when
multiple social signals are presented with ads, and when ads are affiliated
with peers who are strong, rather than weak, ties.
  We conduct two very large field experiments that identify the effect of
social cues on consumer responses to ads, measured in terms of ad clicks and
the formation of connections with the advertised entity. In the first
experiment, we randomize the number of social cues present in word-of-mouth
advertising, and measure how responses increase as a function of the number of
cues. The second experiment examines the effect of augmenting traditional ad
units with a minimal social cue (i.e., displaying a peer's affiliation below an
ad in light grey text). On average, this cue causes significant increases in ad
performance. Using a measurement of tie strength based on the total amount of
communication between subjects and their peers, we show that these influence
effects are greatest for strong ties. Our work has implications for ad

bifurcations, which occur when an algebraic condition on the eigenvalues of the
system is satisfied and which typically result in the creation or destruction
of a long-period periodic orbit. Resonance bifurcations for heteroclinic
networks are more complicated because different subcycles in the network can
undergo resonance at different parameter values, but have, until now, not been
systematically studied. In this article we present the first investigation of
resonance bifurcations in heteroclinic networks. Specifically, we study two
heteroclinic networks in $\R^4$ and consider the dynamics that occurs as
various subcycles in each network change stability. The two cases are
distinguished by whether or not one of the equilibria in the network has real
or complex contracting eigenvalues. We construct two-dimensional Poincare
return maps and use these to investigate the dynamics of trajectories near the
network. At least one equilibrium solution in each network has a
two-dimensional unstable manifold, and we use the technique developed in [18]
to keep track of all trajectories within these manifolds. In the case with real
eigenvalues, we show that the asymptotically stable network loses stability
first when one of two distinguished cycles in the network goes through
resonance and two or six periodic orbits appear. In the complex case, we show
that an infinite number of stable and unstable periodic orbits are created at
resonance, and these may coexist with a chaotic attractor. There is a further
resonance, for which the eigenvalue combination is a property of the entire
network, after which the periodic orbits which originated from the individual
resonances may interact. We illustrate some of our results with a numerical
example.

inhomogeneous linear inverse problem where the degree of ill-posedness of
operator $Q$ depends not only on the scale but also on location. In this case,
the rates of convergence are determined by the interaction of four parameters,
the smoothness and spatial homogeneity of the unknown function $f$ and degrees
of ill-posedness and spatial inhomogeneity of operator $Q$. Estimators obtained
in the paper are based either on wavelet-vaguelette decomposition (if the norms
of all vaguelettes are finite) or on a hybrid of wavelet-vaguelette
decomposition and Galerkin method (if vaguelettes in the neighborhood of the
singularity point have infinite norms). The hybrid estimator is a combination
of a linear part in the vicinity of the singularity point and the nonlinear
block thresholding wavelet estimator elsewhere. To attain adaptivity, an
optimal resolution level for the linear, singularity affected, portion of the
estimator is obtained using Lepski [Theory Probab. Appl. 35 (1990) 454-466 and
36 (1991) 682-697] method and is used subsequently as the lowest resolution
level for the nonlinear wavelet estimator. We show that convergence rates of
the hybrid estimator lie within a logarithmic factor of the optimal minimax
convergence rates. The theory presented in the paper is supplemented by
examples of deconvolution with a spatially inhomogeneous kernel and
deconvolution in the presence of locally extreme noise or extremely
inhomogeneous design. The first two problems are examined via a limited
simulation study which demonstrates advantages of the hybrid estimator when the
degree of spatial inhomogeneity is high. In addition, we apply the technique to
recovery of a convolution signal transmitted via amplitude modulation.

in-transit signature of Earth-like extrasolar planets. However, a comparative
analysis of the two phenomena addressing in detail the transport of stellar
light through the planet's atmosphere has not yet been presented. Here, we
proceed with the investigation of both phenomena by making use of a common
formulation. Our starting point is a set of previously unpublished
near-infrared spectra collected at various phases during the August 2008 lunar
eclipse. We then take the formulation to the limit of an infinitely distant
observer in order to investigate the in-transit signature of the Earth-Sun
system as being observed from outside our Solar System. The refraction-bending
of sunlight rays that pass through the Earth's atmosphere is a critical factor
in the illumination of the eclipsed Moon. Likewise, refraction will have an
impact on the in-transit transmission spectrum for specific planet-star systems
depending on the refractive properties of the planet's atmosphere, the stellar
size and the planet's orbital distance. For the Earth-Sun system, at
mid-transit, refraction prevents the remote observer's access to the lower
~12-14 km of the atmosphere and, thus, also to the bulk of the
spectroscopically-active atmospheric gases. We demonstrate that the effective
optical radius of the Earth in transit is modulated by refraction and varies by
~12 km from mid-transit to 2nd contact. The refractive nature of atmospheres, a
property which is rarely accounted for in published investigations, will pose
additional challenges to the characterization of Earth-like extrasolar planets.
Refraction may have a lesser impact for Earth-like extrasolar planets within
the habitable zone of some M-type stars.

a particle or as a wave, is one of the most intriguing features of quantum
mechanics. An exemplary Gedanken experiment, emphasizing such a
measurement-dependent nature, was suggested by Wheeler using single photons.
The subtleness of the idea lies in the fact that the output beam-splitter of a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer is put in or removed after a photon has already
entered the interferometer, thus performing a delayed test of the wave-particle
complementary behavior. Recently, it was proposed that using a quantum analogue
of the output beam-splitter would permit carrying out this type of test after
the detection of the photon and observing wave-particle superposition. In this
paper we describe an experimental demonstration of these predictions using
another extraordinary property of quantum systems, entanglement. We use a pair
of polarization entangled photons composed of one photon whose nature (wave or
particle) is tested, and of a corroborative photon that allows determining
which one, or both, of these two aspects is being tested. This corroborative
photon infers the presence or absence of the beam-splitter and until it is
measured, the beam-splitter is in a superposition of these two states, making
it a quantum beam-splitter. When the quantum beam-splitter is in the state
present or absent, the interferometer reveals the wave or particle nature of
the test photon, respectively. Furthermore, by manipulating the corroborative
photon, we can continuously morph, via entanglement, the test photon from wave
to particle behavior even after it was detected. This result underlines the
fact that a simple vision of light as a classical wave or a particle is
inadequate.

from all three configurations allowing us to trace spatial scales as small as

resolution C configuration line profile shows that the inner S1 flow has
slightly asymmetric outflow velocities ranging from -9.0 km s-1 to +10.6 km s-1
with respect to the stellar rest frame. We find little evidence for the outer
S2 flow in this configuration because the majority of this emission has been
spatially-filtered (resolved out) by the array. We also report a SOFIA-GREAT
CO(J= 12-11) emission line profile which we associate with this inner higher
excitation S1 flow. The outer S2 flow appears in the D and E configuration maps

S1 and S2 in the multi-configuration maps and see a gradual change in the

characterized by mutations in the genetic structure of the photoreceptors that
leads to the premature death of both rod and cone photoreceptors. Defects in
particular genes encoding proteins that are involved in either the
photoreceptor structure, phototransduction cascades, or visual cycle are
expressed in the rods but ultimately affect both types of cells. RP is
""typically"" manifested by a steady death of rods followed by a period of
stability in which cones survive initially and then inevitably die too. In some
RP cases, rods and cones die off simultaneously or even cone death precedes rod
death (reverse RP). The mechanisms and factors involved in the development of
the different types of RP are not well understood nor have researchers been
able to provide more than a limited number of short-term therapies. In this
work we trace the progression of RP to complete blindness through each subtype
via bifurcation theory. We show that the evolution of RP from one stage to
another often requires the failure of multiple components. Our results indicate
that a delicate balance between the availability of nutrients and the rates of
shedding and renewal of photoreceptors is needed at every stage of RP to halt
its progression. This work provides a framework for future physiological
investigations potentially leading to long-term targeted multi-facet
interventions and therapies dependent on the particular stage and subtype of RP
under consideration. The results of this mathematical model may also give
insight into the progression of many other degenerative eye diseases involving

constructed by the shear construction due to Clunie and Sheil-Small which

convolution of two univalent harmonic convex mappings in $\ID$ is not
necessarily even univalent in $\ID$. In this paper, we fix $f_0\in{\mathcal

parallelism can be extracted, the greater will be the total communication
between mappers and reducers. We introduce a model of problems that can be
solved in a single round of map-reduce computation. This model enables a
generic recipe for discovering lower bounds on communication cost as a function
of the maximum number of inputs that can be assigned to one reducer. We use the
model to analyze the tradeoff for three problems: finding pairs of strings at
Hamming distance $d$, finding triangles and other patterns in a larger graph,
and matrix multiplication. For finding strings of Hamming distance 1, we have
upper and lower bounds that match exactly. For triangles and many other graphs,
we have upper and lower bounds that are the same to within a constant factor.
For the problem of matrix multiplication, we have matching upper and lower
bounds for one-round map-reduce algorithms. We are also able to explore
two-round map-reduce algorithms for matrix multiplication and show that these
never have more communication, for a given reducer size, than the best
one-round algorithm, and often have significantly less.

order to identify which modes would best constrain models of Jupiter's interior

sensitivity of derived parameters to this mode set. Three different models of
the Jovian interior are computed and the theoretical pulsation spectrum from
these models for $\ell\leq 25$ is obtained. We compute sensitivity kernels and
perform linear inversions to infer details of the expected discontinuities in
the profiles in the Jovian interior. We find that the amplitude of the

discontinuities, the location of such features can be accurately measured,

revisited in the context of Randall-Sundrum models. The Higgs is assumed to be
localized on the IR brane. Three cases for neutrino masses are considered: (a)
The higher dimensional LH.LH operator (b) Dirac masses (c) Type I see-saw with
bulk Majorana mass terms. Neutrino masses and mixing as well as charged lepton
masses are fit in the first two cases using $\chi^2$ minimisation for the bulk
mass parameters, while varying the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Yukawa couplings between
0.1 and 4. Lepton flavour violation is studied for all the three cases. It is
shown that large negative bulk mass parameters are required for the right
handed fields to fit the data in the LH LH case. This case is characterized by
a very large Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum and relatively weak flavour violating
constraints at leading order. The zero modes for the charged singlets are
composite in this case and their corresponding effective 4-D Yukawa couplings
to the KK modes could be large. For the Dirac case, good fits can be obtained
for the bulk mass parameters, $c_i$, lying between 0 and 1. However, most of
the `best fit regions' are ruled out from flavour violating constraints. In the
bulk Majorana terms case, we have solved the profile equations numerically. We
give example points for inverted hierarchy and normal hierarchy of neutrino
masses. Lepton flavor violating rates are large for these points. We then
discuss various minimal flavor violation (MFV) schemes for Dirac and bulk
Majorana cases. In the Dirac case with MFV hypothesis, it is possible to
simultaneously fit leptonic masses and mixing angles and alleviate lepton
flavor violating constraints for Kaluza-Klein modes with masses of around 3
TeV. Similar examples are also provided in the Majorana case.

universal extra dimension that we orbifold-compactify. We obtain a Kaluza-Klein
(KK) theory by expanding in KK towers covariant objects rather than fields, as
such an approach yields a four-dimensional description possessing an
interesting gauge structure in which two sorts of gauge transformations leave
the theory invariant. One type are the standard gauge transformations (SGT),
under which the KK zero modes behave as gauge fields. The other transformations
receive the name of nonstandard gauge transformations (NSGT), and under them
some of the the KK excited modes are gauge fields. We quantize the KK excited
modes within the BRST approach, which includes the elimination of the gauge
symmetries associated to the KK excitations through a gauge-fixing procedure
that preserves gauge invariance with respect to the SGT. We present the most
general Faddeev-Popov ghost sector. We integrate out the KK excited modes and
derive an effective Lagrangian containing the explicit expressions of the
coefficients multiplying all the independent nonrenormalizable operators of
canonical dimension six that are allowed by the SU(N) gauge group and by
Lorentz invariance. We first perform the calculation in the Feynman-`t Hooft
(FtH) gauge and then in the general $R_\xi$ gauge. We find for the latter case
a gauge-dependent result. The derivation of the effective Lagrangian explicitly
proves that the contributions of KK excited modes to one-loop light Green's
functions are renormalizable. Finally, we compare, at the four-dimensional
level, the effects of the extra dimension with the contributions of a presumed
fundamental theory describing nature at energies higher than those
corresponding to the extra-dimensional physics. We find that the effects of the
KK excited modes are the dominant ones.

mis-application selectionism across the social sciences because it does not
address the paradox that inspired the theory of natural selection in the first
place: how do organisms accumulate change when traits acquired over their
lifetime are obliterated? This is addressed by von Neumann's concept of a
self-replicating automaton (SRA). A SRA consists of a self-assembly code that
is used in two distinct ways: (1) actively deciphered during development to
construct a self-similar replicant, and (2) passively copied to the replicant
to ensure that it can reproduce. Information that is acquired over a lifetime
is not transmitted to offspring, whereas information that is inherited during
copying is transmitted. In cultural evolution there is no mechanism for
discarding acquired change. Acquired change can accumulate orders of magnitude
faster than, and quickly overwhelm, inherited change due to differential
replication of variants in response to selection. This prohibits a selectionist
but not an evolutionary framework for culture. Recent work on the origin of
life suggests that early life evolved through a non-Darwinian process referred
to as communal exchange that does not involve a self-assembly code, and that
natural selection emerged from this more haphazard, ancestral evolutionary
process. It is proposed that communal exchange provides a more appropriate
evolutionary framework for culture than selectionism. This is supported by a
computational model of cultural evolution and a network-based program for
documenting material cultural history, and it is consistent with high levels of
human cooperation.

two-way one-bit soft forwarding (TW-1bSF) protocol in which the relay forwards
the one-bit quantization of a posterior information metric about the
transmitted bits, associated with an appropriately designed reliability
parameter.
  In WSN-related standards (such as IEEE802.15.6 and Bluetooth), block codes
are adopted instead of convolutional and other sophisticated codes, due to
their efficient decoder hardware implementation. As the second main
contribution, we derive tight upper bounds on the BLER performance for both
TW-SDF and TW-1bSF, when the two-way relaying network employs block codes and
hard decoding. The error probability analysis confirms the superiority of
TW-1bSF. Moreover, we derive the asymptotic performance gain of TW-1bSF over
TW-SDF, which further suggests that the proposed protocol is a good choice,

layers of water that slide with respect to each other. This friction triggers
the shear stress, which is traditionally presumed to be linearly proportional
to the velocity gradient. The proportionality coefficient characterizes the
viscosity of water. Remarkably, the standard Navier-Stokes model surmises that
materials never fail - the transition to turbulence can only be triggered by
some kinematic instability of the flow. This premise is probably the reason why
the Navier-Stokes theory fails to explain the so-called subcritical transition
to turbulence with the help of the linear instability analysis. When linear
instability analysis fails, nonlinear instability analysis is often resorted
to, but, despite the occasional uses of this approach, it is intrinsically
biased to require finite flow perturbations which do not necessarily exist.
  In the present work we relax the traditional restriction on the perfectly
intact material and introduce the parameter of fluid viscous strength, which
enforces the breakdown of internal friction. We develop a generalized
Navier-Stokes constitutive model which includes a material failure description,
and use it to analyze the Couette flow between two parallel plates to find that
the lateral infinitesimal perturbations can destabilize the laminar flow.
Furthermore, we use the results of the recent experiments on the onset of
turbulence in pipe flow to calibrate the viscous strength of water.
Specifically, we find that the maximal shear stress that water can sustain in
the laminar flow is about one Pascal. We note also that the introduction of the
fluid strength uncovers new prospects in the explanation of the remarkable
phenomenon of the delay of the transition to turbulence due to an addition of a
small amount of long polymer molecules to water.

Schr\""{o}dinger equation of standard Quantum Mechanics by adding stochastic
non-linear terms to it. The aim of such models is to describe the quantum
(linear) nature of microsystems along with the classical nature (violation of
superposition principle) of macroscopic ones. The addition of such non-linear
terms in the Schr\""{o}dinger equation leads to non-conservation of energy of
the system under consideration. Thus, a striking feature of collapse models is
to heat non-relativistic particles with a constant rate. If such a process is
physical, then it has the ability to perturb the well-understood thermal
history of the universe. In this article we will try to investigate the impacts
of such heating terms on standard evolution of non-relativistic matter and on
the formation of CMBR. We will use the CSL model, the most widely used collapse
model. We will also put constraints on the CSL collapse rate $\lambda$ by
considering that the standard evolution of non-relativistic matter is not
hampered and the observed precise blackbody spectrum of CMBR would not get
distorted (in the form of $\mu-$type and $y-$type distortions) so as to violate
the observed bounds.

A highly detailed (with the temperature step of 1 K) calculation of the

anion self-diffusion in model crystals without surface or artificially embedded

decentralized interaction rules give rise to a globally ordered state. In the
emergence of order out of self-organization we find similarities between
biological systems, as bird flocks, and some physical systems, as ferromagnets.
In both cases, the tendency of individuals to align to their neighbours gives
rise to a polarized state. There is, however, one crucial difference: the
interaction network within an animal group is not necessarily fixed in time, as
each individual moves and may change its neighbours. Therefore, the dynamical
interaction mechanism in biological and physical system can be quite different,
not only due to the gross disparity in the complexity of the individual
entities, but also because of the potential role of inter-individual motion. To
assess the relevance of this mechanism it is necessary to gain quantitative
experimental information about how much individuals move with respect to each
other within the group. Here, by using data from field observations on
starlings, we study the diffusion properties of individual birds within a flock
and investigate the effect of diffusion on the dynamics of the interaction
network. We find that birds diffuse faster than Brownian particles
(superdiffusion) and in a strongly anisotropic way. We also find that
neighbours change in time exclusively as a consequence of diffusion, so that no
specific mechanism to keep one's neighbours seems to be enforced. Finally, we
study the diffusion properties of birds at the border of the flock. We find
that these individuals remain on the border significantly longer than what
would be expected on the basis of a purely diffusional model, suggesting that
there is a sort barrier a bird must cross to make the transition from border to
interior of the flock.

and violations of Bell's inequalities, steering implies a direction between the
parties involved. Recent theoretical works have precisely defined this
property. Here we present an experimental realization of two entangled Gaussian
modes of light by which in fact one party can steer the other but not
conversely. The generated one-way steering gives a new insight into quantum

possible in networks. Here, we consider traveling and stationary patterns in
bistable one-component systems on random Erd\""os-R\'enyi, scale-free and
hierarchical tree networks. As revealed through numerical simulations,
traveling fronts exist in network-organized systems. They represent waves of
transition from one stable state into another, spreading over the entire
network. The fronts can furthermore be pinned, thus forming stationary
structures. While pinning of fronts has previously been considered for chains
of diffusively coupled bistable elements, the network architecture brings about
significant differences. An important role is played by the degree (the number
of connections) of a node. For regular trees with a fixed branching factor, the
pinning conditions are analytically determined. For large Erd\""os-R\'enyi and

In the heterodyne configuration, the beating between the reference beam and the

of a constant of motion of a Hamilton-Lagrange system with a particular
symmetry transformation that preserves the form of the action functional.
Although usually derived in the Lagrangian formalism, the natural context for
deriving Noether's theorem for first-order Lagrangian systems is the
Hamiltonian formalism. The reason is that the class of transformations that
leave the action functional invariant coincides with the class of canonical
transformations. As a result, any invariant of a Hamiltonian system can be
correlated with a symmetry transformation simply by means of the canonical
transformation rules. As this holds for any invariant, we thereby obtain the
most general representation of Noether's theorem. In order to allow for
symmetry mappings that include a transformation of time, we must refer to the
extended Hamiltonian formalism. This formalism enables us to define generating
functions of canonical transformations that also map time and energy in
addition to the conventional mappings of canonical space and momentum
variables. As an example for the generalized Noether theorem, a manifest
representation of the symmetry transformation is derived that corresponds to
the Runge-Lenz invariant of the Kepler system.

of ~10 in six months. We interpret this flare-up in terms of a transition from
an accretion-disk dominated emission to a synchrotron-jet dominated one. We
analysed a Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) archival optical spectrum taken
during a period of low radio and optical activity of the source. We estimated
the mass of the central black hole using the width of the CIV emission line. In
our work, we have also investigated SDSS archival optical photometric data and
UV GALEX observations to estimate the thermal-disk emission contribution of GB6
J1239+0443. Our analysis of the gamma-ray data taken during the flaring
episodes indicates a flat gamma-ray spectrum, with an extension of up to 15
GeV, with no statistically-relevant sign of absorption from the broad line
region, suggesting that the blazar-zone is located beyond the broad line
region. This result is confirmed by the modeling of the broad-band spectral
energy distribution (well constrained by the available multiwavelength data) of
the flaring activity periods and by the accretion disk luminosity and black
hole mass estimated by us using archival data.

eddy field reflect the combined influence of surface buoyancy and interior
potential vorticity anomalies. The former have a surface-trapped structure,
while the latter have a more grave form. To assess the relative importance of
each contribution to the signal, it is useful to project the observed field
onto a set of modes that separates their influence in a natural way. However,
the surface-trapped dynamics are not well-represented by standard baroclinic
modes; moreover, they are dependent on horizontal scale.
  Here we derive a modal decomposition that results from the simultaneous
diagonalization of the energy and a generalisation of potential enstrophy that
includes contributions from the surface buoyancy fields. This approach yields a
family of orthonomal bases that depend on two parameters: the standard
baroclinic modes are recovered in a limiting case, while other choices provide
modes that represent surface and interior dynamics in an efficient way.
  For constant stratification, these modes consist of symmetric and
antisymmetric exponential modes that capture the surface dynamics, and a series
of oscillating modes that represent the interior dynamics. Motivated by the
ocean, where shears are concentrated near the upper surface, we also consider
the special case of a quiescent lower surface. In this case, the interior modes
are independent of wavenumber, and there is a single exponential surface mode
that replaces the barotropic mode. We demonstrate the use and effectiveness of
these modes by projecting the energy in a set of simulations of baroclinic
turbulence.

can fluctuate between quiescent and active states, generating slow 0.5-2 Hz
oscillations which are widely known as transitions between Up and Down States.
Despite a large number of studies on Up-Down transitions, deciphering its
nature, mechanisms and function are still today challenging tasks. In this
paper we focus on recent experimental evidence, showing that a class of
spontaneous oscillations can emerge within the Up states. In particular, a
non-trivial peak around 20 Hz appears in their associated power-spectra, what
produces an enhancement of the activity power for higher frequencies (in the
30-90 Hz band). Moreover, this rhythm within Ups seems to be an emergent or
collective phenomenon given that individual neurons do not lock to it as they
remain mostly unsynchronized. Remarkably, similar oscillations (and the
concomitant peak in the spectrum) do not appear in the Down states. Here we
shed light on these findings by using different computational models for the
dynamics of cortical networks in presence of different levels of physiological
complexity. Our conclusion, supported by both theory and simulations, is that
the collective phenomenon of ""stochastic amplification of fluctuations""
-previously described in other contexts such as Ecology and Epidemiology--
explains in an elegant and parsimonious manner, beyond model-dependent details,
this extra-rhythm emerging only in the Up states but not in the Downs.

Importantly, models that support this idea have to date only allowed defectors

the existence of anti-social punishment in public goods games. That is,
individuals that defect have been found to also punish cooperators. Some recent
theoretical studies have found that such anti-social punishment can prevent the
evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation. However, the evolution of
anti-social punishment in group-structured populations has not been formally
addressed. Previous work has informally argued that group-structure must favour
pro-social punishment. Here we formally investigate how two demographic
factors, group size and dispersal frequency, affect selection pressures on pro-
and anti-social punishment. Contrary to the suggestions of previous work, we
find that anti-social punishment can prevent the evolution of pro-social
punishment and cooperation under a range of group structures. Given that
anti-social punishment has now been found in all studied extant human cultures,
the claims of previous models showing the co-evolution of pro-social punishment
and cooperation in group-structured populations should be re-evaluated.

$A_n=\lfloor\phi n \rfloor$ and $B_n=A_n+n$. The P-positions of Wythoff Nim are
all pairs of piles with $A_n$ and $B_n$ tokens respectively. We study a
generalization of this game called $(1,2)\G$ where, in addition to the rules of
Wythoff Nim, a player has the choice to remove a positive number of tokens from
one of the piles and twice that number from the other pile. We show that there
is an infinite sector $\alpha \le y/x \le \alpha +\epsilon$, for given real
numbers $\alpha>1$ and $\epsilon > 0$, for which each $(x,y)$ is an N-position,
but that there are infinitely many P-positions for both $1\le y/x <\alpha $ and
$\alpha +\epsilon < y/x $. This proves a conjecture from a recent paper.
Namely, the adjoined set of moves in $(1,2)\G$ \emph{splits} the beam of slope
$\phi $ P-positions of Wythoff Nim. We also provide a lower bound on the lower
asymtotic density of lower pile heights of P-positions for extensions of
Wythoff Nim. Suppose that $(a_i)$ and $(b_i)$, $i>0$, is a pair of so-called
complementary sequences on the natural numbers which satisfy $(a_i)$ is
increasing and for all $i$, $a_i<b_i$, for all $i\ne j$, $b_i-a_i\ne b_j-a_j$.
Then $\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{#\{i\mid a_i < n\}}{n} \ge \phi^{-1}$.

memory dynamics, that can include both Hebbian learning mechanisms and
refractory periods. The state of a network is described by the times elapsed
since its neurons fired within the post-synaptic transfer kernel memory span,
and the current strengths of synaptic connections, the state spaces of our
models being hierarchies of finite-dimensional components. We establish
ergodicity of the stochastic processes describing the behaviour of the networks
and prove the existence of continuously differentiable stationary distribution
densities (with respect to the Lebesgue measures of corresponding
dimensionality) on the components of the state space and find upper bounds for
them. For the density components, we derive a system of differential equations
that can be solved in a few simplest cases only. Approaches to approximate
computation of the stationary density are discussed. One is to reduce the
dimensionality of the problem by modifying the network so that each neuron
cannot fire if the number of spikes it emitted within the post-synaptic
transfer kernel memory span reaches a given threshold. We show that the
stationary distribution of this `truncated' network converges to that of the
unrestricted one as the threshold increases, and that the convergence is at a
super-exponential rate. A complementary approach uses discrete Markov chain
approximations to the network process. We derive linear systems for the
stationary distributions of these Markov chains and prove that these
distributions converge weakly to the stationary laws for the original
processes.

coherent set of science-enabling tools and services. The distributed nature of
our virtual observatory-with data and personnel spanning geographic,
institutional and regime boundaries-is simultaneously a major operational
headache and the primary science motivation for the VAO. Most astronomy today
uses data from many resources. Facilitation of matching heterogeneous datasets
is a fundamental reason for the virtual observatory. Key aspects of our
approach include continuous monitoring and validation of VAO and VO services
and the datasets provided by the community, monitoring of user requests to
optimize access, caching for large datasets, and providing distributed storage
services that allow user to collect results near large data repositories. Some
elements are now fully implemented, while others are planned for subsequent
years. The distributed nature of the VAO requires careful attention to what can
be a straightforward operation at a conventional observatory, e.g., the
organization of the web site or the collection and combined analysis of logs.
Many of these strategies use and extend protocols developed by the

$\psi(3770)$ and $\psi(4040)$. Therefore, the cross section line-shape of this

model-independent narrow enhancement between the thresholds of
$D^0\bar{D}^{*0}+c.c.$ and $D^+D^{*-}+c.c.$ is predicted. This study can also
help understand the X(3900) enhancement recently observed by the Belle and

volume of SWNTs in high-pressure regime as assigned by a phase transition from
circular to collapsed phase which are strictly dependent on the tube diameter.
For the DWNTs, those results show first a transformation to a polygonized shape
of the outer tube and subsequently the simultaneous collapse of the outter and
inner tube, at the onset of the inner tube ovalization. Before the DWNT
collapse, phonon calculations reproduce the experimentally observed screening
effect on the inner tube pressure induced blue shift both for RBM and
tangential G$_z$ modes . Furthermore, the collapse of CNTs bundles induces a
sudden redshift of tangential component in agreement with experimental studies.
The G$_z$ band analysis of the SWNT collapsed tubes shows that the flattened
regions of the tubes are at the origin of their G-band signal. This explains
the observed graphite type pressure evolution of the G band in the collapsed
phase and provides in addition a mean for the identification of collapsed tubes

the turbulence. We find that our measurements fit the linear relation between
the r.m.s. Mach number and the standard deviation of the density distribution
in a wide range of Mach numbers, where the proportionality constant depends on
the type of the forcing. In addition, we propose a new linear relation between
the standard deviation of the density distribution and the standard deviation
of the velocity in compressible modes, i.e. the compressible component of the
r.m.s. Mach number. In this relation the influence of the forcing is
significantly reduced, suggesting a linear relation between the standard

Photoexcitation of the HEB is followed by internal relaxation prior the
radiative decay to the ground state. Adding PC70BM results in the efficient PL
quenching within the first 50 ps after excitation. From the PL excitation
experiments no evidence for a direct electron transfer from the HEB of PCDTBT

schedule length after gathering information about the number of flows in its
neighbourhood. Then, a combination of deterministic and random backoffs are
used to reach a collision-free schedule. A deterministic backoff is used after
successful transmissions and a random backoff is used otherwise. It is
explained that the short acknowledgement control packets can easily result in
channel time fragmentation and, to avoid this, the use of link layer delayed

that a collision-free protocol easily outperforms a collision-prone protocol

result of counterion adsorption on the chain backbones play a key role in
affecting the local dielectric function. For polyelectrolytes made of monomers
having dipole moments lower than the solvent molecules, dielectric decrement is
predicted inside the brush region. However, the formation of ion-pairs (due to
adsorption of counterions coming from the dissociation of added salt) more
polar than the solvent molecules is shown to increase the magnitude of the

areas, from physics (e.g. wave phenomena, fluid dynamics) to engineering (e.g.
signal processing, filter design). One of the principal reasons for the
importance of PSWFs is that they are a natural and efficient tool for computing
with bandlimited functions, that frequently occur in the abovementioned areas.
This is due to the fact that PSWFs are the eigenfunctions of the integral
operator, that represents timelimiting followed by lowpassing.
  Needless to say, the behavior of this operator is governed by the decay rate
of its eigenvalues. Therefore, investigation of this decay rate plays a crucial
role in the related theory and applications - for example, in construction of
quadratures, interpolation, filter design, etc.
  The significance of PSWFs and, in particular, of the decay rate of the
eigenvalues of the associated integral operator, was realized at least half a
century ago. Nevertheless, perhaps surprisingly, despite vast numerical
experience and existence of several asymptotic expansions, a non-trivial
explicit upper bound on the magnitude of the eigenvalues has been missing for
decades.
  The principal goal of this paper is to close this gap in the theory of PSWFs.
We analyze the integral operator associated with PSWFs, to derive fairly tight
non-asymptotic upper bounds on the magnitude of its eigenvalues. Our results
are illustrated via several numerical experiments.

high-level representation of the inputs given only unlabeled data; it

coding has also been shown to be useful for self-taught learning, in which the
goal is to solve a supervised classification task given access to additional
unlabeled data drawn from different classes than that in the supervised
learning problem. Shift-invariant sparse coding (SISC) is an extension of
sparse coding which reconstructs a (usually time-series) input using all of the
basis functions in all possible shifts. In this paper, we present an efficient
algorithm for learning SISC bases. Our method is based on iteratively solving
two large convex optimization problems: The first, which computes the linear
coefficients, is an L1-regularized linear least squares problem with
potentially hundreds of thousands of variables. Existing methods typically use
a heuristic to select a small subset of the variables to optimize, but we
present a way to efficiently compute the exact solution. The second, which
solves for bases, is a constrained linear least squares problem. By optimizing
over complex-valued variables in the Fourier domain, we reduce the coupling
between the different variables, allowing the problem to be solved efficiently.
We show that SISC's learned high-level representations of speech and music
provide useful features for classification tasks within those domains. When
applied to classification, under certain conditions the learned features

local nature of the proposals that are commonly used. It has been shown that
sampling from the space of node orders yields better results [FK03, EW06].
Recently, Koivisto and Sood showed how one can analytically marginalize over
orders using dynamic programming (DP) [KS04, Koi06]. Their method computes the
exact marginal posterior edge probabilities, thus avoiding the need for MCMC.
Unfortunately, there are four drawbacks to the DP technique: it can only use
modular priors, it can only compute posteriors over modular features, it is
difficult to compute a predictive density, and it takes exponential time and
space. We show how to overcome the first three of these problems by using the
DP algorithm as a proposal distribution for MCMC in DAG space. We show that
this hybrid technique converges to the posterior faster than other methods,
resulting in more accurate structure learning and higher predictive likelihoods
on test data.

generally selected based on the rate at which the fastest component evolves.
Inference must then be performed at this fastest granularity, potentially at
significant computational cost. Continuous Time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs) avoid
time-slicing in the representation by modeling the system as evolving
continuously over time. The expectation-propagation (EP) inference algorithm of
Nodelman et al. (2005) can then vary the inference granularity over time, but
the granularity is uniform across all parts of the system, and must be selected
in advance. In this paper, we provide a new EP algorithm that utilizes a
general cluster graph architecture where clusters contain distributions that
can overlap in both space (set of variables) and time. This architecture allows
different parts of the system to be modeled at very different time
granularities, according to their current rate of evolution. We also provide an
information-theoretic criterion for dynamically re-partitioning the clusters
during inference to tune the level of approximation to the current rate of

reasoning about the joint distribution over attributes of a large number of

is inference. Even when dealing with complete data, where one can summarize a
large domain by sufficient statistics, learning requires one to compute the
expectation of the sufficient statistics given different parameter choices. The
typical solution to this problem is to resort to approximate inference
procedures, such as loopy belief propagation. Although these procedures are
quite efficient, they still require computation that is on the order of the
number of interactions (or features) in the model. When learning a large
relational model over a complex domain, even such approximations require
unrealistic running time. In this paper we show that for a particular class of
relational MRFs, which have inherent symmetry, we can perform the inference
needed for learning procedures using a template-level belief propagation. This
procedure's running time is proportional to the size of the relational model
rather than the size of the domain. Moreover, we show that this computational
procedure is equivalent to sychronous loopy belief propagation. This enables a
dramatic speedup in inference and learning time. We use this procedure to learn
relational MRFs for capturing the joint distribution of large protein-protein

Markov logic (Richardson & Domingos, 2006) accomplishes this by attaching
weights to first-order formulas and viewing them as templates for features of
Markov networks. Unfortunately, it does not have the full power of first-order
logic, because it is only defined for finite domains. This paper extends Markov
logic to infinite domains, by casting it in the framework of Gibbs measures
(Georgii, 1988). We show that a Markov logic network (MLN) admits a Gibbs
measure as long as each ground atom has a finite number of neighbors. Many
interesting cases fall in this category. We also show that an MLN admits a
unique measure if the weights of its non-unit clauses are small enough. We then
examine the structure of the set of consistent measures in the non-unique case.
Many important phenomena, including systems with phase transitions, are
represented by MLNs with non-unique measures. We relate the problem of

  in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)",,,"UAI-P-2007-PG-360-367","cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  BDeu marginal likelihood score is a popular model selection criterion for
selecting a Bayesian network structure based on sample data. This
non-informative scoring criterion assigns same score for network structures
that encode same independence statements. However, before applying the BDeu
score, one must determine a single parameter, the equivalent sample size alpha.
Unfortunately no generally accepted rule for determining the alpha parameter
has been suggested. This is disturbing, since in this paper we show through a
series of concrete experiments that the solution of the network structure
optimization problem is highly sensitive to the chosen alpha parameter value.
Based on these results, we are able to give explanations for how and why this
phenomenon happens, and discuss ideas for solving this problem.

aspirin"" are central to scientific discourse, and are formally interpreted as
statements derived from ""alternative worlds"". However, since they invoke
hypothetical states of affairs, often incompatible with what is actually known
or observed, testing counterfactuals is fraught with conceptual and practical
difficulties. In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of
""testable counterfactuals,"" namely, counterfactual statements whose
probabilities can be inferred from physical experiments. We provide complete
procedures for discerning whether a given counterfactual is testable and, if
so, expressing its probability in terms of experimental data.

solving decentralized POMDPs with large horizons. We generalize the algorithm
and improve its scalability by reducing the complexity with respect to the
number of observations from exponential to polynomial. We derive error bounds
on solution quality with respect to this new approximation and analyze the
convergence behavior. To evaluate the effectiveness of the improvements, we
introduce a new, larger benchmark problem. Experimental results show that
despite the high complexity of decentralized POMDPs, scalable solution
techniques such as MBDP perform surprisingly well.

pressure, energy density as a function of volume along with determination of
caloric EoS from following two model: $w(z)=w_{0}+w_{1}\ln(1+z)$ & $
w(z)=-1+\frac{(1+z)}{3}\frac{A_{1}+2A_{2}(1+z)}{A_{0}+2A_{1}(1+z)+A_{2}(1+z)^{2}}$.
The time scale of instability for this two models is discussed. In the paper we
then generalize our result and arrive at general expression for energy density
irrespective of the model. The thermodynamical stability for both of the model
and the general case is discussed from this viewpoint. We also arrive at a
condition on the limiting behavior of thermodynamic parameter to validate the
third law of thermodynamics and interpret the general mathematical expression
of integration constant $U_{0}$ (what we get while integrating energy
conservation equation) physically relating it to number of micro states. The
constraint on the allowed values of the parameters of the models is discussed
which ascertains stability of universe. The validity of thermodynamical laws
within apparent and event horizon is discussed.
