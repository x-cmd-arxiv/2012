Decision Aiding (MCDA), by considering all sets of parameters of an assumed
preference model, that are compatible with preference information given by the
Decision Maker (DM). As a result of ROR, one gets necessary and possible
preference relations in the set of alternatives, which hold for all compatible
sets of parameters or for at least one compatible set of parameters,
respectively. In this paper, we extend the MCDA methods based on ROR, by
considering one important aspect of decision problems: imprecise evaluations.
To deal with imprecise evaluations of some alternatives on particular criteria,
we extend the set of considered variables to define necessary and possible
preference relations taking into account this imprecision. In consequence, the
concepts of necessary and possible preference represent not only all compatible
sets of parameters, but also all possible values of the imprecise evaluations
of alternatives.

formulations of polytopes by representing them as projections of higher
dimensional ones. It is an important question whether a polytope admits a small
extended formulation, i.e., one involving only a polynomial number of
inequalities in its dimension. For the case of symmetric extended formulations
(i.e., preserving the symmetries of the polytope) Yannakakis established a
powerful technique to derive lower bounds and rule out small formulations. We
rephrase the technique of Yannakakis in a group-theoretic framework. This
provides a different perspective on symmetric extensions and considerably
simplifies several lower bound constructions.

The system has a quasi-one-dimensional geometry, and consists in two

them, and producing the advance of a crack. Quasistatic crack advance occurs as
a consequence of the plasticity included in the springs which form the chains,

continuous limit of the model allows a detailed analytical treatment that gives
physical insight of the propagation mechanism. This simple model captures key

one-body currents are studied in the local fermi gas approximation. The current
form factors are generated by meson dominance in the EFT Lagrangian. The
conservation of the vector current and the partial conservation of the axial

The $\Delta$ dynamics in nuclei, as a key component in the study, are explored.
Introduced $\Delta$-meson couplings explain the $\Delta$ spin-orbit (S-L)

Meanwhile a phenomenological approach is applied to parametrize the $\Delta$
width. To benchmark our approximations, we calculate the differential cross

which denotes a pronounced low-mass enhancement in the $\pi\pi$-invariant mass
spectrum. The experiments were carried out with the WASA detector setup at
COSY. Similar to the observation in the basic $pn \to d \pi^0\pi^0$ reaction,
the data reveal a correlation between the ABC effect and a resonance-like
energy dependence in the total cross section. The maximum occurs at m=2.37 GeV
+ 2$m_N$, i.e. at the same position as in the basic reaction. The observed
resonance width $\Gamma \approx$ 160 MeV can be understood from broadening due
to Fermi motion of the nucleons in initial and final nuclei together with
collision damping. Differential cross sections are described equally well by
the hypothesis of a $pn$ resonance formation during the reaction process.

determined unambiguously by the bulk, even in the presence of gapless surface

determine the quantity up to some quantized value, given that (i) there are no
gapless surface states, (ii) the surfaces do not break the symmetries preserved
by the bulk, and (iii) the system is kept at charge neutrality. If any of the
above conditions is violated, the quantity is then determined entirely by the

nuclear dependence of the quark distributions, also known as the EMC effect, as
well as the presence of highmomentum nucleons arising from short-range
correlations (SRCs). Recent measurements of both of these effects on light
nuclei have shown a clear deviation from simple density-dependent models.
Purpose: A better understanding of the nuclear quark distributions and
short-range correlations requires a careful examination of the experimental
data on these effects to constrain models that attempt to describe these
phenomena.
  Methods: We present a detailed analysis of the nuclear dependence of the EMC
effect and the contribution of SRCs in nuclei, comparing to predictions and
simple scaling models based on different pictures of the underlying physics. We
also make a direct, quantitative comparison of the two effects to further
examine the connection between these two observables related to nuclear
structure.
  Results: We find that, with the inclusion of the new data on light nuclei,
neither of these observables can be well explained by common assumptions for
the nuclear dependence. The anomalous behavior of both effects in light nuclei
is consistent with the idea the the EMC effect is driven by either the presence
of high-density configurations in nuclei or the large virtuality of the
highmomentum nucleons associated with these configurations.
  Conclusions: The unexpected nuclear dependence in the measurements of the EMC
effect and SRC contributions appear to suggest that the local environment of
the struck nucleon is the most relevant quantity for explaining these results.
The common behavior suggests a connection between the two seemingly disparate
phenomena, but the data do not yet allow for a clear preference between models
which aim to explain this connection.

$\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $[A]$ and $\bar{\mathbf{k}}$ denotes the

to a result due to Kolchin and Kovacic \cite{Ko71a}. This paper is devoted to
the study of reduced forms, of (higher order) variational equations along a
particular solution of a complex analytical hamiltonian system $X$. Using a
previous result \cite{ApWea}, we will assume that the first order variational
equation has an abelian Lie algebra so that, at first order, there are no
Galoisian obstructions to Liouville integrability. We give a strategy to
(partially) reduce the variational equations at order $m+1$ if the variational
equations at order $m$ are already in a reduced form and their Lie algebra is
abelian. Our procedure stops when we meet obstructions to the meromorphic
integrability of $X$. We make strong use both of the lower block triangular
structure of the variational equations and of the notion of associated Lie
algebra of a linear differential system (based on the works of Wei and Norman
in \cite{WeNo63a}). Obstructions to integrability appear when at some step we
obtain a non-trivial commutator between a diagonal element and a nilpotent
(subdiagonal) element of the associated Lie algebra. We use our method coupled
with a reasoning on polylogarithms to give a new and systematic proof of the
non-integrability of the H\'enon-Heiles system. We conjecture that our method
is not only a partial reduction procedure but a complete reduction algorithm.
In the context of complex Hamiltonian systems, this would mean that our method
would be an effective version of the Morales-Ramis-Sim\'o theorem.

on a combination of isochronal age plus youth indicators for the K4V common
proper motion system TW PsA. TW PsA is 1.96 deg away from Fomalhaut, and was
first proposed as a companion by Luyten (1938), but the physicality of the
binarity is worth testing with modern data. I demonstrate that TW PsA is

0.280+0.019-0.012 pc (57.4+3.9-2.5 kAU) and sharing velocities within 0.1+-0.5

considered ""Fomalhaut B"". Combining modern HR diagram constraints with four
sets of evolutionary tracks, and assuming the star was born with protosolar
composition, I estimate a new isochronal age for Fomalhaut of 450+-40 Myr and
mass of 1.92+-0.02 Msun. Various stellar youth diagnostics are re-examined for
TW PsA. The star's rotation, X-ray emission, and Li abundances are consistent
with approximate ages of 410, 380, and 360 Myr, respectively, yielding a
weighted mean age of 400+-70 Myr. Combining the independent ages, I estimate a
mean age for the Fomalhaut-TW PsA binary of 440+-40 Myr. The older age implies
that substellar companions of a given mass are approximately one magnitude
fainter at IR wavelengths than previously assumed.

measured with the Jefferson Lab CLAS spectrometer. Differential cross sections
were measured at more than 1800 kinematic values in $Q^2$, $x_B$, $t$, and
$\phi_\pi$, in the $Q^2$ range from 1.0 to 4.6 GeV$^2$,\ $-t$ up to 2 GeV$^2$,
and $x_B$ from 0.1 to 0.58. Structure functions $\sigma_T +\epsilon \sigma_L,
\sigma_{TT}$ and $\sigma_{LT}$ were extracted as functions of $t$ for each of
17 combinations of $Q^2$ and $x_B$. The data were compared directly with two
handbag-based calculations including both longitudinal and transversity GPDs.
Inclusion of only longitudinal GPDs very strongly underestimates $\sigma_T
+\epsilon \sigma_L$ and fails to account for $\sigma_{TT}$ and $\sigma_{LT}$,
while inclusion of transversity GPDs brings the calculations into substantially
better agreement with the data. There is very strong sensitivity to the
relative contributions of nucleon helicity flip and helicity non-flip
processes. The results confirm that exclusive $\pi^0$ electroproduction offers
direct experimental access to the transversity GPDs.

processing and the nascent field of graph signal processing. In this paper, a
spectral graph analogy to Heisenberg's celebrated uncertainty principle is
developed. Just as the classical result provides a tradeoff between signal
localization in time and frequency, this result provides a fundamental tradeoff
between a signal's localization on a graph and in its spectral domain. Using
the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian as a surrogate Fourier basis,
quantitative definitions of graph and spectral ""spreads"" are given, and a
complete characterization of the feasibility region of these two quantities is
developed. In particular, the lower boundary of the region, referred to as the
uncertainty curve, is shown to be achieved by eigenvectors associated with the
smallest eigenvalues of an affine family of matrices. The convexity of the
uncertainty curve allows it to be found to within $\varepsilon$ by a fast
approximation algorithm requiring $O(\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ typically sparse
eigenvalue evaluations. Closed-form expressions for the uncertainty curves for
some special classes of graphs are derived, and an accurate analytical
approximation for the expected uncertainty curve of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random
graphs is developed. These theoretical results are validated by numerical
experiments, which also reveal an intriguing connection between diffusion
processes on graphs and the uncertainty bounds.

address the issue of properly calibrating the detection setup, and in

surface density index, grain size distribution index, minimum and maximum grain

give us constraints on the geometry of the dust in these systems, as well as

accommodates the masses and mixing of the leptonic sector and relates the
emergence of large leptonic mixing angles with the seesaw mechanism. For large
deviations of the minimal texture, both quasidegenerate spectrum or inverted
hierarchy are allowed for neutrino masses.

development of small scales. At the latest time, a convergence of magnetic
field lines to the location of maximum current is probably leading locally to a
strong bending and directional variability of such lines. A novel analytical
method, based on sharp analysis inequalities, is used to assess the validity of
the finite-time singularity scenario. This method allows one to rule out
spurious singularities by evaluating the rate at which the logarithmic
decrement of the analyticity-strip method goes to zero. The result is that the

mass terms based on the Monte Carlo method.
  In the bosonic models we show the existence of an exotic first/second order
transition from a phase with a well defined background geometry (the fuzzy
sphere) to a phase with commuting matrices with no geometry in the sense of
Connes. At the transition point the sphere expands abruptly to infinite size
then it evaporates as we increase the temperature (the gauge coupling
constant). The transition looks first order due to the discontinuity in the
action whereas it looks second order due to the divergent peak in the specific
heat.
  The fuzzy sphere is stable for the supersymmetric models in the sense that
the bosonic phase transition is turned into a very slow crossover transition.
The transition point is found to scale to zero with N. We conjecture that the
transition from the background sphere to the phase of commuting matrices is
associated with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.
  The eigenvalues distribution of any of the bosonic matrices in the matrix
phase is found to be given by a non-polynomial law obtained from the fact that
the joint probability distribution of the four matrices is uniform inside a
solid ball with radius R. The eigenvalues of the gauge field on the background
geometry are also found to be distributed according to this non-polynomial law.

observations from ACS/WFC onboard HST. One field is centered about 2 arcmin
from M32 while the other is located 15 arcmin to the southeast of M31. We
identify a total of 1139 RR Lyrae variables of which 821 are ab-type and 318
are c-type. In the field near M32, we find a radial gradient in the density of
RR Lyraes relative to the center of M32. This gradient is consistent with the
surface brightness profile of M32 suggesting that a significant number of the
RR Lyraes in this region belong to M32. This provides further confirmation that
M32 contains an ancient stellar population formed around the same time as the
oldest population in M31 and the Milky Way. The RR Lyrae stars in M32 exhibit a
mean metal abundance of [Fe/H] ~ -1.42 +/- 0.02, which is ~15 times lower than
the metal abundance of the overall M32 stellar population. Moreover, the
abundance of RR Lyrae stars normalized to the luminosity of M32 in the field
analyzed further indicates that the ancient metal-poor population in M32
represents only a very minor component of this galaxy, consistent with the 1%
to 4.5% in mass inferred from the CMD analysis of Monachesi et al. In the other
field, we find unprecedented evidence for two populations of RR Lyraes in M31
as shown by two distinct sequences among the ab-type variables in the Bailey
Diagram. When interpreted in terms of metal abundance, one population exhibits
a peak at [Fe/H] ~ -1.3 and the other is at [Fe/H] ~ -1.9. One possible
interpretation of this result is that the more metal-rich population represents
the dominant M31 halo, while the metal-poorer group could be a disrupted dwarf
satellite galaxy orbiting M31. If true, this represents a further indication
that the formation of the M31 spheroid has been significantly influenced by the
merger and accretion of dwarf galaxy satellites. [abridged]

measure an online algorithm's performance against adaptive adversaries.
Focusing on the online bandit setting, we show that no bandit algorithm can
guarantee a sublinear policy regret against an adaptive adversary with
unbounded memory. On the other hand, if the adversary's memory is bounded, we
present a general technique that converts any bandit algorithm with a sublinear

a large margin formulation that makes structured learning from only partially
annotated data possible. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex, yet
can be efficiently solve by concave-convex procedure (CCCP) with novel speedup
strategies. We apply our method to a challenging tracking-by-assignment problem

factorization and its probabilistic counterparts for audio source separation.
Although able to capture audio spectral structure well, these models neglect
the non-stationarity and temporal dynamics that are important properties of
audio. The recently proposed non-negative factorial hidden Markov model
(N-FHMM) introduces a temporal dimension and improves source separation
performance. However, the factorial nature of this model makes the complexity
of inference exponential in the number of sound sources. Here, we present a
Bayesian variant of the N-FHMM suited to an efficient variational inference
algorithm, whose complexity is linear in the number of sound sources. Our
algorithm performs comparably to exact inference in the original N-FHMM but is
significantly faster. In typical configurations of the N-FHMM, our method
achieves around a 30x increase in speed.

the evolution of molecular clouds. We use high-resolution 3D SPH simulations to
explore the dynamical effects of a single O7 star located at the centre of a
molecular cloud with mass 10^4M_sun and radius 6.4pc. The initial internal
structure of the cloud is characterised by its fractal dimension, D=2.0 - 2.8,
and its log-normal density PDF. (i) As regards star formation, in the short
term ionising feedback is positive, in the sense that star formation occurs
much more quickly in gas that is compressed by the high pressure of the ionised
gas. However, in the long term ionising feedback is negative, in the sense that
most of the cloud is dispersed with an outflow rate of up to ~0.01M_sun/yr, on
a timescale comparable with the sound-crossing time for the ionised gas
(~1-2Myr), and triggered star formation is therefore limited to a few percent
of the cloud's mass. (ii) As regards the morphology of the ionisation fronts
(IFs) bounding the HII region and the systematics of outflowing gas, we
distinguish two regimes. For low D<=2.2, the initial cloud is dominated by
large-scale structures, so the neutral gas tends to be swept up into a few
extended coherent shells, and the ionised gas blows out through a few large
holes between these shells; we term these HII regions ""shell-dominated"".
Conversely, for high D>=2.6, the initial cloud is dominated by small-scale
structures, and these are quickly overrun by the advancing IF, thereby
producing neutral pillars whilst the ionised gas blows out through a large
number of small holes between the pillars; we term these HII regions
""pillar-dominated"". (iii) As regards the injection of bulk kinetic energy, by
~1Myr, the expansion of the HII region has delivered a rms velocity of ~6km/s;
this represents less than 0.1% of the total energy radiated by the O7 star.

pressure feedback from massive star clusters, as it reflects the
radiation-to-gas-pressure ratio and is readily derived from mid-infrared line
ratios. We consider several effects which determine the apparent value of U in
HII regions and galaxies. An upper limit is set by the compression of gas by
radiation pressure. The pressure from stellar winds and the presence of neutral
clumps both reduce U for a given radiation intensity. The most intensely
irradiated regions are selectively dimmed by internal dust absorption of
ionizing photons, inducing observational bias on galactic scales. We explore
these effects analytically and numerically, and use them to interpret previous
observational results.
  We find that radiation confinement sets the upper limit log_10 U = -1 seen in
individual regions. Unresolved starbursts display a maximum value of ~ -2.3.
While lower, this is also consistent with a large portion of their HII regions
being radiation dominated, given the different technique used to interpret
unresolved regions, and given the bias caused by dust absorption. We infer that
many individual, strongly illuminated regions cannot be dominated by stellar
winds, and that even when averaged on galactic scales, shocked wind pressures
cannot be large compared to radiation pressure. Therefore, most HII regions
cannot be adiabatic wind bubbles. Our models imply a metallicity dependence in
the physical structure and dust attenuation of radiation-dominated regions,
both of which should vary strongly across a critical metallicity of about
one-twentieth solar.

includes baryons. We find that gas pressure, reionisation, supernova feedback,
stripping, and truncated accretion systematically reduce the total mass and the
abundance of structures below ~10^12 solar masses compared to the pure dark
matter simulation. Taking this into account and adopting an appropriate
detection threshold lowers the abundance of observed galaxies with maximum
circular velocities below 100 km/s, significantly reducing the reported
discrepancy between Lambda-CDM and the measured HI velocity function of the
ALFALFA survey. We also show that the stellar-to-total mass ratios of galaxies
with stellar masses of ~10^5 - 10^7 solar masses inferred from abundance
matching of the (sub)halo mass function to the observed galaxy mass function
increase by a factor of ~2. In addition, we find that an important fraction of
low-mass subhaloes are completely devoid of stars. Accounting for the presence
of dark subhaloes below 10^10 solar masses further reduces the abundance of
observable objects, and leads to an additional increase in the inferred
stellar-to-total mass ratio by factors of 2 - 10 for galaxies in haloes of 10^9

this paper we present the results of computer modelling of light scattering by
aggregates that contain more than 1000 monomers of submicron size and study how
their light scattering characteristics, specifically polarization, change with
phase angle and wavelength. Such a modeling became possible due to development
of a new version of MSTM (Multi Sphere T-Matrix) code for parallel computing.
The results of the modeling are applied to the results of comet polarimetric
observations to check if large aggregates dominate in formation of light
scattering by comet dust. We compare aggregates of different structure and
porosity. We show that large aggregates of more than 98% porosity (e.g.
ballistic cluster-cluster aggregates) have angular dependence of polarization
almost identical to the Rayleigh one. Large compact aggregates (less than 80%
porosity) demonstrate the curves typical for solid particles. This rules out
too porous and too compact aggregates as typical comet dust particles. We show
that large aggregates not only can explain phase angle dependence of comet
polarization in the near infrared but also may be responsible for the

  in N=8 SUGRA","27 pages",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new formulation of the complete tree-level S-matrix of N = 8
supergravity. The new formula for n particles in the k R-charge sector is an
integral over the Grassmannian G(2,n) and uses the Veronese map into G(k,n).
The image of a point in G(2,n) is required to be in the ""complement"" of a
2|8-plane thus making the SU(8) R-symmetry manifest. The integrand is the ratio
of two determinants. The numerator is an analog of Hodges' recent determinant
formula for MHV amplitudes. The denominator is a 2(n+k-2) x 2(n+k-2) minor of a
2(n+k) x 2(n+k) matrix of rank 2(n+k-2). Just as Hodges' formula does for MHV
amplitudes, our integrand makes the complete invariance under Sn manifest for
all sectors.
  The validity of the new formula follows from two surprising facts. One is the
equivalence of Hodges' MHV formula and the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) formula
when kinematic invariants are allowed to be off-shell in a novel way. We give a
proof of this for any number of particles. The second fact is an orthogonality
property of the solutions to the polynomial equations defining the Veronese
embedding. Explicit proof of the orthogonality is given for all amplitudes in
all R-charge sectors with eight or less particles thus providing non-trivial
evidence for our proposal.

energy and momentum per unit area), and argue that it does properly account for
gravitational effects. As a simple example of the explanatory power of this
quasilocal approach, consider that, when we accelerate toward a freely-floating
massive object, the kinetic energy of that object increases (relative to our
frame). But how, exactly, does the object acquire this increasing kinetic
energy? Using the energy form of our quasilocal conservation law, we can see
precisely the actual mechanism by which the kinetic energy increases: It is due
to a bona fide gravitational energy flux that is exactly analogous to the
electromagnetic Poynting flux, and involves the general relativistic effect of
frame dragging caused by the object's motion relative to us.

that it is variable. Although our observations do not sample the entire orbital

the Sun's elemental and isotopic composition, indicate that the solar system
was contaminated early in its evolution by ejecta from a nearby supernova (SN).
Previous models have invoked SN material being injected into an extant
protoplanetary disk, or isotropically expanding ejecta sweeping over a distant
(>10 pc) cloud core, simultaneously enriching it and triggering its collapse.
Here we consider a new astrophysical setting: the injection of clumpy SN
ejecta, as observed in the Cas A SN remnant, into the molecular gas at the
periphery of an HII region created by the SN's progenitor star. To track these
interactions we have conducted a suite of high-resolution (1500^3 effective) 3D
simulations that follow the evolution of individual clumps as they move into
molecular gas. Even at these high resolutions, our simulations do not quite
achieve numerical convergence, due to the challenge of properly resolving the
small-scale mixing of ejecta and molecular gas, although they do allow some
robust conclusions to be drawn. Isotropically exploding ejecta do not penetrate
into the molecular cloud, but, if cooling is properly accounted for, clumpy
ejecta penetrate to distances ~10^18 cm and mix effectively with star-forming
molecular gas. The ~2 M_\odot high-metallicity ejecta from a core-collapse SN
is likely to mix with ~2 \times 10^4 M_\odot of molecular gas. Thus all stars
forming late (~5 Myr) in the evolution of an HII region may be contaminated by
SN ejecta at a level ~10^-4. This level of contamination is consistent with the
abundances of short-lived radionuclides and possibly some stable isotopic
shifts in the early solar system, and is potentially consistent with the
observed variability in stellar elemental abundances. SN contamination of
forming planetary systems may be a common, universal process.

polarized incident beam the SOI manifests itself by giving rise to a strong
anisotropic linear diattenuation effect which produces polarization-dependent
off-axis high intensity side lobes near the focal plane of the trap. Single
micron-sized asymmetric particles can be trapped in the side lobes, and
transported over circular paths by a rotation of the plane of input
polarization. We demonstrate such controlled motion on single pea-pod shaped
single soft oxometalate (SOM) particles of dimension around $1\times 0.5\mu$m
over lengths up to $\sim$15 $\mu$m . The observed effects are supported by
calculations of the intensity profiles based on a variation of the Debye-Wolf
approach. The enhanced SOI could thus be used as a generic means of
transporting mesoscopic asymmetric particles in an optical trap without the use
of complex optical beams or changing the alignment of the beam into the trap.

divide all $t_{2g}$ states into two types: the `localized' ones, which are

the symmetric `delocalized' ones. Thus, NaV$_2$O$_4$ can be classified as the

the universe in its infancy required highly improbable initial conditions. In
this paper, we examine this well-known problem by considering photon
propagation through a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime at a more

the composite Fermi liquid (CFL) theory of the half-filled Landau level. In
this paper, we study continuous quantum phase transitions out of the CFL state
and into a Landau Fermi liquid, in the limit of no disorder and fixed particle
number. This transition can be induced by tuning the bandwidth of the Landau
level relative to the interaction energy, for instance through an externally
applied periodic potential. We find a transition to the Landau Fermi liquid
through a gapless Mott insulator with a Fermi surface of neutral fermionic
excitations. In the presence of spatial symmetries, we also find a direct
continuous transition between the CFL and the Landau Fermi liquid. The
transitions have a number of characteristic observable signatures, including
the presence of two crossover temperature scales, resistivity jumps, and
vanishing compressibility. When the composite fermions are paired instead, our
results imply quantum critical points between various non-Abelian topological
states, including the \nu = 1/2 Moore-Read Pfaffian (Ising x U(1) topological
order), a version of the Kitaev B phase (Ising topological order), and paired
electronic superconductors. To study such transitions, we use a projective
construction of the CFL, which goes beyond the conventional framework of flux
attachment to include a broader set of quantum fluctuations. These
considerations suggest a possible route to fractionalized Mott insulators by
starting with FQH states and tuning the Landau level bandwidth.

these problems allows efficient optimization strategies - a well known example
is variable projection, where nonlinear least squares problems which are linear

the idea of projecting out a subset over the variables to a broad class of
maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori likelihood (MAP) problems with
nuisance parameters, such as variance or degrees of freedom. As a result, we
are able to incorporate nuisance parameter estimation into large-scale

approach to a variety of problems, including estimation of unknown variance
parameters in the Gaussian model, degree of freedom (d.o.f.) parameter
estimation in the context of robust inverse problems, automatic calibration,
and optimal experimental design. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate
improvement in recovery of primary parameters for several large- scale inverse

called the gravitational self-force, are now well established, but concrete
results have mostly been limited to linear order. Accurately modeling the
dynamics of compact binaries requires proceeding to nonlinear orders. To that
end, I show how to obtain the metric perturbation outside the body at all

surrounding the body, the form of the perturbation can be found analytically as
an expansion for small distances $r$ from a representative worldline. Given
only a specification of the body's multipole moments, the field obtained in the

numerical puncture scheme. Following this procedure at first and second order,
I calculate the field in the buffer region around an arbitrarily structured
compact body at sufficiently high order in $r$ to numerically implement a
second-order puncture scheme, including effects of the body's spin. I also
define $n$th-order (local) generalizations of the Detweiler-Whiting singular

what could be a minimal extension consistent with what we now know. The most
promising such scenarios extend the MSSM with new tree-level Higgs interactions
that can lift its mass to at least 125 GeV and also allow for flavor-dependent
soft terms so that the third generation squarks are lighter than current bounds
on the first and second generation squarks. We argue that a common feature of
almost all such models is the need for a new scale near 10 TeV, such as a scale
of Higgsing or confinement of a new gauge group. We consider the question
whether such a model can naturally derive from a single mass scale associated
with supersymmetry breaking. Most such models simply postulate new scales,
leaving their proximity to the scale of MSSM soft terms a mystery. This
coincidence problem may be thought of as a mild tuning, analogous to the usual
mu problem. We find that a single mass scale origin is challenging, but suggest
that a more natural origin for such a new dynamical scale is the gravitino
mass, m_{3/2}, in theories where the MSSM soft terms are a loop factor below
m_{3/2}. As an example, we build a variant of the NMSSM where the singlet S is
composite, and the strong dynamics leading to compositeness is triggered by
masses of order m_{3/2} for some fields. Our focus is the Higgs sector, but our
model is compatible with a light stop (with the other generation squarks heavy,
or with R-parity violation or another mechanism to hide them from current
searches). All the interesting low-energy mass scales, including linear terms
for S playing a key role in EWSB, arise dynamically from the single scale
m_{3/2}. However, numerical coefficients from RG effects and wavefunction
factors in an extra dimension complicate the otherwise simple story.

have employed these systems as prototypes to test stochastic mode reduction
strategies. In the present paper the Burgers-Hopf dynamics truncated to n
Fourier modes is treated by a new statistical model reduction technique, and a
closed system of evolution equations for the mean values of the m lowest modes
is derived for m << n. In the reduced model the m-mode macrostates are
associated with trial probability densities on the phase space of the n-mode
microstates, and a cost functional is introduced to quantify the lack of fit of
paths of these densities to the Liouville equation. The best-fit macrodynamics
is obtained by minimizing the cost functional over paths, and the equations
governing the closure are then derived from Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The
resulting reduced equations have a fractional diffusion and modified nonlinear
interactions, and the explicit form of both are determined up to a single
closure parameter. The accuracy and range of validity of this nonequilibrium
closure is assessed by comparison against direct numerical simulations of
statistical ensembles, and the predicted behaviour is found to be well

Analytic solutions are derived for power law potential in one dimension, and
extensions of these solutions in three dimensions are proposed. Next the self
similarity of the collapse of cold dynamical systems is investigated
numerically. The fold system in phase space is consistent with analytic self
similar solutions, the solutions present all the proper self-similar scalings.
An additional point is the appearance of an $x^{-(1/2)}$ law at the center of
the system for initial conditions with power law index larger than $-(1/2)$. It
is found that the first appearance of the $x^{-(1/2)}$ law corresponds to the
formation of a singularity very close to the center. Finally the general
properties of self similar multi dimensional solutions near equilibrium are
investigated. Smooth and continuous self similar solutions have power law
behavior at equilibrium. However cold initial conditions result in
discontinuous phase space solutions, and the smoothed phase space density
looses its auto similar properties. This problem is easily solved by observing
that the probability distribution of the phase space density $P$ is identical
except for scaling parameters to the probability distribution of the smoothed
phase space density $P_S$. As a consequence $P_S$ inherit the self similar
properties of $P$. This particular property is at the origin of the universal
power law observed in numerical simulation for ${\rho}/{\sigma^3}$. The self
similar properties of $P_S$ implies that other quantities should have also an
universal power law behavior with predictable exponents. This hypothesis is
tested using a numerical model of the phase space density of cold dark matter
halo's, an excellent agreement is obtained.

Rietveld refinement of the powder X-ray diffraction data reveals that Pr2Pt3Si5
crystallizes in the U2Co3Si5-type orthorhombic structure (space group Ibam).
Both the dc and ac magnetic susceptibility data measured at low fields exhibit
sharp anomaly near 15 K. In contrast, the specific heat data exhibit only a
broad anomaly implying no long range magnetic order down to 2 K. The broad
Schottky-type anomaly in low temperature specific heat data is interpreted in
terms of crystal electric field (CEF) effect, and a CEF-split singlet ground
state is inferred. The absence of the long range order is attributed to the
presence of nonmagnetic singlet ground state of the Pr3+ ion. The electrical
resistivity data exhibit metallic behavior and are well described by the
Bloch-Gr\""uniesen-Mott relation.

been studied within the self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock+BCS and
quasi-particle random phase approximation (QRPA). Three Skyrme parameter sets
are used in the calculations, i.e., SLy5, SkM* and SkP, since they are
characterized by different values of the compression modulus in symmetric
nuclear matter, namely K=230, 217, and 202 MeV, respectively. We also
investigate the effect of different types of pairing forces on the ISGMR in Cd,
Sn and Pb isotopes. The calculated peak energies and the strength distributions
of ISGMR are compared with available experimental data. We find that SkP fails
completely to describe the ISGMR strength distribution for all isotopes due to
its low value of the nuclear matter incompressibility, namely K=202 MeV. On the
other hand, the SLy5 parameter set, supplemented by an appropriate pairing
interaction, gives a reasonable description of the ISGMR in Cd and Pb isotopes.
A better description of ISGMR in Sn isotopes is achieved by the SkM*
interaction, that has a somewhat softer value of the nuclear incompressibility.

clocks moving through curved spacetime measures geometry by sending signals
back and forth, as in the global positioning system (GPS). Combining well-known
quantum limits to measurement with the requirement that the energy density of
clocks and signals be be no greater than the black hole density leads to the
quantum geometric limit: the total number of ticks of clocks and clicks of
detectors that can be contained in a four volume of spacetime of radius r and
temporal extent t is less than or equal to rt/\pi l_P t_P, where l_P, t_P are
the Planck length and time. The quantum geometric limit suggests that each
event or `op' that takes place in a four-volume of spacetime is associated with
a Planck-scale area. This paper shows that the quantum geometric limit can be
used to derive general relativity: if each quantum event is associated with a
Planck-scale area removed from two-dimensional surfaces in the volume in which

properties of the density-parallel magnetic field correlation for these kinetic

correlation is consistent with a statistically negligible kinetic fast wave
energy contribution for the large sample used in this study. A model of the
solar wind inertial range fluctuations is proposed comprised of a mixture of a
critically balanced distribution of incompressible Alfvenic fluctuations and a
critically balanced or more anisotropic than critical balance distribution of

and energy outflows originating in regions of star formation. Magnetic fields
are an essential ingredient of the ISM, but their connection to the gaseous
medium and its evolution remains poorly understood. Here we present the
detection of a gradient in Faraday rotation measure (RM), co-located with a
hole in the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution in the disk of the nearby spiral
galaxy NGC 6946. The gas kinematics in the same location show evidence for
infall of cold gas. The combined characteristics of this feature point to a
substantial vertical displacement of the initially plane-parallel ordered
magnetic field, driven by a localized star formation event. This reveals how
the large-scale magnetic field pattern in galaxy disks is directly influenced
by internal energetic phenomena. Conversely, magnetic fields are observed to be
an important ingredient in disk-halo interactions, as predicted in MHD
simulations. Turbulent magnetic fields at smaller spatial scales than the
observed RM gradient will also be carried from the disk and provide a mechanism
for the dynamo process to amplify the ordered magnetic field without quenching.
We discuss the observational biases, and suggest that this is a common feature
of star forming galaxies with active disk-halo flows.

performing a suitable measurement on a distant quantum system entangled with
it. In all experiments performed to date, this choice took place either in the
past or, in some delayed-choice arrangements, in the future of the
interference. Thus in principle, physical communications between choice and
interference were not excluded. Here we report a quantum eraser experiment, in
which by enforcing Einstein locality no such communication is possible. This is
achieved by independent active choices, which are space-like separated from the
interference. Our setup employs hybrid path-polarization entangled photon pairs
which are distributed over an optical fiber link of 55 m in one experiment, or
over a free-space link of 144 km in another. No naive realistic picture is

stem from a proposed coarse grained neutral model based on birth-death

and synthesizing both theoretical results of ecological neutral theory and
empirical evidence on species diversity preservation. Neutral model of
biodiversity deals with ecosystems in the same trophic level where per-capita
vital rates are assumed to be species-independent. Close-form analytical
solutions for neutral theory are obtained within a coarse-grained model, where
the only input is the species persistence time distribution. Our results
pertain: the probability distribution function of the number of species in the
ecosystem both in transient and stationary states; the n-points connected time
correlation function; and the survival probability, definned as the
distribution of time-spans to local extinction for a species randomly sampled
from the community. Analytical predictions are also tested on empirical data
from a estuarine fish ecosystem. We find that emerging properties of the
ecosystem are very robust and do not depend on specific details of the model,
with implications on biodiversity and conservation biology.

results without a supersymmetry. We show that the present tiny dark energy is

(up to ~10 \muJy) to study the evolution of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) over a wide range of cosmic time. Aims. We present
here ancillary radio observations at a frequency of 2.3 GHz obtained with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The main goal of this is to study the
radio spectra of an unprecedented large sample of sources (~2000 observed, ~600
detected in both frequencies). Methods. With this paper, we provide 2.3 GHz
source catalogues for both ATLAS fields, with a detection limit of 300 \muJy.
We compute spectral indices between 1.4 GHz and 2.3 GHz using matched
resolution images and investigate various properties of our source sample in
dependence of their spectral indices. Results. We find the entire source sample
to have a median spectral index of 0.74, in good agreement with both the
canonical value of 0.7 for optically thin synchrotron radiation and other
spectral index studies conducted by various groups. Regarding the radio
spectral index as indicator for source type, we find only marginal correlations
so that flat or inverted spectrum sources are usually powered by AGN and hence
conclude that at least for the faint population the spectral index is not a
strong discriminator. We investigate relation between spectral index and
redshift for our source sample and find no such correlation at all. We do find
a significant correlation between redshift and radio to near-infrared flux
ratio, making this a much stronger tracer of high-z radio sources. We also find
no evidence for a dependence of the radio-IR correlation on spectral index.

exhibiting a marginally flatter central profile. A significant dependence of
the temperature profiles on the pseudo-entropy ratio sigma is detected by
fitting a function of both r and sigma, showing an indication that the outer
part of the profiles becomes steeper for higher values of sigma (i.e.
transitioning towards the NCC clusters). No significant evidence of redshift
evolution could be found within the redshift range sampled by our clusters
(0.4<z<0.9). A comparison of our high-z sample with intermediate clusters at
0.1<z<0.3, showed how both the CC and NCC clusters temperature profiles have
experienced some sort of evolution. This can be due by the fact that higher z
clusters are at less advanced stage of their formation and did not have enough
time to create a relaxed structure, characterized by a central temperature dip
in CC clusters and by flatter profiles in NCC clusters. This is the first time
that a systematic study of the temperature profiles of galaxy clusters at z>0.4

Furthermore, since the internal rearrangement of magnetic fields is a highly
dynamical process, which has been suggested to be behind magnetar giant flares,
our simulations can provide a realistic estimate of the electromagnetic and
gravitational-wave emission which should accompany the flare event. Our main
findings are the following: (i) the initial development of the instability
meets all the expectations of perturbative studies in terms of the location of
the seed of the instability, the timescale for its growth and the generation of
a toroidal component; (ii) in the subsequent nonlinear reorganization of the
system, ~90% of magnetic energy is lost in few Alfven timescales mainly through
electromagnetic emission, and further decreases on a much longer timescale;
(iii) all stellar models tend to achieve a significant amount of magnetic
helicity and the equipartition of energy between poloidal and toroidal magnetic
fields, and evolve to a new configuration which does not show a subsequent
instability on dynamical or Alfven timescales; (iv) the electromagnetic
emission matches the duration of the initial burst in luminosity observed in
giant flares, giving support to the internal rearrangement scenario; (v) only a
small fraction of the energy released during the process is converted into
f-mode oscillations and in the consequent gravitational-wave emission, thus

spiking-bursting behavior in response to a weak periodic force. This model
exhibits two types of oscillations with different characteristic time scales,
namely, long and short time scales. Several types of phase synchronization are
observed, such as 1 : 1 phase locking between a single spike and one period of
the force and 1 : l phase locking between the period of slow oscillation
underlying bursts and l periods of the force. Moreover, spiking-bursting
oscillations with chaotic firing patterns can be synchronized with the periodic
force. Such a type of phase synchronization is detected from the position of a
set of points on a unit circle, which is determined by the phase of the
periodic force at each spiking time. We show that this detection method is
effective for a system with multiple time scales. Owing to the existence of
both the short and the long time scales, two characteristic phenomena are found
around the transition point to chaotic phase synchronization. One phenomenon
shows that the average time interval between successive phase slips exhibits a
power-law scaling against the driving force strength and that the scaling
exponent has an unsmooth dependence on the changes in the driving force
strength. The other phenomenon shows that Kuramoto's order parameter before the
transition exhibits stepwise behavior as a function of the driving force
strength, contrary to the smooth transition in a model with a single time
scale.

restrict the nature of GJ1214's atmosphere. We used the Gran Telescopio
Canarias (GTC) OSIRIS instrument to acquire narrow band photometry with tunable
filters. With our observations, we were able to observe the primary transit of
the super-Earth GJ 1214b in three bandpasses: two centered in the continuum
around Halpha (653.5 nm and 662.0 nm) and one centered at the line core (656.3
nm). We measure the depth of the planetary transit at each wavelength
interval.By fitting analytic models to the measured light curves we were able
to compute the depth of the transit at the three bandpasses. Taking the
difference in the computed planet to star radius ratio between the line and the
comparison continuum filters, we find Delta (Rp/Rstar)_{Halpha-653.5} = (6.60

Although the planet radius is found to be larger in the Halpha line than in the
surrounding continuum, the quality of our observations and the sigma level of
the differences (1.8 and 1.0, respectively) does not allow us to claim an
Halpha excess in GJ1214's atmosphere. Further observations will be needed to

basis, the number of objects had to be increased dramatically from the few

150 mJy need to be observed, calibrated and their errors be estimated reliably.
We have developed new data reduction methods for the coherent estimation of
correlated fluxes with the Expert Work Station (EWS). They increase the
signal/noise of the reduced correlated fluxes by decreasing the jitter in the
group delay estimation. While correlation losses cannot be fully avoided for
the weakest objects even with the improved routines, we have developed a method
to simulate observations of weak targets and can now detect --- and correct for
--- such losses. We have analyzed all sources of error that are relevant for
the observations of weak targets. Apart from the photon-noise error, that is
usually quoted, there is an additional error from the uncertainty in the
calibration (i.e. the conversion factor). With the improved data reduction,
calibration and error estimation, we can consistently and reproducibly observe
fluxes as weak as ~ 150 mJy with an uncertainty of ~ 15 % under average
conditions.

high-power lasers, we focus our attention on a classically strong field regime
for which $-e^2 \bar {A^2}/m_e^2 c^4 \gtrsim 1$. It is shown that along with
the well-known ""plane-wave"" Volkov solution, Dirac equation also has the
""non-plane-wave"" solutions, which possess OAM and a spin-orbit coupling, and
generalize the free-electron's Bessel states. Motion of the electron with OAM
in a circularly polarized laser wave reveals a twofold character: the
wave-packet center moves along a classical helical trajectory with some quantum
transverse broadening (due to OAM) existing even for a free electron. Using the
twisted states, we calculate the electron's total angular momentum and predict
its shift in the strong-field regime that is analogous to the well-known shifts
of the electron's momentum and mass (and to a less known shift of its spin) in
intense fields. Since the electron's effective angular momentum is conserved in
a plane wave, as well as in some more general field configurations, we discuss
several possibilities for accelerating non-relativistic twisted electrons by
using the focused and combined electromagnetic fields.

electron-electron interactions even when they cannot exchange particles,
provided that the layer separation d is comparable to a characteristic distance
l between charge carriers within layers. One of the consequences of this remote
coupling is a phenomenon called Coulomb drag, in which an electric current
passed through one of the layers causes frictional charge flow in the other
layer. Previously, only the regime of weak (d>>l) to intermediate (d ~ l)
coupling could be studied experimentally. Here we use graphene-BN
heterostructures with d down to 1 nm to probe interlayer interactions and
Coulomb drag in the limit d<<l where the two Dirac liquids effectively nest
within the same plane, but still can be tuned and measured independently. The
strongly interacting regime reveals many unpredicted features that are
qualitatively different from those observed previously. In particular, although
drag vanishes because of electron-hole symmetry when either layer is neutral,
we find that drag is at its strongest when /both/ layers are neutral. Under
this circumstance, drag is positive in zero magnetic field but changes its sign
and rapidly grows in strength with field. The drag remains strong at room
temperature. The broken electron-hole symmetry is attributed to mutual
polarization of closely-spaced interacting layers. The two-fluid Dirac system
offers a large parameter space for further investigation of strong interlayer
interaction phenomena.

real space shape of the orbitals involved in the tunneling. STM images

computational efficiency of our model is remarkable as the k-point samplings of

multiple genomic studies in order to replicate findings. A common approach is
to first rank genes according to an hypothesis of interest within each study.
Then, lists of the top-ranked genes within each study are compared across
studies. Genes recaptured as highly ranked (usually above some threshold) in
multiple studies are considered to be significant. However, this comparison
strategy often remains informal, in that type I error and false discovery rate
(FDR) are usually uncontrolled. In this paper, we formalize an inferential
strategy for this kind of list-intersection discovery test. We show how to
compute a $p$-value associated with a ""recaptured"" set of genes, using a
closed-form Poisson approximation to the distribution of the size of the
recaptured set. We investigate operating characteristics of the test as a
function of the total number of studies considered, the rank threshold within
each study, and the number of studies within which a gene must be recaptured to
be declared significant. We investigate the trade off between FDR control and
expected sensitivity (the expected proportion of true-positive genes identified
as significant). We give practical guidance on how to design a bioinformatic
list-intersection study with maximal expected sensitivity and prespecified
control of type I error (at the set level) and false discovery rate (at the
gene level). We show how optimal choice of parameters may depend on particular

released from depolymerizing filament tips (processivity), protection of
depolymerizing filament tips from MinD binding, and fragmentation of MinD
filaments due to MinE. Each of processivity, protection, and fragmentation
reduces stuttering, speeds oscillations, and reduces MinD filament lengths.
Neither processivity or tip-protection were, on their own, sufficient to
produce fast stutter-free oscillations. While filament fragmentation could, on
its own, lead to fast oscillations with infrequent stuttering; high levels of
fragmentation degraded oscillations. The infrequent stuttering observed in
standard Min oscillations are consistent with short filaments of MinD, while we
expect that mutants that exhibit higher stuttering frequencies will exhibit
longer MinD filaments. Increased stuttering rate may be a useful diagnostic to
find observable MinD polymerization in experimental conditions.

are local to each relation, has been proposed. In many of those cases, however,
the join often involves performing aggregate operations among some of the
attributes from the different relations. In this paper, we introduce such
queries as ""aggregate skyline join queries"". Since the naive algorithm is
impractical, we propose three algorithms to efficiently process such queries.
The algorithms utilize certain properties of skyline sets, and processes the
skylines as much as possible locally before computing the join. Experiments
with real and synthetic datasets exhibit the practicality and scalability of
the algorithms with respect to the cardinality and dimensionality of the

sensors to be synchronized in time. The sensors in our proposal provide
measurements in an aperiodic way triggered by local conditions. Furthermore, in
the proposed implementation (most of) the communication between nodes requires
only the exchange of one bit of information (per controller update), which
could aid in reducing transmission delays and as a secondary effect result in
fewer transmissions being triggered.

numerical scheme for general relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to an optically
thick radiation field in two existing GR-hydrodynamics codes. We argue that the
necessity of such an improvement arises naturally in astrophysically relevant
regimes where the optical thickness is high as the equations become stiff. By
performing several 1D tests we verify the codes' new ability to deal with this
stiffness and show consistency. Then, still in 1D, we compute a luminosity
versus accretion rate diagram for the setup of spherical accretion onto a
Schwarzschild black hole and find good agreement with previous work. Lastly, we
revisit the supersonic Bondi Hoyle Lyttleton (BHL) accretion in 2D where we can
now present simulations of realistic temperatures, down to T~10^6 K. Here we
find that radiation pressure plays an important role, but also that these
highly dynamical set-ups push our approximate treatment towards the limit of
physical applicability. The main features of radiation hydrodynamics BHL flows
manifest as (i) an effective adiabatic index approaching gamma_effective ~ 4/3;
(ii) accretion rates two orders of magnitude lower than without radiation
pressure; (iii) luminosity estimates around the Eddington limit, hence with an
overall radiative efficiency as small as eta ~ 10^{-2}; (iv) strong departures
from thermal equilibrium in shocked regions; (v) no appearance of the flip-flop
instability. We conclude that the current optically thick approximation to the
radiation transfer does give physically substantial improvements over the pure
hydro also in set-ups departing from equilibrium, and, once accompanied by an
optically thin treatment, is likely to provide a fundamental tool for
investigating accretion flows in a large variety of astrophysical systems.

with nonresponse, a recursive partitioning algorithm is applied to the
Occupational Employment Statistics May 2006 survey data to build a regression
tree. The tree models an establishment's propensity to respond to the survey
given certain establishment characteristics. It provides mutually exclusive
cells based on the characteristics with homogeneous response propensities. This
makes it easy to identify interpretable associations between the characteristic
variables and an establishment's propensity to respond, something not easily
done using a logistic regression propensity model. We test the model obtained
using the May data against data from the November 2006 Occupational Employment
Statistics survey. Testing the model on a disjoint set of establishment data
with a very large sample size $(n=179,360)$ offers evidence that the regression
tree model accurately describes the association between the establishment
characteristics and the response propensity for the OES survey. The accuracy of
this modeling approach is compared to that of logistic regression through
simulation. This representation is then used along with frame-level
administrative wage data linked to sample data to investigate the possibility
of nonresponse bias. We show that without proper adjustments the nonresponse
does pose a risk of bias and is possibly nonignorable.

measure of genuine multipartite entanglement. The new measure $k$-ME
concurrence satisfies important characteristics of an entanglement measure
including entanglement monotone, vanishing on $k$-separable states, convexity,
subadditivity and strictly greater than zero for all $k$-nonseparable states.
Two powerful lower bounds on this measure are given. These lower bounds are
experimentally implementable without quantum state tomography and are easily
computable as no optimization or eigenvalue evaluation is needed. We illustrate
detailed examples in which the given bounds perform better than other known
detection criteria.

locations of peak activations identified in 162 separate studies on emotion.
Neuroimaging meta-analyses are typically performed using kernel-based methods.
However, these methods require the width of the kernel to be set a priori and
to be constant across the brain. To address these issues, we propose a fully
Bayesian nonparametric binary regression method to perform neuroimaging
meta-analyses. In our method, each location (or voxel) has a probability of
being a peak activation, and the corresponding probability function is based on
a spatially adaptive Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF). We also include
parameters in the model to robustify the procedure against miscoding of the
voxel response. Posterior inference is implemented using efficient MCMC
algorithms extended from those introduced in Holmes and Held [Bayesian Anal. 1
(2006) 145--168]. Our method allows the probability function to be locally
adaptive with respect to the covariates, that is, to be smooth in one region of
the covariate space and wiggly or even discontinuous in another. Posterior
miscoding probabilities for each of the identified voxels can also be obtained,
identifying voxels that may have been falsely classified as being activated.
Simulation studies and application to the emotion neuroimaging data indicate
that our method is superior to standard kernel-based methods.

demonstrate that the proposed distributed multi-cell beamforming algorithm

it is known that it is sufficient to prove them for \emph{snarks}, the class of
nontrivial 3-regular graphs which cannot be 3-edge coloured. In the first part
of this paper we present a new algorithm for generating all non-isomorphic
snarks of a given order. Our implementation of the new algorithm is 14 times
faster than previous programs for generating snarks, and 29 times faster for
generating weak snarks. Using this program we have generated all non-isomorphic
snarks on $n\leq 36$ vertices. Previously lists up to $n=28$ vertices have been
published. In the second part of the paper we analyze the sets of generated
snarks with respect to a number of properties and conjectures. We find that
some of the strongest versions of the cycle double cover conjecture hold for
all snarks of these orders, as does Jaeger's Petersen colouring conjecture,
which in turn implies that Fulkerson's conjecture has no small counterexamples.
In contrast to these positive results we also find counterexamples to eight
previously published conjectures concerning cycle coverings and the general
cycle structure of cubic graphs.

state of polarization (SOP) of light, understood as the control over the SOP of
a signal beam by the SOP of a pump beam. We will show how the possibility of
such control arises naturally from a vectorial study of pump-probe Raman
interactions in optical fibers. Most studies on the Raman effect in optical
fibers assume a scalar model, which is only valid for high-PMD fibers (here,
PMD stands for the polarization-mode dispersion). Modern technology enables
manufacturing of low-PMD fibers, the description of which requires a full
vectorial model. Within this model we gain full control over the SOP of the
signal beam. In particular we show how the signal SOP is pulled towards and
trapped by the pump SOP. The isotropic symmetry of the fiber is broken by the
presence of the polarized pump. This trapping effect is used in experiments for
the design of new nonlinear optical devices named Raman polarizers. Along with
the property of improved signal amplification, these devices transform an
arbitrary input SOP of the signal beam into one and the same SOP towards the
output end. This output SOP is fully controlled by the SOP of the pump beam. We
overview the sate-of-the-art of the subject and introduce the notion of an
""ideal Raman polarizer"".

between the subsystems that belong to certain interconnection patterns (motifs)
using three heuristic rules. These rules are based on three motifs:
sequentially connected nodes, nodes connected in parallel and almost
disconnected subgraphs. Aggregation of these motifs keeps the main structure of
the mutual influences between the subsystems in the network. Furthermore,
fulfillment of the reduced small gain condition implies ISS of the large

for the large network can be constructed using the reduced small gain
condition. Applications of these rules is illustrated on an example.

that graphene and boron nitride monolayers, the two best characterized 2D

multiple exposures to pathogens of a single type increase the chance of

ineffective against the others. Under conditions of no intervention-induced
failures, we introduce a framework and Bayesian and frequentist methods to

this, we used a full Monte Carlo method to derive the inclusive differential
spectra (yields) of muons, muon neutrinos and electron neutrinos at the surface
for energies between 80 GeV and hundreds of PeV. The air shower simulator {\sc
corsika} 6.990 was used for showering and propagation of the secondary
particles through the atmosphere, employing the established high-energy
hadronic interaction models {\sc sibyll} 2.1, {\sc qgsjet-01} and {\sc
qgsjet-ii 03}. We show that the performance of the interaction models allows
makes it possible to predict the spectra within experimental uncertainties,
while {\sc sibyll} generally yields a higher flux at the surface than the
qgsjet models. The calculation of the flavor and charge ratios has lead to
inconsistent results, mainly influenced by the different representations of the
K/$\pi$ ratio within the models. Furthermore, we could quantify systematic
uncertainties of atmospheric muon- and neutrino fluxes, associated to the
models of the primary cosmic-ray spectrum and the interaction models. For most
recent parametrizations of the cosmic-ray primary spectrum, atmospheric muons
can be determined with an uncertainty smaller than $^{+15}_{-13}$% of the
average flux. Uncertainties of the muon- and electron neutrino fluxes can be
calculated within an average error of $^{+32}_{-22}$% and $^{+25}_{-19}$%,
respectively.

pioneering work of Kolmogorov (1938), Yaglom (1947) and Sevastyanov (1951).
They appear as a natural object when considering Markov processes that are
certainly absorbed since they are invariant for the evolution of the
distribution of the process conditioned on not being absorbed. They hence
appropriately describe the state of the process at large times for non absorbed
paths. Unlike invariant distributions for Markov processes, QSD are solutions
of a non-linear equation and there can be 0, 1 or an infinity of them. Also,
they cannot be obtained as Ces\`aro limits of Markovian dynamics. These facts
make the computation of QSDs a nontrivial matter. We review different
approximation methods for QSD that are useful for simulation purposes, mainly
focused on Fleming-Viot dynamics. We also give some alternative proofs and
extensions of known results.

2011 and is currently performing observations resulting from its first call for
proposals in addition to a continuing program of commissioning and
characterization observations. The instrument consists of 258 dual-polarization
dipoles, which are digitized and combined into beams. Four
independently-steerable dual-polarization beams are available, each with two
""tunings"" of 16 MHz bandwidth that can be independently tuned to any frequency
between 10 MHz and 88 MHz. The system equivalent flux density for zenith
pointing is ~3 kJy and is approximately independent of frequency; this
corresponds to a sensitivity of ~5 Jy/beam (5sigma, 1 s); making it one of the
most sensitive meter-wavelength radio telescopes. LWA1 also has two ""transient
buffer"" modes which allow coherent recording from all dipoles simultaneously,
providing instantaneous all-sky field of view. LWA1 provides versatile and
unique new capabilities for Galactic science, pulsar science, solar and
planetary science, space weather, cosmology, and searches for astrophysical
transients. Results from LWA1 will detect or tightly constrain the presence of
hot Jupiters within 50 parsecs of Earth. LWA1 will provide excellent resolution
in frequency and in time to examine phenomena such as solar bursts, and pulsars
over a 4:1 frequency range that includes the poorly understood turnover and
steep-spectrum regimes. Observations to date have proven LWA1's potential for
pulsar observing, and just a few seconds with the completed 256-dipole LWA1
provide the most sensitive images of the sky at 23 MHz obtained yet. We are
operating LWA1 as an open skies radio observatory, offering ~2000 beam-hours
per year to the general community.

multiple (local) maxima, and its very high-dimensional parameter space. In this

methods like bi-clustering can be used to classify matrix elements, but these
methods make the overly-restrictive assumption that the class of each element

computational problem, `matrix tile analysis' (MTA), which consists of
decomposing a matrix into a set of non-overlapping tiles, each of which is
defined by a subset of usually nonadjacent rows and columns. MTA does not
require an algebra for combining tiles, but must search over discrete
combinations of tile assignments. Exact MTA is a computationally intractable
integer programming problem, but we describe an approximate iterative technique
and a computationally efficient sum-product relaxation of the integer program.

this issue remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the question of
how to schedule messages for asynchronous propagation so that a fixed point is
reached faster and more often. We first show that any reasonable asynchronous
BP converges to a unique fixed point under conditions similar to those that
guarantee convergence of synchronous BP. In addition, we show that the
convergence rate of a simple round-robin schedule is at least as good as that
of synchronous propagation. We then propose residual belief propagation (RBP),
a novel, easy-to-implement, asynchronous propagation algorithm that schedules
messages in an informed way, that pushes down a bound on the distance from the
fixed point. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of RBP over
state-of-the-art methods for a variety of challenging synthetic and real-life
problems: RBP converges significantly more often than other methods; and it
significantly reduces running time until convergence, even when other methods

in a continuous time. The mathematical framework of Continuous Time Markov
Processes provides the basic foundations for modeling such systems. Recently,
Nodelman et al introduced continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs), which
allow a compact representation of continuous-time processes over a factored
state space. In this paper, we introduce continuous time Markov networks
(CTMNs), an alternative representation language that represents a different
type of continuous-time dynamics. In many real life processes, such as
biological and chemical systems, the dynamics of the process can be naturally
described as an interplay between two forces - the tendency of each entity to
change its state, and the overall fitness or energy function of the entire
system. In our model, the first force is described by a continuous-time
proposal process that suggests possible local changes to the state of the
system at different rates. The second force is represented by a Markov network
that encodes the fitness, or desirability, of different states; a proposed
local change is then accepted with a probability that is a function of the
change in the fitness distribution. We show that the fitness distribution is
also the stationary distribution of the Markov process, so that this
representation provides a characterization of a temporal process whose
stationary distribution has a compact graphical representation. This allows us
to naturally capture a different type of structure in complex dynamical
processes, such as evolving biological sequences. We describe the semantics of
the representation, its basic properties, and how it compares to CTBNs. We also
provide algorithms for learning such models from data, and discuss its
applicability to biological sequence evolution.

of making only the Adjacency-Faithfulness assumption. We show that the familiar
PC algorithm has to be modified to be (asymptotically) correct under the
weaker, Adjacency-Faithfulness assumption. Roughly the modified algorithm,
called Conservative PC (CPC), checks whether Orientation-Faithfulness holds in
the orientation phase, and if not, avoids drawing certain causal conclusions
the PC algorithm would draw. However, if the stronger, standard causal
Faithfulness condition actually obtains, the CPC algorithm is shown to output
the same pattern as the PC algorithm does in the large sample limit. We also
present a simulation study showing that the CPC algorithm runs almost as fast

mix poorly over cluster labels. Among others issues, this can have the adverse

important due to its direct relation (with speed) to the shock the vehicle

advance of rough terrain. Estimating the second derivative is challenging due
to uncertainty. For example, at range, laser readings may be so sparse that
significant information about the surface is missing. Also, a high degree of
precision is required in projecting laser readings. This precision may be
unavailable due to latency or error in the pose estimation. We model these
sources of error as a multivariate polynomial. Its coefficients are learned
using the shock data as ground truth -- the accelerometers are used to train
the lasers. The resulting classifier operates on individual laser readings from
a road surface described by a 3D point cloud. The classifier identifies
sections of road where the second derivative is likely to be large. Thus, the
vehicle can slow down in advance, reducing the shock it experiences. The

The approximation is controlled by the gradient optimization of a small set of

of the SPGP is that this optimization space becomes impractically big for high
dimensional data sets. This paper addresses this limitation by performing
automatic dimensionality reduction. A projection of the input space to a low
dimensional space is learned in a supervised manner, alongside the
pseudo-inputs, which now live in this reduced space. The paper also
investigates the suitability of the SPGP for modeling data with input-dependent

traced by diffuse radio, X-ray and gamma-ray emission. The physical
relationship between different components of diffuse gas emitting at multiple
wavelengths is a focus of this work. We first present radio continuum
observations using Green Bank Telescope and model the nonthermal spectrum in
terms of a broken power-law distribution of GeV electrons emitting synchrotron
radiation. We show that the emission detected by Fermi is primarily due to
nonthermal bremsstrahlung produced by the population of synchrotron emitting
electrons in the GeV energy range interacting with neutral gas. The
extrapolation of the electron population measured from radio data to low and
high energies can also explain the origin of FeI 6.4 keV line and diffuse TeV
emission, as observed with Suzaku, XMM-Newton, Chandra and the H.E.S.S.
observatories. The inferred physical quantities from modeling multi-wavelength
emission in the context of bremsstrahlung emission from the inner 300x120
parsecs of the Galactic center are constrained to have the cosmic ray
ionization rate 1-10x10^{-15} s^-1, molecular gas heating rate elevating the
gas temperature to 75-200K, fractional ionization of molecular gas 10^{-6} to
10^{-5}, large scale magnetic field 10-20 micro Gauss, the density of diffuse
and dense molecular gas 100 and 10^3 cm^{-3} over 300pc and 50pc pathlengths,
and the variability of FeI Kalpha 6.4 keV line emission on yearly time scales.
Important implications of our study are that GeV electrons emitting in radio
can explain the GeV gamma-rays detected by Fermi and that the cosmic ray
irradiation model, like the model of the X-ray irradiation triggered by past
activity of Sgr A*, can also explain the origin of the variable 6.4 keV
emission from Galactic center molecular clouds.

microwave background (CMB) has pointed to possible new physics driving the
origin of density fluctuations in the early Universe and their evolution into
the large-scale structure we see today. In this paper, we focus our attention
on the possible absence of angular correlation in the CMB anisotropies at
angles larger than ~60 degrees, and consider whether this feature may be the
signature of fluctuations expected in the R_h=ct Universe. We calculate the CMB
angular correlation function for a fluctuation spectrum expected from growth in
a Universe whose dynamics is constrained by the equation-of-state p=-rho/3,
where p and rho are the total pressure and density, respectively. We find that,
though the disparity between the predictions of LCDM and the WMAP sky may be
due to cosmic variance, it may also be due to an absence of inflation. The
classic horizon problem does not exist in the R_h=ct Universe, so a period of
exponential growth was not necessary in this cosmology in order to account for
the general uniformity of the CMB (save for the aforementioned tiny
fluctuations of 1 part in 100,000 in the WMAP relic signal. We show that the
R_h=ct Universe without inflation can account for the apparent absence in CMB
angular correlation at angles > 60 degrees without invoking cosmic variance,
providing additional motivation for pursuing this cosmology as a viable
description of nature.

abelian topological semigroup and $X$ is a topological vector space. If $J$ is
a subsemigroup with non-empty interior of a locally compact abelian group $G$
and $G=J-J$, then every polynomial $p$ on $J$ extends uniquely to a polynomial
on $ G$. It is of particular interest to know when the spaces $P^n (J,X)$ of
polynomials of order at most $n$ are finite dimensional. For example we show
that for some semigroups the subspace $P^n_{R} (J,\mathbf{C})$ of Riss
polynomials (those generated by a finite number of homomorphisms $\alpha: J\to
\mathbf{R}$) is properly contained in $P^n (G,\mathbf{C})$. However, if $P^1
(J,\mathbf{C})$ is finite dimensional then $P^n_{R} (J,\mathbf{C})= P^n
(J,\mathbf{C})$. Finally we exhibit a large family of groups for which $P^n
(G,\mathbf{C})$ is finite dimensional.

first prove that if $I$ is a principal ideal then $H^j_I(M,N)$ is $I$-cofinite

that $\dim\Supp(H^j_I(M,N))\le 1 \text{for all} j<t.$ Then $H^j_I(M,N)$ is
$I$-cofinite for all $j<t$ and $\Hom(R/I,H^t_I(M,N))$ is finitely generated.
Finally, we show that if $\dim(M)\le 2$ or $\dim(N)\le 2$ then $H^j_I(M,N)$ is

indications, however, that the laws of physics and cosmological parameters need
not take the form and values observed, and if they were slightly different life
could not exist. A common approach to this fine tuning problem is to propose a
cosmos with an ensemble of domains, mostly inhospitable for life. A Bayesian
method is used to show that this hypothesis is more credible than a homogeneous
fine tuned universe. This conclusion is straightforward for a finite ensemble,
but can be extended to an infinite ensemble by applying a formulation of the
Principle of Mediocrity.
