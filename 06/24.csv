administrative boundary of the Greater London Authority, based on the evolution
of its street network during the last two centuries. This is done by employing
a unique dataset, consisting of the planar graph representation of nine time
slices of Greater London's road network spanning 224 years, from 1786 to 2010.
Within this time-frame, we address the concept of the metropolitan area or city
in physical terms, in that urban evolution reveals observable transitions in
the distribution of relevant geometrical properties. Given that London has a
hard boundary enforced by its long-standing green belt, we show that its street
network dynamics can be described as a fractal space-filling phenomena up to a
capacitated limit, whence its growth can be predicted with a striking level of
accuracy. This observation is confirmed by the analytical calculation of key
topological properties of the planar graph, such as the topological growth of
the network and its average connectivity. This study thus represents an example
of a strong violation of Gibrat's law. In particular, we are able to show
analytically how London evolves from a more loop-like structure, typical of
planned cities, toward a more tree-like structure, typical of self-organized
cities. These observations are relevant to the discourse on sustainable urban
planning with respect to the control of urban sprawl in many large cities,
which have developed under the conditions of spatial constraints imposed by
green belts and hard urban boundaries.

recurrent starbursts in forming less-massive galaxies to solve the core-cusp
problem. The gas, which is heated by supernova feedback after a starburst,
expands and the star formation then terminates. This expanding gas loses energy
by radiative cooling and then falls back toward the galactic center.
Subsequently, the starburst is enhanced again. This cycle of expansion and
contraction of the interstellar gas leads to a repetitive change in the
gravitational potential of the gas. The resonance between DM particles and the
density wave excited by the oscillating potential plays a key role in
understanding the physical mechanism of the cusp-core transition of DM halos.
DM halos effectively gain kinetic energy from the baryon potential through the
energy transfer driven by the resonance between the particles and density
waves. We determine that the critical condition for the cusp-core transition is
such that the oscillation period of the gas potential is approximately the same
as the local dynamical time of DM halos. We present the resultant core radius
of a DM halo after the cusp-core transition induced by the resonance by using
the conventional mass density profile predicted by the cold dark matter models.
Moreover, we verify the analytical model by using $N$-body simulations, and the
results validate the resonance model.

is to find the information source based on the snapshot and the network

infinite-trees, the estimator is a node that minimizes the maximum distance to

$gq>1,$ where $g$ is the node degree and $q$ is the infection probability, the
estimator is within a constant distance from the actual source with a high
probability, independent of the number of infected nodes and the time the

generalises being weakly compact and having separable range. In a comprehensive
study of the class of $\mathsf{WCG}$ operators, we prove that it forms a closed
surjective operator ideal and investigate its relations to other classical
operator ideals. By considering the $p$th long James space
$\mathcal{J}_p(\omega_1)$, we show how properties of the ideal of
$\mathsf{WCG}$ operators (such as being the unique maximal ideal) may be used
to derive results outside ideal theory. For instance, we identify the
$K_0$-group of $\mathscr{B}(\mathcal{J}_p(\omega_1))$ as the additive group of
integers.

transmitter communicates information to two single-antenna receivers, recent
work by Maddah-Ali and Tse has shown that perfect knowledge of delayed channel
state information at the transmitter (perfect delayed CSIT) can be useful, even
in the absence of any knowledge of current CSIT. Similar benefits of perfect
delayed CSIT were revealed in recent work by Kobayashi et al., Yang et al., and
Gou and Jafar, which extended the above to the case of perfect delayed CSIT and
imperfect current CSIT.
  The work here considers the general problem of communicating, over the
aforementioned broadcast channel, with imperfect delayed and imperfect current
CSIT, and reveals that even substantially degraded and imperfect delayed-CSIT
is in fact sufficient to achieve the aforementioned gains previously associated
to perfect delayed CSIT. The work proposes novel multi-phase broadcasting
schemes that properly utilize knowledge of imperfect delayed and imperfect
current CSIT, to match in many cases the optimal degrees-of-freedom (DoF)
region achieved with perfect delayed CSIT. In addition to the theoretical
limits and explicitly constructed precoders, the work applies towards gaining
practical insight as to when it is worth improving CSIT quality.

non-hydrodynamic mechanisms such as jet production may contribute to other
higher azimuth multipoles $v_m$ as biases. Careful distinctions should be
maintained between jet-related and nonjet (possibly hydrodynamic) contributions
to $v_m$ (e.g., ""nonflow"" and ""flow""). In this study we consider several
questions: (a) To what extent do jet-like structures in two-dimensional (2D)
angular correlations contribute to azimuth multipoles inferred from various
$v_m$ methods? (b) If a multipole element is added to a 2D fit model is a
nonzero amplitude indicative of a corresponding flow component? and (c) Can 2D
correlations establish the necessity of nonjet contributions to some or all
higher multipoles? Model fits to 2D angular correlations are used to establish
the origins of azimuth multipoles inferred from 1D projections onto azimuth or
from nongraphical numerical methods. We find that jet-like angular
correlations, and specifically a 2D peak at the angular origin consistent with
jet production, constitute the dominant contribution to inferred higher
multipoles, and the data do not {\em require} higher multipoles in isolation
from the jet-like 2D peak. Inference of ""higher harmonic flows"" results from
identifying certain nominally jet-like structure as flow manifestations through
unjustified application of 1D Fourier series analysis. Although the peak
structure at the angular origin is strongly modified in more-central collisions
some properties remain compatible with relevant pQCD theory expectations for
jet production.

in ageing effects, i.e. the age dependence of the dynamical properties of the

different gate voltage is not a ""history free"" logarithmic (lnt) process, but
departs from lnt in a way which encodes the system's age. The apparent
relaxation time distribution extracted from the observed relaxations is thus
not ""constant"" but evolves with time. We discuss what defines the age of the

on the commonly used ""two dip"" experimental protocol aimed at extracting
""characteristic times"" for the glassy systems (granular aluminum, doped indium

probably highly doped InOx where it provides a trivial value only determined by
the experimental protocol. But in cases where different values are obtained

the column density distributions derived from dust extinction, scattering, and
emission, and to determine to what extent the observations are consistent with
the standard dust models. From Herschel data, we calculate the column density
distribution that is compared to the corresponding data derived in the
near-infrared regime from the reddening of the background stars, and from the
surface brightness attributed to light scattering. We construct
three-dimensional radiative transfer models to describe the emission and the
scattering. The scattered light traces low column densities of A_V~1mag better
than the dust emission, remaining useful to A_V ~ 10-15 mag. Based on the
models, the extinction and the level of dust emission are surprisingly
consistent with a sub-millimetre dust emissivity typical of diffuse medium.
However, the intensity of the scattered light is very low at the centre of the
densest clump and this cannot be explained without a very low grain albedo.
Both the scattered light and dust emission indicate an anisotropic radiation
field. The modelling of the dust emission suggests that the radiation field
intensity is at least three times the value of the normal interstellar
radiation field. The inter-comparison between the extinction, light scattering,
and dust emission provides very stringent constraints on the cloud structure,
the illuminating radiation field, and the grain properties.

converges weakly in probability to a nontrivial limit measure. We prove that
these limit measures have no atoms and give bounds for the modulus of
continuity of the cumulative distribution of the measure. Using the earlier
work of Barral and Seuret (2007), we compute the multifractal spectrum of the
measures. We also extend the result of Benjamini and Schramm (2009), in which
the KPZ formula from quantum gravity is validated for the high temperature
cascade measures, to the critical and low temperature cases.

various systems computed using molecular dynamics simulation. In some cases,
unphysical results, for example, negative thermal conductivity, have been
found. Using GaN as an example case and the direct non-equilibrium method,
extensive molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo analysis of the
results have been carried out to quantify the uncertainty level of the
molecular dynamics methods and to identify the conditions that can yield
sufficiently accurate calculations of thermal conductivity. We found that the
errors of the calculations are mainly due to the statistical thermal
fluctuations. Extrapolating results to the limit of an infinite-size system
tend to magnify the errors and occasionally lead to unphysical results. The
error in bulk estimates can be reduced by performing longer time averages using
properly selected systems over a range of sample lengths. If the errors in the
conductivity estimates associated with each of the sample lengths are kept
below a certain threshold, the likelihood of obtaining unphysical bulk values
becomes insignificant. Using a Monte-Carlo approach developed here, we have
determined the probability distributions for the bulk thermal conductivities
obtained using the direct method. We also have observed a nonlinear effect that
can become a source of significant errors. For the extremely accurate results
presented here, we predict a [0001] GaN thermal conductivity of 185 $\rm{W/K

symmetric Type Ia Supernova in the post-explosion phase, enabling light curves
and spectra to be simulated in a physically self-consistent way.
  The commonly exploited radiative equilibrium, that is in essence a /gas
energy balance/ condition, is unsuitable for this purpose for important
physical and numerical reasons. Firstly, the RE depends on the heating and
cooling rates of the gas by the radiation field, two quantities that almost
completely cancel and are very difficult to calculate accurately. Secondly, the
internal energy of the gas is only a tiny fraction of the total energy in the
system (the vast majority of the energy resides in the radiation field), so
that the vast majority of the energy is neglected in solving for the energy
balance.
  The method presented in this paper, based on the /radiation energy balance/,
addresses the bulk of the energy, does not depend on the heating/cooling rates,
guarantees an accurate run of the bolometric luminosity over time while
bringing the gas temperatures into consistence with the radiation field.
  We have implemented the method in the stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX and
applied it to the classical W7 model. The results illustrate the importance of
each of the four physical contributions to the energy balance as a function of
time. The simulated spectra and light curves for W7 show good resemblance to
the observations, which demonstrates what can be done using PHOENIX with the
REB method.

i.e. 'Priority Queuing' and 'Weighted Fair Queuing' for packet identification
under Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP). The simulation results show
that WFQ has an edge over PQ in terms of queuing delays and jitters experienced

simulated and discussed to evaluate QoS deeper. In the end, it is also analyzed
how network's database service with applied Quality of Service may be affected

terms of a 'single-particle state', the so-called macroscopic wavefunction.
Since the discovery of Bose-condensed gases, an alternative theoretical picture
has been developed which is based on a 'coherent band' of classically occupied

this chapter is to review the differences between the Beliaev broken symmetry

elastically with their quantum numbers conserved and no other particles

dominate at high energies, elastic scattering contributes considerably (18-25%)
to the total cross section. Its share first decreases and then increases at
higher energies. Small-angle scattering prevails at all energies. Some
characteristic features are seen that provide informationon the geometrical
structure of the colliding particles and the relevant dynamical mechanisms. The
steep Gaussian peak at small angles is followed by the exponential (Orear)
regime with some shoulders and dips, and then by a power-law drop.
  Results from various theoretical approaches are compared with experimental
data. Phenomenological models claiming to describe this process are reviewed.
The unitarity condition predicts an exponential fall for the differential cross
section with an additional substructure to occur exactly between the low
momentum transfer diffraction cone and a power-law, hard parton scattering
regime under high momentum transfer. Data on the interference of the Coulomb
and nuclear parts of amplitudes at extremely small angles provide the value of
the real part of the forward scattering nuclear amplitude.
  The real part of the elastic scattering amplitude and the contribution of
inelastic processes to the imaginary part of this amplitude (the so-called
overlap function) at nonforward transferred momenta are also discussed.
Problems related to the scaling behavior of the differential cross section are
considered. The power-law regime at highest momentum transfer is briefly
described.

from the Doi-Onsager equation. As in the fluid dynamic limit of the Boltzmann
equation, we first make the Hilbert expansion for the solution of the
Doi-Onsager equation. The existence of the Hilbert expansion is connected to an
open question whether the energy of the Ericksen-Leslie equation is dissipated.
We show that the energy is dissipated for the Ericksen-Leslie equation derived
from the Doi-Onsager equation. The most difficult step is to prove a uniform
bound for the remainder in the Hilbert expansion. This question is connected to
the spectral stability of the linearized Doi-Onsager operator around a critical
point. By introducing two important auxiliary operators, the detailed spectral
information is obtained for the linearized operator around all critical points.
However, these are not enough to justify the small Deborah number limit for the
inhomogeneous Doi-Onsager equation, since the elastic stress in the velocity
equation is also strongly singular. For this, we need to establish a precise
lower bound for a bilinear form associated with the linearized operator. In the
bilinear form, the interactions between the part inside the kernel and the part
outside the kernel of the linearized operator are very complicated. We find a
coordinate transform and introduce a five dimensional space called the
Maier-Saupe space such that the interactions between two parts can been seen
explicitly by a delicate argument of completing the square. However, the lower
bound is very weak for the part inside the Maier-Saupe space. In order to apply
them to the error estimates, we have to analyze the structure of the singular
terms and introduce a suitable energy functional.

questions about the construct validity of these studies. Consequently, concerns
exist about the validity and reliability of their empirical findings. Some
scholars have acknowledged the problem and use a dyadic perspective. However, a

contributions and do not explain why there is a problem. Therefore, the purpose

open timelike curve (OTC), for which the only local effect is to increase the
time elapsed by a clock carried by the system. Remarkably, circuits with access
to OTCs are shown to violate Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, allowing
perfect state discrimination and perfect cloning of coherent states. The model
is extended to wave-packets and smoothly recovers standard quantum mechanics in
an appropriate physical limit. The analogy with general relativistic
time-dilation suggests that OTCs provide a novel alternative to existing

the FFLO instability in these systems can emerge at temperatures close to the

theorem to a holomorphic vector bundle E_{\infty}, which is isomorphic to the
associated graded object of the Harder-Narasimhan-Seshadri filtration of

of $d = 10$ 4-vector fields. A unique feature of this formulation is that the
action remains finite for the discontinuous fields (although continuity is
recovered on the equations of motion). This means that the spacetime can be
decomposed into the 4-simplices virtually not coinciding on their common faces,
that is, independent. This allows, in particular, to consider a surface as
consisting of a set of virtually independent elementary pieces (2-simplices).
Then the spectrum of surface area is the sum of the spectra of independent
elementary areas. We use connection representation of the Faddeev action for
the piecewise flat (simplicial) manifold earlier proposed in our work. The
spectrum of elementary areas is the spectrum of the field bilinears which are
canonically conjugate to the orthogonal connection matrices. We find that the
elementary area spectrum is proportional to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter
$\gamma$ in the Faddeev gravity and is similar to the spectrum of the angular
momentum in the space with the dimension $d - 2$. Knowing this spectrum allows
to estimate statistical black hole entropy. Requiring that this entropy
coincide with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy gives the equation, known in the
literature. This equation allows to estimate $\gamma$ for arbitrary $d$, in

studied by linear stability analysis, Lyapunov functions or lower and upper

equations with time dependent coefficients. It yields new results and is
applicable when the usual linearization method is not applicable.

  Modelling",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A adapted tensor-structured GMRES method for the TT format is proposed and
investigated. The Tensor Train (TT) approximation is a robust approach to
high-dimensional problems. One class of problems is solution of a linear
system. In this work we study the convergence of the GMRES method in the
presence of tensor approximations and provide relaxation techniques to improve
its performance. Several numerical examples are presented. The method is also
compared with a projection TT linear solver based on the ALS and DMRG methods.
On a particular sPDE (high-dimensional parametric) problem, these methods
manifest comparable performance, with a good preconditioner the TT-GMRES
overcomes the ALS solver.

of uncertain 2D discrete switched systems with state delays represented by a
model of Roesser type, where the switching instants of the controller
experience delays with respect to those of the system, and the parameter
uncertainties are assumed to be norm-bounded. A state feedback controller is
proposed to guarantee exponential stability for such 2D discrete switched
systems, and the dwell time approach is utilized for the stability analysis and
controller design. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

  More precisely, the method here described allows generating longitudinal
acoustic pressure fields, whose longitudinal intensity patterns can assume, in
principle, any desired shape within a freely chosen interval 0 < z < L of the
propagation axis, and that can be endowed in particular with a s t a t i c
envelope (within which only the carrier wave propagates). Indeed, it is here
demonstrated by computer evaluations that these very special beams of
non-attenuated ultrasonic field can be generated in water-like media by means
of annular transducers. Such fields ""at rest"" have been called by us <<
Acoustic Frozen Waves >> (FW).
  The paper presents various cases of FWs in water, and investigates their
aperture characteristics, such as minimum required size and ring dimensioning,
as well as the influence they have on the proper generation of the desired FW
patterns.
  The FWs are particular Localized Solutions to the wave equation that can be
used in many applications, like new kinds of devices, such as, e.g., acoustic
tweezers or scalpels, and especially various ultrasound medical apparatus; e.g.
for attempting the destruction of tumor cells without affecting the preceding

several, possibly conflicting, quantitative properties of a stochastic system.
It has useful applications in controller synthesis and compositional
probabilistic verification. However, existing methods are based on linear
programming, which limits the scale of systems that can be analysed and makes
verification of time-bounded properties very difficult. We present a novel
approach that addresses both of these shortcomings, based on the generation of
successive approximations of the Pareto curve for a multi-objective model
checking problem. We illustrate dramatic improvements in efficiency on a large
set of benchmarks and show how the ability to visualise Pareto curves
significantly enhances the quality of results obtained from current
probabilistic verification tools.

order to solve this problem, there is every reason to believe that we have to
start from the proposal of a worldview. Recently we proposed measurement theory
(i.e., quantum language, or the linguistic interpretation of quantum
mechanics), which is characterized as the linguistic turn of the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics. This turn from physics to language does
not only extend quantum theory to classical theory but also yield the quantum
mechanical world view (i.e., the (quantum) linguistic world view, and thus, a
form of quantum thinking, in other words, quantum philosophy). Thus, we believe
that the quantum lingistic formulation of statistics gives an answer to the
question: ""What is statistics?"". In this paper, this will be done through the
studies of inference interval, statistical hypothesis testing, Fisher maximum
likelihood method, Bayes method and regression analysis in meaurement theory.
