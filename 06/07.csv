  Version to be published in Phys. Rev. D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.86.074021",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we deal with the critical behavior of the bulk viscosity in the
linear sigma model (LSM) as an example of a system which can be treated by
using different techniques. Starting from the Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck
equation we compute the bulk viscosity over entropy density of the LSM in the
large-N limit. We search for a possible maximum of the bulk viscosity over
entropy density at the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition. The
information about this critical temperature, as well as the effective masses,
is obtained from the effective potential. We find that the expected maximum (as
a measure of the conformality loss) is absent in the large N in agreement with
other models in the same limit. However, this maximum appears when, instead of
the large-N limit, the Hartree approximation within the
Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism is used. Nevertheless, this last
approach to the LSM does not give rise to the Goldstone theorem and also
predicts a first order phase transition instead of the expected second order
one. Therefore both, the large-N limit and the CJT-Hartree approximations,
should be considered as complementary for the study of the critical behavior of
the bulk viscosity in the LSM.

experiences dephasing events by varying \textit{in situ} the cavity mode
population and decay rate. This allows us to verify a pure dephasing mechanism
that matches theoretical predictions, and in fact explains the increased
dephasing seen in recent transmon experiments as a function of cryostat
temperature. We investigate photon dynamics in this limit and observe large
increases in coherence times as the cavity is decoupled from the environment.

found from the ISMF direction that provides the best fit to the polarization
position angles of nearby stars, using weighted fits to the data. New
polarization observations are included in the analysis. The best-fitting ISMF
is close to the magnetic field direction traced by the center of the Ribbon of

PlanetPol data show that polarization increases with distance. It extends to
within 8 parsecs of the Sun and implies a weak curvature in the nearby ISMF.
Variations from the ordered component indicate turbulence of +/-23 deg. The
local ISMF is generally uniform in direction over spatial scales of 8-200
parsecs so that it appears similar to interarm magnetic fields. The
best-fitting ISMF direction also agrees with the position of tail-in spatial
asymmetries in GeV-TeV galactic cosmic rays. The peculiar geometrical relation
between the CMB dipole moment, the heliosphere nose, and local ISMF is
supported by these new results. Radiative torques are not likely to play a role

the largest entropy rate of a common random variable two parties observing one
of the sources each can agree upon. It is well-known that their common
information captures only a limited form of dependence between the random
variables and is zero in most cases of interest. Our generalization, which we
call the Assisted Common Information system, takes into account almost-common
information ignored by G\'acs-K\""orner common information. In the assisted
common information system, a genie assists the parties in agreeing on a more
substantial common random variable; we characterize the trade-off between the
amount of communication from the genie and the quality of the common random
variable produced using a rate region we call the region of tension.
  We show that this region has an application in deriving upperbounds on the
efficiency of secure two-party sampling, which is a special case of secure
multi-party computation, a central problem in modern cryptography. Two parties
desire to produce samples of a pair of jointly distributed random variables
such that neither party learns more about the other's output than what its own
output reveals. They have access to a set up - correlated random variables
whose distribution is different from the desired distribution - and noiseless
communication. We present an upperbound on the rate at which a given set up can
be used to produce samples from a desired distribution by showing a
monotonicity property for the region of tension: a protocol between two parties

tested using three criteria of which the agreement of dissipation values
estimated from the torque and from the volume dissipation rate turns out to be
most demanding. We evaluate the influence of Taylor vortex heights on the
torque for a stationary outer cylinder and select a value of the aspect ratio
of \Gamma=2, close to the torque maximum. The connection between the torque and
the transverse current J^\omega of azimuthal motion which can be computed from
the velocity field enables us to investigate the local transport resulting in
the torque. The typical spatial distribution of the individual convective and
viscous contributions to the local current is analysed for a turbulent flow
case. To characterise the turbulent statistics of the transport, PDF's of local
current fluctuations are compared to experimental wall shear stress
measurements. PDF's of instantaneous torques reveal a fluctuation enhancement
in the outer region for strong counter-rotation. Moreover, we find for
simulations realising the same shear Re_S>=2x10^4 the formation of a torque
maximum for moderate counter-rotation with angular velocities
\omega_o\approx-0.4\omega_i. In contrast, for Re_S<=4x10^3 the torque features
a maximum for a stationary outer cylinder. In addition, the effective torque
scaling exponent is shown to also depend on the mean rotation state. Finally,

exhibit a spin-crossover transition. In spite of the many efforts aimed at
assessing the performances of density functional theory for such systems, an
exchange-correlation functional able to account accurately for the energetic of
the various possible spin-states has not been identified yet. Here we
critically discuss the issues related to the theoretical description of this
class of molecules from first principles. In particular we present a comparison
between different density functionals for four ions, namely
[Fe(H$_2$O)$_6$]$^{2+}$, [Fe(NH$_3$)$_6$]$^{2+}$, [Fe(NCH)$_6$]$^{2+}$ and
[Fe(CO)$_6$]$^{2+}$. These are characterized by different ligand-field
splittings and ground state spin multiplicities. Since no experimental data are
available for the gas phase, the density functional theory results are
benchmarked against those obtained with diffusion Monte Carlo, one of the most
accurate methods available to compute ground state total energies of quantum
systems. On the one hand, we show that most of the functionals considered
provide a good description of the geometry and of the shape of the potential
energy surfaces. On the other hand, the same functionals fail badly in
predicting the energy differences between the various spin states. In the case
of [Fe(H$_2$O)$_6$]$^{2+}$, [Fe(NH$_3$)$_6$]$^{2+}$, [Fe(NCH)$_6$]$^{2+}$, this
failure is related to the drastic underestimation of the exchange energy.
Therefore quite accurate results can be achieved with hybrid functionals
including about 50% of Hartree-Fock exchange. In contrast, in the case of
[Fe(CO)$_6$]$^{2+}$, the failure is likely to be caused by the
multiconfigurational character of the ground state wave-function and no
suitable exchange and correlation functional has been identified.

consider acoustic waves of perfect barotropic gas as the zero-order solution
and derive the equation for the averaged flow of the first order. The used
small parameter of our asymptotic study is dimensionless inverse frequency, and
the leading term for a velocity field is chosen to be a purely oscillating
acoustic field. The employed mathematical approach combines the two-timing
method and the notion of a distinguished limit. The properties of commutators
are used to simplify calculations. The derived averaged equation is similar to
the original vorticity equation, where the Reynolds stresses has been
transformed to an additional advection with the drift velocity. Hence ADE can
be seen as a compressible version of the Craik-Leibovich equation. In
particular, ADE shows that if the averaged vorticity is absent in the initial
data, then it will always be equal to zero. This property confirms that the
acoustic streaming is of viscous nature. At the same time ADE can be useful for
the description of secondary motions which take place for `strong' acoustic

caused by efficient overshoot mixing, could be followed by a matter accretion
after 7Li depletion has ceased on MS thus restoring Li almost to the pristine

burn Li completely, but an accretion rate of the type 1e-8xe^{-t/3e6} Msun

process is required to produce similar final values in a range of different
stellar masses to explain the PopII Spite plateau. However, this framework
could explain why open cluster stars have lower Li abundances than the

for example they admit a unique invariant complex structure which gives rise to
unique invariant K\""ahler--Einstein metric. The most typical examples are the
compact isotropy irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces for which the Killing

non-isotropy irreducible spaces the classification of homogeneous Einstein

the Einstein equation for the two unexamined cases, namely the flag manifolds
$\E_8/\U(1)\times \SU(4)\times \SU(5)$ and $\E_8/\U(1)\times \SU(2)\times
\SU(3)\times \SU(5)$. In order to determine explicitly the Ricci tensors of an

conclude that any flag manifold $G/H$ with $b_{2}(M)=1$ admits a finite number

behind Laser ablation is that of inducing a sublimation of the NEO surface,
which produces a low thrust thereby slowly deviating the asteroid from its
initial Earth threatening trajectory. This work investigates the integrated
design of the Space-based Laser system and the deflection action generated by
laser ablation under uncertainty. The integrated design is formulated as a
multi-objective optimisation problem in which the deviation is maximised and
the total system mass is minimised. Both the model for the estimation of the
thrust produced by surface laser ablation and the spacecraft system model are
assumed to be affected by epistemic uncertainties (partial or complete lack of
knowledge). Evidence Theory is used to quantify these uncertainties and
introduce them in the optimisation process. The propagation of the trajectory
of the NEO under the laser-ablation action is performed with a novel approach
based on an approximated analytical solution of Gauss' Variational Equations.
An example of design of the deflection of asteroid Apophis with a swarm of

between groups differing both genetically and culturally. A sex-ratio allele is
expressed in the heterogametic sex only, so that assumptions of Fisher's
analysis do not apply. Sex-ratio evolution drives cultural evolution of a
group-associated trait governing mortality in the homogametic sex. The two-sex
dynamics under resource limitation induces a strong Allee effect that depends
on both sex ratio and cultural trait values. We describe the resulting
threshold, separating extinction from positive growth, as a function of female
and male densities. When initial conditions avoid extinction due to the Allee
effect, different sex ratios cannot coexist; in our model, greater female
allocation always invades and excludes a lesser allocation. But the culturally
transmitted trait interacts with the sex ratio to determine the ecological
consequences of successful invasion. The invading female allocation may permit
population persistence at self-regulated equilibrium. For this case, the
resident culture may be excluded, or may coexist with the invader culture. That
is, a single sex-ratio allele in females and a cultural dimorphism in male
mortality can persist; a low-mortality resident trait is maintained by
father-to-son cultural transmission. Otherwise, the successfully invading
female allocation excludes the resident allele and culture, and then drives the
population to extinction via a shortage of males. Finally, we show that the
results obtained under homogeneous mixing hold, with caveats, in a spatially
explicit model with local mating and diffusive dispersal in both sexes.

undetected by optical SN searches due to obscuration by large amounts of dust
in their host galaxies. This effect is especially important in luminous and
ultraluminous infrared galaxies, which are locally rare but dominate the star
formation at redshifts of z~1-2. We perform a detailed investigation of the SN
activity in the nearby luminous infrared galaxy Arp 299 and estimate that up to
83% of the SNe in Arp 299 and in similar galaxies in the local Universe are
missed by observations at optical wavelengths. For rest-frame optical surveys
we find the fraction of SNe missed due to high dust extinction to increase from
the average local value of ~19% to ~38% at z~1.2 and then stay roughly constant
up to z~2. It is therefore crucial to take into account the effects of
obscuration by dust when determining SN rates at high redshift and when
predicting the number of CCSNe detectable by future high-z surveys such as
LSST, JWST, and Euclid. For a sample of nearby CCSNe (distances 6-15 Mpc)
detected during the last 12 yr, we find a lower limit for the local CCSN rate
of 1.5 +0.4/-0.3 x 10^-4 yr^-1 Mpc^-3, consistent with that expected from the
star formation rate. Even closer, at distances less than ~6 Mpc, we find a
significant increase in the CCSN rate, indicating a local overdensity of star
formation caused by a small number of galaxies that have each hosted multiple
SNe.

that all five gas species likely originate from the same source regions on the

ice that survived long enough to be affected by radiation pressure and driven
in the anti-sunward direction. We detected the faint, sunward facing dust jet

the presence of dark matter substructures in galaxy clusters is predicted to
enhance the signal by 2-3 orders of magnitude over the contribution from the

The anisotropy power spectrum of the CFIRB captures the spatial distribution of

halos in the large-scale structure. Existing halo models of CFIRB anisotropy
power spectrum are either incomplete or lead to halo model parameters that are
inconsistent with the galaxy distribution selected at other wavelengths. Here
we present a conditional luminosity function approach to describe the far-IR
bright galaxies. We model the 250 um luminosity function and its evolution with
redshift and model-fit the CFIRB power spectrum at 250 um measured by the
Herschel Space Observatory. We introduce a redshift dependent duty-cycle
parameter so that we are able to estimate the typical duration of the dusty
star formation process in the dark matter halos as a function of redshifts. We
find the duty cycle of galaxies contributing to the far-IR background is 0.3 to
0.5 with a dusty star-formation phase lasting for \sim0.3-1.6 Gyrs. This result
confirms the general expectation that the far-IR background is dominated by
star-forming galaxies in an extended phases, not bright starbursts that are
driven by galaxy mergers and last \sim10-100 Myrs. The halo occupation number
for satellite galaxies has a power-law slope that is close to unity over 0<z<4.

histories of their host galaxies, and that star clusters can be used to trace
galaxy evolution -- an aim for which the Utrecht star cluster models were never
designed, but which they are well-capable of fulfilling. I review some of the
work in this direction, with a strong emphasis on the contributions from the

photometry shows a narrower-than-average B-band light curve for SN 2012cg,
though slightly overluminous at maximum brightness and with normal color
evolution (including some of the earliest SN Ia filtered photometry ever

allows one to distinguish the different parts of the background: the
unresolvable (which forms a stochastic background) and the resolvable. Several
estimations of the background are obtained, for different assumptions on the

different initial spin period distributions lead to very different results. For
one of the models, with slow initial spins, the detection of the background can
be rejected. However, other models do predict the detection of the background
by the future ground-based gravitational wave detector ET. A robust upper limit
for the background of rotating neutron stars is obtained; it does not exceed
the detection threshold of two cross-correlated Advanced LIGO interferometers.
If gravitars exist and constitute more than a few percent of the neutron star

by ET. Under the most reasonable assumptions on the parameters characterizing a
neutron star, the background is too faint. Previous papers have suggested
neutron star models in which large magnetic fields (like the ones that
characterize magnetars) induce big deformations in the star, which produce a
stronger emission of gravitational radiation. Considering the most optimistic
(in terms of the detection of gravitational waves) of these models, an upper
limit for the background produced by magnetars is obtained; it could be

However, there are two different ways of how information reaches a person in a

well as through the influence of external out-of-network sources, like the
mainstream media. While most present models of information adoption in networks
assume information only passes from a node to node via the edges of the

allows us to study this process in more detail. We present a model in which
information can reach a node via the links of the social network or through the
influence of external sources. We then develop an efficient model parameter
fitting technique and apply the model to the emergence of URL mentions in the
Twitter network. Using a complete one month trace of Twitter we study how

influences over time and describe how these influences affect the information

group techniques, we find that the surface fermionic modes either decouple from
the bulk fluctuations, or flow to a strongly coupled fixed point which remains

confined only to the surface and find that in several cases the critical point
is naturally supersymmetric. This allows a determination of critical exponents

Finally, we study the fate of gapless Majorana modes localized on point and

It has generally been assumed that the Universe was reionized by ultraviolet
photons from massive stars. However, it has been argued that X-ray photons
associated with the death of these stars would have contributed ~10% to the
total ionizations via several channels. The parameter space for a significant
component of cosmological reionization to be sourced by X-rays is limited by a
few observations. We revisit the unresolved soft X-ray background constraint
and show that it significantly limits the contribution to reionization from
several potential sources: X-rays from X-ray binaries, from Compton scattering
off supernovae-accelerated electrons, and from the annihilation of dark matter
particles. We discuss the additional limits on high-redshift X-ray production
from (1) z~3 measurements of metal absorption lines, (2) the consensus that
helium reionization was ending at z~3, and (3) measurements of the
intergalactic medium's thermal history. We show that observations of z~3 metal
lines allow little room for extra coeval X-ray emission from nonstandard
sources. In addition, we show that the late reionization of helium makes it
difficult to also ionize the hydrogen at z>6 with a single source population
(such as quasars) and that it likely requires the spectrum of ionizing
emissions to soften with increasing redshift. However, it is difficult to
constrain an X-ray contribution to reionization from the intergalactic
temperature history. We show that the gas would have been heated to a narrower
range of temperatures than is typically assumed at reionization, 2-3 x10^4 K.

how small $|\lambda-1|$ is. This is shown to be true also with the most general

to be consistent with observations, one needs either to find a mechanism to
restrict $\lambda$ precisely to $\lambda_{GR}=1$, or to consider $A$ and/or
$\varphi$ as parts of the 4-dimensional metric on which matter fields
propagate. In the latter, requiring that the line element be invariant not only
under the foliation-preserving diffeomorphism but also under the local U(1)
transformations, we propose the replacements, $N \rightarrow N - \upsilon(A -

consistent with solar system tests for both $\lambda=1$ and $\lambda\not=1$,

resolution simulations of structure formation in the LCDM model: the Aquarius
dark matter simulations of individual halos and the Millennium II simulation of
a large cosmological volume. To relate the simulations to observations of the
Milky Way we use two alternative models to populate dark halos with ""visible""
galaxies: a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and an abundance matching
technique. We find that the radial density profile of massive satellites
roughly follows that of the dark matter halo (unlike the distribution of dark
matter subhalos). Furthermore, our two galaxy formation models give results
consistent with the observed profile of the 11 classical satellites of the
Milky Way. Our simulations predict that larger, fainter samples of satellites
should still retain this profile at least up to samples of 100 satellites. The
angular distribution of the classical satellites of the Milky Way is known to
be highly anisotropic. Depending on the exact measure of flattening, 5--10 per
cent of satellite systems in our simulations are as flat as the Milky Way's and
this fraction does not change when we correct for possible obscuration of
satellites by the Galactic disk. A moderate flattening of satellite systems is
a general property of LCDM, best understood as the consequence of preferential
accretion along filaments of the cosmic web. Accretion of a single rich group
of satellites can enhance the flattening due to such anisotropic accretion. We
verify that a typical Milky Way-mass CDM halo does not acquire its 11 most
massive satellites from a small number of rich groups. Single--group accretion
becomes more likely for less massive satellites. Our model predictions should
be testable with forthcoming studies of satellite systems in other galaxies and
surveys of fainter satellites in the Milky Way.

to be put on the value of the tidal dissipation, constraints that will be

this leads to an unexpectedly low value of tidal dissipation. This
over-abundance of short period giant planets may be due to a continuing
resupply of longer period giant planets migrating into a shorter period pileup,
disrupting the presence of smaller planets along the way. Perhaps the

the evolution equation exhibits a behavior consistent with Tevatron CDF data:
the jet distribution vanishes in the small invariant-mass limit, and its peak
moves toward the high invariant-mass region with the jet energy. We also
construct an evolution equation for the energy profile of the light-quark and
gluon jets in the similar framework. The solution shows that the energy
accumulates faster within a light-quark jet cone than within a gluon jet cone.
The jet energy profile convoluted with hard scattering and parton distribution
functions matches well with the Tevatron CDF and the large-hadron-collider
(LHC) CMS data. Moreover, comparison with the CDF and CMS data implies that
jets with large (small) transverse momentum are mainly composed of the
light-quark (gluon) jets. At last, we discuss the application of the above

from the literature), we attempt to determine the structure of the
circumstellar material. We consider models including both circumstellar disks
and envelopes, and constrain the masses (and other structural parameters) of
each of these components. We show that the disk masses in our sample span a
range from <0.01 to >0.1 Msun. The disk masses for our sample are significantly
higher than for samples of more evolved Class II objects. Thus, Class I disk
masses probably provide a more accurate estimate of the initial mass budget for
star and planet formation. However, the disk masses determined here are lower
than required by theories of giant planet formation. The masses also appear too
low for gravitational instability, which could lead to high mass accretion
rates. Even in these Class I disks, substantial particle growth may have hidden
much of the disk mass in hard-to-see larger bodies.

luminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. Building
upon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous and

data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the \textit{Fermi Gamma-ray

the physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. We find further evidence for
quasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radio
continuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both to
quiescent galaxies of the Local Group and low-redshift starburst galaxies
(conservative $P$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical and
systematic uncertainties). The normalizations of these scaling relations
correspond to luminosity ratios of $\log(L_{0.1-100 \rm{GeV}}/L_{1.4 \rm{GHz}})

Using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,
the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts
$0<z<2.5$ above 0.1 GeV is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ ph

measured. Taking the derivative of the current-voltage curve yields the energy
distribution which is found to closely resemble the distribution of total

investigate the dependence of distribution shape and width on electrode
geometry and contaminant substances adsorbed from the atmosphere, in particular
to water and hydro-carbons. Emission efficiency increases initially during air
exposure before diminishing to zero on a timescale of several hours, whilst
subsequent annealing of the sample restores emissivity. A model fit function,
in good quantitative agreement with the measured data, is introduced which
accounts for the experiment-specific electrode geometry and an energy dependent
transmission coefficient. The impact of large patch potential fields from
contact potential drops between sample and sample holder is investigated. The
total quantum yield is split into bulk and surface contributions which are
tested for their sensitivity to light incidence angle and polarization. Our

3227, confirms previous reports that the broad H-alpha emission line flux is
time variable, decreasing by a modest ~ 11% between 1999 and 2000 in response
to a corresponding ~ 37% decrease in the underlying continuum. Modeling the gas
distribution responsible for the broad H-alpha, H-beta and H-gamma emission
lines favors a spherically symmetric inflow as opposed to a thin disk. Adopting
a central black hole mass of 7.6 x 10^{6} Msun, determined from prior
reverberation mapping, leads to the following dimensions for the size of the
region emitting the broad H-alpha line; an outer radius ~ 90 l.d and an inner
radius ~ 3 l.d. Thus, the previously determined reverberation size for the
broad line region (BLR) consistently coincides with the inner radius of a much
larger volume of ionized gas. However, the perceived size of the BLR is an
illusion, a consequence of the fact that the emitting region is ionization
bounded at the outer radius and diminished by Doppler broadening at the inner
radius. The actual dimensions of the inflow remain to be determined.
Nevertheless, the steady state mass inflow rate is estimated to be ~ 10^{-2}
Msun/yr which is sufficient to explain the X-ray luminosity of the AGN in terms
of radiatively inefficient accretion. Collectively, the results challenge many
preconceived notions concerning the nature of BLRs in active galactic nuclei.

with focus on network coverage. In contrast to the disk-based sensing model in
a traditional sensor network, the detection range of a bistatic radar depends
on the locations of both the radar transmitter and radar receiver, and is
characterized by Cassini ovals. Furthermore, in a network with multiple radar
transmitters and receivers, since any pair of transmitter and receiver can
potentially form a bistatic radar, the detection ranges of different bistatic
radars are coupled and the corresponding network coverage is intimately related
to the locations of all transmitters and receivers, making the optimal
deployment design highly non-trivial. Clearly, the detectability of an intruder
depends on the highest SNR received by all possible bistatic radars. We focus
on the worst-case intrusion detectability, i.e., the minimum possible
detectability along all possible intrusion paths. Although it is plausible to
deploy radars on a shortest line segment across the field, it is not always
optimal in general, which we illustrate via counter-examples. We then present a
sufficient condition on the field geometry for the optimality of shortest line
deployment to hold. Further, we quantify the local structure of detectability
corresponding to a given deployment order and spacings of radar transmitters
and receivers, building on which we characterize the optimal deployment to
maximize the worst-case intrusion detectability. Our results show that the
optimal deployment locations exhibit a balanced structure. We also develop a
polynomial-time approximation algorithm for characterizing the worse-case
intrusion path for any given locations of radars under random deployment.

gamma-ray observations of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), is seriously
challenging our understanding of how particles are accelerated at fast shocks.
The cosmic-ray (CR) spectra required to account for the observed phenomenology
are in fact as steep as $E^{-2.2}--E^{-2.4}$, i.e., steeper than the
test-particle prediction of first-order Fermi acceleration, and significantly
steeper than what expected in a more refined non-linear theory of diffusive
shock acceleration. By accounting for the dynamical back-reaction of the
non-thermal particles, such a theory in fact predicts that the more efficient
the particle acceleration, the flatter the CR spectrum. In this work we put
forward a self-consistent scenario in which the account for the magnetic field
amplification induced by CR streaming produces the conditions for reversing
such a trend, allowing --- at the same time --- for rather steep spectra and CR
acceleration efficiencies (about 20%) consistent with the hypothesis that SNRs
are the sources of Galactic CRs. In particular, we quantitatively work out the
details of instantaneous and cumulative CR spectra during the evolution of a
typical SNR, also stressing the implications of the observed levels of
magnetization on both the expected maximum energy and the predicted CR
acceleration efficiency. The latter naturally turns out to saturate around
10-30%, almost independently of the fraction of particles injected into the
acceleration process as long as this fraction is larger than about $10^{-4}$.

improvement in confusion noise which will not depend as strongly on position

containing zero, few, or many bright stellar sources. We are also able to
detect and track a source down to mK~18 through the least confused regions of
our field of view at a precision of ~200 microarcseconds along the baseline

GRAVITY will perform ~10 microarcsecond astrometry on a mK=16.3 source and ~200
microarcsecond astrometry on a mK=18.8 source in six hours of monitoring a
crowded field. Monitoring the orbits of several stars will provide the ability
to distinguish between multiple post-Newtonian orbital effects, including those

Minkowski spacetime is considered, in which the equations of motion are
required to be compatible with a nonlinear $\sigma $ model type length-fixing
constraint $H_{\mu \nu}^{2}=\pm M^{2}$ leading to spontaneous Lorentz
invariance violation, SLIV ($M$ is the proposed scale for SLIV). Allowing the
parameters in the Lagrangian to be adjusted so as to be consistent with this

in the weak field approximation, while some of the massless tensor Goldstone
modes appearing through SLIV are naturally collected in the physical graviton.
The underlying diffeomophism invariance emerges as a necessary condition for
the tensor field $H_{\mu \nu}$ not to be superfluously restricted in degrees of
freedom, apart from the constraint due to which the true vacuum in the theory
is chosen by SLIV. The emergent theory appears essentially nonlinear, when
expressed in terms of the pure Goldstone tensor modes and contains a plethora
of new Lorentz and $CPT$ violating couplings. However, these couplings do not
lead to physical Lorentz violation once this tensor field gravity is properly
extended to conventional general relativity.

into a xenon-filled plastic tube. The electrons emit radiation behind the
shock. This radiation from the shocked xenon preheats the unshocked xenon.
Photons traveling ahead of the shock will also interact with the plastic tube,
heat it, and in turn this can drive another shock off the wall into the xenon.

defined to be the total length of the smallest subtree of T with leaf-set Y .
In case k = 2, it is well-known that 2-dissimilarities arising in this way can
be characterized by the so-called ""4-point condition"". However, in case k > 2
Pachter and Speyer recently posed the following question: Given an arbitrary
k-dissimilarity, how do we test whether this map comes from a tree? In this
paper, we provide an answer to this question, showing that for k >= 3 a
k-dissimilarity on a set X arises from a tree if and only if its restriction to
every 2k-element subset of X arises from some tree, and that 2k is the least
possible subset size to ensure that this is the case. As a corollary, we show
that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm to determine when a
k-dissimilarity arises from a tree. We also give a 6-point condition for
determining when a 3-dissimilarity arises from a tree, that is similar to the
aforementioned 4-point condition.

older XMM-Newton observations from 2002--2003. Distributed over five months,
the RXTE observations were designed to search for long X-ray modulations over a
few months. These observations indeed suggest the presence of a long cycle with
P = 226 days and an amplitude of a factor of two. We also used X-ray light
curves constructed from XMM-Newton observations to characterize the lifetimes,
strengths, and interflare intervals of 1615 flare-like events in the light
curves. After accounting for false positive events, we infer the presence of
955 (2002-2003) and 386 (2007) events we identified as flares. Similarly, as a
control we measured the same attributes for an additional group of 541 events
in XMM-Newton light curves of gamma Cas, which after a similar correction
yielded 517 flares. We found that the flare properties of HD 110432 are mostly
similar to our control group. In both cases the distribution of flare strengths
are best fit with log-linear relations. Both the slopes of these distributions
and the flaring frequencies themselves exhibit modest fluctuations. We
discovered that some flares in the hard X-ray band of HD 110432 were weak or
unobserved in the soft band and vice versa. The light curves also occasionally
show rapid curve drop offs that are sustained for hours. We discuss the

will image $\sim$ 20,000 square degrees of sky in six filter bands every few
nights, bringing the final survey depth to $r\sim27.5$, with over 4 billion
well measured galaxies. To take full advantage of this unprecedented
statistical power, the systematic errors associated with weak lensing
measurements need to be controlled to a level similar to the statistical
errors.
  This work is the first attempt to quantitatively estimate the absolute level
and statistical properties of the systematic errors on weak lensing shear
measurements due to the most important physical effects in the LSST system via
high fidelity ray-tracing simulations. We identify and isolate the different
sources of algorithm-independent, \textit{additive} systematic errors on shear
measurements for LSST and predict their impact on the final cosmic shear
measurements using conventional weak lensing analysis techniques. We find that
the main source of the errors comes from an inability to adequately
characterise the atmospheric point spread function (PSF) due to its high
frequency spatial variation on angular scales smaller than $\sim10'$ in the
single short exposures, which propagates into a spurious shear correlation
function at the $10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}$ level on these scales. With the large
multi-epoch dataset that will be acquired by LSST, the stochastic errors
average out, bringing the final spurious shear correlation function to a level
very close to the statistical errors. Our results imply that the cosmological
constraints from LSST will not be severely limited by these
algorithm-independent, additive systematic effects.

  arXiv:0909.1066 by other authors",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a certain domain $\Omega$ in the Sierpinski gasket $\mathcal{SG}$ whose
boundary is a line segment, a complete description of the eigenvalues of the
Laplacian, with an exact count of dimensions of eigenspaces, under the
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions is presented. The method developed in
this paper is a weak version of the spectral decimation method due to Fukushima
and Shima, since for a lot of ""bad"" eigenvalues the spectral decimation method
can not be used directly. Let $\rho^0(x)$, $\rho^\Omega(x)$ be the eigenvalue
counting functions of the Laplacian associated to $\mathcal{SG}$ and $\Omega$
respectively. We prove a comparison between $\rho^0(x)$ and $\rho^\Omega(x)$
says that $ 0\leq \rho^{0}(x)-\rho^\Omega(x)\leq C x^{\log2/\log 5}\log x$ for
sufficiently large $x$ for some positive constant $C$. As a consequence,
$\rho^\Omega(x)=g(\log x)x^{\log 3/\log 5}+O(x^{\log2/\log5}\log x)$ as
$x\rightarrow\infty$, for some (right-continuous discontinuous) $\log
5$-periodic function $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with
$0<\inf_{\mathbb{R}}g<\sup_\mathbb{R}g<\infty$. Moreover, we explain that the
asymptotic expansion of $\rho^\Omega(x)$ should admit a second term of the
order $\log2/\log 5$, that becomes apparent from the experimental data. This is
very analogous to the conjectures of Weyl and Berry.

measure the cosmic shear signal from weak lensing to extreme accuracy. One
difficulty, however, is that with the short exposure time ($\simeq$15 seconds)
proposed, the spatial variation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) shapes may
be dominated by the atmosphere, in addition to optics errors. While optics
errors mainly cause the PSF to vary on angular scales similar or larger than a
single CCD sensor, the atmosphere generates stochastic structures on a wide
range of angular scales. It thus becomes a challenge to infer the multi-scale,
complex atmospheric PSF patterns by interpolating the sparsely sampled stars in
the field. In this paper we present a new method, PSFent, for interpolating the
PSF shape parameters, based on reconstructing underlying shape parameter maps
with a multi-scale maximum entropy algorithm. We demonstrate, using images from
the LSST Photon Simulator, the performance of our approach relative to a
5th-order polynomial fit (representing the current standard) and a simple
boxcar smoothing technique. Quantitatively, PSFent predicts more accurate PSF
models in all scenarios and the residual PSF errors are spatially less
correlated. This improvement in PSF interpolation leads to a factor of 3.5
lower systematic errors in the shear power spectrum on scales smaller than
$\sim13'$, compared to polynomial fitting. We estimate that with PSFent and for
stellar densities greater than $\simeq1/{\rm arcmin}^{2}$, the spurious shear
correlation from PSF interpolation, after combining a complete 10-year dataset
from LSST, is lower than the corresponding statistical uncertainties on the
cosmic shear power spectrum, even under a conservative scenario.

full consistency of the CR acceleration theory with the observations; direct
proof is impossible because of the orbit stochasticity of CR particles. Recent
observations of a number of galactic SNR strongly support the SNR-CR connection
in general and the Fermi mechanism of CR acceleration, in particular. However,
many SNR expand into weakly ionized dense gases, and so a significant revision
of the mechanism is required to fit the data. We argue that strong ion-neutral
collisions in the remnant surrounding lead to the steepening of the energy
spectrum of accelerated particles by \emph{exactly one power}. The spectral
break is caused by a partial evanescence of Alfven waves that confine particles
to the accelerator. The gamma-ray spectrum generated in collisions of the
accelerated protons with the ambient gas is also calculated. Using the recent
Fermi spacecraft observation of the SNR W44 as an example, we demonstrate that
the parent proton spectrum is a classical test particle power law $\propto
E^{-2}$, steepening to $E^{-3}$ at $E_{br}\approx7GeV$.

Heroux, Mark Hoemmen","Fault-tolerant linear solvers via selective reliability",,,,,"math.NA cs.DC cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy increasingly constrains modern computer hardware, yet protecting
computations and data against errors costs energy. This holds at all scales,
but especially for the largest parallel computers being built and planned
today. As processor counts continue to grow, the cost of ensuring reliability
consistently throughout an application will become unbearable. However, many
algorithms only need reliability for certain data and phases of computation.
This suggests an algorithm and system codesign approach. We show that if the
system lets applications apply reliability selectively, we can develop
algorithms that compute the right answer despite faults. These ""fault-tolerant""
iterative methods either converge eventually, at a rate that degrades
gracefully with increased fault rate, or return a clear failure indication in
the rare case that they cannot converge. Furthermore, they store most of their
data unreliably, and spend most of their time in unreliable mode.
  We demonstrate this for the specific case of detected but uncorrectable
memory faults, which we argue are representative of all kinds of faults. We
developed a cross-layer application / operating system framework that
intercepts and reports uncorrectable memory faults to the application, rather
than killing the application, as current operating systems do. The application
in turn can mark memory allocations as subject to such faults. Using this
framework, we wrote a fault-tolerant iterative linear solver using components
from the Trilinos solvers library. Our solver exploits hybrid parallelism (MPI
and threads). It performs just as well as other solvers if no faults occur, and
converges where other solvers do not in the presence of faults. We show
convergence results for representative test problems. Near-term future work
will include performance tests.

light curves for a large number of stars, searching for the signature of
planetary transits, and confirming planetary candidates with larger telescopes.
HATSouth employs 6 telescope units spread over 3 locations with large longitude
separation in the southern hemisphere (Las Campanas Observatory, Chile; HESS
site, Namibia; Siding Spring Observatory, Australia). Each of the HATSouth
units holds four 0.18m diameter f/2.8 focal ratio telescope tubes on a common
mount producing an 8.2x8.2 arcdeg field, imaged using four 4Kx4K CCD cameras
and Sloan r filters, to give a pixel scale of 3.7 arcsec/pixel. The HATSouth
network is capable of continuously monitoring 128 square arc-degrees. We

total of more than 1million science frames at 4 minute integration time, and
observing ~10.65 hours per day on average. We describe the scheme of our data
transfer and reduction from raw pixel images to trend-filtered light curves and
transiting planet candidates. Photometric precision reaches ~6 mmag at 4-minute
cadence for the brightest non-saturated stars at r~10.5. We present detailed

that the coherence peak on 1/T1T is completely suppressed due to large {\gamma}

compounds with Tc < 10 K, the coherence peak could appear for both pairing
states, since {\gamma} at Tc is quickly suppressed in proportion to Tc^2. By

satisfying the same constraints. It is then useful to require that there exists
a homogeneous average of this inhomogeneous process within the same model. This
leads to the definition of ""Lie Markov models"", which are precisely the class
of models where such an average exists. These models form Lie algebras and
hence concepts from Lie group theory are central to their derivation. In this
paper, we concentrate on applications to phylogenetics and nucleotide
evolution, and derive the complete hierarchy of Lie Markov models that respect
the grouping of nucleotides into purines and pyrimidines -- that is, models
with purine/pyrimidine symmetry. We also discuss how to handle the subtleties
of applying Lie group methods, most naturally defined over the complex field,
to the stochastic case of a Markov process, where parameter values are
restricted to be real and positive. In particular, we explore the geometric
embedding of the cone of stochastic rate matrices within the ambient space of
the associated complex Lie algebra.

dimensions, where the task is to estimate the support and values of several
(typically related) sparse vectors from a few noisy linear measurements. Our
algorithm is a ""forward-backward"" greedy procedure that -- uniquely -- operates
on two distinct classes of objects. In particular, we organize our target
sparse vectors as a matrix; our algorithm involves iterative addition and
removal of both (a) individual elements, and (b) entire rows (corresponding to
shared features), of the matrix.
  Analytically, we establish that our algorithm manages to recover the supports
(exactly) and values (approximately) of the sparse vectors, under assumptions
similar to existing approaches based on convex optimization. However, our
algorithm has a much smaller computational complexity. Perhaps most
interestingly, it is seen empirically to require visibly fewer samples. Ours
represents the first attempt to extend greedy algorithms to the class of models
that can only/best be represented by a combination of component structural
assumptions (sparse and group-sparse, in our case).

propose a model which attributes formation of streams to the process of the
electric current adjustment in the magnetosphere. A mismatch between the
magnetospheric current distribution and the current injected by the polar cap
accelerator gives rise to reverse plasma flows in the magnetosphere. The
reverse flow shields the electric field in the polar gap and thus shuts up the
plasma production process. I assume that a circulating system of streams is
formed such that the upward streams are produced in narrow gaps separated by
downward streams. The electric drift is small in this model because the
potential drop in narrow gaps is small. The gaps have to drift because by the
time a downward stream reaches the star surface and shields the electric field,
the corresponding gap has to shift. The transverse size of the streams is
determined by the condition that the potential drop in the gaps is sufficient
for the pair production. This yields the radius of the stream roughly 10% of
the polar cap radius, which makes it possible to fit in the observed
morphological features such as the ""carousel"" with 10-20 subbeams and the
system of the core - two nested cone beams.

background. Under the assumption that dark energy is described by the
cosmological constant, we show that the dynamical effects of dark energy are
strong in clusters like the Virgo cluster. Specifically, the key physical
parameters of the dark mater halos in clusters are determined by dark energy:
1) the halo cut-off radius is practically, if not exactly, equal to the
zero-gravity radius at which the dark matter gravity is balanced by the dark
energy antigravity; 2) the halo averaged density is equal to two densities of
dark energy; 3) the halo edge (cut-off) density is the dark energy density with
a numerical factor of the unity order slightly depending on the halo profile.
The cluster gravitational potential well in which the particles of the dark
halo (as well as galaxies and intracluster plasma) move is strongly affected by
dark energy: the maximum of the potential is located at the zero-gravity radius
of the cluster.

sample is defined using the K-band, 14.0<=K<=16.6, and SDSS i-band limits of
i=19.5, 19.7 and 22.0 over sky areas of 287, 150 and 196 deg^2, respectively.
The survey includes >3200 known quasars from the SDSS and more than 250
additional confirmed quasars from the KX-selection. A well-defined sub-sample
of quasars in the redshift interval 1.0<=z<=3.5 includes 1152 objects from the
SDSS and 172 additional KX-selected quasars. The quasar selection is >95 per
cent complete with respect to known SDSS quasars and >95 per cent efficient,
largely independent of redshift and i-band magnitude. The properties of the new
KX-selected quasars confirm the known redshift-dependent effectiveness of the
SDSS quasar selection and provide a sample of luminous quasars experiencing
intermediate levels of extinction by dust. The catalogue represents an
important step towards the assembly of a well-defined sample of luminous

0.05). Low field ac susceptibility and dc magnetization of YMn$_2$O$_5$ shows
multiple transition in analogy to those observed in electrical measurement of
the compound. Using various time dependent magnetization protocols it has been
observed that the behavior of spins in commensurate and incommensurate phase
are drastically different. YMn$_{1.95}$Cr$_{0.05}$O$_5$ undergoes a
ferrimagnetic ordering with an enhanced magnetic ordering temperature as
compared to the parent, which undergoes an antiferromagnetic ordering.
Appearance of spontaneous magnetization without any major change in the atomic
structure is rather significant since the parent compound is an important
multiferroic material. In addition, magnetic memory effect is observed in the
Cr substituted compound whereas it is absent in the parent compound.

resonances. Two-body planet-asteroid resonances are widely known, due to the
Kirkwood gaps. Besides, so-called three-body mean motion resonances exist, in
which an asteroid and two planets participate. Identification of asteroids in
three-body (namely, Jupiter-Saturn-asteroid) resonances was initially
accomplished by D.Nesvorny and A.Morbidelli (1998), who, by means of visual
analysis of the time behaviour of resonant arguments, found 255 asteroids to
reside in such resonances. We develop specialized algorithms and software for
massive automatic identification of asteroids in the three-body, as well as
two-body, resonances of arbitrary order, by means of automatic analysis of the
time behaviour of resonant arguments. In the computation of orbits, all
essential perturbations are taken into account. We integrate the asteroidal
orbits on the time interval of 100000 yr and identify main-belt asteroids in
the three-body Jupiter-Saturn-asteroid resonances up to the 6th order
inclusive, and in the two-body Jupiter-asteroid resonances up to the 9th order
inclusive, in the set of ~250000 objects from the ""Asteroids - Dynamic Site""

extrapolations for higher-order resonances, are determined. In particular, the
observed fraction of pure-resonant asteroids (those exhibiting resonant
libration on the whole interval of integration) in the three-body resonances up
to the 6th order inclusive is approximately 0.9% of the whole set; and, using a
higher-order extrapolation, the actual total fraction of pure-resonant
asteroids in the three-body resonances of all orders is estimated as
approximately 1.1% of the whole set.

been repeatedly reported in many fields of mathematics, like combinatorial
evaluations and discrete branching processes. It is precisely in the context of
branching processes with bounded off-spring that T. Harris, in 1948, first set
forth the possibility that the logarithm of the moment generating function of
the rescaled population size, in the super-critical regime, does not grow near
infinity as a power, but it has an oscillatory prefactor. These oscillations
have been observed numerically only much later and, while the origin is clearly
tied to the discrete character of the iteration, the amplitude size is not so
well understood. The purpose of this note is to reconsider the issue for
hierarchical models and in what is arguably the most elementary setting -- the
pinning model -- that actually just boils down to iteration of polynomial maps
(and, notably, quadratic maps). In this note we show that the oscillatory
critical amplitude for pinning models and the oscillating pre factor connected
to the Harris random variable coincide. Moreover we make explicit the link
between these oscillatory functions and the geometry of the Julia set of the
map, making thus rigorous and quantitative some ideas set forth by B. Derrida,
C. Itzykson and J. M. Luck (CMP 1984).

is crucial to take assembly/disassembly and maintenance operations in advance.
A well-designed system should enable relatively easy access of operating
manipulators in the constrained environment and reduce musculoskeletal disorder
risks for those manual handling operations. Trajectory planning comes up as an
important issue for those assembly and maintenance operations under a
constrained environment, since it determines the accessibility and the other
ergonomics issues, such as muscle effort and its related fatigue. In this
paper, a customer-oriented interactive approach is proposed to partially solve
ergonomic related issues encountered during the design stage under a
constrained system for the operator's convenience. Based on a single objective
optimization method, trajectory planning for different operators could be
generated automatically. Meanwhile, a motion capture based method assists the
operator to guide the trajectory planning interactively when either a local
minimum is encountered within the single objective optimization or the operator
prefers guiding the virtual human manually. Besides that, a physical engine is
integrated into this approach to provide physically realistic simulation in
real time manner, so that collision free path and related dynamic information
could be computed to determine further muscle fatigue and accessibility of a
product design

  Measurement Records",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Open Quantum Random Walks, as developed in \cite{APSS}, are a quantum
generalization of Markov chains on finite graphs or on lattices. These random
walks are typically quantum in their behavior, step by step, but they seem to
show up a rather classical asymptotic behavior, as opposed to the quantum
random walks usually considered in Quantum Information Theory (such as the
well-known Hadamard random walk). Typically, in the case of Open Quantum Random
Walks on lattices, their distribution seems to always converge to a Gaussian
distribution or a mixture of Gaussian distributions. In the case of nearest
neighbors homogeneous Open Quantum Random Walks on $\ZZ^d$ we prove such a
Central Limit Theorem, in the case where only one Gaussian distribution appears
in the limit. Through the quantum trajectory point of view on quantum master
equations, we transform the problem into studying a certain functional of a
Markov chain on $\ZZ^d$ times the Banach space of quantum states. The main
difficulty is that we know nothing about the invariant measures of this Markov
chain, even their existence. Surprisingly enough, we are able to produce a
Central Limit Theorem with explicit drift and explicit covariance matrix. The
interesting point which appears with our construction and result is that it
applies actually to a wider setup: it provides a Central Limit Theorem for the
sequence of recordings of the quantum trajectories associated to any completely
positive map. This is what we show and develop as an application of our result.
  In a second step we are able to extend our Central Limit Theorem to the case
of several asymptotic Gaussians, in the case where the operator coefficients of
the quantum walk are block-diagonal in a common basis.

theory to the finite depth domain. A depth-dependent wave growth rate is
derived from the dispersion relation of the wind/water interface. A suitable
dimensionless finite depth wave age parameter allows us to plot a family of
wave growth curves, each family member characterized by the water depth. Two
major results are that for small wave age, the wave growth rates are comparable
to those of deep water and for large wave age, a finite-depth wave-age-limited
growth is reached, with wave growth rates going to zero. The corresponding
limiting wave length and limiting phase speed are explicitely calculated in the
shallow and in the deep water cases. A qualitative agreement with well-known

the Internet. Due to their popularity, users apply them to a wide range of
search needs, from simple look-ups to rather complex information tasks. This
paper presents the results of a study to investigate the characteristics of
these complex information needs in the context of Web search engines. The aim
of the study is to find out more about (1) what makes complex search tasks
distinct from simple tasks and if it is possible to find simple measures for
describing their complexity, (2) if search success for a task can be predicted
by means of unique measures, and (3) if successful searchers show a different
behavior than unsuccessful ones. The study includes 60 people who carried out a
set of 12 search tasks with current commercial search engines. Their behavior
was logged with the Search-Logger tool. The results confirm that complex tasks
show significantly different characteristics than simple tasks. Yet it seems to
be difficult to distinguish successful from unsuccessful search behaviors. Good
searchers can be differentiated from bad searchers by means of measurable
parameters. The implications of these findings for search engine vendors are
discussed.

suspensions (fresh concrete, foodstuff, etc.). On the one hand, it is known
that they are stable at rest when the interstitial paste has a high enough
yield stress; on the other hand, it is not yet possible to predict if a given
material will remain homogeneous during a flow. Using MRI techniques, we study
the time evolution of the particle volume fraction during the flows in a
Couette geometry of model density-mismatched suspensions of noncolloidal
particles in yield stress fluids. We observe that shear induces sedimentation
of the particles in all systems, which are stable at rest. The sedimentation
velocity is observed to increase with increasing shear rate and particle
diameter, and to decrease with increasing yield stress of the interstitial
fluid. At low shear rate ('plastic regime'), we show that this phenomenon can
be modelled by considering that the interstitial fluid behaves like a viscous
fluid -- of viscosity equal to the apparent viscosity of the sheared fluid --
in the direction orthogonal to shear. The behavior at higher shear rates, when
viscous effects start to be important, is also discussed. We finally study the
dependence of the sedimentation velocity on the particle volume fraction, and
show that its modelling requires estimating the local shear rate in the

convergence of Krylov subspace methods for the solution of nonsingular linear
algebraic systems. Despite some formal similarity, the two techniques are
conceptually different from preconditioning. Deflation (in the sense the term
is used here) ""removes"" certain parts from the operator making it singular,
while augmentation adds a subspace to the Krylov subspace (often the one that
is generated by the singular operator); in contrast, preconditioning changes
the spectrum of the operator without making it singular. Deflation and
augmentation have been used in a variety of methods and settings. Typically,
deflation is combined with augmentation to compensate for the singularity of
the operator, but both techniques can be applied separately.
  We introduce a framework of Krylov subspace methods that satisfy a Galerkin
condition. It includes the families of orthogonal residual (OR) and minimal
residual (MR) methods. We show that in this framework augmentation can be
achieved either explicitly or, equivalently, implicitly by projecting the
residuals appropriately and correcting the approximate solutions in a final
step. We study conditions for a breakdown of the deflated methods, and we show
several possibilities to avoid such breakdowns for the deflated MINRES method.
Numerical experiments illustrate properties of different variants of deflated
MINRES analyzed in this paper.

Orion project. It has a photometric transit period of 0.448413 +- 0.000040
days, and appears in both 2009 and 2010 PTF data. Follow-up low-precision
radial velocity (RV) observations and adaptive optics imaging suggest that the
star is not an eclipsing binary, and that it is unlikely that a background
source is blended with the target and mimicking the observed transit. RV
observations with the Hobby-Eberly and Keck telescopes yield an RV that has the
same period as the photometric event, but is offset in phase from the transit
center by approximately -0.22 periods. The amplitude (half range) of the RV
variations is 2.4 km/s and is comparable with the expected RV amplitude that
stellar spots could induce. The RV curve is likely dominated by stellar spot
modulation and provides an upper limit to the projected companion mass of M_p
sin i_orb < 4.8 +- 1.2 M_Jup; when combined with the orbital inclination, i
orb, of the candidate planet from modeling of the transit light curve, we find
an upper limit on the mass of the planetary candidate of M_p < 5.5 +- 1.4

everything else (charged) through the electric field, which is short and long
range extending to boundaries of the system. Mathematics has recently been
developed to deal with interacting systems of this sort. The variational theory
of complex fluids has spawned the theory of liquid crystals. In my view, ionic
solutions should be viewed as complex fluids. In both biology and
electrochemistry ionic solutions are mixtures highly concentrated (~10M) where
they are most important, near electrodes, nucleic acids, enzymes, and ion
channels. Calcium is always involved in biological solutions because its
concentration in a particular location is the signal that controls many
biological functions. Such interacting systems are not simple fluids, and it is
no wonder that analysis of interactions, such as the Hofmeister series, rooted
in that tradition, has not succeeded as one would hope. We present a
variational treatment of hard spheres in a frictional dielectric. The theory
automatically extends to spatially nonuniform boundary conditions and the
nonequilibrium systems and flows they produce. The theory is unavoidably
self-consistent since differential equations are derived (not assumed) from
models of (Helmholtz free) energy and dissipation of the electrolyte. The
origin of the Hofmeister series is (in my view) an inverse problem that becomes
well posed when enough data from disjoint experimental traditions are
interpreted with a self-consistent theory.

  Our algorithm provides efficient maintenance and incurs a low overhead per

$O(\log n)$ messages are needed with high probability ($n$ is the number of

development does not necessarily imply the nuclear physics connection, such a
connection has proven qualitatively and quantitatively inspiring. In particular
to model protein evolution in terms of the alignment of quasispins displaying
twenty different projections, one for each of the twenty amino acids occurring
in nature, and the associated symmetry breaking in information (sequence)
space. Emergent properties of the corresponding phase transition are domain
walls which stabilize local elementary structures (LES), few groups of 10-20
aminoacids which become structured already in the denatured state provide the
molecular recognition directing protein folding. In fact, their docking is
closely related to the transition state of the process. While the two-step, yes
or no, folding process, does not provide direct information concerning LES, one
can force LES from virtual to become real, observable final state entities.
Getting again inspiration from the nuclear case (virtual processes contributing
to pair correlations can be forced to become real with the help of a probe
which itself changes particle number by two), one would expect that to make
real virtual LES, that is segments of the protein which already at an early
stage of the folding process flicker in and out of their native conformation,
one needs a probe which itself displays a similar behaviour. Peptides
displaying a sequence identical to LES are such probes.

system showed that as well as powering the hyper-luminous infrared emission of
the cluster-central galaxy, the QSO is associated with a double-lobed radio
source. However, the steep radio spectral index and misalignment between the
jets and ionised optical emission suggested that the orientation of the QSO had
recently changed. We use a combination of new, multi-band Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope observations and archival radio data to confirm that the jets are no
longer powered by the QSO, and estimate their age to be 120-160 Myr. This is in
agreement with the ~70-200 Myr age previously estimated for star-formation in
the galaxy. Previously unpublished Very Long Baseline Array data reveal a 200
pc scale double radio source in the galaxy core which is more closely aligned
with the current QSO axis and may represent a more recent period of jet
activity. These results suggest that the realignment of the QSO, the cessation
of jet activity, and the onset of rapid star-formation may have been caused by
a gas-rich galaxy merger. A Chandra X-ray observation confirms the presence of
cavities associated with the radio jets, and we estimate the energy required to
inflate them to be ~7.7x10^60 erg. The mechanical power of the jets is
sufficient to balance radiative cooling in the cluster, provided they are
efficiently coupled to the intra-cluster medium (ICM). We find no evidence of
direct radiative heating and conclude that the QSO either lacks the radiative
luminosity to heat the ICM, or that it requires longer than 100-200 Myr to
significantly impact its environment. [Abridged]

naturally induced by the random key predistribution scheme of Eschenauer and
Gligor for securing wireless sensor network (WSN) communications. Random key
graphs have received much interest recently, owing in part to their wide
applicability in various domains including recommender systems, social
networks, secure sensor networks, clustering and classification analysis, and
cryptanalysis to name a few. In this paper, we study connectivity properties of
random key graphs in the presence of unreliable links. Unreliability of the
edges are captured by independent Bernoulli random variables, rendering edges
of the graph to be on or off independently from each other. The resulting model
is an intersection of a random key graph and an Erdos-Renyi graph, and is
expected to be useful in capturing various real-world networks; e.g., with
secure WSN applications in mind, link unreliability can be attributed to harsh
environmental conditions severely impairing transmissions. We present
conditions on how to scale this model's parameters so that i) the minimum node
degree in the graph is at least k, and ii) the graph is k-connected, both with
high probability as the number of nodes becomes large. The results are given in
the form of zeroone laws with critical thresholds identified and shown to
coincide for both graph properties. These findings improve the previous results
by Rybarczyk on the k-connectivity of random key graphs (with reliable links),
as well as the zero-one laws by Yagan on the 1-connectivity of random key
graphs with unreliable links.

coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Some of these ejections are detected in the
solar wind as magnetic clouds (MCs) that have flux rope signatures. Magnetic
clouds are structures that typically expand in the inner heliosphere. We derive
the expansion properties of MCs in the outer heliosphere from one to five
astronomical units to compare them with those in the inner heliosphere. We
analyze MCs observed by the Ulysses spacecraft using insitu magnetic field and
plasma measurements. The MC boundaries are defined in the MC frame after
defining the MC axis with a minimum variance method applied only to the flux
rope structure. As in the inner heliosphere, a large fraction of the velocity
profile within MCs is close to a linear function of time. This is indicative
of} a self-similar expansion and a MC size that locally follows a power-law of
the solar distance with an exponent called zeta. We derive the value of zeta
from the insitu velocity data. We analyze separately the non-perturbed MCs
(cases showing a linear velocity profile almost for the full event), and
perturbed MCs (cases showing a strongly distorted velocity profile). We find
that non-perturbed MCs expand with a similar non-dimensional expansion rate
(zeta=1.05+-0.34), i.e. slightly faster than at the solar distance and in the
inner heliosphere (zeta=0.91+-0.23). The subset of perturbed MCs expands, as in
the inner heliosphere, at a significantly lower rate and with a larger
dispersion (zeta=0.28+-0.52) as expected from the temporal evolution found in
numerical simulations. This local measure of the expansion also agrees with the
distribution with distance of MC size,mean magnetic field, and plasma
parameters. The MCs interacting with a strong field region, e.g. another MC,
have the most variable expansion rate (ranging from compression to
over-expansion).

shell of varying thickness and different types (such as oxyhydroxide -CrOOH or
chromium oxide Cr2O3). For all the samples at low temperatures we found
non-metallic temperature dependence of resistivity and giant negative
magnetoresistance (MR). The maximum value of MR at low temperatures (T \approx
5 K) is \approx 37% in relatively small fields (0.5 T). At higher temperatures
there was a rapid decrease of MR (up to \approx 1% / T at T \approx 200 K). The
main objective of this work was studying the influence of properties and
thickness of the intergranular dielectric layers, as well as CrO2 particle
shape, on the magnitude of the tunneling resistance and MR of the pressed
powder. The new results obtained in this study include: (1) detection at low
temperatures in powders with needle-like particles a new type of MR hysteresis,
and nonmonotonic MR behaviour with increasing magnetic field (absolute value of
the MR at first grows rather rapidly with the field, and then begins
diminishing markedly, forming a maximum), and (2) detection of non-monotonic
temperature dependence, where - a field in which the resistance in a magnetic
field has a maximum, as well as finding discrepancies in values of and
coercivity fields, (3) detection of the anisotropy of MR, depending on the
relative orientation of the transport current and the magnetic field, (4) a new
method of synthesis, to regulate the thickness of dielectric coating.

degradation or transient failures or even crashes in long running software
systems such as web servers. It mainly occurs due to the deterioration of
operating system resource, fragmentation and numerical error accumulation. A
primitive method to fight against software aging is software rejuvenation.
Software rejuvenation is a proactive fault management technique aimed at
cleaning up the system internal state to prevent the occurrence of more severe
crash failures in the future. It involves occasionally stopping the running
software, cleaning its internal state and restarting it. An optimized schedule
for performing the software rejuvenation has to be derived in advance because a
long running application could not be put down now and then as it may lead to
waste of cost. This paper proposes a method to derive an accurate and optimized
schedule for rejuvenation of a web server (Apache) by using Radial Basis
Function (RBF) based Feed Forward Neural Network, a variant of Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN). Aging indicators are obtained through experimental setup
involving Apache web server and clients, which acts as input to the neural
network model. This method is better than existing ones because usage of RBF
leads to better accuracy and speed in convergence.

from the analysis of a very simple randomised procedure using the so-called
entropy compression method. We show that the expected running time of the
procedure is O(mn Delta^2 log Delta), where n and m are the number of vertices
and edges of G. Such a randomised procedure running in expected polynomial time
was only known to exist in the case where at least 16 Delta colors were
available. Our aim here is to make a pedagogic tutorial on how to use these
ideas to analyse a broad range of graph coloring problems. As an application,
also show that every graph with maximum degree Delta has a star coloring with 2
sqrt(2) Delta^{3/2} + Delta colors.

to dark matter with a suitable interaction in the universe described by brane
cosmology. Here DGP and the RSII brane models have been considered separately.
Dark energy in the form of Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin gas is considered. A
suitable interaction between dark energy and dark matter is considered in order
to at least alleviate (if not solve) the cosmic coincidence problem. The
dynamical system of equations is solved numerically and a stable scaling
solution is obtained. A significant attempt towards the solution of the cosmic
coincidence problem is taken. The statefinder parameters are also calculated to
classify the dark energy models. Graphs and phase diagrams are drawn to study
the variations of these parameters. It is also seen that the background
dynamics of Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin gas is consistent with the late cosmic
acceleration, but not without satisfying certain conditions. It has been shown
that the universe in both the models follows the power law form of expansion
around the critical point, which is consistent with the known results. Future
singularities were studied and our models were declared totally free from any
types of such singularities. Finally, some cosmographic parameters were also
briefly studied. Our investigation led to the fact that although GCCG with a
far lesser negative pressure compared to other DE models, can overcome the
relatively weaker gravity of RS II brane, with the help of the negative brane
tension, yet for the DGP brane model with much higher gravitation, the
incompetency of GCCG is exposed, and it cannot produce the accelerating
scenario until it reaches the phantom era.
