computation infrastructure with cloud services. Likewise, there is an increased
emphasis on performing analytics based on multiple datasets obtained from
different data sources. While ensuring security of data and computation
outsourced to a third party cloud is in itself challenging, supporting
analytics using data distributed across multiple, independent clouds is even
further from trivial. In this paper we present CloudMine, a cloud-based service
which allows multiple data owners to perform privacy-preserved computation over
the joint data using their clouds as delegates. CloudMine protects data privacy
with respect to semi-honest data owners and semi-honest clouds. It furthermore
ensures the privacy of the computation outputs from the curious clouds. It
allows data owners to reliably detect if their cloud delegates have been lazy
when carrying out the delegated computation. CloudMine can run as a centralized
service on a single cloud, or as a distributed service over multiple,
independent clouds. CloudMine supports a set of basic computations that can be
used to construct a variety of highly complex, distributed privacy-preserving
data analytics. We demonstrate how a simple instance of CloudMine (secure sum
service) is used to implement three classical data mining tasks
(classification, association rule mining and clustering) in a cloud
environment. We experiment with a prototype of the service, the results of
which suggest its practicality for supporting privacy-preserving data analytics
as a (multi) cloud-based service.

Osterwalder--Schrader on constructive quantum field theory and duality between
unitary representations of the euclidean motion group and the Poincare group.
  On the mathematical side this duality can be made precise as follows. If $\g$
is a Lie algebra with an involutive automorphism $\tau$. Decompose $\g = \fh
\oplus \fq = \ker(\tau - \1) \oplus \ker(\tau + \1)$ into $\tau$-eigenspaces
and let $\g^c := \fh \oplus i \fq$. At the core of the notion of reflection
positivity is the idea that this duality can sometimes be implemented on the
level of unitary representations. The idea is simple on the Lie algebra level:
Let $(\pi,\cH^0)$ be a representation of $\g$ where $\pi$ acts by
skew-symmetric operators. Assume that there exists a unitary operator $J$ of
order two such that $J \pi J = \pi\circ \tau$ and a $\g$-invariant subspace
$\cK^0$ which is {\it $J$-positive}. Then complex linear extension leads to a
representation of $\g^c$ on $\cK^0$ by operators which are skew-symmetric with
respect to $h_J$, so that we obtain a ""unitary"" representation of $\g^c$ on the
pre-Hilbert space $\cK_J^0 := \cK_J/{v \: \cK^0 \: h_J(v,v)=0}$.
  The aim of this article is twofold. First we discuss reflection positivity in
an abstract setting using {\it reflection positive distributions} on the Lie
group $G_\tau =G\rtimes {1,\tau}$ and {\it reflection positive distribution
vectors} of a unitary representation of $G_\tau$. Then we apply these ideas to
the conformal group $\OO_{1,n+1}^+(\R)$ of the sphere $\bS^n$ as well as the
the half-space picture mostly used in physics.

searching for the correct general statement of the Riemann Hypothesis (""RH"")
which appears implicit in their results. Recently, upon viewing the extension
$\C/\R$ in light of results derived for the Carlitz module, we were led to view
the RH as a statement about ramification which we explore in this short work.
We shall see that, combined with some ideas flowing from the proofs of Wan,
Poonen, and Sheats, this ramification idea has a good deal of explanatory power
in finite characteristic. Indeed, unramified extensions of nonarchimedean local
fields are cyclotomic in nature and this fits perfectly with the best possible
extension of the result of Wan and Sheats. The notion that the zeroes ""lie on a
line"" seems to be the beginning of the story in finite characteristic, and we
show how this fits with having the zeroes be unramified.

developing a self consistent scheme for an interacting tight binding model. The
presence of bulk carriers, in addition to surface electrons, generates an
intrinsic inhomogeneous charge density in the vicinity of the surface and, as a
result, band bending effects are present. We find that electron doping and hole
doping produce band bending effects of similar magnitude and opposite signs.
The presence of additional surface dopants breaks this approximate
electron-hole symmetry and dramatically affects the magnitude of the band
bending. Applying a gate potential can generate a depletion zone characterized
by a vanishing carrier density. We find that the density profile in the
transition zone between the depleted region and the bulk is independent of the
applied potential. In thin films the electrostatic effects are strongly
dependent on the carrier charge density. In addition, we find that substrate
induced potentials can generate a Rashba type spin-orbit coupling in ultra thin
topological insulator films. We calculate the profiles of bulk and surface
states in topological insulator films and identify the conditions corresponding
to both types of states being localized within the same region in space.

conditions on two static mirrors, one of them flat and the other gently curved.
We show that, for Dirichlet boundary conditions, the next to leading order term
in the Casimir energy is of quadratic order in derivatives, regardless of the
number of dimensions. Therefore it is local, and determined by a single
coefficient. We show that the same holds true, if $d \neq 2$, for a field which
satisfies Neumann conditions. When $d=2$, the next to leading order term
becomes nonlocal in coordinate space, a manifestation of the existence of a
gapless excitation (which do exist also for $d> 2$, but produce sub-leading
terms).
  We also consider a derivative expansion approach including thermal
fluctuations of the scalar field. We show that, for Dirichlet mirrors, the next
to leading order term in the free energy is also local for any temperature $T$.
Besides, it interpolates between the proper limits: when $T \to 0$ it tends to
the one we had calculated for the Casimir energy in $d$ dimensions, while for
$T \to \infty$ it corresponds to the one for a theory in $d-1$ dimensions,

mirrors in $d=3$, we find a nonlocal next to leading order term for any $T>0$.

However, fair sharing, a principle commonly adopted in current congestion
control protocols, is far from optimal for satisfying latency requirements.
  We propose Preemptive Distributed Quick (PDQ) flow scheduling, a protocol
designed to complete flows quickly and meet flow deadlines. PDQ enables flow
preemption to approximate a range of scheduling disciplines. For example, PDQ
can emulate a shortest job first algorithm to give priority to the short flows
by pausing the contending flows. PDQ borrows ideas from centralized scheduling
disciplines and implements them in a fully distributed manner, making it
scalable to today's data centers. Further, we develop a multipath version of
PDQ to exploit path diversity.
  Through extensive packet-level and flow-level simulation, we demonstrate that
PDQ significantly outperforms TCP, RCP and D3 in data center environments. We
further show that PDQ is stable, resilient to packet loss, and preserves nearly
all its performance gains even given inaccurate flow information.

not always easy to obtain an accurate estimation for high-dimensional MI. In
this paper, we propose an efficient method for feature extraction that is based

one network may lead to catastrophic consequences. Above a critical fraction of
interdependent nodes, even a single node failure can invoke cascading failures
that may abruptly fragment the system, while below this ""critical dependency""
(CD) a failure of few nodes leads only to small damage to the system. So far,
the research has been focused on interdependent random networks without space
limitations. However, many real systems, such as power grids and the Internet,
are not random but are spatially embedded. Here we analytically and numerically
analyze the stability of systems consisting of interdependent spatially

lattice systems, in contrast to non-embedded systems, there is no CD and
\textit{any} small fraction of interdependent nodes leads to an abrupt

limit, the Lee-Yang zeros approach to real numbers at the critical temperature.
However, the imaginary Lee-Yang zeros have not been regarded as experimentally
observable since they occur at imaginary field or temperature, which are
unphysical. Here we show that the coherence of a probe spin weakly coupled to a
many-body system presents zeros as a function of time that are one-to-one
mapped to the Lee-Yang zeros of the many-body system. In the thermodynamic
limit, of which the Lee-Yang zeros form a continuum, the probe spin coherence
presents a sudden death at the edge singularities of the Lee-Yang zeros. By
measuring the probe spin coherence, one can directly reconstruct the partition
function of a many-body system. These discoveries establish a profound relation
between two most fundamental quantities in the physical world, time and

the methyl / acetate or other groups bound to the modified residues the torsion
angles of the nearby histone chain are supposed to participate in the quantum
transition cooperatively. The transition rate W is calculated based on the
non-radiative quantum transition theory in adiabatic approximation. By using
W's the reaction equations can be written for histone modification and the
histone modification level can be calculable from the equations, which is
decided by not only the atomic group bound to the modified residue, but also
the nearby histone chain. The theory can explain the mechanism for the
correlation between a pair of chromatin markers observed in histone
modification. The temperature dependence and the coherence-length dependence of
histone modification are deduced. Several points for checking the proposed
theory and the quantum nature of histone modification are suggested as follows:
1, The relationship between lnW and 1/T is same as usual protein folding. The
non-Arhenius temperature dependence of the histone modification level is
predicted. 2, The variation of histone modification level through point
mutation of some residues on the chain is predicted since the mutation may
change the coherence-length of the system. 3, Multi-site modification obeys the
quantum superposition law and the comparison between multi-site transition and
single modification transition gives an additional clue to the testing of the
quantum nature of histone modification.

on space environment and climate. However, recent efforts to predict the
amplitude of the solar cycle have resulted in diverging forecasts with no
consensus. Yeates et al. (2008) have shown that the dynamical memory of the
solar dynamo mechanism governs predictability and this memory is different for
advection- and diffusion-dominated solar convection zones. By utilizing
stochastically forced, kinematic dynamo simulations, we demonstrate that the
inclusion of downward turbulent pumping of magnetic flux reduces the memory of
both advection- and diffusion-dominated solar dynamos to only one cycle;
stronger pumping degrades this memory further. Thus, our results reconcile the
diverging dynamo-model-based forecasts for the amplitude of solar cycle 24. We
conclude that reliable predictions for the maximum of solar activity can be
made only at the preceding minimum--allowing about 5 years of advance planning
for space weather. For more accurate predictions, sequential data assimilation
would be necessary in forecasting models to account for the Sun's short memory.

The AGN is the brightest source in the central regions up to lambda~24micron,

combination of the quantum normalization of RGWs when they are produced and the
CMB observations, we obtain the relation between the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$
and the inflation index $\beta$ for a given scalar spectral index $n_s$. As a
comparison, the diagram $r-\beta$ in the slow-roll inflation model is also
given. Thus, the observational limits of $r$ from CMB lead to the constraints
on the value of $\beta$. Then, we illustrate the energy density spectrum of
RGWs with the quantum normalization for different values of $r$ and the
corresponding $\beta$. For comparison, the energy density spectra of RGWs with
parameters based on slow-roll inflation are also discussed. We find that the
values of $n_s$ affect the spectra of RGWs sensitively in the very high

height are often used to model the solar atmosphere, at least out to several
solar radii. A common example involves uniform vertical or inclined magnetic
field in an isothermal atmosphere, for which the Alfv\'en speed is exponential.
We address the issue of internal reflection in such atmospheres, both for
time-harmonic and for transient waves. It is found that a mathematical boundary
condition may be devised that corresponds to perfect absorption at infinity,
and, using this, that many atmospheres where a(x) is analytic and unbounded
present no internal reflection of harmonic Alfv\'en waves. However, except for
certain special cases, such solutions are accompanied by a wake, which may be
thought of as a kind of reflection. For the initial-value problem where a
harmonic source is suddenly switched on (and optionally off), there is also an
associated transient that normally decays with time as O(t-1) or O(t-1 ln t),
depending on the phase of the driver. Unlike the steady-state harmonic
solutions, the transient does reflect weakly. Alfv\'en waves in the solar
corona driven by a finite-duration train of p-modes are expected to leave such
transients.

Our data set has a spatial dynamic range (the ratio of linear map size to the
pixel size) of about 1000 and spectrally resolved velocity information, which
together allow a systematic examination of the distribution and dynamic state
of $^{13}$CO cores in a large contiguous region. We use empirical fit to the CO
and CO$_2$ ice to correct for depletion of gas-phase CO. The $^{13}$CO core
mass function ($^{13}$CO CMF) can be fitted better with a log-normal function
than with a power law function. We also extract cores and calculate the
$^{13}$CO CMF based on the integrated intensity of $^{13}$CO and the CMF from
2MASS. We demonstrate that there exists core blending, i.e.\ combined
structures that are incoherent in velocity but continuous in column density.
  The core velocity dispersion (CVD), which is the variance of the core
velocity difference $\delta v$, exhibits a power-law behavior as a function of
the apparent separation $L$:\ CVD (km/s) $\propto L ({\rm pc})^{0.7}$. This is
similar to Larson's law for the velocity dispersion of the gas. The peak
velocities of $^{13}$CO cores do not deviate from the centroid velocities of
the ambient $^{12}$CO gas by more than half of the line width. The low velocity
dispersion among cores, the close similarity between CVD and Larson's law, and
the small separation between core centroid velocities and the ambient gas all
suggest that molecular cores condense out of the diffuse gas without additional
energy from star formation or significant impact from converging flows.

theory often yields an asymptotic series and the subsequent numerical outcome
becomes uncertain. To tackle such kind of problems, we develop a general
solution scheme based on a new energy dissection idea. Instead of dividing the
potential energy into ""unperturbed"" and ""perturbed"" terms, a partition of the
kinetic energy is performed. By distributing the kinetic energy term in part
into each individual potential, the Hamiltonian can be expressed as the sum of
the subsystem Hamiltonians with respective competing potentials. The total
wavefunction is expanded by using a linear combination of the basis sets of
respective subsystem Hamiltonians. We first illustrate the solution procedure
using a simple system consisting of a particle under the action of double
delta-function potentials. Next, this method is applied to the prototype
systems of a charged harmonic oscillator in strong magnetic field and the
hydrogen molecule ion. Compared with the usual perturbation approach, this new
scheme converges much faster to the exact solutions for both eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions. When properly extended, this new solution scheme can be very
useful for dealing with strongly coupling quantum systems.

Indeed, these events are dominant by many orders of magnitude, and about 40%
are of diffractive origin; that is, due to elastic scattering or proton
dissociation. Moreover, soft interactions unavoidably give an underlying
component to the rare `hard' events, from which we hope to extract new physics.
Here, we discuss how to quantify this contamination. First we present a brief
introduction to diffraction. We emphasize the different treatment required for
proton dissociation into low- and high-mass systems; the former requiring a
multichannel eikonal approach, and the latter the computation of triple-Pomeron
diagrams with multi-Pomeron corrections. Then we give an overview of the
Pomeron, and explain how the QCD (BFKL-type) Pomeron is the natural object to
continue from the `hard' to the `soft' domain. In this way we can obtain a
partonic description of soft interactions. We introduce the so-called KMR
model, based on this partonic approach, which includes absorptive multi-Pomeron
corrections that become increasingly important as we proceed further into the
soft domain. This model is able to describe total, elastic and proton
dissociation data, and to predict the survival probability of large rapidity
gaps to soft rescattering --- in terms of a few physically-motivated
parameters. However, more differential phenomena, such as single particle p_t
distributions, can only be satisfactorily described if hadronization effects
are included. This is achieved by incorporating the KMR analytic approach into
the SHERPA Monte Carlo framework. It allows a description of soft physics and
diffraction, together with jet physics, in a coherent, self-consistent way. We
outline the structure, and show a few results, of this Monte Carlo, which we
call SHRiMPS, for reasons which will become clear.

of wireless sensor networks (WSN), where energy efficiency is a crucial concern
due to the constrained nature of the transmission devices. Often, the common
thinking among researchers and implementers is that compression is always a
good choice, because the major source of energy consumption in a sensor node
comes from the transmission of the data. Lossy compression is deemed a viable
solution as the imperfect reconstruction of the signal is often acceptable in
WSN. In this paper, we thoroughly review a number of lossy compression methods
from the literature, and analyze their performance in terms of compression
efficiency, computational complexity and energy consumption. We consider two
different scenarios, namely, wireless and underwater communications, and show
that signal compression may or may not help in the reduction of the overall
energy consumption, depending on factors such as the compression algorithm, the
signal statistics and the hardware characteristics, i.e., micro-controller and
transmission technology. The lesson that we have learned, is that signal
compression may in fact provide some energy savings. However, its usage should
be carefully evaluated, as in quite a few cases processing and transmission
costs are of the same order of magnitude, whereas, in some other cases, the
former may even dominate the latter. In this paper, we show quantitative
comparisons to assess these tradeoffs in the above mentioned scenarios.
Finally, we provide formulas, obtained through numerical fittings, to gauge
computational complexity, overall energy consumption and signal representation
accuracy for the best performing algorithms as a function of the most relevant
system parameters.

more vulnerable to transient faults. To detect transient faults, previous
core-level schemes provide redundancy for each core separately. As a result,
they may leave transient faults in the uncore parts, which consume over 50%
area of a modern CMP, escaped from detection. This paper proposes RepTFD, the
first core-level transient fault detection scheme with 100% coverage. Instead
of providing redundancy for each core separately, RepTFD provides redundancy
for a group of cores as a whole. To be specific, it replays the execution of
the checked group of cores on a redundant group of cores. Through comparing the
execution results between the two groups of cores, all malignant transient
faults can be caught. Moreover, RepTFD adopts a novel pending period based
record-replay approach, which can greatly reduce the number of execution orders
that need to be enforced in the replay-run. Hence, RepTFD brings only 4.76%
performance overhead in comparison to the normal execution without
fault-tolerance according to our experiments on the RTL design of an industrial
CMP named Godson-3. In addition, RepTFD only consumes about 0.83% area of
Godson-3, while needing only trivial modifications to existing components of

ratios are lower than unity in the central part of BN/KL. Furthermore, the HDO
3(1,2)-2(2,1) line at 225.9 GHz was detected and its emission distribution
shows a shift of a few arcseconds with respect to the deuterated methanol

optical maximum. The X-ray spectrum at that time, obtained with the RGS of
XMM-Newton, shows deep, blue-shifted absorption by ions of a wide range of
ionization. We show that the deep absorption lines of the X-ray spectrum at
maximum, and nine days later, are well described by the following
phenomenological model with emission from a central blackbody and from a
collisionally ionized plasma (CIE). The blackbody spectrum (BB) is absorbed by
three main highly-ionized expanding shells; the CIE and BB are absorbed by cold
circumstellar and interstellar matter that includes dust. The outflow density
does not decrease monotonically with distance. The abundances of the shells
indicate that they were ejected from an O-Ne white dwarf. We show that the
variations on time scales of hours in the X-ray spectrum are caused by a
combination of variation in the central source and in the column density of the
ionized shells. Our phenomenological model gives the best description so far of
the supersoft X-ray spectrum of nova V2491 Cyg, but underpredicts, by a large
factor, the optical and ultraviolet flux. The X-ray part of the spectrum must
originate from a very different layer in the expanding envelope, presumably
much closer to the white dwarf than the layers responsible for the
optical/ultraviolet spectrum. This is confirmed by absence of any correlation
between the X-ray and UV/optical observed fluxes.

a sample of 95 CMEs in comparison with associated flares and filament
eruptions. We found that CMEs associated with flares reveal on average
significantly higher peak accelerations and lower acceleration phase durations,
initiation heights and heights, at which they reach their peak velocities and
peak accelerations. This means that CMEs that are associated with flares are
characterized by higher and more impulsive accelerations and originate from
lower in the corona where the magnetic field is stronger. For CMEs that are
associated with filament eruptions we found only for the CME peak acceleration
significantly lower values than for events which were not associated with
filament eruptions. The flare rise time was found to be positively correlated
with the CME acceleration duration, and negatively correlated with the CME peak
acceleration. For the majority of the events the CME acceleration starts before
the flare onset (for 75% of the events) and the CME accleration ends after the
SXR peak time (for 77% of the events). In ~60% of the events, the time
difference between the peak time of the flare SXR flux derivative and the peak
time of the CME acceleration is smaller than \pm5 min, which hints at a
feedback relationship between the CME acceleration and the energy release in
the associated flare due to magnetic reconnection.

low dimensional systems) has recently become apparent. Several attempts to
tackle this problem have been made and all focus on either the controllability
or synchronisability of the network --- usually analyzed by way of the master
stability function, or the graph Laplacian. We take a different approach. Using
the basic tools from dynamical systems theory we show that the dynamical
stability of a network can easily be defined in terms of the eigenvalues of an
homologue of the network adjacency matrix. This allows us to compute the
stability of a network (a quantity derived from the eigenspectrum of the
adjacency matrix). Numerical experiments show that this quantity is very
closely related too, and can even be predicted from, the standard structural
network properties. Following from this we show that the stability of large
network systems can be understood via an analytic study of the eigenvalues of
their fixed points --- even for a very large number of fixed points.

quadratic kernel is diagonal. The calibration of these models on US stock
returns reveals several unexpected features. The off-diagonal (non ARCH)
coefficients of the quadratic kernel are found to be highly significant both
In-Sample and Out-of-Sample, but all these coefficients turn out to be one
order of magnitude smaller than the diagonal elements. This confirms that daily
returns play a special role in the volatility feedback mechanism, as postulated
by ARCH models. The feedback kernel exhibits a surprisingly complex structure,
incompatible with models proposed so far in the literature. Its spectral
properties suggest the existence of volatility-neutral patterns of past
returns. The diagonal part of the quadratic kernel is found to decay as a
power-law of the lag, in line with the long-memory of volatility. Finally,
QARCH models suggest some violations of Time Reversal Symmetry in financial
time series, which are indeed observed empirically, although of much smaller
amplitude than predicted. We speculate that a faithful volatility model should
include both ARCH feedback effects and a stochastic component.

the Gaussian distributions related to avoided crossings of different levels may
overlap. Here, new effects arise, especially from the imaginary part of the
coupling term via the environment. The results show, moreover, the influence of
symmetries onto the multi-level avoided crossing phenomenon.

short-period planets, they are ideal for verifying these results. To determine
the frequency of planets as a function of stellar mass, we also have to
characterize the sample of stars that was observed. We study the stellar
content of the CoRoT-fields IRa01, LRa01 (=LRa06), and LRa02 by determining the
spectral types of 11466 stars. We used spectra obtained with the multi-object
spectrograph AAOmega and derived the spectral types by using template spectra
with well-known parameters. We find that 34.8+/-0.7% of the stars observed by
CoRoT in these fields are F-dwarfs, 15.1+/-0.5% G-dwarfs, and 5.0+/-0.3%
K-dwarfs. We conclude that the apparent lack of exoplanets of K- and M-stars is
explained by the relatively small number of these stars in the observed sample.
We also show that the apparently large number of planets orbiting F-stars is
similarly explained by the large number of such stars in these fields. Our
study also shows that the difference between the sample of stars that CoRoT
observes and a sample of randomly selected stars is relatively small, and that
the yield of CoRoT specifically is the detection one hot Jupiter amongst
2100+/-700 stars. We conclude that transit search programs can be used to study

have double-peaked narrow [O III] optical emission lines. Based on the analysis
of the optical spectrum, Peng et al. (2011) suggested that this object harbours
a dual active galactic nucleus (AGN) system, with two supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) separated on the kpc scale. SMBH pairs should be ubiquitous according
to hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios in which the host galaxies and their
central black holes grow together via interactions and eventual mergers. Yet
the number of presently-confirmed dual SMBHs on kpc or smaller scales remains
small. A possible way to obtain direct observational evidence for duality is to
conduct high-resolution radio interferometric measurements, provided that both
AGN are in an evolutionary phase when some activity is going on in the radio.
We used the technique of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to image SDSS
J1425+3231. Observations made with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 GHz
and 5 GHz frequencies in 2011 revealed compact radio emission at sub-mJy flux
density levels from two components with a projected linear separation of
\sim2.6 kpc. These two components support the possibility of a dual AGN system.
The weaker component remained undetected at 5 GHz, due to its steep radio
spectrum. Further study will be necessary to securely rule out a jet--shock
interpretation of the less dominant compact radio source. Assuming the dual AGN
interpretation, we discuss black hole masses, luminosities, and accretion rates
of the two components, using available X-ray, optical, and radio data. While
high-resolution radio interferometric imaging is not an efficient technique to
search blindly for dual AGN, it is an invaluable tool to confirm the existence
of selected candidates.

critical mass at which the single ring current doesn't depend on the flux. In
lower mass regime the total current spectrum shows plateaus at different height
which appears periodically. The susceptibility as well shows periodic nature
with amplitude depending on particle mass. As we move from higher mass to lower
mass regime, we find that the system turns into paramagnetic from diamagnetic.
We also show that same behaviour is observed if one vary the radius of the ring

smaller one will be paramagnetic. Finally we propose an experiment to verify

a model for the quantum TLS where we can adjust the temperature of its
environment, and the decoherence rate independently. The model has a
well-defined classical limit at any temperature and this corresponds to the
appropriate random telegraph process, which is symmetric at high temperatures
and becomes asymmetric at low temperatures. We find that the difference in the
qubit decoherence rates predicted by the two models depends on the ratio
between the qubit-TLS coupling and the decoherence rate in the pointer basis of
the TLS. This is then the relevant parameter which determines whether the TLS
has to be treated quantum mechanically or can be replaced by a classical
telegraph process. We also compare the mutual information between the qubit and
the TLS in the classical and quantum cases.

component of the stellar magnetic field and the accretion disk, the star's
rotation rate is roughly of the order of the Keplerean rotation rate at the
inner boundary of the disk, estimated as the conventional Alfven radius. A
range of frequencies higher than this equilibrium rotation frequency can
naturally arise if the accretion flow is channeled by higher multipoles of the
star's magnetic field. The higher multipole components of the magnetic field
will balance the material stresses of the accretion flow at radii closer to the
star. The Kepler frequencies associated with these generalized Alfven radii
increase with the order of the multipole. Other frequency bands, like the
epicyclic frequencies associated with the accretion flow, may in turn be higher
than the Kepler frequencies. We present expressions for the spectrum of higher
frequencies arising due to these effects. Kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation
frequencies that are much higher than the rotation rate of the neutron star, as
observed from the recently discovered 11 Hz (P = 90 ms) X-ray pulsar IGR

parameter $a>0$) of the noncolliding Brownian motion such that neighboring
particles can change the order of positions in one dimension within the
characteristic length $a$. This process is not determinantal. Under a special
entrance law, however, Borodin and Corwin gave a Fredholm determinant
expression for the expectation of an observable, which is a softening of an
indicator of a particle position. We rewrite their integral kernel to a form
similar to the correlation kernels of determinantal processes and show, if the
number of particles is $N$, the rank of the matrix of the Fredholm determinant
is $N$. Then we give a representation for the quantity by using an $N$-particle
system of complex Brownian motions (CBMs). The complex function, which gives
the determinantal expression to the weight of CBM paths, is not entire, but in
the combinatorial limit $a \to 0$ it becomes an entire function providing
conformal martingales and the CBM representation for the noncolliding Brownian
motion is recovered.

storage systems as a way to provide fault-tolerance at the cost of less storage
overhead than traditional replication. Redundancy is maintained over time
through repair mechanisms, which may entail large network resource overheads.
In recent years, several novel codes tailor-made for distributed storage have
been proposed to optimize storage overhead and repair, such as Regenerating
Codes that minimize the per repair traffic, or Self-Repairing Codes which
minimize the number of nodes contacted per repair. Existing studies of these
coding techniques are however predominantly theoretical, under the simplifying
assumption that only one object is stored. They ignore many practical issues
that real systems must address, such as data placement, de/correlation of
multiple stored objects, or the competition for limited network resources when
multiple objects are repaired simultaneously. This paper empirically studies
the repair performance of these novel storage centric codes with respect to
classical erasure codes by simulating realistic scenarios and exploring the
interplay of code parameters, failure characteristics and data placement with
respect to the trade-offs of bandwidth usage and speed of repairs.

Abstract-Interpretation-based formalization of a static analysis for inferring

reachability, which models the property that the location pointed to by a

It is found that the samples directly quenched in the cooling process of growth

though their stoichiometries are similar. The sample cooled with furnace can be
tuned from insulating to superconducting by post-annealing and then quenching.
Based on the two points mentioned above, we conclude that the superconducting

the superconducting state. The similar stoichiometries of all the

superconducting. Combining with the result got in the KxFe2-ySe2 thin films

scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and the insulating sample mainly
corresponds to the phase with the $\sqrt{5}\times\sqrt{5}$ vacancy order.
Quenching may play a role of freezing the phase without iron vacancies.

properties (local star-formation rate, local metallicity, etc.). The sample
consists of almost 200 spectroscopically or photometrically confirmed SNe Ia at
redshifts below 0.25. The sample is split into two groups depending on the
morphology of the host galaxy. We fit light-curves using both MLCS2k2 and
SALT2, and determine color (AV, c) and light-curve shape (delta, x1) parameters
for each SN Ia, as well as its residual in the Hubble diagram. We then
correlate these parameters with both the physical and the normalized distances
to the center of the host galaxy and look for trends in the mean values and
scatters of these parameters with increasing distance. The most significant (at
the 4-sigma level) finding is that the average fitted AV from MLCS2k2 and c
from SALT2 decrease with the projected distance for SNe Ia in spiral galaxies.
We also find indications that SNe in elliptical galaxies tend to have narrower
light-curves if they explode at larger distances, although this may be due to
selection effects in our sample. We do not find strong correlations between the
residuals of the distance moduli with respect to the Hubble flow and the
galactocentric distances, which indicates a limited correlation between SN
magnitudes after standardization and local host metallicity.

The persistent (non-burst) emission has an absorbed 0.5-8keV luminosity of 1.7
x 10^36 erg/sec (at 6.9kpc) and can be well described by a thermal
Comptonization model of soft, ~0.6keV, seed photons up-scattered by a hot

with kT_(bb)~1.6keV and R_(bb)~5km. While an evolution in temperature of the

elements and/or coefficient functions of hard QCD processes. Strictly speaking,
this contribution is not known theoretically, since it is beyond perturbative
QCD. For DGLAP evolution all the infrared contributions are collected in the
phenomenological input parton distribution functions (PDFs), at some relatively
low scale Q_0; functions which are obtained from a fit to the `global' data.
However dimensional regularization sometimes produces a non-zero result coming
from the infrared region. Instead of this conventional regularization
treatment, we argue that the proper procedure is to first subtract from the NLO
matrix element the contribution already generated at the same order in \alpha_s
by the LO DGLAP splitting function convoluted with the LO matrix element. This
prescription eliminates the logarithmic infrared divergence, giving a
well-defined result which is consistent with the original idea that everything
below Q_0 is collected in the PDF input. We quantify the difference between the
proposed treatment and the conventional approach using low-mass Drell-Yan
production and deep inelastic electron-proton scattering as examples; and
discuss the potential impact on the `global' PDF analyses. We present arguments
to show that the difference cannot be regarded as simply the use of an

realizations often preclude its application as a predictive theory. Here, we
review the foundations of DFT applied to open-shell systems, both within the
nonrelativistic and the relativistic framework. In particular, we provide an
in-depth discussion of the exact theory, with a focus on the role of the spin
density and possibilities for targeting specific spin states. It turns out that
different options exist for setting up Kohn-Sham DFT schemes for open-shell
systems, which imply different definitions of the exchange-correlation energy
functional and lead to different exact conditions on this functional. Finally,
we suggest some possible directions for future developments.

  2012",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Thermal and non-thermal radiation from pulsars carries significant
information from surface and would have profound implications on the state of
dense matter in compact stars. For the non-thermal radio emission, subpulse
drifting phenomena suggest the existence of Ruderman-Sutherland-like
gap-sparking and strong binding of particles on pulsar polar caps. While
conventional neutron star models can hardly provide such a high binding energy,
the strong self-bound surface of quark-cluster stars can naturally solve this
problem. As for the thermal one, the featureless X-ray spectra of pulsars may
indicate a bare surface without atmosphere, and the ultrarelativistic fireball
of gamma-ray bursts and supernovae would also require strong self-bound
surfaces. Recent achievements in measuring pulsar mass and mass-radius relation
further indicate a stiff equation of state and a self-bound surface. Therefore,
we conjecture that matters inside pulsar-like compact stars could be in a
quark-cluster phase. The surface of quark-cluster stars is chromatically
confined and could initially be bare. Such a surface can not only explain above
features, but may also promote a successful core-collapse supernova, and the
hydro-cyclotron oscillation of the electron sea above the surface could be
responsible for those absorption features detected in the X-ray spectrum.

  27-29, 2012, Memorie della Societa' Astronomica Italiana Supplementi",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The presence of 6Li in the atmospheres of metal-poor halo stars is usually
inferred from the detection of a subtle extra depression in the red wing of the
7Li doublet line at 670.8 nm. However, the intrinsic line asymmetry caused by
convective flows in the photospheres of cool stars is almost indistinguishable
from the asymmetry produced by a weak 6Li blend on a (presumed) symmetric 7Li
profile. Previous determinations of the 6Li/ 7Li isotopic ratio based on 1D
model atmospheres, ignoring the convection-induced line asymmetry, must
therefore be considered as upper limits. By comparing synthetic 1D LTE and 3D
non-LTE line profiles of the Li 670.8 nm feature, we quantify the differential
effect of the convective line asymmetry on the derived 6Li abundance as a
function of effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity. As expected, we
find that the asymmetry effect systematically reduces the resulting 6Li/7Li
ratios. Depending on the stellar parameters, the 3D-1D offset in 6Li/7Li ranges
between -0.005 and -0.020. When this purely theoretical correction is taken
into account for the Asplund 2006 sample of stars, the number of significant
6Li detections decreases from 9 to 5 (2 sigma criterion), or from 5 to 2 (3
sigma criterion).
  We also present preliminary results of a re-analysis of high-resolution, high
S/N spectra of individual metal-poor turn-off stars, to see whether the ""second
Lithium problem"" actually disappears when accounting properly for convection
and non-LTE line formation in 3D stellar atmospheres. Out of 8 stars, HD84937
seems to be the only significant (2 sigma) detection of 6Li. In view of our
results, the existence of a 6Li plateau appears questionable.

calculate the energy gap caused by the tunneling between two zero-mass lines

still missing and there are cases where VMD drastically fails, e.g. for the
omega transition form factor. In principle, effective field theories with their
systematic expansion and power counting could provide a tool to assess the
validity of VMD and more generally to describe the interactions of vector
mesons at low energies. Though the systematic development is still in an infant
stage we present here a Lagrangian for light pseudoscalar and vector mesons

pressure and minimum unsupported membrane length for a stationary bleb to
nucleate and grow as a function of the membrane-cortex adhesion. We next show
how a bleb may travel around the periphery of the cell when the cytoplasmic
pressure varies in space and time in a prescribed way and find that the

local cortical contraction while the shape of the traveling bleb is governed by
the speed of cortical healing. Finally, we relax the assumption that the
pressure change is prescribed and couple it hydrodynamically to the cortical
contraction and membrane deformation. By quantifying the phase space of bleb

However, reality dictates a more complicated situation: typically a voter
participates in two elections, i.e. the congress and the presidential
elections. In both elections he/she has to decide between two choices. This
very feature of the US election system requires that the mental state is
represented by a 2-qubit state corresponding to the superposition of 4
different choices (e.g. for republicans in the congress; for the president as a
democrat). The main issue of this paper is to describe the dynamics of the
voters' mental states taking in account the mental and socio- political
environment. What is truly novel in this paper is that instead of using
Schr\""odinger's equation to describe the dynamics in an absence of
interactions, we here apply the quantum master equation. This equation
describes quantum decoherence, i.e., resolution from superposition to a
