compared, using Poisson statistics, to the number of SNe that it hosted (zero
or one), based on the method introduced in Maoz et al. (2011). This SN sample
differs from the SDSS2 SN Ia sample analyzed by Brandt et al. (2010), using a
related, but different, DTD recovery method. Furthermore, we use a
simulation-based SN detection-efficiency function, and we apply a number of
important corrections to the galaxy SFHs and SN Ia visibility times. The DTD
that we find has 4-sigma detections in all three of its time bins: prompt (t <
420 Myr), intermediate (0.4 < t < 2.4 Gyr), and delayed (t > 2.4 Gyr),
indicating a continuous DTD, and it is among the most accurate and precise
among recent DTD reconstructions. The best-fit power-law form to the recovered
DTD is t^(-1.12+/-0.08), consistent with generic ~t^-1 predictions of SN Ia
progenitor models based on the gravitational-wave induced mergers of binary

helpful to have a pion DA model that can mimic all the suggested behaviors,
especially to agree with the constraints from the pion-photon TFF in whole

conventional model for pion wavefunction/DA that has been constructed in our
previous paper \cite{hw1}, whose broadness is controlled by a parameter $B$. We
fix the DA parameters by using the CELLO, CLEO, BABAR and Belle data within the
smaller $Q^2$ region ($Q^2 \leq 15$ GeV$^2$), where all the data are consistent
with each other. And then the pion-photon TFF is extrapolated into larger $Q^2$
region. We observe that the BABAR favors $B=0.60$ which has the behavior close
to the Chernyak-Zhitnitsky DA, whereas the recent Belle favors $B=0.00$ which
is close to the asymptotic DA. We need more accurate data at large $Q^2$ region
to determine the precise value of $B$, and the definite behavior of pion DA can
be concluded finally by the consistent data in the coming future.

FeH, FeH3 and FeH4 are stable iron hydrides at these conditions. For Fe3C, the
cementite structure (Pnma) and the Cmcm structure recently found by random
sampling are less stable than the I-4 and C2/m structures found here. We found
that FeH3 and FeH4 adopt chemically interesting thermodynamically stable
structures, in both compounds containing trivalent iron. The density of the
inner core can be matched with a reasonable concentration of carbon, 11-15
mol.percent (2.6-3.7 wt.percent) at relevant pressures and temperatures. This
concentration matches that in CI carbonaceous chondrites and corresponds to the
average atomic mass in the range 49.3-51.0, in close agreement with inferences
from the Birch's law for the inner core. Similarly made estimates for the
maximum hydrogen content are unrealistically high, 17-22 mol.percent (0.4-0.5

are increasingly used by the daily-deal providers. Unlike the traditional web
ads, the advertiser's profits for group-buying ads depends on the time to
expiry and additional customers needed to satisfy the minimum group size. Since
both these quantities are time-dependent, optimal bid amounts to maximize
profits change with every impression. Consequently, traditional static bidding
strategies are far from optimal. Instead, bid values need to be optimized in
real-time to maximize expected bidder profits. This online optimization of deal
profits is made possible by the advent of ad exchanges offering real-time
(spot) bidding. To this end, we propose a real-time bidding strategy for
group-buying deals based on the online optimization of bid values. We derive
the expected bidder profit of deals as a function of the bid amounts, and
dynamically vary bids to maximize profits. Further, to satisfy time constraints
of the online bidding, we present methods of minimizing computation timings.
Subsequently, we derive the real time ad selection, admissibility, and real
time bidding of the traditional ads as the special cases of the proposed
method. We evaluate the proposed bidding, selection and admission strategies on
a multi-million click stream of 935 ads. The proposed real-time bidding,
selection and admissibility show significant profit increases over the existing
strategies. Further the experiments illustrate the robustness of the bidding

two RXTE observations and one Chandra observation of the black hole candidate
H1743-322. The QPO is observed only at the beginning of the 2010 and 2011
outbursts at similar hard colour and intensity, suggestive of an accretion
state dependence for the QPO. Although its frequency appears to be correlated
with X-ray intensity on timescales of a day, in successive outbursts eight
months apart we measure a QPO frequency that differs by less than ~2.2 mHz
while the intensity had changed significantly. We show that this ~11 mHz QPO is
different from the so-called Type-C QPOs seen in black holes and that the
mechanisms that produce the two flavours of variability are most probably
independent. After comparing this QPO with other variability phenomena seen in
accreting black holes and neutron stars, we conclude that it best resembles the
so-called ""1 Hz"" QPOs seen in dipping neutron star systems, although having a
significantly lower (1-2 orders of magnitude) frequency. If confirmed,
H1743-322 is the first black hole showing this type of variability. Given the
unusual characteristics and the hard-state dependence of the ~11 mHz QPO, we
also speculate whether these oscillations could instead be related to the radio
jets observed in H1743-322. A systematic search for this type of low-frequency
QPOs in similar systems is needed to test this speculation. In any case, it
remains unexplained why these QPOs have only been seen in the last two

bremsstrahlung-producing electrons in solar flares, we analyze the evolution of
the flare loop size with respect to energy at a variety of times. A GOES M3.7
loop-structured flare starting around 23:55 on 2002 April 14 is studied in
detail using \textit{Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager}
(\textit{RHESSI}) observations. We construct photon and mean-electron-flux maps
in 2-keV energy bins by processing observationally-deduced photon and electron
visibilities, respectively, through several image-processing methods: a
visibility-based forward-fit (FWD) algorithm, a maximum entropy (MEM) procedure
and the uv-smooth (UVS) approach. We estimate the sizes of elongated flares
(i.e., the length and width of flaring loops) by calculating the second
normalized moments of the intensity in any given map. Employing a collisional
model with an extended acceleration region, we fit the loop lengths as a
function of energy in both the photon and electron domains. The resulting
fitting parameters allow us to estimate the extent of the acceleration region
which is between $\sim 13 \rm{arcsec}$ and $\sim 19 \rm{arcsec}$. Both
forward-fit and uv-smooth algorithms provide substantially similar results with
a systematically better fit in the electron domain.The consistency of the
estimates from these methods provides strong support that the model can
reliably determine geometric parameters of the acceleration region. The
acceleration region is estimated to be a substantial fraction ($\sim 1/2$) of
the loop extent, indicating that this dense flaring loop incorporates both
acceleration and transport of electrons, with concurrent thick-target
bremsstrahlung emission.

financial institution needs to raise and invest in a pre-specified eligible
asset to ensure it is adequately capitalized. Most of the literature has
focused on cash-additive risk measures, for which the eligible asset is a
risk-free bond, on the grounds that the general case can be reduced to the
cash-additive case by a change of numeraire. However, discounting does not work
in all financially relevant situations, typically when the eligible asset is a
defaultable bond. In this paper we fill this gap allowing for general eligible
assets. We provide a variety of finiteness and continuity results for the
corresponding risk measures and apply them to risk measures based on
Value-at-Risk and Tail Value-at-Risk on $L^p$ spaces, as well as to shortfall
risk measures on Orlicz spaces. We pay special attention to the property of
cash subadditivity, which has been recently proposed as an alternative to cash
additivity to deal with defaultable bonds. For important examples, we provide
characterizations of cash subadditivity and show that, when the eligible asset
is a defaultable bond, cash subadditivity is the exception rather than the
rule. Finally, we consider the situation where the eligible asset is not
liquidly traded and the pricing rule is no longer linear. We establish when the
resulting risk measures are quasiconvex and show that cash subadditivity is
only compatible with continuous pricing rules.

$J y'(t)-B(t)y(t)=\D(t) f(t)$ on an interval $[a,b> $ with the regular endpoint
$a$. The deficiency indices $n_\pm$ of the corresponding minimal relation
$\Tmi$ may be arbitrary (possibly unequal). Our approach is based on the
concept of a decomposing boundary triplet, which enables one to parametrize
various classes of extensions of $\Tmi$ (self-adjoint, $m$-dissipative, etc.)
in terms of boundary conditions imposed on regular and singular values of a
function $y\in \dom \tma$ at the endpoints $a$ and $b$ respectively. In
particular, we describe self-adjoint and $\l$-depending Nevanlinna boundary
conditions which are analogs of separated ones for Hamiltonian systems. With a
boundary value problem involving such conditions we associate the $m$-function
$m(\cd)$, which is an analog of the Titchmarsh-Weyl coefficient for the
Hamiltonian system. In the simplest case of minimal (unequal) deficiency
indices $n_\pm$ the $m$-function $m(\cd)$ coincides with the rectangular
Titchmarsh-Weyl coefficient introduced by Hinton and Schneider. We parametrize
all $m$-functions in terms of the Nevanlinna boundary parameter at the endpoint
$b$ by means of the formula similar to the known Krein formula for resolvents.
Application of these results to differential operators of an odd order enables
us to complete the results by Everitt and Krishna Kumar on the Titchmarsh-Weyl
theory of such operators.

give bounds connecting the cardinality of the sumset $A+B=\{a+b\;;\;a\in

structure) of the original sets $A,B$. For example, the sum-difference bound of
Ruzsa states that, $|A+B|\,|A|\,|B|\leq|A-B|^3$, where the difference set $A-B=
\{a-b\;;\;a\in A,\,b\in B\}$. Interpreting the differential entropy $h(X)$ of a
continuous random variable $X$ as (the logarithm of) the size of the effective
support of $X$, the main contribution of this paper is a series of natural
information-theoretic analogs for these results. For example, the Ruzsa
sum-difference bound becomes the new inequality, $h(X+Y)+h(X)+h(Y)\leq
3h(X-Y)$, for any pair of independent continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$.
Our results include differential-entropy versions of Ruzsa's triangle
inequality, the Pl\""{u}nnecke-Ruzsa inequality, and the
Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers lemma. Also we give a differential entropy version
of the Freiman-Green-Ruzsa inverse-sumset theorem, which can be seen as a
quantitative converse to the entropy power inequality. Versions of most of
these results for the discrete entropy $H(X)$ were recently proved by Tao,
relying heavily on a strong, functional form of the submodularity property of
$H(X)$. Since differential entropy is {\em not} functionally submodular, in the
continuous case many of the corresponding discrete proofs fail, in many cases
requiring substantially new proof strategies. We find that the basic property
that naturally replaces the discrete functional submodularity, is the data
processing property of mutual information.

diverse and successful, including natural language processing, gesture
recognition, gene sequencing, and Kalman filtering of physical measurements.
HMMs are highly non-linear statistical models, and just as linear models are
amenable to linear algebraic techniques, non-linear models are amenable to
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
  This paper closely examines HMMs in which all the hidden random variables are
binary. Its main contributions are (1) a birational parametrization for every
such HMM, with an explicit inverse for recovering the hidden parameters in
terms of observables, (2) a semialgebraic model membership test for every such
HMM, and (3) minimal defining equations for the 4-node fully binary model,
comprising 21 quadrics and 29 cubics, which were computed using Grobner bases
in the cumulant coordinates of Sturmfels and Zwiernik. The new model parameters
in (1) are rationally identifiable in the sense of Sullivant, Garcia-Puente,
and Spielvogel, and each model's Zariski closure is therefore a rational
projective variety of dimension 5. Grobner basis computations for the model and
its graph are found to be considerably faster using these parameters. In the
case of two hidden states, item (2) supersedes a previous algorithm of
Schonhuth which is only generically defined, and the defining equations (3)
yield new invariants for HMMs of all lengths $\geq 4$. Such invariants have
been used successfully in model selection problems in phylogenetics, and one
can hope for similar applications in the case of HMMs.

total mass $\approx 2.7 M_\odot$. For the total mass $\approx 3 M_\odot$, a

outcome for the nucleonic (hyperonic) EOS. It is shown that the typical total

$4\times 10^{-22}$ at $f\approx 2$ -- $3.2 {\rm kHz}$ for a source of distance

An immediate consequence of this technique is that any planar graph can be
drawn with a fixed vertex mapping so that edges map to piecewise linear curves

graphs, we show that $2n + O(1)$ bends per edge is sufficient on average.
  To further utilize our technique, we consider simultaneous embeddings of $k$
uniformly random planar graphs with vertices mapping to a fixed, common point
set. We explain how to achieve such a drawing so that edges map to piecewise

combination of this relation with the quark-lepton complementarity and the
self-complementarity results in correlations of the lepton mixing angles with
the quark mixing angles. We find that the three mixing angles in the PMNS
matrix are all related to the Wolfenstein parameter $\lambda$ in the quark
mixing, so they are also correlated. Consequently, the PMNS matrix can be
parameterized by $\lambda$, A, and a Dirac CP-violating phase $\delta$. Such
parametrizations for the PMNS matrix have the same explicitly hierarchical

properties of the nuclear magnetic resonance for temperatures T > 50K. In the

elucidation. The establishment of more animal models for studying placental
malaria can provide novel ways of circumventing problems experienced during

experiments were carried out to determine placental cytokine profiles
underlying the immunopathogenesis of placental malaria. Four pregnant olive
baboons were infected with blood stage P. knowlesi H strain parasites on the
one fiftieth day of gestation while four other uninfected pregnant olive
baboons were maintained as uninfected controls. After nine days of infection,
placentas were extracted from all the eight baboons through cesarean surgery

Increased levels of IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 and interferon gamma (IFN-{\gamma})

find a significant, 40%-50%, contribution from non-thermal pressure in the core
assuming a spherical model. This non-thermal pressure support is similar to
what was found by Molnar et al. (2010) using a sample of massive relaxed
clusters drawn from high resolution cosmological simulations. We have studied
hydrostatic equilibrium in MS 2137 under the assumption of elliptical cluster
geometry adopting prolate models for the dark matter density distribution with
different axis ratios. Our results suggest that the main effect of ellipticity
(compared to spherical models) is to decrease the non-thermal pressure support
required for equilibrium at all radii without changing the distribution
qualitatively. We find that a prolate model with an axis ratio of 1.25 (axis in

model implying that MS 2137 is close to hydrostatic equilibrium at about
0.04-0.15 Rvir and have an about 25% contribution from non-thermal pressure at

channel H -> gamma gamma. In the Higgs Triplet Model (HTM) there are
contributions to this decay from loops of doubly charged scalars (H^{\pm\pm})
and singly charged scalars (H^\pm) that are not present in the Standard Model.
These additional contributions are mediated by the trilinear couplings H_1
H^{++}H^{--} and H_1 H^{+}H^{-}, where H_1 is the lightest CP-even Higgs boson.
We point out the possibility of constructive interference of the H^{\pm\pm}
contribution with that of the W^\pm contribution, which enables a substantial
enhancement of the branching ratio of H_1 -> gamma gamma in the HTM. The
magnitude of the contribution of $H^{\pm\pm}$ is essentially determined by the
mass of H^{\pm\pm} (m_{H^{\pm\pm}}) and a quartic scalar coupling (\lambda_1),
with constructive interference arising for \lambda_1 < 0. Consequently, the
ongoing searches for H -> gamma gamma restrict the parameter space of
[m_{H^{\pm\pm}},\lambda_1] more stringently for \lambda_1 < 0 than for the
recently-studied case of destructive interference with \lambda_1 > 0. Moreover,
if the excess of gamma gamma events around a mass of 125 GeV in the LHC
searches for H -> gamma gamma is substantiated with larger data samples, and
the branching ratio is measured to be somewhat larger than that for the SM
Higgs boson, then such an enhancement could be readily accommodated by H_1 in

galactic binary systems that contain a massive star and a compact object, show
a changing milliarcsecond morphology and a similar broad spectral energy
distribution (SED) that peaks at MeV-TeV energies and is modulated by the
orbital motion. The nature of the compact object is unclear in LS I +61 303, LS
5039 and HESS J0632+057, whereas PSR B1259-63 harbours a 47.74 ms radio pulsar.
Aims. A scenario in which a young pulsar wind interacts with the stellar wind
has been proposed to explain the very high energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray
emission detected from LS I +61 303, although no pulses have been reported from
this system at any wavelength. We aim to find evidence of the pulsar nature of
the compact object. Methods. We performed phased array observations with the
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 1280 MHz centred at phase 0.54.
Simultaneous data from the multi-bit phased array (PA) back-end with a sampling
time of tsamp = 128 microsec and from the polarimeter (PMT) back-end with tsamp
= 256 microsec where taken. Results. No pulses have been found in the data set,
with a minimum detectable mean flux density of \sim 0.38 mJy at 8-sigma level
for the pulsed emission from a putative pulsar with period P >2 ms and duty
cycle D = 10% in the direction of LS I +61 303. Conclusions. The detection of
posible radio pulsations will require deep and sensitive observations at
frequencies \sim0.5-5 GHz and orbital phases 0.6-0.7. However, it may be
unfeasible to detect pulses if the putative pulsar is not beamed at the Earth
or if there is a strong absorption within the binary system.

elongated similarly to that of the stellar halo, while that of the blue GCs is

extended than that of the red GCs. The radial number density profile of the red
GCs is consistent with the surface brightness profile of the M86 stellar halo.
The GC system has a negative radial color gradient, which is mainly due to the

exploiting the knowledge on how humans most frequently use their hands. To
increase the accuracy of pose reconstruction without modifying the glove
hardware - hence basically at no extra cost - we propose to collect, organize,

in common tasks. We discuss how a database of such an a priori information can
be built, represented in a hierarchy of correlation patterns or postural
synergies, and fused with glove data in a consistent way, so as to provide a
good hand pose reconstruction in spite of insufficient and inaccurate sensing
data. Simulations and experiments on a low-cost glove are reported which
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

  \cu\ is currently on a quasi-satellite orbit with repeatable transitions into

compound tadpole-quasi-satellite orbit. \ql\ and \Larsen\ are the co-orbitals
of Jupiter which are temporarily moving in a horseshoe orbit occasionally
interrupted by a quasi-satellite behavior. \sa\ is moving in a pure horseshoe
orbit. Orbits of the latter three objects are unstable and according to our

years. Two asteroids, \qq\ and \aee, are long-lived quasi-satellites of
Jupiter. They will remain in this state for a few thousand years at least. The
comets \ar\ and \wc\ are also quasi-satellites of Jupiter. However, the
non-gravitational effects may be significant in the motion of these comets. We
have shown that \wcs\ is moving in a quasi-satellite orbit and will stay in
this regime to at least 2500 year. Asteroid \hr\ will be temporarily captured

of the exo-life. We examine the feasibility of the detection of the 1.27 micron
oxygen band from habitable exoplanets, in particular, around late- type stars
observed with a future instrument on a 30 m class ground-based telescope. We
analyzed the night airglow around 1.27 micron with IRCS/echelle spectrometer on
Subaru and found that the strong telluric emission from atmospheric oxygen
molecules declines by an order of magnitude by midnight. By compiling nearby
star catalogs combined with the sky background model, we estimate the
detectability of the oxygen absorption band from an Earth twin, if it exists,
around nearby stars. We find that the most dominant source of photon noise for
the oxygen 1.27 micron band detection comes from the night airglow if the
contribution of the stellar PSF halo is suppressed enough to detect the planet.
We conclude that the future detectors for which the detection contrast is
limited by photon noise can detect the oxygen 1.27 micron absorption band of
the Earth twins for ~50 candidates of the late type star. This paper
demonstrates the importance of deploying small inner working angle efficient
coronagraph and extreme adaptive optics on extremely large telescopes, and
clearly shows that doing so will enable study of potentially habitable planets.

to evaluate the scale-dependent bias in the presence of primordial
non-Gaussianity. The integrated perturbation theory is a general framework of
nonlinear perturbation theory, in which a broad class of bias models can be
incorporated into perturbative evaluations of biased power spectrum and
higher-order polyspectra. Approximations such as the high-peak limit or the
peak-background split are not necessary to derive the scale-dependent bias in
this framework. Applying the halo approach, previously known formulas are
re-derived as limiting cases of a general formula in this work, and it is
implied that modifications should be made in general situations. Effects of
redshift-space distortions are straightforwardly incorporated. It is found that
the slope of the scale-dependent bias on large scales is determined only by the
behavior of primordial bispectrum in the squeezed limit, and is not sensitive
to bias models in general. It is the amplitude of scale-dependent bias that is
sensitive to the bias models. The effects of redshift-space distortions turn
out to be quite small for the monopole component of the power spectrum, while
the quadrupole component is proportional to the monopole component on large
scales, and thus also sensitive to the primordial non-Gaussianity.

linear random smoothly varying flow field of counter rotating vortices where
the two-particle velocity correlation was measured as a function of spatial
separation. Values of the correlation less than one for zero separation
indicated the presence of RUM. In terms of Stokes number, the motion of the
particles in one direction corresponds to either a heavily damped ({\tau}p <
0.25) or lightly damped ({\tau}p > 0.25)harmonic oscillator. In the lightly
damped case the particles overshoot the stagnation lines of the flow and are
projected from one vortex to another (the so-called sling-shot effect). It is
shown that RUM occurs only when {\tau}p > 0.25, increasing monotonically with
increasing Stokes number. Calculations of the particle pair separation
distribution function show that equilibrium of the particle concentration field
is never reached, the concentration at zero separation increasing monotonically
with time. This is consistent with the calculated negative values of the
average Liapounov exponent (finite compressibility) of the particle velocity
field.

its fixed point reveals critical behavior in the large-N limit. We instead
utilize the fuzzy sphere structure based on which we construct a new map
(renormalization group) from N \times N matrix model to that of rank N-1. Our
renormalization group has great advantage of being a nice analog of the
standard renormalization group in field theory. It is naturally endowed with
the concept of high/low energy, and consequently it is in a sense local and
admits derivative expansions in the space of matrices. In construction we also
find that our renormalization in general generates multi-trace operators, and
that nonplanar diagrams yield a nonlocal operation on a matrix, whose action is
to transport the matrix to the antipode on the sphere. Furthermore the
noncommutativity of the fuzzy sphere is renormalized in our formalism. We then
analyze our renormalization group equation, and Gaussian and nontrivial fixed
points are found. We further clarify how to read off scaling dimensions from
our renormalization group equation. Finally the critical exponent of the model

  A theorem is presented according to which an arbitrary point-particle
Lagrangian can be formulated in terms of a complex function F, whose features
are analogous to those of the holomorphic function of special geometry. A
crucial role is played by a symplectic vector that represents a
complexification of the canonical variables, i.e. the coordinates and canonical

context of field theory models with duality invariances.
  The function F may depend on a number of external parameters that are not
subject to duality transformations. We introduce duality covariant complex
variables whose transformation rules under duality are independent of these
parameters. We express the real Hesse potential of N=2 supergravity in terms of

massive red elliptical galaxies, where they are thought to be powered through
gas accretion from their surrounding hot halos in a radiatively inefficient
manner. These AGN are often referred to as ""low-excitation"" radio galaxies
(LERGs). When radio-loud AGN are found in galaxies with a young stellar
population and active star formation, they are usually high-power
radiatively-efficient radio AGN (""high-excitation"", HERG). Using a sample of
low-redshift radio galaxies identified within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS), we determine the fraction of galaxies that host a radio-loud AGN,
$f_{RL}$, as a function of host galaxy stellar mass, $M_*$, star formation
rate, color (defined by the 4000 $\angstrom$ break strength), radio luminosity
and excitation state (HERG/LERG).
  We find the following: 1. LERGs are predominantly found in red galaxies. 2.
The radio-loud AGN fraction of LERGs hosted by galaxies of any color follows a
$f^{LE}_{RL} \propto M^{2.5}_*$ power law. 3. The fraction of red galaxies
hosting a LERG decreases strongly for increasing radio luminosity. For massive
blue galaxies this is not the case. 4. The fraction of green galaxies hosting a
LERG is lower than that of either red or blue galaxies, at all radio
luminosities. 5. The radio-loud AGN fraction of HERGs hosted by galaxies of any
color follows a $f^{HE}_{RL} \propto M^{1.5}_*$ power law. 6. HERGs have a
strong preference to be hosted by green or blue galaxies. 7. The fraction of
galaxies hosting a HERG shows only a weak dependence on radio luminosity cut.
8. For both HERGs and LERGs, the hosting probability of blue galaxies shows a
strong dependence on star formation rate. This is not observed in galaxies of a
different color.[abridged]

coplanar waveguides (CPWs) needs to be improved by at least an order of
magnitude to satisfy the requirements for space-based terahertz astronomy. Our
aim is to investigate if this can be achieved by reducing the width of the CPW
to much below what has typically been made using optical lithography (> 1
{\mu}m). CPW resonators with a central line width as narrow as 300 nm were made
in NbTiN using electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching. In a
systematic study of quarter-wave CPW resonators with varying widths it is shown
that the behavior of responsivity, noise and power handling as a function of
width continues down to 300 nm. This encourages the development of narrow KIDs
using Al in order to improve their sensitivity.

on the novel consequences that this constraint has on the direction and

provide detailed analysis in support of the results of Plunk and Tatsuno but
also significantly broaden the scope and use additional methods to address the

energies are not merely formal invariants of an idealized model

turbulence, i.e. quantities that can be used to predict the behavior of the
turbulence. Though many open questions remain, this paper collects evidence in
favor of this perspective by demonstrating in several contexts that constrained
spectral energy transfer governs the dynamics.

relaxation and transverse transport properties in bulk metals with respect to
the direction of the spin quantization axis in paramagnets or of the
spontaneous magnetization in ferromagnets. Owing to the presence of the
spin-orbit interaction the orbital and spin character of the Bloch states
depends sensitively on the orientation of the spins relative to the crystal
axes. This leads to drastic changes in quantities which rely on interband
mixing induced by the spin-orbit interaction. The anisotropy is particularly
striking for quantities which exhibit spiky and irregular distribution in the
Brillouin zone, such as the spin-mixing parameter or the Berry curvature of the
electronic states. We demonstrate this for three cases: (i) the Elliott-Yafet
spin-relaxation mechanism in paramagnets with structural inversion symmetry;
(ii) the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnets; and (iii) the spin
Hall effect in paramagnets. We discuss the consequences of the pronounced

which dilatons can couple to the Standard Model and on the role played by the
conformal anomaly as a way to characterize their interactions. In the case of a
dilaton derived from a metric compactification (graviscalar), we present the
structure of the radiative corrections to its decay into two photons, a photon
and a $Z$, two $Z$ gauge bosons and two gluons, together with their
renormalization properties. We prove that, in the electroweak sector, the
renormalization of the theory is guaranteed only if the Higgs is conformally
coupled. For such a dilaton, its coupling to the trace anomaly is quite
general, and determines, for instance, an enhancement of its decay rates into
two photons and two gluons. We then turn our attention to theories containing a
non-gravitational (effective) dilaton, which, in our perturbative analysis,
manifests as a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone mode of the dilatation current ($J_D$).
The infrared coupling of such a state to the two-photons and to the two-gluons
sector, and the corresponding anomaly enhancements of its decay rates in these
channels, is critically analyzed.

value for statistical studies of candidate properties. A previous investigation
of the stellar population in the Kepler field has provided an estimate for the
FPP of less than 5% for most of the candidates. We report here the results of
our radial velocity observations on a sample of 46 Kepler candidates with a
transit depth greater than 0.4%, orbital period less than 25 days and host star
brighter than Kepler magnitude 14.7. We used the SOPHIE spectrograph mounted on
the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence to establish the
nature of the transiting candidates. In this sample, we found five undiluted
eclipsing binaries, two brown dwarfs, six diluted eclipsing binaries, and nine
new transiting planets that complement the 11 already published planets. The
remaining 13 candidates were not followed-up or remain unsolved due to photon
noise limitation or lack of observations. From these results we computed the
FPP for Kepler close-in giant candidates to be 34.8% \pm 6.5%. We aimed to
investigate the variation of the FPP for giant candidates with the longer
orbital periods and found that it should be constant for orbital periods
between 10 and 200 days. This significant disagrees with the previous
estimates. We discuss the reasons for this discrepancy and the possible
extension of this work toward smaller planet candidates. Finally, taking the
false-positive rate into account, we refined the occurrence rate of hot
jupiters from the Kepler data.

uses thousands of stationary dipoles to observe celestial phenomena. These
dipoles are grouped in various 'stations' which are centred on the Netherlands
with additional 'stations' across Europe. The telescope is designed to operate
at frequencies from 10 to 240\,MHz with very large fractional bandwidths
(25-100%). Several 'beam-formed' observing modes are now operational and the
system is designed to output data with high time and frequency resolution,
which are highly configurable. This makes LOFAR eminently suited for dynamic
spectrum measurements with applications in solar and planetary physics. In this
paper we describe progress in developing automated data analysis routines to
compute dynamic spectra from LOFAR time-frequency data, including correction
for the antenna response across the radio frequency pass-band and mitigation of
terrestrial radio-frequency interference (RFI). We apply these data routines to
observations of interplanetary scintillation (IPS), commonly used to infer
solar wind velocity and density information, and present initial science
results.

computers, the intervals between the release of new generations of consumer
products have been dramatically reduced and so have their lifetime cycles.
While it was very natural in the post-war era, that sophisticated consumer
products like television sets and stereo equipment would not be replaced with a
new product until they break, and usually beyond that point since it was very
common to have a broken television set serviced, the habits of consumers have
changed during the last quarter of the 20th century.
  A modern consumer product, like Apple's famous iPhone has a market life of
approximately one year until a successor is announced and subsequently pushed
into the market. Usually these new generations bring a bunch of new features,
have a higher performance while maintaining the price or becoming even cheaper,
thus the consumer greatly benefits from the reduced lifetime cycle of these
products.
  However, electronic devices not only require a lot of of Earth's limited
resources for their production, but their production processes are a major
source for harmful climate gases like carbon dioxide and toxic waste like heavy
metal alloys, acids and alkalis. And last but not least is every obsoleted
iPhone a candidate for waste facilities unless consumers are going to sell them
on the second hand market.
  While we can not expect consumers and manufacturers to go back to the early
days of consumer products where lifetime cycles reached up to 20 years, the
world record being the famous ""Centennial Lightbulb"" in Livermore, CA in the
US, which has been lit for over 100 years, it is certainly about time to
rethink modern consumerism with regard to responsibility to future generations.

local H\""older exponents and in a global way by fractal dimensions. Following a
previous work of Adler, we connect these two concepts for multiparameter
Gaussian random fields. More precisely, we prove that almost surely the
Hausdorff dimensions of the range and the graph in any ball $B(t_0,\rho)$ are
bounded from above using the local H\""older exponent at $t_0$. We define the
deterministic local sub-exponent of Gaussian processes, which allows to obtain
an almost sure lower bound for these dimensions. Moreover, the Hausdorff
dimensions of the sample path on an open interval are controlled almost surely
by the minimum of the local exponents.
  Then, we apply these generic results to the cases of the multiparameter
fractional Brownian motion, the multifractional Brownian motion whose
regularity function $H$ is irregular and the generalized Weierstrass function,
whose Hausdorff dimensions were unknown so far.

based on a dimension-reduction viewpoint. Under stationary settings, the
inference is simple in the sense that both the number of factors and the factor
loadings are estimated in terms of an eigenanalysis for a nonnegative definite
matrix, and is therefore applicable when the dimension of time series is on the
order of a few thousands. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are
investigated under two settings: (i) the sample size goes to infinity while the
dimension of time series is fixed; and (ii) both the sample size and the
dimension of time series go to infinity together. In particular, our estimators
for zero-eigenvalues enjoy faster convergence (or slower divergence) rates,
hence making the estimation for the number of factors easier. In particular,
when the sample size and the dimension of time series go to infinity together,
the estimators for the eigenvalues are no longer consistent. However, our
estimator for the number of the factors, which is based on the ratios of the
estimated eigenvalues, still works fine. Furthermore, this estimation shows the
so-called ""blessing of dimensionality"" property in the sense that the
performance of the estimation may improve when the dimension of time series
increases. A two-step procedure is investigated when the factors are of
different degrees of strength. Numerical illustration with both simulated and
real data is also reported.

a non-automatized and interactive process based on decision taking. This
lengthy process usually requires a full year of one person's work in order to
satisfactory collect, analyze and validate the list of all metabolic reactions

to go through a huge amount of genomic, metabolomic and physiological
information. Currently, there is no optimal algorithm that allows one to
automatically go through all this information and generate the models taking
into account probabilistic criteria of unicity and completeness that a
biologist would consider. Results: This work presents the automation of a
methodology for the reconstruction of genome scale metabolic models for any

implemented manually for the reconstruction of the genome scale metabolic model

generates the models from the probabilistic algorithms that have been

the metabolic models of several organisms generated by the platform have been
studied together with published models that have been manually curated. Network

virialization from a more fundamental point of view. Throughout, we remain
within general relativity and the class of FLRW models. The virialization
equation is set up and solved numerically for the virial radius, y_{vir}, from
which the virial overdensity \Delta_{V} is directly obtained. Leading order
corrections in the post-Newtonian framework are derived and quantified. In
addition, problems in the application of this formalism to dynamical DE models
are pointed out and discussed explicitly. We show that, in the weak field

Baber electron-electron scattering with participation of both Coulomb and
phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions provides the T^{2}-dependence of
the relaxation rate. The scattering on the potential landscape caused by
impurities is responsible for the residual relaxation rate at low temperatures.
A good agreement with experiment is achieved accounting for all phonon branches
in strontium titanate, both the optical and acoustic phonons. It is shown that
the effective electron-electron interaction can be attractive in strontium

number of applications, especially in the knowledge extraction task in social

community organization at a global level. In these cases, traditional graph
partitioning algorithms fail to let the latent knowledge embedded in modular
structure emerge, because they impose a top-down global view of a network. We
propose here a simple local-first approach to community discovery, able to
unveil the modular organization of real complex networks. This is achieved by
democratically letting each node vote for the communities it sees surrounding
it in its limited view of the global system, i.e. its ego neighborhood, using a
label propagation algorithm; finally, the local communities are merged into a
global collection. We tested this intuition against the state-of-the-art
overlapping and non-overlapping community discovery methods, and found that our
new method clearly outperforms the others in the quality of the obtained
communities, evaluated by using the extracted communities to predict the
metadata about the nodes of several real world networks. We also show how our
method is deterministic, fully incremental, and has a limited time complexity,
so that it can be used on web-scale real networks.

in many popular random-access networks including Ethernet and wireless LAN
(WLAN). The prominence of EB is primarily attributed to its asymptotic
throughput stability, which ensures a non-zero throughput even when the number
of users in the network goes to infinity. Recent studies, however, show that EB
is fundamentally unsuitable for applications that are sensitive to large delay
and delay jitters, as it induces divergent second- and higher-order moments of
medium access delay. Essentially, the medium access delay follows a power law
distribution, a subclass of heavy-tailed distribution. To understand and
alleviate the issue, this paper systematically analyzes the tail delay
distribution of general backoff functions, with EB being a special case. In
particular, we establish a tradeoff between the tail decaying rate of medium
access delay distribution and the stability of throughput. To be more specific,
convergent delay moments are attainable only when the backoff functions $g(k)$
grows slower than exponential functions, i.e., when $g(k)\in o(r^k)$ for all
$r>1$. On the other hand, non-zero asymptotic throughput is attainable only
when backoff functions grow at least as fast as an exponential function, i.e.,
$g(k)\in\Omega(r^k)$ for some $r>1$. This implies that bounded delay moments
and stable throughput cannot be achieved at the same time. For practical
implementation, we show that polynomial backoff (PB), where $g(k)$ is a
polynomial that grows slower than exponential functions, obtains finite delay
moments and good throughput performance at the same time within a practical
range of user population. This makes PB a better alternative than EB for
multimedia applications with stringent delay requirements.

the uncertainties in their astrometric calibration. Due to the lack of standard
reference objects, an image with a small field of view can have significantly
larger errors in its absolute positioning than the relative precision of the
detected sources within. We present a new general solution for the relative
astrometry that quickly refines the World Coordinate System of overlapping
fields. The efficiency is obtained through the use of infinitesimal 3-D
rotations on the celestial sphere, which do not involve trigonometric
functions. They also enable an analytic solution to an important step in making
the astrometric corrections. In cases with many overlapping images, the correct
identification of detections that match together across different images is
difficult to determine. We describe a new greedy Bayesian approach for
selecting the best object matches across a large number of overlapping images.
The methods are developed and demonstrated on the Hubble Legacy Archive, one of
the most challenging data sets today. We describe a novel catalog compiled from
many Hubble Space Telescope observations, where the detections are combined
into a searchable collection of matches that link the individual detections.
The matches provide descriptions of astronomical objects involving multiple
wavelengths and epochs. High relative positional accuracy of objects is
achieved across the Hubble images, often sub-pixel precision in the order of
just a few milli-arcseconds. The result is a reliable set of high-quality
associations that are publicly available online.

live time of 863 days, are used to measure the oscillation parameters of
atmospheric neutrinos. Muon tracks are reconstructed with energies as low as 20
GeV. Neutrino oscillations will cause a suppression of vertical upgoing muon
neutrinos of such energies crossing the Earth. The parameters determining the
oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos are extracted by fitting the event rate as
a function of the ratio of the estimated neutrino energy and reconstructed
flight path through the Earth. Measurement contours of the oscillation
parameters in a two-flavour approximation are derived. Assuming maximum mixing,
a mass difference of $\Delta m_{32}^2=(3.1\pm 0.9)\cdot 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ is
obtained, in good agreement with the world average value.

form transversely elongated ellipses in the [H, K] plane of the reciprocal
space. Upon Ni-doping, the c-axis magnetic exchange coupling is rapidly
suppressed and the momentum distribution of spin excitations in the [H, K]
plane is enlarged in both the transverse and longitudinal directions with
respect to the in-plane AF ordering wave vector of the parent compound. As a
function of increasing Ni-doping x, the spin excitation widths increase
linearly but with a larger rate along the transverse direction. These results
are in general agreement with calculations of dynamic susceptibility based on
the random phase approximation (RPA) in an itinerant electron picture. For
samples near optimal superconductivity at x= 0.1, a neutron spin resonance
appears in the superconducting state. Upon further increasing the
electron-doping to decrease the superconducting transition temperature Tc, the
intensity of the low-energy magnetic scattering decreases and vanishes
concurrently with vanishing superconductivity in the overdoped side of the
superconducting dome. Comparing with the low-energy spin excitations centered
at commensurate AF positions for underdoped and optimally doped materials
(x<0.1), spin excitations in the over-doped side (x=0.15) form transversely
incommensurate spin excitations, consistent with the RPA calculation.
Therefore, the itinerant electron approach provides a reasonable description to
the low-energy AF spin excitations in BaFe2-xNixAs2.

distinct from the sdB stars that show V1093Her pulsations, which all have
surface gravities higher than log g = 5.1 and helium abundances depleted by at
least an order of magnitude relative to the solar composition. We find that
KIC1718290 has T_eff = 22 100K, log g = 4.72, and a super-solar helium
abundance (log N(He)/N(H) = -0.45). This places it well above the extreme

follows: 1) to have a clear ontology for QM, 2) to describe QM in a causal way,
3) to get rid of the wave-particle dualism in pilot wave theories, 4) to
provide a theoretical framework for describing creation and annihilation of
particles, and 5) to provide a possible connection between particle QM and
virtual particles in QFT. These goals are achieved, if the wave function is
replaced by a fluid of so called virtual particles. It is also assumed that in
this fluid of virtual particles exist a few real particles and that only these
real particles can be directly observed. This has relevance for the measurement
problem in QM and it is found that quantum probabilities arise in a very
natural way from the structure of the theory. The model presented here is very
similar to a recent computational model of quantum physics and recent Bohmian

dimensional version of the classical method of constructing Lebesgue measure on
$\R^n$ (see \cite{YA1}, \cite{KH} and \cite{KP2}). First we show that von
Neumann's theory of infinite tensor product Hilbert spaces already implies that
a natural version of Lebesgue measure must exist on $\R^{\iy}$. Using this
insight, we define the canonical version of $L^2[\R^{\iy}, \la_{\iy}]$, which
allows us to construct Lebesgue measure on $\R^{\iy}$ and analogues of Lebesgue
and Gaussian measure for every separable Banach space with a Schauder basis.
When $\mcH$ is a Hilbert space and $\la_{\mcH}$ is Lebesgue measure restricted
to $\mcH$, we define sums and products of unbounded operators and the Gaussian
density for $L^2[\mcH, \la_{\mcH}]$. We show that the Fourier transform induces
two different versions of the Pontryagin duality theory. An interesting new
result is that the character group changes on infinite dimensional spaces when
the Fourier transform is treated as an operator. Since our construction
provides a complete $\s$-finite measure space, the abstract version of Fubini's
theorem allows us to extend Young's inequality to every separable Banach space
with a Schauder basis. We also give constructive examples of partial
