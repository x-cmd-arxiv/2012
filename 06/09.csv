partially explains the hierarchies of the yukawa couplings, and provides a
natural embedding for Supersymmetry with heavier first two generations, where
collider constraints are not in conflict with the requirement of naturalness
and the SUSY CP problem is solved. Within this context a specific pattern of
flavour symmetry breaking is considered. The K, B_d and B_s mixing amplitudes
show a definite correlation that can resolve existing tensions in the CKM fit,
pointing in this way to sbottom and gluino masses below about 1.5 TeV.
Potentially sizeable contributions to both indirect and direct CP violation in
B decays are allowed, even in the absence of flavour-blind phases. In case some
effects are observed, the peculiar pattern in Delta(F) = 2 and Delta(B) = 1
observables may allow to distinguish between this and other models.

to existence questions of open and closed edge, diagonal, and mobile guards in

using hidden open mobile (edge or diagonal) guards, but not necessarily with

quantum correlations has been challenged by the rise of new correlation
concepts, such as quantum discord, able to reveal quantum correlations that are

discord, because it involves a minimization over all possible local
measurements in a bipartition. In the realm of continuous variable (CV)
systems, a Gaussian version of quantum discord has been put forward upon
restricting to Gaussian measurements. It is natural to ask whether non-Gaussian
measurements can lead to a stronger minimization than Gaussian ones. Here we
focus on two relevant classes of two-mode Gaussian states: squeezed thermal
states (STS) and mixed thermal states (MTS), and allow for a range of
experimentally feasible non-Gaussian measurements, comparing the results with
the case of Gaussian measurements. We provide evidence that Gaussian
measurements are optimal for Gaussian states.

a parameter. At high level density, where many states avoid crossing, a
dynamical phase transition takes place in the system under the influence of the
environment. It causes a dynamical stabilization of the system what can be seen
in many different experimental data. Due to this effect, time is bounded from
below: the decay widths (inverse proportional to the lifetimes of the states)
do not increase limitless. The dynamical stabilization is an irreversible

location, physical status and images of the surrounding area, is essential for
minimizing loss of life, injury, and property damage. Today's handhelds make it
easy for people to gather data from within the disaster area in many formats,
including text, images and video. Studies show that the extreme anxiety induced
by disasters causes humans to create a substantial amount of repetitive and
redundant content. Transporting this content outside the disaster zone can be
problematic when the network infrastructure is disrupted by the disaster.
  This paper presents the design of a novel architecture called CARE
(Content-Aware Redundancy Elimination) for better utilizing network resources
in disaster-affected regions. Motivated by measurement-driven insights on
redundancy patterns found in real-world disaster area photos, we demonstrate
that CARE can detect the semantic similarity between photos in the networking
layer, thus reducing redundant transfers and improving buffer utilization.
Using DTN simulations, we explore the boundaries of the usefulness of deploying
CARE on a damaged network, and show that CARE can reduce packet delivery times
and drops, and enables 20-40% more unique information to reach the rescue teams
outside the disaster area than when CARE is not deployed.

to investigate the implications of variations in the abundances of these and

sequences have been computed for scaled solar and enhanced alpha-element
mixtures, and for mixtures in which the assumed [m/Fe] value for each of the
metals C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Ti has been increased, in turn, by
0.4 dex at constant [Fe/H]. These tracks, together with isochrones for ages
from 6 to 14 Gyr, have been computed for -3.0 < [Fe/H] < -0.6, with helium
abundances Y = 0.25, 0.29, and 0.33 at each [Fe/H] value, using upgraded
versions of the Victoria stellar structure program and the Regina interpolation
code, respectively. Turnoff luminosity versus age relations from isochrones are
found to depend almost entirely on the importance of the CNO-cycle, and thereby
mainly on the abundance of oxygen. Since C, N, and O, as well as Ne and S, do
not contribute significantly to the opacities at low temperatures and
densities, variations in their abundances do not impact the Teff scale of red
giants. The latter is a strong function of the abundances of only Mg and Si
(and Fe, possibly to a lesser extent), because they are so abundant and because
they are strong sources of opacity at low temperatures. For these reasons, Mg
and Si also have important effects on the temperatures of main-sequence stars.
Due to their low abundances, Na, Ca, and Ti are of little consequence for
stellar models. The effects of varying the adopted solar metals mix and the
helium abundance at a fixed [Fe/H] are also briefly discussed.

systems that lead to similarities in a variety of different contexts. Classic
examples include the descriptive power of fractals, the importance of surface
area to volume constraints, the universality of entropy in systems, and
mathematical rules of growth and form. Documenting such overarching principles
may represent a rejoinder to the Neodarwinian synthesis that emphasizes
adaptation and competition. Instead, these principles could indicate the
importance of constraint and structure on form and evolution. Here we document
a potential example of a phenomenon suggesting congruent behavior of very
different systems. We focus on the notion that universally there has been a
tendency for more volatile entities to disappear from systems such that the net
volatility in these systems tends to decline. We specifically focus on
origination and extinction rates in the marine animal fossil record, the
performance of stocks in the stock market, and the characters of stars and
stellar systems. We consider the evidence that each is experiencing declining
volatility, and also consider the broader significance of this.

Twenty five percent of the LoBALs show PAH features and 45% have weak 9.7

starburst contributions to the far-infrared luminosity in LoBALs and in
non-LoBALs. Their median total, starburst, and AGN infrared luminosities are
comparable. Twenty percent (but no more than 60%) of the LoBALs and 26% of the
non-LoBALs are ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs; L_IR>10^12*L_sun). We
estimate star formation rates (SFRs) corrected for the AGN contribution to the
FIR flux and find that LoBALs have comparable levels of star formation activity
to non-LoBALs when considering the entire samples. However, the SFRs of the
IR-luminous LoBALs are 80% higher than those of their counterparts in the
control sample. The median contribution of star formation to the total
far-infrared flux in LoBALs and in non-LoBALs is estimated to be 40-50%, in
agreement with previous results for PG QSOs. Overall, our results show that
there is no strong evidence from the mid- and far-IR properties that LoBALs are

In this article we show with a realistic model for a biologically pertinent
system how this phenomenon appears at the molecular level. We focus on the
association of the C-terminal domain (CA-C) of the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) capsid protein. By combining all-atom simulations with specialized
sampling techniques we measure the water density distribution during the
approach of two CA-C proteins as a function of separation and amino acid
sequence in the interfacial region. The simulations demonstrate that CA-C
protein-protein interactions sit at the edge of a dewetting transition and that
this mesoscopic manifestation of the underlying liquid-vapor phase transition
can be readily manipulated by biology or protein engineering to significantly
affect association behavior. While the wild type protein remains wet until
contact, we identify a set of in silico mutations, in which three hydrophilic
amino acids are replaced with nonpolar residues, that leads to dewetting prior
to association. The existence of dewetting depends on the size and relative
locations of substituted residues separated by nm length scales, indicating
long range cooperativity and a sensitivity to surface topography. These
observations identify important details which are missing from descriptions of
protein association based on buried hydrophobic surface area.

in galaxies. Galactic outflows driven by supernovae/stellar winds are the
leading mechanism for explaining this fact. The scaling relation between galaxy
mass and outer rotation velocity (also known as the baryonic Tully-Fisher
relation, BTF) has recently been used as evidence against this viewpoint. We
use a LCDM based semi-analytic disk galaxy formation model to investigate these
claims. In our model, galaxies with less efficient star formation and higher
gas fractions are more efficient at ejecting gas from galaxies. This is due to
the fact that galaxies with less efficient star formation and higher gas
fractions tend to live in dark matter haloes with lower circular velocities,
from which less energy is required to escape the potential well. In our model
the intrinsic scatter in the BTF is 0.15 dex, and mostly reflects scatter in
dark halo concentration. The observed scatter, equal to 0.24 dex, is dominated
by measurement errors. The best estimate for the intrinsic scatter is that it
is less than 0.15 dex, and thus our LCDM based model (which does not include
all possible sources of scatter) is only just consistent with this. In our
model, gas rich galaxies, at fixed virial velocity (V_vir), with lower stellar
masses have lower baryonic masses. This is consistent with the expectation that
galaxies with lower stellar masses have had less energy available to drive an
outflow. However, when the outer rotation velocity (V_flat) is used the
correlation has the opposite sign, with a slope in agreement with observations.
This is due to scatter in the relation between V_flat and V_vir. In summary,
contrary to some previous claims, we show that basic features of the BTF are
consistent with a LCDM based model in which the low efficiency of galaxy
formation is determined by galactic outflows.

subluminous event for which spectropolarimetry is available, i.e. SN1999by. The
data present a very marked dominant axis, which is shared by both the continuum
and lines such as SiII 6355, suggesting that the relatively large, global
asymmetry is common to the photosphere and the line-forming region. The maximum
polarization degree observed in the SiII 6355 absorption reaches 0.39+/-0.08%.
At variance with what is seen in core-normal Type Ia, SN2005ke displays
significant continuum polarization, which grows from the blue to the red and
peaks at about 7000 A, reaching ~0.7%. The properties of the polarization and
flux spectra can be understood within the framework of a subluminous
delayed-detonation (DD), or pulsating DD scenario, or WD mergers. The
difference in appearance with respect to core-normal SNe Ia is caused by low
photospheric temperatures in combination with layers of unburned C, and more
massive layers of the products of explosive C and O burning. The comparatively
high level of continuum polarization is explained in terms of a significant
global asymmetry (~15%), which is well reproduced by an oblate ellipsoidal
geometry. Our results suggest that SN2005ke arose either from a
single-degenerate system in which the WD is especially rapidly rotating, close
to the break-up velocity, or from a double-degenerate merger. Based on the
current polarization data, we cannot distinguish between these two
possibilities.

strong excess of absorption near galaxies compared to random lines of sight.
The excess continues beyond 1 Mpc, reflecting the correlation of metal
absorption with large-scale structure. Absorption is particularly enhanced
within about v<300 km/sec and roughly 300 kpc of galaxies (with distances
somewhat larger for the highest ion), approximately delineating the CGM; this
range contains the majority of global metal absorption. Low ions like MgII and
SiIV predominantly arise in denser gas closer to galaxies and drop more rapidly
with b, while high ions OVI and NeVIII trace more diffusely distributed gas
with a comparatively flat radial profile; CIV is intermediate. All ions
predominantly trace T~10^4-4.5 K photo-ionised gas at all b, but when hot CGM
gas is present (mostly in larger halos), we see strong collisionally-ionised
OVI and NeVIII at b <= 100 kpc. Larger halo masses generally produce more
absorption, though overall the trends are not as strong as that with impact
parameter. These findings arise using our favoured outflow scalings as expected
for momentum-driven winds; with no winds, the CGM gas remains mostly
unenriched, while our outflow model with a constant velocity and mass loading
factor produce hotter, more widely dispersed metals.

ultraviolet Lyman-Werner (LW) photons emitted by the first stars (directly
photodissociating H_2), or by the X-rays produced by accretion onto the black
hole (BH) remnants of these stars (heating the gas but catalyzing H_2
formation). Recent studies have suggested that a significant fraction of the
first stars may have had low masses (a few M_sun). Such stars do not leave BH
remnants and they have softer spectra, with copious infrared (IR) radiation at
photon energies around 1eV. Similar to LW and X-ray photons, these photons have
a mean-free path comparable to the Hubble distance, building up an early IR
background. Here we show that if soft-spectrum stars, with masses of a few
M_sun, contributed more than 1% of the UV background (or their mass fraction
exceeded 90%), then their IR radiation dominated radiative feedback in the
early Universe. The feedback is different from the UV feedback from high-mass
stars, and occurs through the photo-detachment of H^- ions, necessary for
efficient H_2 formation. Nevertheless, we find that the baryon fraction which
must be incorporated into low-mass stars in order to suppress H_2-cooling is
only a factor of few higher than for high-mass stars.

interactions with a companion star in a binary system. In this paper, we
investigate the formation mechanism of MSPs by considering the pulsar recycling
process in both intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) and low-mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs). The IMXBs mainly lead to the formation of binary MSPs with a
massive carbon-oxygen (CO) or an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf (ONeMg WD)
companion, whereas the LMXBs form recycled pulsars with a helium white dwarf
(He WD) companion. We discuss the accretion physics leading to the spin-up line
in the PPdot-diagram and demonstrate that such a line cannot be uniquely
defined. We derive a simple expression for the amount of accreted mass needed
for any given pulsar to achieve its equilibrium spin and apply this to explain
the observed differences of the spin distributions of recycled pulsars with
different types of companions. From numerical calculations we present further
evidence for significant loss of rotational energy in accreting X-ray MSPs in
LMXBs during the Roche-lobe decoupling phase (Tauris 2012) and demonstrate that
the same effect is negligible in IMXBs. We examine the recycling of pulsars
with CO WD companions via Case BB Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) of naked helium
stars in post common envelope binaries. We find that such pulsars typically
accrete of the order 0.002-0.007 M_sun which is just about sufficient to
explain their observed spin periods. We introduce isochrones of radio MSPs in
the PPdot-diagram to follow their spin evolution and discuss their true ages
from comparison with observations. Finally, we apply our results of the spin-up
process to the massive pulsar J1614-2230 (Paper I) and put new constraints on
the birth masses of a number of recycled pulsars. [Abridged]

the tone's frequency. In an accompanying psychoacoustic study, and in agreement

read out in the brain? Here we demonstrate that recurrent random neural
networks in which connections between neurons introduce characteristic time
delays, and in which neurons require temporally coinciding inputs for spike
initiation, can perform sharp frequency discrimination when stimulated with
phase-locked inputs. Although the frequency resolution achieved by such

star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 0.75<z<1.5 are presented. These
data were taken with slitless spectroscopy using the G102 and G141 grisms of
the Wide-Field-Camera 3 (WFC3) on board the Hubble Space Telescope as part of
the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel (WISP) survey. Interstellar dust
extinction is measured from stacked spectra that cover the Balmer decrement
(Halpha/Hbeta). We present dust extinction as a function of Halpha luminosity
(down to 3 x 10^{41} erg/s), galaxy stellar mass (reaching 4 x 10^{8} Msun),
and rest-frame Halpha equivalent width. The faintest galaxies are two times
fainter in Halpha luminosity than galaxies previously studied at z~1.5. An
evolution is observed where galaxies of the same Halpha luminosity have lower
extinction at higher redshifts, whereas no evolution is found within our error
bars with stellar mass. The lower Halpha luminosity galaxies in our sample are
found to be consistent with no dust extinction. We find an anti-correlation of
the [OIII]5007/Halpha flux ratio as a function of luminosity where galaxies
with L_{Halpha}<5 x 10^{41} erg/s are brighter in [OIII]5007 than Halpha. This
trend is evident even after extinction correction, suggesting that the
increased [OIII]5007/Halpha ratio in low luminosity galaxies is likely due to
lower metallicity and/or higher ionization parameters.

occurs contemporaneously with temporal changes in population size, potentially
altering the very nature of those dynamics. Such eco-evolutionary processes may
be most readily explored in systems with short generations and simple genetics.
Asexual and cyclically parthenogenetic organisms such as microalgae,
cladocerans, and rotifers, which frequently dominate freshwater plankton
communities, meet these requirements. Multiple clonal lines can coexist within
each species over extended periods, until either fixation occurs or a sexual
phase reshuffles the genetic material. When clones differ in traits affecting
interspecific interactions, within-species clonal dynamics can have major
effects on the population dynamics. We first consider a simple predator-prey
system with two prey genotypes, parameterized with data on a well-studied
experimental system, and explore how the extent of differences in defense
against predation within the prey population determine dynamic stability versus
instability of the system. We then explore how increased potential for
evolution affects the community dynamics in a more general community model with
multiple predator and multiple prey genotypes. These examples illustrate how
microevolutionary ""details"" that enhance or limit the potential for heritable
phenotypic change can have significant effects on contemporaneous
community-level dynamics and the persistence and coexistence of species.

developed under generalized linear model theory by utilizing the canonical link

displays universal behavior independent of material details. Properties of the
heavy electron liquid are best probed by NMR Knight shift measurements, which
provide a direct measure of the behavior of the heavy electron liquid that
emerges below the Kondo lattice coherence temperature as the lattice of local
moments hybridizes with the background conduction electrons. Because the
transfer of spectral weight between the localized and itinerant electronic
degrees of freedom is gradual, the Kondo liquid typically coexists with the
local moment component until the material orders at low temperatures. The
two-fluid formula captures this behavior in a broad range of materials in the
paramagnetic state. In order to investigate two-fluid behavior and the onset
and physical origin of different long range ordered ground states in heavy
electron materials, we have extended Knight shift measurements to
URu$_2$Si$_2$, CeIrIn$_5$ and CeRhIn$_5$. In CeRhIn$_5$ we find that the
antiferromagnetic order is preceded by a relocalization of the Kondo liquid,
providing independent evidence for a local moment origin of antiferromagnetism.
In URu$_2$Si$_2$ the hidden order is shown to emerge directly from the Kondo
liquid and so is not associated with local moment physics. Our results imply
that the nature of the ground state is strongly coupled with the hybridization

the Sr content range 0.145 < x < 0.33. We show that the x-dependence of the
previously observed field-induced broadening of the internal magnetic field
distribution above the superconducting transition temperature Tc reflects the
presence of two distinct contributions. One of these becomes less pronounced
with increasing x and is attributed to diminishing antiferromagnetic
correlations. The other grows with increasing x, but decreases above x ~ 0.30,
and is associated with the Curie-like term in the bulk magnetic susceptibility.
In contrast to the Curie-like term, however, this second contribution to the
TF-muSR line width extends back into the underdoped regime. Our findings imply
a coexistence of antiferromagnetically correlated and paramagnetic moments,
with the latter becoming dominant beyond x ~ 0.185. This suggests that the
doped holes do not neutralize all Cu spins via the formation of Zhang-Rice
singlets. Moreover, the paramagnetic component of the TF-muSR line width is
explained by holes progressively entering the Cu 3d_{x^2-y^2} orbital with

deliver a 700 kg science observatory payload to extra-Zodiacal orbit. This new
capability enables up to ~13X increased photometric sensitivity and ~160X
increased observing speed relative to a Sun-Earth L2, Earth-trailing, or Earth
orbit with no increase in telescope aperture. All enabling SEP stage
technologies for this launch service augmentation have reached sufficient
readiness (TRL-6) for Explorer Program application in conjunction with the
Falcon 9. We demonstrate that enabling Astrophysics Explorers to reach
extra-zodiacal orbit will allow this small payload program to rival the science
performance of much larger long development time systems; thus, providing a
means to realize major science objectives while increasing the SMD Astrophysics
portfolio diversity and resiliency to external budget pressure. The SEP
technology employed in this study has strong applicability to SMD Planetary
Science community-proposed missions. SEP is a stated flight demonstration

long-term stable (Dermott and Murray, 1981; Murray and Dermott, 1999). As the
lifetime of Earth's and Venus's horseshoe coorbitals is expected to be about a
Gyr, we investigated the possible contribution of late-escaping inner planet
coorbitals to the lunar Late Heavy Bombardment. Contrary to analytical
estimates, we do not find many horseshoe objects escaping after first 100 Myr.
In order to understand this behaviour, we ran a second set of simulations
featuring idealized planets on circular orbits with a range of masses. We find
that horseshoe coorbitals are generally long lived (and potentially stable) for
systems with primary-to-secondary mass ratios larger than about 1200. This is
consistent with results of Laughlin and Chambers (2002) for equal-mass pairs or
coorbital planets and the instability of Jupiter's horseshoe companions (Stacey
and Connors, 2008). Horseshoe orbits at smaller mass ratios are unstable
because they must approach within 5 Hill radii of the secondary. In contrast,
tadpole orbits are more robust and can remain stable even when approaching
within 4 Hill radii of the secondary.

neutral, and their understanding requires a generalization of multi-instanton

to the proliferation of social networks, such as LiveJournal, Flickr and

rapidly. An important problem in social network analysis is proximity
estimation that infers the closeness of different users. Link prediction, in
turn, is an important application of proximity estimation. However, many
methods for computing proximity measures have high computational complexity and
are thus prohibitive for large-scale link prediction problems. One way to
address this problem is to estimate proximity measures via low-rank
approximation. However, a single low-rank approximation may not be sufficient
to represent the behavior of the entire network. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Scale Link Prediction (MSLP), a framework for link prediction, which can
handle massive networks. The basis idea of MSLP is to construct low rank
approximations of the network at multiple scales in an efficient manner. Based
on this approach, MSLP combines predictions at multiple scales to make robust
and accurate predictions. Experimental results on real-life datasets with more
than a million nodes show the superior performance and scalability of our
method.

correlation functions of a complex $n\times n$ Gaussian matrix with independent
entries of mean zero and unit variance are asymptotically given by the
determinantal point process on $\mathbb{C}$ with kernel
$K_{\infty}(z,w):=\frac{1}{\pi}e^{-|z|^2/2-|w|^2/2+z\bar{w}}$ in the limit
$n\to\infty$. In this paper, we show that this asymptotic law is universal
among all random $n\times n$ matrices $M_n$ whose entries are jointly
independent, exponentially decaying, have independent real and imaginary parts
and whose moments match that of the complex Gaussian ensemble to fourth order.
Analogous results at the edge of the spectrum are also obtained. As an
application, we extend a central limit theorem for the number of eigenvalues of
complex Gaussian matrices in a small disk to these more general ensembles.
These results are non-Hermitian analogues of some recent universality results
for Hermitian Wigner matrices. However, a key new difficulty arises in the
non-Hermitian case, due to the instability of the spectrum for such matrices.
To resolve this issue, we the need to work with the log-determinants
$\log|\det(M_n-z_0)|$ rather than with the Stieltjes transform
$\frac{1}{n}\operatorname {tr}(M_n-z_0)^{-1}$, in order to exploit Girko's
Hermitization method. Our main tools are a four moment theorem for these
log-determinants, together with a strong concentration result for the
log-determinants in the Gaussian case. The latter is established by studying
the solutions of a certain nonlinear stochastic difference equation. With some
extra consideration, we can extend our arguments to the real case, proving
universality for correlation functions of real matrices which match the real
Gaussian ensemble to the fourth order. As an application, we show that a real
$n\times n$ matrix whose entries are jointly independent, exponentially
decaying and whose moments match the real Gaussian ensemble to fourth order has
$\sqrt{\frac{2n}{\pi}}+o(\sqrt{n})$ real eigenvalues asymptotically almost
surely.

work is to calibrate the p-factor if a Cepheid has both the BW distance and an
independent distance measurement, and examine the p-factor for delta Cephei --
the prototype of classical Cepheids. We calibrated the p-factor for several
Galactic Cepheids that have both the latest BW distances and independent
distances either from Hipparcos parallaxes or main-sequence fitting distances
to Cepheid-hosted stellar clusters. Based on 25 Cepheids, the calibrated
p-factor relation is consistent with latest p-factor relation in literature.
The calibrated p-factor relation also indicates that this relation may not be
linear and may exhibit an intrinsic scatter. We also examined the discrepancy
of empirical p-factors for delta Cephei, and found that the reasons for this
discrepancy include the disagreement of angular diameters, the treatment of
radial velocity data, and the phase interval adopted during the fitting
procedure. Finally, we investigated the impact of the input p-factor in two BW
methodologies for delta Cephei, and found that different p-factors can be
adopted in these BW methodologies and yet result in the same angular diameters.

proposed time-slot scheduling method first avoids time-slots assigned to nodes

of enhanced [OIII] emission. The spokes appear to consist of dense
condensations having low-excitation tails, possibly arising due to UV shadowing
and/or ram-pressure stripping of material. Line ratios imply that most of the
emission arises through photo-ionisation, and is unlikely to derive from
post-shock cooling regions. An analysis of these features in the MIR suggests
that they may also be associated with high levels of emission from polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), together with various permitted and forbidden
line transitions. Such high levels of PAH emission, where they are confirmed,
may develop as a result of preferentially enhanced FUV pumping of the
molecules, or shattering of larger grains within local shocks. Although H2
emission may also contribute to these trends, it is argued that shock-excited
transitions would lead to markedly differing results. We finally note that thin
filaments and ridges of [OIII] emission may indicate the presence of shock
activity at the limits of the interior envelope, as well as at various

generators into the power systems economy. Electricity markets currently are
run in a way that participating generators must supply contracted amounts. And
yet, renewable energy generators such as wind power generators cannot supply
contracted amounts with certainty. Thus, alternative market architectures must
be considered where there are aggregator entities who participate in the
electricity market by buying power from the renewable energy generators, and
assuming risk of any shortfall from contracted amounts. In this paper, we
propose auction mechanisms that can be used by the aggregators for procuring
stochastic resources, such as wind power. The nature of stochastic resources is
different from classical resources in that such a resource is only available
stochastically. The distribution of the generation is private information, and
the system objective is to truthfully elicit such information. We introduce a
variant of the VCG mechanism for this problem. We also propose a non-VCG
mechanism with a contracted-payment-plus-penalty payoff structure. We
generalize the basic mechanisms in various ways. We then consider the setting
where there are two classes of players to demonstrate the difficulty of auction
design in such scenarios. We also consider an alternative architecture where
the generators need to fulfill any shortfall from the contracted amount by
buying from the spot market.

growing acceptance that carrier pairing in these strongly correlated electronic
materials is mediated mainly by bosons of electronic origin rather than the
phonons. Still, a significant isotope exponent (IE) (in certain cases, much
larger than 0.5, the canonical BCS value) is observed experimentally. This has
led to the assumption that phonons are also involved up to a certain extent.
The magnitude of the IE in cuprates depends strongly on the number of doped
holes, p, in the CuO2 planes and therefore, may indicate that phonons play
different quantitative roles as the mediating boson at different regions of the
Tc-p phase diagram. Based on recent experiments on Fermi-surface reconstruction
from the thermoelectric transport measurements (Nature Commun. 2:432 doi:

YBa2Cu3O7-delta (Nature 477, 191 (2011)), we propose a very simple scenario
where isotope substitutions affect the stripe state via the coupling to the
lattice and thereby change the superconducting Tc. In this picture significant
part of the observed IE, over an extended p-range, originates from the isotope
induced stripe modulation and is not directly related to the characteristic
energy scale of the pairing phonons as is the case in the BCS framework. This
simple proposal qualitatively explains all the p-dependent anomalous features

of subsets of any set is a topology on that set. On the one hand, this system
is a common weakening of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ZF, the positive set
theory GPK and the theory of hyperuniverses. On the other hand, it retains most
of the expressiveness of these theories and has the same consistency strength
as ZF. We single out the additional axiom of the universal set as the one that
increases the consistency strength to that of GPK and explore several other
axioms and interrelations between those theories. Our results are independent
of whether the empty class is a set and whether atoms exist.

asymmetry $A_N$ at the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV in elastic

in the four-momentum transfer squared $t$ range $0.003 \leqslant |t| \leqslant
0.035$ $\GeVcSq$, the region of a significant interference between the
electromagnetic and hadronic scattering amplitudes. The measured values of
$A_N$ and its $t$-dependence are consistent with a vanishing hadronic spin-flip
amplitude, thus providing strong constraints on the ratio of the single
spin-flip to the non-flip amplitudes. Since the hadronic amplitude is dominated
by the Pomeron amplitude at this $\sqrt{s}$, we conclude that this measurement
addresses the question about the presence of a hadronic spin flip due to the
Pomeron exchange in polarized proton-proton elastic scattering.

obtain first- and second-order relativistic hydrodynamics of the relativistic
Boltzmann equation (RBE) as a dynamical system, with some corrections and new
unpublished results. For the first-order equation, we explicitly obtain the
distribution function in the asymptotic regime as the invariant manifold of the
dynamical system, which turns out to be nothing but the matching condition
defining the energy frame, i.e., the Landau-Lifshitz one. It is argued that the
frame on which the flow of the relativistic hydrodynamic equation is defined
must be the energy frame, if the dynamics should be consistent with the
underlying RBE. A sketch is also given for derivation of the second-order
hydrodynamic equation, i.e., extended thermodynamics, which is accomplished by
extending the invariant manifold so that it is spanned by excited modes as well
as the zero modes (hydrodynamic modes) of the linearized collision operator. On
the basis of thus constructed resummed distribution function, we propose a
novel ansatz for the functional form to be used in Grad moment method; it is
shown that our theory gives the same expressions for the transport coefficients
as those given in the Chapman-Enskog theory as well as the novel expressions
for the relaxation times and lengths allowing natural interpretation.

propositional terms with atomic propositions that may have side effects and
that are evaluated sequentially from left to right. Such propositional terms
are commonly used in programming languages to direct the flow of a program. In
this thesis we explore two such left-sequential logics. First we discuss Fully
Evaluated Left-Sequential Logic, which employs a full evaluation strategy,
i.e., to evaluate a term every one of its atomic propositions is evaluated
causing its possible side effects to occur. We then turn to Short-Circuit
(Left-Sequential) Logic as presented in [BP10b], where the evaluation may be
'short-circuited', thus preventing some, if not all, of the atomic propositions
in a term being evaluated. We propose evaluation trees as a natural semantics
for both logics and provide axiomatizations for the least identifying variant
of each. From this, we define a logic with connectives that prescribe a full
evaluation strategy as well as connectives that prescribe a short-circuit
evaluation strategy.

evolution of close binary systems in which the primary is a compact remnant and
the secondary is filling its Roche lobe, thus triggering mass transfer.
Although tidal locking is expected in such systems, most studies have neglected
the rotationally-induced mixing that may occur. Here we study the possible
effects of mixing in the mass-losing stars for a range in secondary star masses
and metallicities. We find that tidal locking can induce rotational mixing
prior to contact and thus affect the evolution of the secondary star if the
effects of the Spruit-Tayler dynamo are included both for angular momentum and
chemical transport. Once contact is made, the effect of mass transfer tends to
be more rapid than the evolutionary time scale, so the effects of mixing are no
longer directly important, but the mass transfer strips matter to inner layers
that may have been affected by the mixing. These effects are enhanced for
secondaries of 1-1.2 Msun and for lower metallicities. We discuss the possible
implications for the paucity of carbon in the secondaries of the cataclysmic
variable SS Cyg and the black hole candidate XTE J1118+480 and for the
progenitor evolution of Type Ia supernovae. We also address the issue of the
origin of blue straggler stars in globular and open clusters. We find that for
models that include rotation consistent with that observed for some blue
straggler stars, evolution is chemically homogeneous. This leads to tracks in
the HR diagram that are brighter and bluer than the non-rotating main-sequence
turn-off point. Rotational mixing could thus be one of the factors that
contribute to the formation of blue stragglers.

particles from multilayer deposits in a fully-developed turbulent boundary
layer. The rate of removal of particles from any given layer depends upon the
rate of removal of particles from the layer above which acts as a source of
uncovering and exposure of particles to the resuspending flow. The primary
resuspension rate constant for an individual particle within a layer is based
on the Rock'n'Roll (R'n'R) model using non-Gaussian statistics for the
aerodynamic forces acting on the particles (Zhang et al., 2012). The coupled
layer equations that describe multilayer resuspension of all the particles in
each layer are based on the generic lattice model of Friess & Yadigaroglu
(2001) which is extended here to include the influence of layer coverage and
particle size distribution. We consider the influence of layer thickness on the
resuspension along with the spread of adhesion within layers, and the
statistics of non-Gaussian versus Gaussian removal forces including their
timescale. Unlike its weak influence on long-term resuspension rates for
monolayers, this timescale plays a crucial and influential role in multilayer
resuspension. Finally we compare model predictions with those of a large-scale
and a mesoscale resuspension test, STORM (Castelo et al., 1999) and BISE
(Alloul-Marmor, 2002).

  of light",,,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we consider a process of plane wave scattering from a single
dielectric cylinder at oblique incidence under which it is possible to excite
long range cyclic Sommerfeld waves (CSWs) and consequently cyclic Sommerfeld
resonances (CSRs) of different orders. It is shown that the CSRs are analogous
to Wood's anomalies occurred under plane wave scattering from one dimensional
(1D) metallic diffraction gratings. The conditions which are necessary for an
effective excitation of CSWs and CSRs with high quality factors are analyzed.

systems with novel cloud, personalization and collaboration capabilities that
can serve the needs of more users, communities, and businesses. The project
develops a MediaWise Cloud platform that supports do-it-yourself creation,
search, management, and consumption of multimedia content. The MediaWise Cloud
supports pay-as-you-go models and elasticity that are similar to those offered
by commercially available cloud services. However, unlike existing commercial
CDN services providers such as Limelight Networks and Akamai the MediaWise
Cloud require no ownerships of computing infrastructure and instead rely on the
public Internet and public cloud services (e.g., commercial cloud storage to
store its content). In addition to integrating such public cloud services into
a public cloud-based Content Delivery Network, the MediaWise Cloud also
provides advanced Quality of Service (QoS) management as required for the
delivery of streamed and interactive high resolution multimedia content. In
this paper, we give a brief overview of MediaWise Cloud architecture and
present a comprehensive discussion on research objectives related to its
service components. Finally, we also compare the features supported by the
existing CDN services against the envisioned objectives of MediaWise Cloud.

disappearance over kilometer-scale baselines using six antineutrino detectors
at near and far distances from reactor cores at the Daya Bay nuclear power
complex. Liquid scintillator contained in transparent target vessels is used to
detect electron antineutrinos via the inverse beta-decay reaction. The Daya Bay
experiment will operate for about five years yielding a precision measurement
of sin22{\theta}13. We report on long-term studies of poly(methyl methacrylate)
known as acrylic, which is the primary material used in the fabrication of the
target vessels for the experiment's antineutrino detectors. In these studies,
acrylic samples are subjected to gaseous and liquid environmental conditions
similar to those experienced during construction, transport, and operation of
the Daya Bay acrylic target vessels and detectors. Mechanical and optical
stability of the acrylic as well as its interaction with detector liquids is
reported.

from positing only quantum laws at the fundamental level without notions of a
classical apparatus or collapse of the wave-function. Searching for a marked
target in a list of N items requires \Omega(N) oracle queries when using a
classical computer, while a quantum computer can accomplish the same task in
O{\sqrt{N}} queries using Grover's quantum algorithm. We study a closed quantum
system executing Grover algorithm in the framework of decoherent histories and
find it to be an exactly solvable model, thus yielding an alternate derivation
of Grover's famous result. We also subject the Grover-executing computer to a
generic external influence without needing to know the specifics of the
Hamiltonian insofar as the histories decohere. Depending on the amount of
decoherence, which is captured in our model by a single parameter related to
the amount of information obtained by the environment, the search time can
range from quantum to classical. Thus, we identify a key effect induced by the
environment that can adversely affect a quantum computer's performance and
demonstrate exactly how classical computing can emerge from quantum laws.

  (October 11, 2012)","10.1117/12.931026",,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss the deflection of light and Shapiro delay under the influence of
gravity as described by Schwarzschild metric. We obtain an exact expression
based on the coordinate velocity, as first set forth by Einstein, and present a
discussion on the effect of velocity anisotropy. We conclude that the
anisotropy in the coordinate velocity, as the velocity apparent to a distant
observer, gives rise to a third order error in the deflection angle, so that
the practical astronomical observations from gravitational lensing data remain
inconclusive on the anisotropy. However, measurement of Shapiro delay provides
a fairly convenient way to determine whether the spacetime is optically
anisotropic for a distant observer or not. We calculate the Shapiro delay for a
round trip path between Earth and Venus and observe excellent agreement to two
experimentally reported values measured during a time span of six months in
1967, without any need to extra fitting parameters. This is while the expected
delay obtained from an isotropic light velocity as described by Einstein's
model suffers from much larger errors under similar conditions. This article
illustrates the usefulness of the equivalent medium theory in understanding of
general theory of relativity.

  Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing (Allerton 2012)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fundamental limits of the cognitive interference channel (CIC) with two pairs
of transmitter-receiver has been under exploration for several years. In this
paper, we study the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel (DM-CIC)
in which the cognitive transmitter non-causally knows the message of the
primary transmitter. The capacity of this channel is not known in general; it
is only known in some special cases. Inspired by the concept of less noisy
broadcast channel (BC), in this work we introduce the notion of less noisy
cognitive interference channel. Unlike BC, due to the inherent asymmetry of the
cognitive channel, two different less noisy channels are distinguishable; these
are named the primary-less-noisy and cognitive-less-noisy channels. We derive
capacity region for the latter case, by introducing inner and outer bounds on
the capacity of the DM-CIC and showing that these bounds coincide for the
cognitive-less-noisy channel. Having established the capacity region, we prove
that superposition coding is the optimal encoding technique.

the semi-iterative methods under consideration are linked to a family of
co-dilated ultraspherical polynomials. This connection makes it possible to
increase the decay of the residual polynomials at the origin by means of a
dilation parameter. This increased decay has advantages when solving linear
ill-posed equations in which the spectrum of the involved operators is
clustered at the origin. The convergence order of the new semi-iterative
methods turns out to be the same as the convergence order of the original
\nu-methods. The new algorithms are tested numerically and a simple adaptive
scheme is developed in which an optimal dilation parameter is computed.
