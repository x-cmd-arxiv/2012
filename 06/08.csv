in microwave cavity arrays using current technology. The Kagome lattice
exhibits an exotic band structure with three bands one of which can be made
completely flat. The presence of artificial gauge fields allows to emulate
topological phases and induce chiral edge modes which can coexist inside the
energy gap with the flat band that is topologically trivial. By tuning the
artificial fluxes or in the presence of disorder, the flat band can also
acquire a bandwidth in energy allowing the coexistence between chiral edge
modes and bulk extended states; in this case the chiral modes become fragile
towards scattering into the bulk. The photonic system then exhibits equivalents
of both a quantum Hall effect without Landau levels, and an anomalous Hall
effect characterized by a non-quantized Chern number. We discuss experimental
observables such as local density of states and edge currents. We show how
synthetic uniform magnetic fields can be engineered, which allows an
experimental probe of Landau levels in the photonic Kagome lattice. We then
draw on semiclassical Boltzmann equations for transport to devise a method to
measure Berry's phases around loops in the Brillouin zone. The method is based
solely on wavepacket interference and can be used to determine band Chern
numbers or the photonic equivalent of the anomalous Hall response. We
demonstrate the robustness of these measurements towards on-site and
gauge-field disorder. We also show the stability of the anomalous quantum Hall
phase for nonlinear cavities and for (artificial) atom-photon interactions.

of passive galaxies at z>1.4 in a concentration of BzK-selected galaxies in the
COSMOS field. The observations have been conducted with Subaru/MOIRCS, and have
resulted in absorption lines and/or continuum detection for 18 out of 34
objects. This allows us to measure spectroscopic redshifts for a sample almost
complete to K(AB)=21. COSMOS photometric redshifts are found in fair agreement
overall with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a standard deviation of ~0.05;
however, ~30% of objects have photometric redshifts systematically
underestimated by up to ~25%. We show that these systematic offsets in
photometric redshifts can be removed by using these objects as a training set.
All galaxies fall in four distinct redshift spikes at z=1.43, 1.53, 1.67 and
1.82, with this latter one including 7 galaxies. SED fits to broad-band fluxes
indicate stellar masses in the range of ~4-40x10^10Msun and that star formation
was quenched ~1 Gyr before the cosmic epoch at which they are observed. The
spectra of several individual galaxies have allowed us to measure their
Hdelta_F and Dn4000 indices, which confirms their identification as passive
galaxies, as does a composite spectrum resulting from the coaddition of 17
individual spectra. The effective radii of the galaxies have been measured on
the HST/ACS F814W image, confirming the coexistence at these redshifts of
passive galaxies which are substantially more compact than their local
counterparts with others that follow the local size-stellar mass relation. For
the galaxy with best S/N spectrum we were able to measure a velocity dispersion
of 270+/-105 km/s, indicating that this galaxy lies closely on the virial
relation given its stellar mass and effective radius.

in one-dimensional quantum systems is introduced, which allows to adjust the
degree of phase and momentum randomization independently. Hence, the model is
able to describe the transport in an intermediate regime between classic and
quantum transport. The model is based on B\""uttiker's approach using fictitious
reservoirs for the dephasing effects. However, in contrast to other models, at
the fictitious reservoirs complete phase randomization is assumed, which
effectively divides the system into smaller coherent subsystems, and an
ensemble average over randomly distributed dephasing reservoirs is calculated.
This approach reduces not only the computation time but allows also to gain new
insight into system properties. In this way, after deriving an efficient
formula for the disorder-averaged resistance of a tight-binding chain, it is
shown that the dephasing-driven transition from localized-exponentially to
ohmic-linear behavior is not affected by the degree of momentum randomizing
dephasing.

fact that a $d$-critical graph has minimum degree at least $d - 1$. DeVos,

that a graph with minimum degree $d-1$ has an immersion of $K_d$ fails for
$d=10$ and $d\geq 12$ with a finite number of examples for each value of $d$,
and small chromatic number relative to $d$, but it is shown that a minimum

can be up to $(d-2)$-edge-connected. We show, using Haj\'os' Construction, that
there is an infinite class of non-$(d-1)$-colorable graphs that contain an

that a graph $G$ with minimum degree $d - 1$ and more than

sorting order using a improved snake like sorting algorithm with reduced

the absolute difference between processed pixels is greater than fixed

the median is checked using the above procedure. if found true then the pixel
is considered as noisy hence the corrupted pixel is replaced by the median of
the current processing window. If median is also noisy then replace the
corrupted pixel with unsymmetrical trimmed median else if the pixel is termed
uncorrupted and left unaltered. The proposed algorithm (PA) is tested on
varying detail images for various noises. The proposed algorithm effectively
removes the high density fixed value impulse noise, low density random valued

of Riemannian geometry, and of Einstein gravity, sheds light on actual
questions of physics and its philosophical reflection. After introducing the
theory's principles, it explains how Weyl geometric gravity relates to
Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. We then discuss the link between gravity and the
electroweak sector of elementary particle physics, as it looks from the Weyl
geometric perspective. Weyl's hypothesis of a preferred scale gauge, setting
Weyl scalar curvature to a constant, gets new support from the interplay of the
gravitational scalar field and the electroweak one (the Higgs field). This has
surprising consequences for cosmological models. In particular it leads to a
static (Weyl geometric) spacetime with ""inbuilt"" cosmological redshift. This
may be used for putting central features of the present cosmological model into
a wider perspective.

demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that it is always possible to
restore the excitonic degeneracy by the simultaneous application of large

to align the polarization of the exciton emission along the axis of the second

passes, the Dirac point moves to higher binding energies, indicating an

can be accelerated by intentionally exposing the surface to carbon monoxide and
other species. For a sufficiently strong band bending, additional states appear
at the Fermi level. These are interpreted as quantised conduction band states.
For large band bendings, these states are found to undergo a strong Rashba

valence band states. Different interpretations of similar data are also

problem where execution speed and resources used for computation are of extreme
importance, especially if we think about real time data processing. Most of the
traditional sorting techniques compute the process after receiving all of the
data and hence the process needs large amount of resources for data storage.
So, suitable design strategy needs to be adopted if we wish to sort a large
amount of data in real time, which essential means higher speed of process
execution and utilization of fewer resources in most of the cases. This paper
proposes a single chip scalable architecture based on Field Programmable Gate
Array(FPGA), for a modified counting sort algorithm where data acquisition and
sorting is being done in real time scenario. Our design promises to work
efficiently, where data can be accepted in the run time scenario without any
need of prior storage of data and also the execution speed of our algorithm is
invariant to the length of the data stream. The proposed design is implemented
and verified on Spartan 3E(XC3S500E-FG320) FPGA system. The results prove that
our design is better in terms of some of the design parameters compared to the

than they have been able to confirm as true planets. This situation is
especially acute with the Kepler survey, which has found over 2300 candidates
but has confirmed only 77 planets to date. I present here a general procedure
that can quickly be applied to any planet candidate to calculate its false
positive probability. This procedure takes into account the period, depth,
duration, and shape of the signal; the colors of the target star; arbitrary
spectroscopic or imaging follow-up observations; and informed assumptions about
the populations and distributions of field stars and multiple-star properties.
I also introduce the concept of the ""specific occurrence rate,"" which allows
for the calculation of the FPP without relying on an assumed planet radius
function. Applying these methods to a sample of known Kepler planets, I
demonstrate that many signals can be validated with very limited follow-up
observations: in most cases with only a spectrum and an AO image. Additionally,
I demonstrate that this procedure can reliably identify false positive signals.
Because of the computational efficiency of this analysis, it is feasible to
apply it to all Kepler planet candidates in the near future, and it will
streamline the follow-up efforts for Kepler and other current and future
transit surveys.

This resonance is due to a virtual bound state, in the atom-dimer system, which
is present at this low energy. When the mass ratio between the two fermionic
elements is increased, this virtual bound state goes to a known real bound
state which appears when the mass ratio reaches 8.17. This resonance should
affect a number of physical properties. These include the equation of state of
unbalanced mixtures at very low temperature but also the equation of state of
balanced mixtures at moderate or high temperature. The frequency and the
damping of collective modes should also provide a convenient way to evidence
this resonance. Finally it should be possible to modify the effective mass of
one the fermionic species by making use of an optical lattice. This would allow
to study the strong dependence of the resonance as a function of the mass ratio
of the two fermionic elements.

hemirings; A characterization of J-semisimple hemirings; A description of
J-semisimple congruence-simple hemirings; A characterization of finite

gravitationally-lensed QSOs with multiple images. We seek to establish whether
microlensing is occurring in each QSO image using only single-epoch
observations. We calculate flux ratios for the cores of emission lines in image
pairs to set a baseline for no microlensing. The offset of the continuum flux
ratios relative to this baseline yields the microlensing magnification free
from extinction, as extinction affects the continuum and the lines equally.
When we find chromatic microlensing, we attempt to constrain the size of the
QSO accretion disk. SDSSJ1004+4112 and HE1104-1805 show chromatic microlensing
with amplitudes $0.2< |\Delta m| < 0.6$ and $0.2< |\Delta m| < 0.4$ mag,
respectively. Modeling the accretion disk with a Gaussian source ($I\propto
\exp(-R^2/2r_s^2)$) of size $r_s\propto \lambda^p$ and using magnification maps
to simulate microlensing we find $r_s(\lambda 3363)=7\pm3 light-days
(18.1\pm7.8 \times 10^{15} cm$) and $p=1.1\pm 0.4$ for SDSS1004+4112, and
$r_s(\lambda 3363)=6\pm2 light-days (15.5\pm5.2 \times 10^{15} cm$) and
$p=0.7\pm0.1$ for HE1104-1805. For SDSSJ1029+2623 we find strong chromaticity
of $\sim 0.4$ mag in the continuum flux ratio, which probably arises from
microlensing although not all the available data fit within this explanation.
For Q0957+561 we measure B-A magnitude differences of 0.4 mag, much greater
than the $\sim$0.05 mag amplitude usually inferred from lightcurve variability.
It may substantially modify the current interpretations of microlensing in this
system, likely favoring the hypothesis of smaller sources and/or larger
microdeflectors. For HS0818+1227, our data yield posible evidence of
microlensing.

even larger reduction of the scattering coefficient. Furthermore, the annealing
has no significant influence on the \emph{intrinsic} light yield. An additional
absorption occurring at $\sim400$ nm suggests the formation of O$^-$ hole
centers. Light-yield measurements at room temperature where one crystal surface
was mechanically roughened showed an increase of the \emph{measured} light
yield by $\sim40 %$ and an improvement of the energy resolution at 59.5 keV by

for the also observed reduction of the scattering coefficient after annealing.

(V=8.77) primary star of the HD 42176 binary system. The host is a slightly
evolved late F-star likely in the very short-lived ""blue-hook"" stage of
evolution, with $\teff=6148\pm48{\rm K}$, $\log{g}=4.030_{-0.026}^{+0.015}$ and
$\feh=0.034\pm0.78$. The inferred stellar mass is
$M_*=1.314_{-0.060}^{+0.063}$\msun\ and the star has a relatively large radius
of $R_*=1.836_{-0.046}^{+0.066}$\rsun. The planet is a typical hot Jupiter with
period $4.11379\pm0.00001$ days and a mass of $M_P=1.524\pm0.088$\mj\ and
radius of $R_P=1.290_{-0.050}^{+0.064}$\rj. This is mildly inflated as compared
to models of irradiated giant planets at the $\sim$4 Gyr age of the system.
KELT-2A is the third brightest star with a transiting planet identified by
ground-based transit surveys, and the ninth brightest star overall with a
transiting planet. KELT-2Ab's mass and radius are unique among the subset of
planets with $V<9$ host stars, and therefore increases the diversity of bright
benchmark systems. We also measure the relative motion of KELT-2A and -2B over
a baseline of 38 years, robustly demonstrating for the first time that the
stars are bound. This allows us to infer that KELT-2B is an early K-dwarf. We
hypothesize that through the eccentric Kozai mechanism KELT-2B may have
emplaced KELT-2Ab in its current orbit. This scenario is potentially testable
with Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements, which should have an amplitude of
$\sim$44 m s$^{-1}$.

the strength of several absorption features sensitive to the presence of
low-mass stars. Our sample comprises ~40,000 ETGs from the SPIDER survey
(z<0.1). The data, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, are combined,
rejecting both noisy data, and spectra with contamination from telluric lines,
resulting in a set of 18 stacked spectra at high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N>
400 per A). A combined analysis of IMF-sensitive line strengths and spectral
fitting is performed with the latest state-of the art population synthesis
models (an extended version of the MILES models). A significant trend is found
between IMF slope and velocity dispersion, towards an excess of low-mass stars
in the most massive galaxies. Although we emphasize that accurate values of the
IMF slope will require a detailed analysis of chemical composition (such as
[a/Fe] or even individual element abundance ratios), the observed trends
suggest that low-mass ETGs are better fit by a Kroupa-like IMF, whereas massive
galaxies require bottom-heavy IMFs, exceeding the Salpeter slope at velocity
dispersions above 200km/s.

greatly limited by a dearth of data and an excess of free parameters - from

from AGN. This paper presents a simple FIR SED fitting technique joining a
modified, single dust temperature greybody, representing the reprocessed
starburst emission in the whole galaxy, to a mid-infrared powerlaw, which
approximates hot-dust emission from AGN heating or clumpy, hot starbursting
regions. This FIR SED can be used to measure infrared luminosities, dust
temperatures and dust masses for both local and high-z galaxies with 3 to 10+
FIR photometric measurements.
  This fitting method is compared to infrared template SEDs in the literature
using photometric data on 65 local luminous and ultraluminous infrared
galaxies, (U)LIRGs. Despite relying only on 2-4 free parameters, the coupled
greybody/powerlaw SED fitting described here produces better fits to
photometric measurements than best-fit literature template SEDs (with residuals
a factor of ~2 lower). A mean emissivity index of beta=1.60+-0.38 and
mid-infrared powerlaw slope of alpha=2.0+-0.5 is measured; the former agrees
with the widely presumed emissivity index of beta=1.5 and the latter is
indicative of an optically-thin dust medium with a shallow radial density
profile, ~r^-0.5. Adopting characteristic dust temperature as the inverse
wavelength where the SED peaks, dust temperatures ~25-45K are measured for
local (U)LIRGs, ~5-15K colder than previous estimates using only simple
greybodies. This comparative study highlights the impact of SED fitting
assumptions on the measurement of physical properties such as infrared
luminosity (and thereby infrared-based star formation rate), dust temperature
and dust mass, for both local and high-redshift galaxies. [abridged]

are located far from star clusters. It is known that some of these stars are
runaways and therefore most likely were formed in embedded clusters and then
ejected into the field because of dynamical few-body interactions or
binary-supernova explosions. However, there exists a group of field O stars
whose runaway status is difficult to prove via direct proper motion
measurements or whose low space velocities and/or young ages appear to be
incompatible with their large separation from known star clusters. The
existence of this group led some authors to believe that field O stars can form
in situ. In this paper, we examine the runaway status of the best candidates
for isolated formation of massive stars in the Milky Way and the Magellanic
Clouds by searching for bow shocks around them, by using the new reduction of
the Hipparcos data, and by searching for stellar systems from which they could
originate within their lifetimes. We show that most of the known O stars
thought to have formed in isolation are instead very likely runaways. We show
also that the field must contain a population of O stars whose low space
velocities and/or young ages are in apparent contradiction with the large
separation of these stars from their parent clusters and/or the ages of these
clusters. These stars (the descendants of runaway massive binaries) cannot be
traced back to their parent clusters and therefore can be mistakenly considered
as having formed in situ. We argue also that some field O stars could be
detected in optical wavelengths only because they are runaways, while their
cousins residing in the deeply embedded parent clusters might still remain
totally obscured. The main conclusion of our study is that there is no
significant evidence whatsoever in support of the in situ proposal on the
origin of massive stars.

less important for minor mergers - scatters relatively more dark matter
particles than bulge particles to small. Stripping in minor mergers assembles
stellar satellite particles at large radii in halo dominated regions of the
massive host. This strongly increases the size of the bulge into regions with
higher dark matter fractions leaving the inner host structure almost unchanged.
A factor of two mass increase by minor mergers increases the dark matter
fraction by 20 per cent. We present analytic corrections to simple
one-component virial estimates for the evolution of the gravitational radii. If
such a two-component system grows by minor mergers alone its size growth,
$r_{\mathrm{e}} \propto M^\alpha$, reaches values of $\alpha \approx 2.4$,
significantly exceeding the simple theoretical limit of $\alpha = 2$. For major
mergers the sizes grow with $\alpha \lesssim 1$. Our results indicate that
minor mergers of galaxies embedded in massive dark matter halos provide a
potential mechanism for explaining the rapid size growth and the build-up of
massive elliptical systems predicting significant dark matter fractions and
radially biased velocity dispersions at large radii (abbreviated)

""pi-over-eight"" gate corresponds to one-eighth of a complete rotation about the
vertical axis. This simple gate often plays an important role in quantum
information theory, typically in situations for which Pauli and Clifford gates
are insufficient. Most notably, when it supplements the set of Clifford gates
then universal quantum computation can be achieved. The ""pi-over-eight"" gate is
the simplest example of an operation from the third level of the Clifford
hierarchy (i.e., it maps Pauli operations to Clifford operations under
conjugation). Here we derive explicit expressions for all qudit (d-level, where
d is prime) versions of this gate and analyze the resulting group structure
that is generated by these diagonal gates. This group structure differs
depending on whether the dimensionality of the qudit is two, three or greater
than three. We then discuss the geometrical relationship of these gates (and
associated states) with respect to Clifford gates and stabilizer states. We
present evidence that these gates are maximally robust to depolarizing and
phase damping noise, in complete analogy with the qubit case. Motivated by this
and other similarities we conjecture that these gates could be useful for the
task of qudit magic-state distillation and, by extension, fault-tolerant
quantum computing. Very recent, independent work by Campbell, Anwar and Browne
confirms the correctness of this intuition, and we build upon their work to
characterize noise regimes for which noisy implementations of these gates can
(or provably cannot) supplement Clifford gates to enable universal quantum
computation.

feature into an ellipsoid which implies that the bump in the galaxy correlation
function occurs at different scales in the radial and transverse correlation
functions. We compute these for the first time, under the approximation that

The radial and transverse correlation functions are very different from those
of the concordance model, even when the models have the same average BAO scale.
This implies that if void models are fine-tuned to satisfy average BAO data,
there is enough extra information in the correlation functions to distinguish a
void model from the concordance model. We expect these new features to remain
when the full perturbation equations are solved, which means that the radial

that constant-depth circuits can only implement a finite group of encoded gates

""turned off"" for at least some steps in the computation in order to achieve
universality. For the 3D geometry we show that an encoded gate U is
implementable by a constant-depth circuit only if the image of any Pauli
operator under conjugation by U belongs to the Clifford group. This class of
gates includes some non-Clifford gates such as the \pi/8 rotation. Our

exploiting deep photometric data from the CFHTLS, we probe the number of
companions per BCG (Nc) with luminosity ratios down to those corresponding to
potential minor mergers of 20:1. We also measure the average luminosity in
companions per galaxy (Lc). We find that Nc and Lc rise steeply with luminosity
ratio for both the BCGs, and a control sample of other bright, red, cluster
galaxies. The trend for BCGs rises more steeply, resulting in a larger number
of close companions. For companions within 50kpc of a BCG, Nc= 1.38+/-0.14 and
Lc=(2.14+/-0.31)x10^(10)L_sun and for companions within 50kpc of a luminosity
matched control sample of non-BCGs, Nc=0.87+/-0.08 and
Lc=(1.48+/-0.20)x10^(10)L_sun. This suggests that the BCGs are likely to
undergo more mergers compared to otherwise comparable luminous galaxies.
Additionally, compared to a local sample of luminous red galaxies, the more
distant sample presented in this study (with redshifts between 0.15-0.39,)
shows a higher Nc, suggesting the younger and smaller BCGs are still undergoing
hierarchical formation. Using the Millennium Simulations we model and estimate
the level of contamination due to unrelated cluster galaxies. The contamination
by interloping galaxies is 50% within projected separations of 50kpc, but
within 30kpc, 60% of identified companions are real physical companions. We
conclude that the luminosity of bound merger candidates down to luminosity
ratios of 20:1 could be adding as much as 10% to the mass of a typical BCG over
0.5Gyr at redshifts of z~0.3.

fluid and methods in the lab to these constraints, this is hardly possible for
industrial mixers. We present in this article a novel measurement technique
which is suitable for opaque or granular flows: an instrumented particle, which
continuously transmits the force/acceleration acting on it as it is advected in
a flow. Its density is adjustable for a wide range of fluids and because of its
small size and its wireless data transmission, the system can be used both in
industrial and scientific mixers allowing a better understanding of the flow
within. We demonstrate the capabilities and precision of the particle by
comparing its transmitted acceleration to alternative measurements, in
particular in the case of a turbulent von K\'arm\'an flow. Our technique shows
to be an efficient and fast tool to characterize flows.

orthosis to the net joint torques in order to select the proper actuator for
the joint. Depending on the disability of each patient, different controllers
can be designed. As a matter of fact, the duration of the gait cycle for each

parameters are tuned by optimizing a cost function which takes into account the
patients muscle power and the error of the knee angle with the reference value.
Moreover, the final time is obtained by minimizing the mean of integral squared
errors. The performance of the method is shown by designing the controller for
three types of patients, ordered from low to high disability. The objective of
this work is to use optimal control techniques based on physiological static

range of molecular gas mass fractions in the galaxies in this sample and
explore the correlation of the far-infrared luminosity, which traces star
formation, with the CO luminosity, which traces the molecular gas mass. By
comparing the NGLS data with merging galaxies at low and high redshift which
have also been observed in the CO J=3-2 line, we show that the correlation of
far-infrared and CO luminosity shows a significant trend with luminosity. This
trend is consistent with a molecular gas depletion time which is more than an
order of magnitude faster in the merger galaxies than in nearby normal
galaxies. We also find a strong correlation of the L(FIR)/L(CO3-2) ratio with
the atomic to molecular gas mass ratio. This correlation suggests that some of
the far-infrared emission originates from dust associated with atomic gas and
that its contribution is particularly important in galaxies where most of the

composition observations exceeds the errors of individual measurements. This
may indicate that there are mechanisms of the change in the composition of
matter in the Universe after the completion of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We
have calculated the destruction and production rates of light isotopes (D, 3He,
4He) under the influence of photonuclear reactions triggered by the gamma-ray
emission from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We investigate the destruction and
production of light elements depending on the spectral characteristics of the
gamma-ray emission. We show that in comparison with previous works, taking into
account the influence of spectral hardness on the photonuclear reaction rates
can increase the characteristic radii of influence of the gamma-ray emission
from AGNs by a factor of 2-8. The high gamma-ray luminosities of AGNs observed
in recent years increase the previous estimates of the characteristic radii by
two orders of magnitude. This may suggest that the influence of the emission

the temporal correlation/channel memory inherent in the Markovian channels to
improve network performance. However, designing low-complexity and
throughput-optimal algorithms under temporal correlation is a challenging
problem. In this paper, we find that under an average number of transmissions
constraint, a low-complexity index policy is throughput-optimal. The policy
uses Whittle's index value, which was previously used to capture opportunistic
scheduling under temporally correlated channels. Our results build on the
interesting finding that, under the intricate queue length and channel memory
evolutions, the importance of scheduling a user is captured by a simple
multiplication of its queue length and Whittle's index value. The proposed
queue-based index policy has provably low complexity. Numerical results show
that significant throughput gains can be realized by exploiting the channel

The companion is a low-mass brown dwarf or super-massive planet with mass of
27.23+/-0.50 MJ and radius of 1.110+0.037-0.024 RJ, on a very short period
(P=1.21750007) circular orbit. KELT-1b receives a large amount of stellar
insolation, with an equilibrium temperature assuming zero albedo and perfect
redistribution of 2422 K. Upper limits on the secondary eclipse depth indicate
that either the companion must have a non-zero albedo, or it must experience
some energy redistribution. Comparison with standard evolutionary models for
brown dwarfs suggests that the radius of KELT-1b is significantly inflated.
Adaptive optics imaging reveals a candidate stellar companion to KELT-1, which
is consistent with an M dwarf if bound. The projected spin-orbit alignment
angle is consistent with zero stellar obliquity, and the vsini of the primary
is consistent with tidal synchronization. Given the extreme parameters of the
KELT-1 system, we expect it to provide an important testbed for theories of the
emplacement and evolution of short-period companions, and theories of tidal
dissipation and irradiated brown dwarf atmospheres.

Their precession frequency changes with parameters and it may change sign,
passing through zero. When this happens, the dynamical system is very sensitive
to imperfections that break the SO(2) symmetry and the waves may become trapped
by the imperfections, resulting in steady solutions that exist in a finite
region in parameter space. This is the so-called pinning phenomenon. In this
study, we analyze the breaking of the SO(2) symmetry in a dynamical system
close to a Hopf bifurcation whose frequency changes sign along a curve in
parameter space. The problem is very complex, as it involves the complete
unfolding of high codimension. A detailed analysis of different types of
imperfections indicates that a pinning region surrounded by infinite-period
bifurcation curves appears in all cases. Complex bifurcational processes,
strongly dependent on the specifics of the symmetry breaking, appear very close
to the intersection of the Hopf bifurcation and the pinning region. Scaling
laws of the pinning region width, and partial breaking of SO(2) to Zm, are also
considered. Previous and new experimental and numerical studies of pinned

mechanism is at work in the galaxy's disc to flatten the oxygen abundance
gradient. Using the starburst99 model, we estimate the ages of the young
populations, and again find no variations in age between the bar and the arms
or as a function of radius. Instead, we find evidence for two galaxy-wide waves
of star formation, about 7.1 Myr and 10.5 Myr ago. While the bar in NGC5430 is

could induce widespread star formation on such a short time-scale.

The devices were specifically designed to completely separate heat related
effects from charge related effects. A pure heat current through the nanopillar
spin valve, a stack of two ferromagnetic layers (F) separated by a non-magnetic
layer (N), leads to a thermovoltage proportional to the spin-dependent Seebeck
coefficient S_{S}=S_{\uparrow}-S_{\downarrow} of the ferromagnet, where
S_{\uparrow} and S_{\downarrow} are the Seebeck coefficient for spin-up and
spin-down electrons. By using a three-dimensional finite-element model (3D-FEM)
based on spin-dependent thermoelectric theory, whose input material parameters
were measured in separate devices, we were able to accurately determine a
spin-dependent Seebeck coefficient of -1.8 microvolt/Kelvin and -4.5
microvolt/Kelvin for cobalt and permalloy, respectively corresponding to a
Seebeck coefficient polarization P_{S}=S_{S}/S_{F} of 0.08 and 0.25, where
S_{F} is the Seebeck coefficient of the ferromagnet. The results are in
agreement with earlier theoretical work in Co/Cu multilayers and spin-dependent

Balmer emission line widths, $v_{\rm FWHM}$, as a proxy for disc circular

accurate TFRs given the small $3""$ diameter of the fibres used for SDSS
spectroscopic measurements. However, we show by modelling the H$\alpha$

appropriate redshifts ($z>0.045$) the fibres sample enough of the disc to
obtain a linear relationship between $v_{\rm FWHM}$ and $v_{\rm circ}$,
allowing us to obtain a TFR and to investigate dependence on other variables.
We also develop a methodology for distinguishing between astrophysical and
sample bias in the fibre TFR trends. We observe the well-known steepening of
the TFR in redder bands in our sample. We divide the sample of galaxies into
four equal groups using projected neighbour density ($\Sigma$) quartiles and
find no significant dependence on environment, extending previous work to a
wider range of environments and a much larger sample. Having demonstrated that

clients is important to reduce the data access delay. However, efficient cache
invalidation strategies are used to ensure the consistency between the data in
the cache of mobile clients and at the database server. Servers use
invalidation reports (IRs) to inform the mobile clients about data item
updates. This paper proposes and implements a multicast based strategy to
maintain cache consistency in mobile environment using AVI as the cache
invalidation scheme. The proposed algorithm is outlined as follows - To resolve
a query, the mobile client searches its cache to check if its data is valid. If
yes, then query is answered, otherwise the client queries the DTA (Dynamic
Transmitting Agent) for latest updates and the query is answered. If DTA
doesn't have the latest updates, it gets it from the server. So, the main idea
here is that DTA will be multicasting updates to the clients and hence the
clients need not uplink to the server individually, thus preserving the network
bandwidth. The scenario of simulation is developed in Java. The results
demonstrate that the traffic generated in the proposed multicast model is
simplified and it also retains cache consistency when compared to the existing
methods that used broadcast strategy.

equation that makes it possible to avoid the difficulty associated with a
transition from large propagation angles to the case of strictly longitudinal
propagation. Our approach is based on the theory, originally developed by the
Zvonkov and Timofeev [1], who used the paraxial approximation for the magnetic
field strength, but did not consider the slope of the magnetic field lines,
which led to considerable error, as has been recently noted by Gospodchikov and
Smolyakova [2]. We have found ray trajectories in analytic form and
demonstrated that the inhomogeneity of both the magnetic field strength and the
field direction can qualitatively change the picture of wave propagation and
significantly affect the efficiency of electron cyclotron heating of a plasma
in a linear magnetic trap. Analysis of the ray trajectories has revealed a
criterion for the resonance point on the axis of the trap to be an attractor
for the ray trajectories. It is also shown that a family of ray trajectories
can still reach the resonance point on the axis if the latter generally repels
the ray trajectories.
  As an example, results of general theory are applied to the electron
cyclotron resonance heating experiment which is under preparation on the Gas
Dynamic Trap in the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics [3].

constraints and player 2, who controls the transition probabilities, has
realization based constraints which can also depend on the strategies of player
1. Next, we consider a N -player nonzero sum constrained stochastic game with

discussed in [2]. We show that the stationary Nash equilibria of both classes

emission. The detection of gamma rays from star-forming galaxies by the Fermi
Large Area Telescope (LAT) has allowed the determination of a functional
relationship between star formation rate and gamma-ray luminosity (Ackermann
et. al. 2012). Since star formation is known to scale with total infrared
(8-1000 micrometers) and radio (1.4 GHz) luminosity, the observed infrared and
radio emission from a star-forming galaxy can be used to quantitatively infer
the galaxy's gamma-ray luminosity. Similarly, star forming galaxies within
galaxy clusters allow us to derive lower limits on the gamma-ray emission from
clusters, which have not yet been conclusively detected in gamma rays. In this
study we apply the relationships between gamma-ray luminosity and radio and IR
luminosities derived in Ackermann et. al. 2012 to a sample of galaxy clusters
from Ackermann et. al. 2010 in order to place lower limits on the gamma-ray
emission associated with star formation in galaxy clusters. We find that
several clusters have predicted lower limits on gamma-ray emission that are
within an order of magnitude of the upper limits derived in Ackermann et. al.
2010 based on non-detection by Fermi-LAT. Given the current gamma-ray limits,
star formation likely plays a significant role in the gamma-ray emission in
some clusters, especially those with cool cores. We predict that both Fermi-LAT
over the course of its lifetime and the future Cherenkov Telescope Array will
be able to detect gamma-ray emission from star-forming galaxies in clusters.

Here, we specifically highlight differences between AO- and HST-derived lens
models, finding that -- at least when the lens and source galaxies are both
bright and red, and the system has a high degree of circular symmetry --
AO-derived models place significantly tighter constraints on model parameters.
Using this improved precision, we infer important physical properties about the
B1938+666 system, including the mass density slope of the lensing galaxy (gamma
= 2.045), the projected dark matter mass fraction within the Einstein radius
(M_dark/M_lens = 0.55), and the total magnification factor of the source galaxy

substructure (M_V > 16.2), based on the non-detection of bright satellite

the AO data to reveal the presence of faint arcs outside of the primary
Einstein ring. The positions and orientations of these arcs raise the
intriguing possibility that B1938+666 has a second source galaxy, located at a
more distant redshift. However, future work is needed to verify this

this paper we present a minimal actor calculus that takes as primitive the
basic constructs of Scala's Actors API. More precisely, actors can send
asynchronous messages, process received messages according to a pattern
matching mechanism, and dynamically create new actors, whose scope can be
extruded by passing actor names as message parameters. Drawing inspiration from
the linear types and session type theories developed for process calculi, we
put forward a behavioural type system that addresses the key issues of an actor
calculus. We then study a safety property dealing with the determinism of
finite actor com- munication. More precisely, we show that well typed and
balanced actor systems are (i) deadlock-free and (ii) any message will
eventually be handled by the target actor, and dually no actor will

the asymmetry may have more than one node, which is an effect that should be
taken into account, e.g. for parameterizations of the strange and anti-strange

overestimates it largely. On the other hand for FeTe, GGA is better
approximation that gives experimentally observed magnetic state. It has been
shown that the height of chalcogen atoms above Fe layers has significant effect
on band structure, electronic density of states (DOS) at Fermi level N(EF) and
Fermi surfaces. For FeSe the value of N(EF) is small so as to satisfy Stoner
criteria for ferromagnetism, (I\timesN(EF)\geq1) whereas for FeTe, since the
value of N(EF) is large, the same is close to be satisfied. Force minimization
done for FeTexSe1-x using supercell approach shows that in disordered system Se
and Te do not share same site and have two distinct z coordinates. This has
small effect on magnetic energy but no significant difference in band structure
and DOS near EF when calculated using either relaxed or average value of z for
chalcogen atoms. Thus substitution of Se at Te site decreases average value of
chalcogen height above Fe layers which in turn affect the magnetism and
Fermiology in the system. By using coherent-potential approximation for

bounded by a walk of length 4, parallel edges allowed. All quadrangulations can
be generated by a sequence of graph operations called vertex splitting,
starting from the path P_2 of length 2. We define the degree D of a splitting S
and consider restricted splittings S_{i,j} with i <= D <= j. It is known that
S_{2,3} generate all simple quadrangulations.
  Here we investigate the cases S_{1,2}, S_{1,3}, S_{1,1}, S_{2,2}, S_{3,3}.
First we show that the splittings S_{1,2} are exactly the monotone ones in the
sense that the resulting graph contains the original as a subgraph. Then we
show that they define a set of nontrivial ancestors beyond P_2 and each
quadrangulation has a unique ancestor.
  Our results have a direct geometric interpretation in the context of
mechanical equilibria of convex bodies. The topology of the equilibria
corresponds to a 2-coloured quadrangulation with independent set sizes s, u.
The numbers s, u identify the primary equilibrium class associated with the
body by V\'arkonyi and Domokos. We show that both S_{1,1} and S_{2,2} generate
all primary classes from a finite set of ancestors which is closely related to
their geometric results.
  If, beyond s and u, the full topology of the quadrangulation is considered,
we arrive at the more refined secondary equilibrium classes. As Domokos,
L\'angi and Szab\'o showed recently, one can create the geometric counterparts
of unrestricted splittings to generate all secondary classes. Our results show
that S_{1,2} can only generate a limited range of secondary classes from the
same ancestor. The geometric interpretation of the additional ancestors defined
by monotone splittings shows that minimal polyhedra play a key role in this
process. We also present computational results on the number of secondary

(n_sersic<1.5), while more bulge-dominated objects often have lower specific
SFRs. For disk galaxies, a much tighter correlation (sigma=0.19dex) is obtained
if the rest-frame H-band luminosity is used instead of stellar mass derived
from multicolor photometry. The specific SFR (sSFR) correlates strongly with
rest-frame optical colors (hence luminosity-weighted stellar age) and also with
clumpiness (which likely reflects the molecular gas fraction). This implies
that most of the observed scatter is real, despite its low level, and not
dominated by random measurement errors. After correcting for these differential
effects a remarkably small dispersion remains (sigma=0.14dex), suggesting that
measurement errors in mass or SFR are ~0.10dex, excluding systematic
uncertainties. Measurement errors in stellar masses, the thickening of the
correlation due to real sSFR variations, and varying completeness with stellar
mass, can spuriously bias the derived slope to lower values due to the finite
range over which observables (mass and SFR) are available. When accounting for
these effects, the intrinsic slope for the main sequence for disk galaxies gets
closer to unity.

system that exhibits discontinuous shear thickening. Using magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), the local properties of the flow are obtained by the
determination of local velocity profiles and concentrations in a Couette cell.
For low rotational rates, we observe shear localization characteristic of yield
stress fluids. When the overall shear rate is increased, the width of the
sheared region increases. The discontinuous shear thickening is found to set in
at the end of this shear localization regime when all of the fluid is sheared:
the existence of a nonflowing region, thus, seems to prevent or delay shear
thickening. Macroscopic observations using different measurement geometries
show that the smaller the gap of the shear cell, the lower the shear rate at
which shear thickening sets in. We, thus, propose that the discontinuous shear
thickening of cornstarch suspensions is a consequence of dilatancy: the system
under flow attempts to dilate but instead undergoes a jamming transition,
because it is confined. This proposition is confirmed by an independent
measurement of the dilation of the suspension as a function of the shear rate.
It is also explains the MRI observations: when flow is localized, the
nonflowing region plays the role of a ""dilatancy reservoir"" which allows the
material to be sheared without jamming.

photometric precision of ~5 mmag, with little or no dependence on the

precision by a factor ~1.3 with respect to a pure white noise regime. Based on
a detailed stellar variability analysis, a) we detected no transit-like events;
b) we determined photometric rotation periods of ~0.47 days and ~0.22 days for
LHS 3445 and GJ 1167A, respectively; c) these values agree with the large
projected rotational velocities (~25 km/s and ~33 km/s, respectively) inferred
for both stars based on the analysis of archival spectra; d) the estimated
inclinations of the stellar rotation axes for LHS 3445 and GJ 1167A are

low-amplitude flaring events were recorded for LHS 3445 and LHS 2686. Finally,
based on simulations of transit signals of given period and amplitude injected
in the actual (nightly reduced) photometric data for our sample, we derive a
relationship between transit detection probability and phase coverage. We find
that, using the BLS search algorithm, even when phase coverage approaches 100%,
there is a limit to the detection probability of ~90%. Around program stars
with phase coverage >50% we would have had >80% chances of detecting planets

It is generally understood that the oscillation period hc/2e in the
superconducting state is half the period hc/e in the metallic state, because
the supercurrent is carried by Cooper pairs with a charge 2e. On the basis of
the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory we discuss, in which cases this simple
interpretation is valid and when a more careful analysis is needed. In fact,
the knowledge of the oscillation period of the current in the ring provides
information on the electron interactions. In particular, we analyze the
crossover from the hc/e periodic normal current to the hc/2e periodic
supercurrent upon turning on a pairing interaction in a metal ring. Further, we

sex with men (MSM), hinders an evidence-based response to the HIV epidemics.
Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was developed to overcome sampling challenges
in studies of populations like MSM for which sampling frames are absent.
Internet-based RDS (webRDS) can potentially circumvent limitations of the
original RDS method. We aimed to implement and evaluate webRDS among a hidden
population.
  Methods and Design: This cross-sectional study took place 18 February to 12
April, 2011 among MSM in Vietnam. Inclusion criteria were men, aged 18 and
above, who had ever had sex with another man and were living in Vietnam.
Participants were invited by an MSM friend, logged in, and answered a survey.
Participants could recruit up to four MSM friends. We evaluated the system by
its success in generating sustained recruitment and the degree to which the
sample compositions stabilized with increasing sample size.
  Results: Twenty starting participants generated 676 participants over 24
recruitment waves. Analyses did not show evidence of bias due to ineligible
participation. Estimated mean age was 22 year and 82% came from the two large
metropolitan areas. 32 out of 63 provinces were represented. The median number
of sexual partners during the last six months was two. The sample composition
stabilized well for 16 out of 17 variables.
  Conclusion: Results indicate that webRDS could be implemented at a low cost
among Internet-using MSM in Vietnam. WebRDS may be a promising method for
sampling of Internet-using MSM and other hidden groups.

fluctuations and applied forces on one side, and the strong resistance exerted
by fluid viscosity on the other. Friction is so strong that completely
neglecting inertia - the overdamped approximation - gives an excellent
effective description of the actual particle mechanics. In sharp contrast with
this result, here we show that the overdamped approximation dramatically fails
when thermodynamic quantities such as the entropy production in the environment
is considered, in presence of temperature gradients. In the limit of
vanishingly small, yet finite inertia, we find that the entropy production is
dominated by a contribution that is anomalous, i.e. has no counterpart in the
overdamped approximation. This phenomenon, that we call entropic anomaly, is
due to a symmetry-breaking that occurs when moving to the small, finite inertia
limit. Strong production of anomalous entropy is traced back to intense sweeps
down the temperature gradient.

equations is limited in stability because it approximates the exact

exponential-splitting method of deriving symplectic integrators, explicit
symplectic finite-difference methods produce Saul'yev-type schemes which
approximate the exact amplification factor by rational-functions. As with
conventional symplectic integrators, these symplectic finite-difference
algorithms preserve important qualitative features of the exact solution. Thus
the symplectic diffusing algorithm is {\it unconditionally stable} and the
symplectic advection algorithm is {\it unitary}. There is a one-to-one
correspondence between symplectic integrators and symplectic finite-difference
methods, including the key idea that one can systematically improve an
algorithm by matching its modified Hamiltonian more closely to the original
Hamiltonian. Consequently, the entire arsenal of symplectic integrators can be
used to produce arbitrary high order time-marching algorithms for solving the
diffusion and the advection equation.

minimizing a function (the estimating function) and they are assessed through
another function (the assessment function). The estimating and assessment
functions generally estimate risks. A classical case is that both functions
estimate an information risk (specifically cross entropy); in that case Akaike
information criterion (AIC) is relevant. In more general cases, the assessment
risk can be estimated by leave-one-out crossvalidation. Since leave-one-out
crossvalidation is computationally very demanding, an approximation formula can
be very useful. A universal approximate crossvalidation criterion (UACV) for
the leave-one-out crossvalidation is given. This criterion can be adapted to
different types of estimators, including penalized likelihood and maximum a
posteriori estimators, and of assessment risk functions, including information
risk functions and continuous rank probability score (CRPS). This formula
reduces to Takeuchi information criterion (TIC) when cross entropy is the risk
for both estimation and assessment. The asymptotic distribution of UACV and of
a difference of UACV is given. UACV can be used for comparing estimators of the

fluctuations to brightness temperatures assuming LTE. The rms fluctuations of
the emitted intensity are about 0.6 (1.2) W/m2 ster pm near the core of the Ca

minimum for wavelengths forming at about 130 km height, but otherwise increases
from the wing to the core. The rms brightness temperature fluctuations are
below 100 K for the photosphere and up to 500 K in the chromosphere. The
skewness of the intensity distributions is close to zero in the outer line wing
and positive throughout the rest of the spectrum. The skewness shows a
pronounced maximum on locations with photospheric magnetic fields for
wavelengths in between the line wing and the line core, and a global maximum at
the very core for both magnetic and field-free locations. The energy content of
the intensity fluctuations is insufficient to create a similar temperature rise
in the chromosphere as predicted in most reference models of the solar

Tauri star (cTTS) GQ Lup carried out with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope (CFHT) in the framework of the ""Magnetic Protostars and Planets""
(MaPP) programme, and obtained at 2 different epochs (2009 July & 2011 June).
From these observations, we first infer that GQ Lup has a photospheric
temperature of 4,300+-50\^A K and a rotation period of 8.4+-0.3 d; it implies
that it is a 1.05+-0.07 Msun star viewed at an inclination of ~30deg, with an
age of 2-5 Myr, a radius of 1.7+-0.2 Rsun, and has just started to develop a
radiative core.
  Large Zeeman signatures are clearly detected at all times, both in
photospheric lines & in accretion-powered emission lines, probing longitudinal
fields of up to 6 kG and hence making GQ Lup the cTTS with the strongest
large-scale fields known as of today. Rotational modulation of Zeeman
signatures is clearly different between our 2 runs, demonstrating that
large-scale fields of cTTSs are evolving with time and are likely produced by
non-stationary dynamo processes.
  Using tomographic imaging, we reconstruct maps of the large-scale field, of
the photospheric brightness & of the accretion-powered emission of GQ Lup. We
find that the magnetic topology is mostly poloidal & axisymmetric; moreover,
the octupolar component of the large-scale field (of strength 2.4 & 1.6 kG in
2009 & 2011) dominates the dipolar component (of strength ~1 kG) by a factor of
~2, consistent with the fact that GQ Lup is no longer fully-convective.
  GQ Lup also features dominantly poleward magnetospheric accretion at both
epochs. The large-scale dipole of GQ Lup is however not strong enough to
disrupt the surrounding accretion disc further than about half-way to the
corotation radius, suggesting that GQ Lup should rapidly spin up like other
similar partly-convective cTTSs (abridged).

cosmologists to study the birth of our universe. Unfortunately, most CMB
experiments such as COBE, WMAP or Planck do not provide a direct measure of the
cosmological signal; CMB is mixed up with galactic foregrounds and point
sources. For the sake of scientific exploitation, measuring the CMB requires
extracting several different astrophysical components (CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
clusters, galactic dust) form multi-wavelength observations. Mathematically
speaking, the problem of disentangling the CMB map from the galactic
foregrounds amounts to a component or source separation problem. In the field
of CMB studies, a very large range of source separation methods have been
applied which all differ from each other in the way they model the data and the
criteria they rely on to separate components. Two main difficulties are i) the
instrument's beam varies across frequencies and ii) the emission laws of most
astrophysical components vary across pixels. This paper aims at introducing a
very accurate modeling of CMB data, based on sparsity, accounting for beams
variability across frequencies as well as spatial variations of the components'
spectral characteristics. Based on this new sparse modeling of the data, a
sparsity-based component separation method coined Local-Generalized
Morphological Component Analysis (L-GMCA) is described. Extensive numerical
experiments have been carried out with simulated Planck data. These experiments
show the high efficiency of the proposed component separation methods to
estimate a clean CMB map with a very low foreground contamination, which makes
L-GMCA of prime interest for CMB studies.

where the jet density equals the ambient density, and (iii) where the forward

external Mach-number and opening angle of the jet. We demonstrate that the
relative magnitudes of these scales determine the collimation, Mach-number,

  Gora, April 2012",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The radio pulsar models based on the existence of an inner accelerating gap
located above the polar cap rely on the existence of a small scale, strong
surface magnetic field $B_s$. This field exceeds the dipolar field $B_d$,
responsible for the braking of the pulsar rotation, by at least one order of
magnitude. Neither magnetospheric currents nor small scale field components
generated during neutron star's birth can provide such field structures in old
pulsars. While the former are too weak to create $B_s \gtrsim 5\times
10^{13}$G$\;\gg B_d$, the ohmic decay time of the latter is much shorter than
$10^6$ years. We suggest that a large amount of magnetic energy is stored in a
toroidal field component that is confined in deeper layers of the crust, where
the ohmic decay time exceeds $10^7$ years. This toroidal field may be created
by various processes acting early in a neutron star's life. The Hall drift is a
non-linear mechanism that, due to the coupling between different components and
scales, may be able to create the demanded strong, small scale, magnetic spots.
Taking into account both realistic crustal microphysics and a minimal cooling
scenario, we show that, in axial symmetry, these field structures are created
on a Hall time scale of $10^3$-$10^4$ years. These magnetic spots can be
long-lived, thereby fulfilling the pre-conditions for the appearance of the
radio pulsar activity. Such magnetic structures created by the Hall drift are
not static, and dynamical variations on the Hall time scale are expected in the
polar cap region.

decreases gradually from a finite value to zero as $x$ increases. This clearly
indicates that quarks are confined inside hadrons, whereas, as $x$ approaches
zero quarks have a finite virtuality, which shows asymptotic freedom of quarks
in QCD. The present predictions are important not only for studying the

for study of the cosmological constant problem, which we have shown should be
treated using nonlocal quark vacuum condensate in the Ghost theory of QCD.

triangulations are related by a flip, their associated QPs are related by the
corresponding QP-mutation. As a byproduct, for (arbitrarily punctured) surfaces

be represented by neurons with exponential compression. The representation is a
novel application of compressive sensing to sparse probability distributions
rather than to the usual sparse signals. The compressive measurements
correspond to expected values of nonlinear functions of the probabilistically
distributed variables. When these expected values are estimated by sampling,
the quality of the compressed representation is limited only by the quality of
sampling. Since the compression preserves the geometric structure of the space
of sparse probability distributions, probabilistic computation can be performed
in the compressed domain. Interestingly, functions satisfying the requirements
of compressive sensing can be implemented as simple perceptrons. If we use
perceptrons as a simple model of feedforward computation by neurons, these
results show that the mean activity of a relatively small number of neurons can
accurately represent a high-dimensional joint distribution implicitly, even
without accounting for any noise correlations. This comprises a novel
hypothesis for how neurons could encode probabilities in the brain.

in earlier papers in this series involves realizing the Julia set as a circle

pattern established for quadratic Julia sets, but for matings the details are
quite challenging, and we have only been completely successful for one example.
Once we have constructed the Laplacian, we are able to use numerical methods to
approximate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. One striking observation from
the data is that for the cubic Julia sets the multiplicities of all eigenspaces
(except for the trivial eigenspace of constants) are even numbers. Nothing like
this is valid for the quadratic julia sets studied earlier. We are able to
explain this, based on the fact that three is an odd number, and more precisely
