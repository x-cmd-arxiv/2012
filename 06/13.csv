corresponds, in a suitable sense, to the absence of rational curves on, say, a
complex projective manifold, while {\it positive} curvature corresponds to the
abundance of rational curves. In this spirit, we prove in this note that a
projective manifold $M$ with a K\""ahler metric with positive total scalar
curvature is uniruled, which is equivalent to every point of $M$ being
contained in a rational curve. We also prove that if $M$ possesses a K\""ahler
metric of total scalar curvature equal to zero, then either $M$ is uniruled or
its canonical line bundle is torsion. The proof of the latter theorem is
partially based on the observation that if $M$ is not uniruled, then the total
scalar curvatures of all K\""ahler metrics on $M$ must have the same sign, which
is either zero or negative.

indistinguishable from equilibrium, and thus the nonequilibrium states are
exceptionally rare in the extremely high-dimensional Hilbert space. On the
contrary, we can easily apply an external force acting on the system, and then
the actual density matrix quantitatively deviates from the canonical state
specified by the system Hamiltonian at each instance. To express how the
external forcing amounts to the deviation from equilibrium, we give a universal
thermodynamic expression of the lower bound of Hilbert-Schmidt distance between
the actual nonequilibrium and corresponding canonical states. The lower bound
is expressed only by the amount of forcing and its consequent entropy
production rate.

boundedness on the horizon of the Ricci scalar, of scalar quadratic curvature
invariants, and of the components of the curvature tensor in the tetrad

surface gravity. We discuss the role of quasiglobal coordinate r that is
emphasized by the conditions of regularity. Further restrictions on the metric
are formulated in terms of subsequent coefficients of expansion of metric

asteroid. The secular evolution of the orbital elements of the asteroid is
computed by averaging the equations of motion over the mean anomalies of the

averaged equations become singular. However, it is possible to define piecewise
differentiable solutions by extending the averaged vector field beyond the
singularity from both sides of the orbit crossing set. In this paper we improve
the previous results, concerning in particular the singularity extraction
technique, and show that the extended vector fields are Lipschitz-continuous.
Moreover, we consider the distance between the Keplerian trajectories of the
small body and of the planet. Apart from exceptional cases, we can select a
sign for this distance so that it becomes an analytic map of the orbital
elements near to crossing configurations. We prove that the evolution of the
'signed' distance along the averaged vector field is more regular than that of
the elements in a neighborhood of crossing times. A comparison between averaged

convergence rate for the homogenization of level-set convex Hamilton-Jacobi
equations in i.i.d. random environments, the first quantitative homogenization
results for these equations in the stochastic setting. By taking advantage of a
connection between the metric approach to homogenization and the theory of
first-passage percolation, we obtain estimates on the fluctuations of the
solutions to the approximate cell problem in the ballistic regime (away from
flat spot of the effective Hamiltonian). In the sub-ballistic regime (on the
flat spot), we show that the fluctuations are governed by an entirely different
mechanism and the homogenization may proceed, without further assumptions, at
an arbitrarily slow rate. We identify a necessary and sufficient condition on
the law of the Hamiltonian for an algebraic rate of convergence to hold in the
sub-ballistic regime and show, under this hypothesis, that the two rates may be
merged to yield comprehensive error estimates and an algebraic rate of
convergence for homogenization.
  Our methods are novel and quite different from the techniques employed in the
periodic setting, although we benefit from previous works in both first-passage
percolation and homogenization. The link between the rate of homogenization and
the flat spot of the effective Hamiltonian, which is related to the
nonexistence of correctors, is a purely random phenomenon observed here for the
first time.

scales in fluid flows is addressed by considering a property of two-dimensional
incompressible turbulence. The property we consider is selective decay, in
which a Casimir of the ideal formulation (enstrophy in 2D flows, helicity in 3D
flows) decays in time, while the energy stays essentially constant. This paper
introduces a mechanism that produces selective decay by enforcing Casimir
dissipation in fluid dynamics. This mechanism turns out to be related in
certain cases to the numerical method of anticipated vorticity discussed in
\cite{SaBa1981,SaBa1985}. Several examples are given and a general theory of
selective decay is developed that uses the Lie-Poisson structure of the ideal
theory. A scale-selection operator allows the resulting modifications of the
fluid motion equations to be interpreted in several examples as parameterizing
the nonlinear, dynamical interactions between disparate scales. The type of
modified fluid equation systems derived here may be useful in modelling
turbulent geophysical flows where it is computationally prohibitive to rely on
the slower, indirect effects of a realistic viscosity, such as in large-scale,
coherent, oceanic flows interacting with much smaller eddies.

polygonal arrangement of cylindrical particles embedded in a cholesteric (Ch)
liquid crystal matrix is performed using the Landau de Gennes model for chiral
self assembly, with strong anchoring at the particles' surface. The defect
textures and LC phases observed are investigated as a function of chirality,
elastic anisotropy, particle polygonal arrangement and particle size. The
presence of a polygonal network made of N circular inclusions results in defect
textures of a net charge of -(N-2)/2 per unit polygonal cell. As the chirality
increases, the LC matrix shows the following transition sequence: weakly
twisted cholesterics, 2D blue phases with non-singular/ singular defect
lattices, cholesteric phases with only disclinations, and fingerprint
cholesteric textures with disclinations and dislocations. For monomeric
mesogens at concentrations far from the I/Ch phase transition and low
chirality, for a given symmetry of the LC phase, the particle with weaker
(stronger) confinement results in a phase with lower (higher) elastic energy,
while at high chirality the elastic energy of a LC phase is proportional to the
number of particles that form the polygonal network. Thus, hexagonal
(triangular) particle arrangement results in low elastic energy at low (high)
chirality. For semiflexible polymeric mesogens (high elastic anisotropy),
defect textures with fewer disclinations/ dislocations arise but due to layer
distortions we find a higher elastic energy than monomeric mesogens. The
defects arising in the simulations and the texture rules established are in
agreement with experimental observations in cellulosic liquid crystal analogues
such as plant cell wall and helical biological polymeric mesophases made of

range covering the W Shelf and extending beyond its edge. In the space of
velocity versus radius, the sample shows the wedge pattern expected from a
radial shell, which is detected clearly here for the first time. This confirms
predictions from an earlier model of formation of the GSS, which proposed that
the W Shelf is a shell from the third orbital wrap of the same tidal debris
stream that produces the GSS, with the main body of the progenitor lying in the
second wrap. We calculate the distortions in the shelf wedge pattern expected

are echoed in the data. In addition, a hot, relatively smooth spheroid
population is clearly present. We construct a bulge-disk-halo N-body model that
agrees with surface brightness and kinematic constraints, and combine it with a
simulation of the GSS. From the contrasting kinematic signatures of the hot
spheroid and shelf components, we decompose the observed stellar metallicity
distribution into contributions from each component using a non-parametric

resolution (STAR) on the bit rate of a compressed video. We propose an
analytical rate model in terms of the quantization stepsize, frame size and
frame rate. Experimental results reveal that the increase of the video rate as
the individual resolution increases follows a power function. Hence, the
proposed model expresses the rate as the product of power functions of the
quantization stepsize, frame size and frame rate, respectively. The proposed
rate model is analytically tractable, requiring only four content dependent
parameters. We also propose methods for predicting the model parameters from
content features that can be computed from original video. Simulation results
show that model predicted rates fit the measured data very well with high
Pearson correlation (PC) and small relative root mean square error (RRMSE). The
same model function works for different coding scenarios (including scalable
and non-scalable video, temporal prediction using either hierarchical B or IPPP
structure, etc.) with very high accuracy (average PC $>$ 0.99), but the values
of model parameters differ. Using the proposed rate model and the quality model
introduced in a separate work, we show how to optimize the STAR for a given
rate constraint, which is important for both encoder rate control and scalable
video adaptation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to order the spatial,
temporal and amplitude layers of a scalable video in a rate-quality optimized
way.

compactness (sparsity) of the representation as a measure of its
compressibility (how much can the image be compressed) with respect to the

be compressed and the more it is similar to the other image. The efficacy of
the proposed measure is demonstrated through the high accuracies achieved in

structures to relieve torsional stress. We use Monte Carlo simulations of a
recently developed coarse-grained model of DNA to demonstrate that the
nucleation of a cruciform can proceed through a cooperative mechanism. Firstly,
a twist-induced denaturation bubble must diffuse so that its midpoint is near
the centre of symmetry of the IR sequence. Secondly, bubble fluctuations must
be large enough to allow one of the arms to form a small number of hairpin
bonds. Once the first arm is partially formed, the second arm can rapidly grow
to a similar size. Because bubbles can twist back on themselves, they need
considerably fewer bases to resolve torsional stress than the final cruciform
state does. The initially stabilised cruciform therefore continues to grow,
which typically proceeds synchronously, reminiscent of the S-type mechanism of
cruciform formation. By using umbrella sampling techniques we calculate, for
different temperatures and superhelical densities, the free energy as a
function of the number of bonds in each cruciform along the correlated but
non-synchronous nucleation pathways we observed in direct simulations.

Ibc supernovae (SN Ibc) discovered exclusively by untargeted SN searches. Past
studies of SN Ibc host environments have been biased towards high-mass,
high-metallicity galaxies by focusing on SNe discovered in galaxy-targeted SN
searches. Our new observations more than double the total number of
spectroscopic stellar population age and metallicity measurements published for
untargeted SN Ibc host environments, and extend to a median redshift about
twice as large as previous statistical studies (z = 0.04). For the 12 SNe Ib
and 21 SNe Ic in our metallicity sample, we find median metallicities of
log(O/H)+12 = 8.48 and 8.61, respectively, but determine that the discrepancy
in the full distribution of metallicities is not statistically significant.
This median difference would correspond to only a small difference in the mass
loss via metal-line driven winds (<30%), suggesting this does not play the
dominant role in distinguishing SN Ib and Ic progenitors. However, the median
metallicity of the 7 broad-lined SN Ic (SN Ic-BL) in our sample is
significantly lower, log(O/H)+12 = 8.34. The age of the young stellar
population of SN Ic-BL host environments also seems to be lower than for SN Ib
and Ic, but our age sample is small. A synthesis of SN Ibc host environment
spectroscopy to date does not reveal a significant difference in SN Ib and Ic
metallicities, but reinforces the significance of the lower metallicities for
SN Ic-BL. This combined sample demonstrates that galaxy-targeted SN searches
introduce a significant bias for studies seeking to infer the metallicity
distribution of SN progenitors, and we identify and discuss other systematic
effects that play smaller roles. We discuss the path forward for making
progress on SN Ibc progenitor studies in the LSST era.

redshift and its dependence on stellar mass, taking advantage of the first data
from the 3D-HST survey, a large spectroscopic Treasury program with the Hubble
Space Telescope WFC3. Combining our Halpha measurements of 854 galaxies at
0.8<z<1.5 with those of ground based surveys at lower and higher redshift, we
can consistently determine the evolution of the EW(Halpha) distribution from
z=0 to z=2.2. We find that at all masses the characteristic EW(Halpha) is
decreasing towards the present epoch, and that at each redshift the EW(Halpha)
is lower for high-mass galaxies. We measure a slope of EW(Halpha) ~ (1+z)^(1.8)
with little mass dependence. Qualitatively, this measurement is a
model-independent confirmation of the evolution of star forming galaxies with
redshift. A quantitative conversion of EW(Halpha) to sSFR is very model
dependent, because of differential reddening corrections between the continuum
SED and the Balmer lines. The observed EW(Halpha) can be reproduced with a
simple model in which the SFR for galaxies rises to the epoch of z~2.5 and then
decreases with time to z = 0. The model implies that the EW(Halpha) rises to
400 A at z=8. The sSFR evolves faster than EW(Halpha), as the mass-to-light
ratio also evolves with redshift. In this context, we find that the sSFR
evolves as (1+z)^(3.2), nearly independent of mass, consistent with previous
reddening insensitive estimates. We confirm previous results that the observed
slope of the sSFR-z relation is steeper than the one predicted by models, but
models and observations agree in finding little mass dependence.

disc composed of test particles, to derive the surface density evolution of the
disc following the mass loss. The model predicts the formation of sharp density
peaks in the disc; the model also allows us to compute the typical timescale
for the formation of these peaks. To test and validate the model, we run
numerical simulations of the process using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics

in the shape and position of the peaks between the model and the simulations.
In a fluid disc, however, the epicyclic oscillations induced by the mass loss
can dissipate, and only some of the predicted peaks form in the simulation. To
quantify how fast this dissipation proceeds, we introduce an appropriate
parameter, and we show that it is effective in explaining the differences
between the analytical, collisionless model and a real fluid disc.

derived previously for the circumnuclear molecular disk and the northern arm

conclude that the ionized gas is not moving along the ionized features, but on
more nearly circular paths. The observed speeds are close to, but probably
somewhat less than expected for orbital motions in the potential of the central
black hole and stars and have a small inward component. The spatial
distribution of the emission is well fitted by a spiral pattern. We discuss
possible physical explanations for the spatial distribution and kinematics of
the ionized gas, and conclude that both may be best explained by a one-armed
spiral density wave, which also accounts for both the observed low velocities

Within F-theory SU(5) unification these two requirements fix M_{SS} ~ 5 x
10^{10} GeV at an intermediate scale and a unification scale M_c ~ 3 x 10^{14}
GeV. As a direct consequence one also predicts the vanishing of the quartic
Higgs SM self-coupling at M_{SS} ~10^{11} GeV. This is tantalizingly consistent
with recent LHC hints of a Higgs mass in the region 124-126 GeV. With such a
low unification scale M_c ~ 3 x 10^{14} GeV one may worry about too fast proton
decay via dimension 6 operators. However in the F-theory GUT context SU(5) is
broken to the SM via hypercharge flux. We show that this hypercharge flux
deforms the SM fermion wave functions leading to a suppression, avoiding in
this way the strong experimental proton decay constraints. In these
constructions there is generically an axion with a scale of size f_a ~
M_c/(4\pi)^2 ~ 10^{12} GeV which could solve the strong CP problem and provide
for the observed dark matter. The prize to pay for these attractive features is
to assume that the hierarchy problem is solved due to anthropic selection in a

orbits at different distances from a central planet. We consider both
homogeneous satellites and differentiated bodies containing a denser core. We
show that the Roche limit for a rubble pile is closer to the planet than for a
fluid body of the same mean density. The Roche limit for a differentiated body
is also closer to the planet than for a homogeneous satellite of the same mean
density. Within its Roche limit, a homogeneous satellite totally disrupts and
forms a narrow ring. The initial stages of the disruption are similar to the
evolution of a viscous fluid ellipsoid, which can be computed
semi-analytically. On the other hand, when a differentiated satellite is just
within the Roche limit only the mantle is disrupted. This process is similar to
Roche-lobe overflow in interacting binary stars and produces two narrow rings
on either side of a remnant satellite. We argue that the Uranian rings, and
possibly their shepherd satellites, could have been formed through the tidal
disruption of a number of protomoons that were formed inside the corotation

survey of fossil galaxy group candidates. These are virialized systems believed

an extended hot X-ray halo. We use new photometric and spectroscopic data from
SDSS Data Release 7 to determine that three of the candidates are clearly not
fossil groups. Of the remaining 30 candidates, 67% contain a radio-loud
(L_1.4GHz > 10^23 W Hz^-1) active galactic nucleus (AGN) at the center of their
dominant elliptical galaxy. We find a weak correlation between the radio
luminosity of the AGN and the X-ray luminosity of the halo suggesting that the
AGN contributes to energy deposition into the intragroup medium. We only find a
correlation between the radio and optical luminosity of the central elliptical
galaxy when we include X-ray selected, elliptically dominated non-fossil
groups, indicating a weak relationship between AGN strength and the mass
assembly history of the groups. The dominant elliptical galaxy of fossil groups
is on average roughly an order of magnitude more luminous than normal group
elliptical galaxies in optical, X-ray, and radio luminosities and our findings
are consistent with previous results that the radio-loud fraction in elliptical
galaxies is linked to the stellar mass of a population. The current level of
activity in fossil groups suggests that AGN fueling continues long after the
last major merger. We discuss several possibilities for fueling the AGN at the
present epoch.

emitting halo at z=2.63, from our ultra-deep, long-slit spectroscopic survey of
faint high redshift emitters, undertaken with Magellan LDSS3 in the GOODS-S
field. The Lya emission, detected over more than 30 kpc, is spatially
coincident with a concentration of galaxies visible in deep broad-band imaging.
While these faint galaxies without spectroscopic redshifts cannot with
certainty be associated with one another or with the Lya emission, there are a
number of compelling reasons why they very probably form a Milky Way halo-mass
group at the Lya redshift. A filamentary structure, possibly consisting of Lya
emission at very high equivalent width, and evidence for disturbed stellar
populations, suggest that the properties of the emitting region reflect ongoing
galaxy assembly, with recent galaxy mergers and star formation occurring in the
group. Hence, the Lya provides unique insights into what is probably a key mode
of galaxy formation at high redshifts. The Lya emission may be powered by
cooling radiation or spatially extended star formation in the halo, but is
unlikely to be fluorescence driven by either an AGN or one of the galaxies. The
spatial profile of the emission is conspicuously different from that of typical
Lya emitters or Lyman break galaxies, which is consistent with the picture that
extended emission of this kind represents a different stage in the galaxy
formation process. Faint, extended Lya emitters such as these may be lower-mass
analogues of the brighter Lya blobs. Our observations provide further,
circumstantial evidence that galaxy mergers may promote the production and / or
escape of ionizing radiation, and that the halos of interacting galaxies may be
significant sources for ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization.

is found by applying a piecewise-linear, discontinuous Galerkin method in time
combined with a piecewise-linear, conforming finite element method in space.
The time mesh is graded appropriately near $t=0$, but the spatial mesh is
quasiuniform. Previously, we proved that the error, measured in the spatial
$L_2$-norm, is of order $k^{2+\alpha_-}+h^2\ell(k)$, uniformly in $t$, where
$k$ is the maximum time step, $h$ is the maximum diameter of the spatial finite

we generalize a known result for the classical heat equation (i.e., the case
$\alpha=0$) by showing that at each time level $t_n$ the solution is
superconvergent with respect to $k$: the error is of order
$(k^{3+2\alpha_-}+h^2)\ell(k)$. Moreover, a simple postprocessing step
employing Lagrange interpolation yields a superconvergent approximation for any
$t$. Numerical experiments indicate that our theoretical error bound is
pessimistic if $\alpha<0$. Ignoring logarithmic factors, we observe that the

long-range interaction: One consists only of the nearest- and
next-nearest-neighbor interactions, and the other is the dipole-dipole
interaction that decays with the interparticle distance $r$ as $\sim r^{-3}$.
It is known from previous analyses by quantum Monte Carlo methods that a
checkerboard supersolid (CSS) is absent in the ground-state phase diagram of
the former case while it is present in the latter. In the former, we find that
quantum fluctuations around mean-field solutions are enhanced by the direct
competition between the checkerboard and striped solid orders and that they
destabilize the CSS phase. On the other hand, the emergence of the CSS phase in
the latter case can be attributed to the absence of such a competition with
other solid orders. We also show that the cluster mean-field method allows for
the determination of phase boundaries in a precise quantitative manner when
scaling with respect to the cluster size is taken into account. It is found
that the phase transition between the superfluid and the solid (or CSS) is of
the first order in the vicinity of the particle-hole symmetric line.

  Nonparametric Models",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variable selection for recovering sparsity in nonadditive nonparametric
models has been challenging. This problem becomes even more difficult due to
complications in modeling unknown interaction terms among high dimensional
variables. There is currently no variable selection method to overcome these
limitations. Hence, in this paper we propose a variable selection approach that
is developed by connecting a kernel machine with the nonparametric multiple
regression model. The advantages of our approach are that it can: (1) recover
the sparsity, (2) automatically model unknown and complicated interactions, (3)
connect with several existing approaches including linear nonnegative garrote,
kernel learning and automatic relevant determinants (ARD), and (4) provide
flexibility for both additive and nonadditive nonparametric models. Our
approach may be viewed as a nonlinear version of a nonnegative garrote method.
We model the smoothing function by a least squares kernel machine and construct
the nonnegative garrote objective function as the function of the similarity
matrix. Since the multiple regression similarity matrix can be written as an
additive form of univariate similarity matrices corresponding to input
variables, applying a sparse scale parameter on each univariate similarity
matrix can reveal its relevance to the response variable. We also derive the
asymptotic properties of our approach, and show that it provides a square root
consistent estimator of the scale parameters. Furthermore, we prove that
sparsistency is satisfied with consistent initial kernel function coefficients
under certain conditions and give the necessary and sufficient conditions for
sparsistency. An efficient coordinate descent/backfitting algorithm is
developed. A resampling procedure for our variable selection methodology is
also proposed to improve power.

using only two parameters with unchanging values. The reasons behind the
success of this reduced model are investigated. Monte Carlo simulations are
performed investigating the role of flexibility of the side chains in the
selectivity of calcium channels under a wide range of ionic conditions. Results
suggest that the exact location and mobility of oxygen ions have little effect
on the selectivity behavior of calcium channels. The first order determinant of
selectivity in calcium channels is the density of charge in the selectivity
filter. Flexibility seems a second order determinant. Single channel planar
lipid bilayer experiments are performed to determine the selectivity,
permeation, and sialic acid specificity of a bacterial outer-membrane channel
NanC of Ecoli. NanC exhibits a large unit conductance varying with the applied
voltage polarity, anion selectivity, and voltage gating. Unitary conductance of
NanC decreases significantly in presence of the buffer HEPES. Alternate buffers
are tested. Results suggest that the sialic acid specificity of NanC should be
performed in low concentration salt solutions without pH buffers adjusted to
neutral pH 7.0. Neu5Ac changes the gating and considerably increases the ionic
conductance of NanC. The effect of Neu5Ac on the unitary current through NanC
saturates at higher Neu5Ac concentrations. Interestingly, Neu5Ac reduces the

moves. This sequence is called the meander's signature. The signature not only
provides a fast algorithm for the computation of the index of a Lie algebra

the graph's plane homotopy type - a finer invariant than the index. The
signature can be used to construct arbitrarily large sets of meanders,
Frobenius and otherwise, of any given size and configuration.
  Making use of a more refined signature, we are able to prove an important
conjecture of Gerstenhaber & Giaquinto: The spectrum of the adjoint of a
principal element in a Frobenius seaweed Lie algebra consists of an unbroken
chain of integers. Additionally, we show the dimensions of the associated
eigenspaces to be unimodal. In certain special cases, the signature is used to
produce an explicit formula for the index of a seaweed Lie subalgebra of sl(n)

coronal loops heated by magnetic reconnection should self-organize to a state
of marginal collisionality. We discuss their model of coronal loop dynamics
with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic calculation. We assume that many current
sheets are present, with a distribution of thicknesses, but that only current
sheets thinner than the ion skin depth can rapidly reconnect. This assumption
naturally causes a density dependent heating rate which is actively regulated
by the plasma. We report 9 numerical simulation results of coronal loop
hydrodynamics in which the absolute values of the heating rates are different
but their density dependences are the same. We find two regimes of behavior,
depending on the amplitude of the heating rate. In the case that the amplitude
of heating is below a threshold value, the loop is in stable equilibrium.
Typically the upper and less dense part of coronal loop is collisionlessly
heated and conductively cooled. When the amplitude of heating is above the
threshold, the conductive flux to the lower atmosphere required to balance
collisionless heating drives an evaporative flow which quenches fast
reconnection, ultimately cooling and draining the loop until the cycle begins
again. The key elements of this cycle are gravity and the density dependence of
the heating function. Some additional factors are present, including pressure
driven flows from the loop top, which carry a large enthalpy flux and play an
important role in reducing the density. We find that on average the density of
the system is close to the marginally collisionless value.

systems coupled to a thermal reservoir in the strong coupling regime. In
general such systems do not necessarily relax to a Boltzmann distribution if
the coupling to the thermal reservoir is non-vanishing or equivalently if the
relaxation timescales are finite. Using a variety of non-equilibrium formalisms
valid for non-Markovian processes, we show that starting from a product state
of the closed system = system + environment, with the environment in its
thermal state, the open system which results from coarse graining the
environment will evolve towards an equilibrium state at late-times. This state
can be expressed as the reduced state of the closed system thermal state at the
temperature of the environment. For a linear (harmonic) system and environment,
which is exactly solvable, we are able to show in a rigorous way that all
multi-time correlations of the open system evolve towards those of the closed
system thermal state. Multi-time correlations are especially relevant in the
non-Markovian regime, since they cannot be generated by the dynamics of the
single-time correlations. For more general systems, which cannot be exactly
solved, we are able to provide a general proof that all single-time
correlations of the open system evolve to those of the closed system thermal
state, to first order in the relaxation rates. For the special case of a
zero-temperature reservoir, we are able to explicitly construct the reduced
closed system thermal state in terms of the environmental correlations.

and more attentions. In this paper, we discover that even without the
informative prior a Bayesian variable selection problem itself can be
considered as a complete graph and described by a Ising model with random
interactions. There are many advantages of treating variable selection as a
graphical model, such as it is easy to employ the single site updating as well
as the cluster updating algorithm, suitable for problems with small sample size
and larger variable number, easy to extend to nonparametric regression models
and incorporate graphical prior information and so on. In a Bayesian variable
selection Ising model the interactions are determined by the linear model
coefficients, so we systematically study the performance of different scale
normal mixture priors for the model coefficients by adopting the global-local
shrinkage strategy. Our results prove that the best prior of the model
coefficients in terms of variable selection should maintain substantial weight
on small shrinkage instead of large shrinkage. We also discuss the connection
between the tempering algorithms for Ising models and the global-local
shrinkage approach, showing that the shrinkage parameter plays a tempering
role. The methods are illustrated with simulated and real data.

cellular or a physiological function. The genes within the same pathway are
expected to function together and hence may interact with each other. It is
also known that many genes, and so pathways, interact with other environmental
variables. However, no formal procedure has yet been developed to evaluate the
pathway-environment interaction. In this article, we propose a semiparametric
method to model the pathway-environment interaction. The method connects a
least square kernel machine and a semiparametric mixed effects model. We model
nonparametrically the environmental effect via a natural cubic spline. Both a
pathway effect and an interaction between a pathway and an environmental effect
are modeled nonparametrically via a kernel machine, and we estimate variance
component representing an interaction effect under a semiparametric mixed
effects model. We then employ a restricted likelihood ratio test and a score
test to evaluate the main pathway effect and the pathway-environment
interaction. The approach was applied to a genetic pathway data of Type II
diabetes, and pathways with either a significant main pathway effect, an
interaction effect or both were identified. Other methods previously developed
determined many as having a significant main pathway effect only. Furthermore,
among those significant pathways, we discovered some pathways having a
significant pathway-environment interaction effect, a result that other methods
would not be able to detect.

of the fifteen known AMXPs, with a particular emphasis on the multi-wavelength
observations that have been carried out since the discovery of the first AMXP
in 1998. We review accretion torque theory, the pulse formation process, and
how AMXP observations have changed our view on the interaction of plasma and
magnetic fields in strong gravity. We also explain how the AMXPs have deepened
our understanding of the thermonuclear burst process, in particular the
phenomenon of burst oscillations. We conclude with a discussion of the open
problems that remain to be addressed in the future.

  and Disorder","14pages, 12 figures, Fig 4 is added correctly",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Milgram Condition proposed by Aoyama et al. plays an important role on the
analysis of ""six degrees of separation"". We have shown that the relations
between Milgram condition and the generalized clustering coefficient, which was
introduced as an index for measuring the number of closed paths by us, are
absolutely different in scale free networks (Barabasi and Albert) and small
world networks (Watts and Strogatz, Watts). This fact implies that the effect
of closed paths on information propagation is different in both networks. In
this article, we first investigate the difference and pursuit what is a crucial
mathematical quantity for information propagation. As a result we find that a
sort of ""disorder"" plays more important role for information propagation than
partially closed paths included in a network. Next we inquired into it in more
detail by introducing two types of intermediate networks. Then we find that the
average of the local clustering coefficient and the generalized clustering
coefficients $C_{(q)}$ have some different functions and important meanings,
respectively. We also find that $C_{(q)}$ is close to the propagation of
information on networks. Lastly, we show that realizability of six degrees of
separation in networks can be understood in a unified way by disorder.

in the literature but for the linear models. It is tested the null hypothesis,
at each sequential observation, that there is no change in the model against a
change presence. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the
null hypothesis is given and its convergence in probability to infinity is
proved when a change occurs. These results will allow to build an asymptotic
critical region. Next, in order to decrease the type I error probability, a
bootstrapped critical value is proposed and a modified test is studied in a
similar way. Simulation results, using Monte-Carlo technique, for nonlinear

MHD turbulence or magnetic reconnection, namely in the hot and sparse, almost

Element Method (FEM) with adaptive gridding appears to be the appropriate
numerical implementation for handling the broad range of scales contained in
such high Lundquist-number MHD problems. In spite the FEM is now routinely used
in engineering practice in solid-state and fluid dynamics, its usage for MHD
simulations has recently only begun and only few implementations exist so far.
In this paper we present our MHD solver based on the Least-Square FEM (LSFEM)
formulation. We describe the transformation of the MHD equations into form
required for finding the LSFEM functional and some practical issues in
implementation of the method. The algorithm was tested on selected problems of
ideal (non-resistive) and resistive MHD. The tests show the usability of LSFEM

evaluated numerically by solving the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation and

between the A$_2$ and A$_1$ phases. It is found that temperature and magnetic

velocity of the system should be increased from zero to a sufficiently large
value to create a HQV with sufficiently large probability. A HQV does not form
if the system starts with a fixed angular velocity and subsequently the
temperature is lowered down to the A$_2$ phase. It is estimated that the

diagnostic of dust obscuration in star forming galaxies. However, the intrinsic
slope is also sensitive to the form of the stellar initial mass function (IMF)
and to the recent star formation and metal enrichment histories of a galaxy.
Using the galform semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, we investigate the
intrinsic distribution of UVC slopes. For star-forming galaxies, we find that
the intrinsic distribution of UVC slopes at z=0, parameterised by the power law
index beta, has a standard deviation of sigma_beta=0.30. This suggests an
uncertainty on the inferred UV attenuation of A_fuv=0.7$ (assuming a Calzetti
attenuation curve) for an individual object, even with perfect photometry.
Furthermore, we find that the intrinsic UVC slope correlates with star
formation rate, intrinsic UV luminosity, stellar mass and redshift. These
correlations have implications for the interpretation of trends in the observed
UVC slope with these quantities irrespective of the sample size or quality of
the photometry. Our results suggest that in some cases the attenuation by dust

magnetization (which could not be resolved in the data for polycrystalline

increases at the initial step for H parallel to basal plane, but decreases at

presence of external fields, charges exert forces that can influence the state

phenomenon is called electrostriction. We show that this effect allows us to
introduce a capacitive susceptibility that assumes a maximum in the melting
transition with an associated excess charge. As a consequence, there exist
voltage regimes where a small change in voltage can lead to a large uptake of

the various intricate nanoarchitectures occurring in the wing scales of several
Lepidoptera species were investigated by controlled cooling (from room
temperature to -5 - -10 {\deg}C) combined with in situ measurement of changes
in the reflectance spectra. It was determined that, due to this procedure, all
photonic nanoarchitectures giving a reflectance maximum in the visible range
and having an open nanostructure exhibited alteration of the position of the
reflectance maximum associated with the photonic nanoarchitectures. The
photonic nanoarchitectures with a closed structure exhibited little to no
alteration in colour. Similarly, control specimens coloured by pigments did not
exhibit a colour change under the same conditions. Hence, this effect can be
used to identify species with open photonic nanoarchitectures in their scales.
For certain species, an almost complete disappearance of the reflectance
maximum was found. All specimens recovered their original colours following
warming and drying. Cooling experiments using thin copper wires demonstrated
that colour alterations could be limited to a millimetre, or below. Dried
museum specimens do not exhibit colour changes when cooled in the absence of a
heat sink due to the low heat capacity of the wings.

  Methods. We used data extracted from the seven large-scale surveys from
infrared to radio wavelengths. In addition we used the JCMT observations of the
J = 3-2 line of 12CO emission data released on CADC and the 12CO J = 2-1 and J
=3-2 lines observed by the KOSMA 3 m telescope. We performed a multiwavelength
study of bubble N22.
  Results. A molecular shell composed of several clumps agrees very well with
the border of N22, suggesting that its expansion is collecting the surrounding
material. The high integrated 12CO line intensity ratio (ranging from 0.7 to
1.14) implies that shocks have driven into the molecular clouds. We identify
eleven possible O-type stars inside the Hii region, five of which are located
in projection inside the cavity of the 20 cm radio continuum emission and are
probably the exciting-star candidates of N22. Twenty-nine YSOs (young stellar
objects) are distributed close to the dense cores of N22. We conclude that star
formation is indeed active around N22; the formation of most of YSOs may have
been triggered by the expanding of the Hii region. After comparing the
dynamical age of N22 and the fragmentation time of the molecular shell, we
suggest that radiation-driven compression of pre-existing dense clumps may be
ongoing.

atom-atom correlations in the famous Fermi problem. This is an archetypal model
to study micro-causality in the quantum domain where two atoms, the first
initially excited and the second prepared in its ground state, interact with
the vacuum electromagnetic field. The excitation can be transferred to the
second atom via a flying photon and various kinds of quantum correlations
between the two are generated during this process. Among these, prominent
examples are given by entanglement, quantum discord and nonlocal correlations.
It is the aim of this paper to analyze the role of the light cone in the
emergence of such correlations.

mag and provide a detailed characterisation of three of them, using
high-precision infrared light curves from the WFCAM Transit Survey (WTS). Such
systems provide the most accurate and model-independent method for measuring
the fundamental parameters of these poorly understood yet numerous stars, which
currently lack sufficient observations to precisely calibrate stellar evolution
models. We fully solve for the masses and radii of three of the systems,
finding orbital periods in the range 1.5<P<4.9 days, with masses spanning
0.35-0.50 Msun and radii between 0.38-0.50 Rsun, with uncertainties of
~3.5-6.4% in mass and ~2.7-5.5% in radius. Close-companions in short-period
binaries are expected to be tidally-locked into fast rotational velocities,
resulting in high levels of magnetic activity. This is predicted to inflate
their radii by inhibiting convective flow and increasing star spot coverage.
The radii of the WTS systems are inflated above model predictions by ~3-12%, in
agreement with the observed trend, despite an expected lower systematic
contribution from star spots signals at infrared wavelengths. We searched for
correlation between the orbital period and radius inflation by combining our
results with all existing M-dwarf radius measurements of comparable precision,
but we found no statistically significant evidence for a decrease in radius
inflation for longer period, less active systems. Radius inflation continues to
exists in non-synchronised systems indicating that the problem remains even for
very low activity M-dwarfs. Resolving this issue is vital not only for
understanding the most populous stars in the Universe, but also for
characterising their planetary companions, which hold the best prospects for
finding Earth-like planets in the traditional habitable zone.

others. Parallel and Distributed Simulation (PADS) aims at improving the

in Erlang, a concurrent, functional programming language specifically targeted
at building distributed systems. We argue that writing parallel simulation

languages. Moreover, ErlangTW allows simulation models to be executed either on
single-core, multicore and distributed computing architectures. We describe the

energy scale, when neutrinos are degenerate. It means that a minimal flavor
violation at a high energy scale can induce a rich variety of flavor mixings in
quark and lepton sectors at a low energy scale through quantum corrections.

collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011, the following ratios of branching

  B(B0 -> pi+ pi-) / B(B0 -> K+pi-) = 0.262 +/- 0.009 +/- 0.017,
  (fs/fd) * B(Bs -> K+K-) / B(B^0 -> K+pi-) = 0.316 +/- 0.009 +/- 0.019,

the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. Using the
current world average of B(B0 -> K+pi-) and the ratio of the strange to light
neutral B meson production fs/fd measured by LHCb, we obtain:
  B(B0 -> pi+pi-) = (5.08 +/- 0.17 +/- 0.37) x 10^-6,
  B(Bs -> K+K-) = (23.0 +/- 0.7 +/- 2.3) x 10^-6,

  B(B0 -> K+K-) = (0.11 {+ 0.05 - 0.04} +/- 0.06) x 10^-6,
  B(Bs -> pi+pi-) = (0.95 {+ 0.21 - 0.17} +/- 0.13) x 10^-6.
  The measurements of B(Bs -> K+K-), B(Bs -> pi+ K-) and B(B0 -> K+K-) are the
most precise to date. The decay mode Bs -> pi+pi- is observed for the first
time with a significance of more than 5 sigma.

  Foundation. An invited submission to Open Astron. J. (accepted version)","Open Astronomy Journal, 2013, 6, 14-19",,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Theory of general relativity (GR) has been scrutinized by experts for almost
a century and describes accurately all gravitational phenomena ranging from the
solar system to the universe. However, this success is achieved provided one
admits three completely independent new components in the energy-stress tensor
$T^{\mu\nu}$$-$inflaton, dark matter and dark energy, which though do not have
any non-gravitational or laboratory evidence and have remained generally
speculative. Moreover, the dark energy poses a serious confrontation between
fundamental physics and cosmology.
  The present situation reminds us of Einstein's `biggest blunder' when he
forced his theory to predict a static universe, perhaps guided by his religious
conviction that the universe must be eternal and unchanging. It seems that we
are making a similar blunder by forcing $T^{\mu\nu}$ into the field equations
while the observations indicate that it is not needed. We seem to have a
deep-rooted conviction that the spacetime will remain empty unless we fill it
by the energy-stress tensor. However, we have been ignoring numerous evidences
earnestly indicating otherwise.
  From a critical analysis of the present situation, we develop an entirely new
insight about the source of curvature in equations $R^{\mu\nu}=0$ which, though
may appear orthogonal to the usual understanding, is in striking agreement with
all known phenomena in GR. Moreover, it answers some hitherto unexplained
puzzles and circumvents some long-standing problems of the standard paradigm.

notion of gauge transformation of state-dependent Brownian motion. We show that
the stochastic dynamics of non gauge-invariant systems is not unambiguously
defined. They typically do not relax to equilibrium steady states even in the
absence of extenal forces. Assuming both coordinate covariance and gauge
invariance, we derive a second-order Langevin equation with state-dependent
diffusion matrix and vanishing environmental forces. It differs from previous
proposals but nevertheless entails the Einstein relation, a Maxwellian
conditional steady state for the velocities, and the equipartition theorem. The
over-damping limit leads to a stochastic differential equation in state space
that cannot be interpreted as a pure differential (Ito, Stratonovich or else).
At odds with the latter interpretations, the corresponding Fokker-Planck
equation admits an equilibrium steady state; a detailed comparison with other
theories of state-dependent diffusion is carried out. We propose this as a
theory of diffusion in a heat bath with varying temperature. Besides
equilibrium, a crucial experimental signature is the non-uniform steady spatial
distribution.

where $\tau$ is the number of learning trials, as well as to obtain the

show some fundamental properties of this cohomology, which are useful for its

numbers, the dimensions of the basic Dolbeault cohomology groups, only depend
on the isomorphism class of the underlying CR structure. Equivalently, we show
that the basic Hodge numbers are invariant under deformations of type I. This
result reduces their computation to the quasi-regular case. In the second part,
we show a basic version of the Carrell-Lieberman theorem relating the basic
Dolbeault cohomology of (M,F) to that of (C,F), where C is the union of closed
leaves of F. As a special case, if F has only finitely many closed leaves, then
the (p,q)-th basic Hodge numbers are zero for p not equal to q. Combining the
two results, we show that if M admits a nowhere vanishing CR vector field with
finitely many closed orbits, then the (p,q)-th basic Hodge numbers are zero for
p not equal to q. As an application of these results, we compute then the basic
Hodge numbers for deformations of homogeneous Sasakian manifolds.

This compatible discretization method relies on the construction of a
conforming discrete Hodge decomposition, that is based on a bounded projection
operator that commutes with the exterior derivative. The projection operator is
the composition of a reduction and a reconstruction step. The reconstruction in
terms of mimetic spectral element basis-functions are tensor-based
constructions and therefore hold for curvilinear quadrilateral and hexahedral

discrete Hodge decomposition, we derive optimal a priori error estimates which
are valid for all admissible boundary conditions on both Cartesian and

experiments. These clearly show that the mimetic spectral elements outperform
the commonly used H(div)-compatible Raviart-Thomas elements.

an expression for the elastic energy needed to deform the grains. The original

(2)Depending on direction and polarization, transverse elastic waves are known
to propagate at slightly different velocities. The old expression neglects
these differences, the new one successfully reproduces them. (3) Most

positions are denser than previously expected, likely
$n\sim1\times10^3$--1$\times10^4$\cmt\ due to contamination, and are chemically
young, similar to the gas in the lower density clump position. We argue that
the density contrast between these positions and their general young chemical
age would support the existence of transient clumps in the lower density

on one-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. By treating the
evolution of critical spectrum parameters as a power-law break between the
ultrarelativistic and non-relativistic asymptotic solutions, we generalize the
prescriptions to any observer time. Our aim is to provide a set of formulas
that constitutes a useful tool for accurate fitting of model-parameters to

applicability range is not confined to gamma-ray burst afterglows, but includes
all spherical outflows (also jets before the jet-break) that produce
synchrotron radiation as they adiabatically decelerate in a cold, power-law

gravitational lensing on the CMB temperature is exploited as a source of
valuable information. Especially the reconstruction of the lensing potential
power spectrum is of great interest. The reconstruction from the optimal
quadratic estimator of the lensing potential, though, is biased. As long as the
intrinsic CMB fluctuations are Gaussian this bias is well understood and
controlled. In the presence of non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbations,
however, the CMB also acquires a non-Gaussian structure mimicking the lensing
signal. Concentrating on primordial non-Gaussianity of local type, we address
the resulting bias by extracting the lensing potential power spectrum from
large samples of simulated lensed CMB temperature maps comprising different
values of f_NL. We find that the bias is considerably larger than previous
analytical calculations suggested. For current values of f_NL and a sensitivity
like that of the Planck mission, however, the bias is completely negligible on

point of view this basic question: can the nature of quantum entangled states
be interpreted ontologically or epistemologically? According to some works, the
degrees of freedom (and the tool of quantum partitions) of quantum systems
permit us to establish a possible classification between factorizable and
entangled states. We suggest, that the ""choice"" of degree of freedom (or
quantum partitions), even if mathematically justified introduces an epistemic
element, not only in the systems but also in their classification. We retain,
instead, that there are not two classes of quantum states, entangled and
factorizable, but only a single class of states: the entangled states. In fact,
the factorizable states become entangled for a different choice of their
degrees of freedom (i.e. they are entangled with respect to other observables).
In the same way, there are no partitions of quantum systems which have an
ontologically superior status with respect to any other. For all these reasons,
both mathematical tools utilize(i.e quantum partitions or degrees of freedom)
are responsible for creating an improper classification of quantum systems.
Finally, we argue that we cannot speak about a classification of quantum
systems: all quantum states exhibit a uniquely objective nature, they are all
entangled states.

relies heavily upon the theory of stochastic processes, with its definitions,
theorems and specific vocabulary as well. Its main hypothesis states indeed
that the classical trajectories of the particles are identical to the sample
functions of a diffusion Markov process, whose conditional probability density
is proposed as a substitute for the wave function. The Schroedinger equation
and the so-called Nelson equations are used to determine the diffusion tensor
and the drift vectors characteristic of such a process. It is then possible to
write down the forward and backward Kolmogorov equations that are used to
determine the conditional probability density, as well as the Fokker-Planck
equation that is used to determine the normal probability density. This method
is applied to several simple cases and the results obtained are compared with
those of the orthodox theory. Among the most important differences let us
mention that any system evolving freely from any original state returns
spontaneously to its ground state, that the definitions of the particles
velocities and momenta are impossible because the sample functions of a
diffusion Markov process nowhere possess a derivative with respect to time and
that the so-called collapse of the wave function is a mere mirage explained by
the updating choice between new and older initial conditions in the resolution
of partial differential equations. We finally attempt to extend the proposed
theory to the domain of the relativistic quantum mechanics. It is promising but
is clearly unfinished because it has not been possible up to now to solve the
Nelson and Kolmogorov equations, except in the very simple case of a free
particle.

posterior point estimates that facilitate (relatively) efficient prediction.
However, the hierarchical Bayes framework does not always lend itself naturally
to this maximum aposteriori goal. In this work we propose an undirected
reformulation of hierarchical Bayes that relies on priors in the form of
similarity measures. We introduce the notion of ""degree of transfer"" weights on

graphical models with cycles thus introducing great difficulty in deriving
efficient algorithms for finding local minima of the free energy for general

that represents policies as stochastic finite-state controllers and iteratively
improves a controller by adjusting the parameters of each node using linear
programming. In the original algorithm, the size of the linear programs, and
thus the complexity of policy improvement, depends on the number of parameters
of each node, which grows with the size of the controller. But in practice, the
number of parameters of a node with non-zero values is often very small, and
does not grow with the size of the controller. Based on this observation, we
develop a version of bounded policy iteration that leverages the sparse

estimator of the generalization error to form a confidence set. Unfortunately,
these methods do not reliably provide sets of the desired confidence. The poor

data imply independence, as long as the conditional empirical distribution is
notably different from uniform. In our second contribution, we focus on
realistic ESS-values, and provide an analytical approximation to the ""optimal""
ESS-value in a predictive sense (its accuracy is also validated
experimentally): this approximation provides an understanding as to which
properties of the data have the main effect determining the ""optimal""
ESS-value.

the most probable (MAP) configuration in graphical models. These relaxations
can be solved efficiently using message-passing algorithms such as belief
propagation and, when the relaxation is tight, provably find the MAP
configuration. The standard LP relaxation is not tight enough in many
real-world problems, however, and this has lead to the use of higher order
cluster-based LP relaxations. The computational cost increases exponentially
with the size of the clusters and limits the number and type of clusters we can
use. We propose to solve the cluster selection problem monotonically in the
dual LP, iteratively selecting clusters with guaranteed improvement, and
quickly re-solving with the added clusters by reusing the existing solution.
Our dual message-passing algorithm finds the MAP configuration in protein
sidechain placement, protein design, and stereo problems, in cases where the
standard LP relaxation fails.

detection exhibit a persistence property: for example, if something breaks, it
stays broken until an intervention. When modeled as a Dynamic Bayesian Network,
persistence adds dependencies between adjacent time slices, often making exact
inference over time intractable using standard inference algorithms. However,
we show that persistence implies a regular structure that can be exploited for
efficient inference. We present three successively more general classes of
models: persistent causal chains (PCCs), persistent causal trees (PCTs) and
persistent polytrees (PPTs), and the corresponding exact inference algorithms
that exploit persistence. We show that analytic asymptotic bounds for our
algorithms compare favorably to junction tree inference; and we demonstrate
empirically that we can perform exact smoothing on the order of 100 times
faster than the approximate Boyen-Koller method on randomly generated instances
of persistent tree models. We also show how to handle non-persistent variables
and how persistence can be exploited effectively for approximate filtering.

process regression from the unfavorable O(n3) scaling in computational time to
O(nm2). Thus far, work has concentrated on models with one covariance function.
However, in many practical situations additive models with multiple covariance
functions may perform better, since the data may contain both long and short
length-scale phenomena. The long length-scales can be captured with global
sparse approximations, such as fully independent conditional (FIC), and the
short length-scales can be modeled naturally by covariance functions with
compact support (CS). CS covariance functions lead to naturally sparse
covariance matrices, which are computationally cheaper to handle than full
covariance matrices. In this paper, we propose a new sparse Gaussian process
model with two additive components: FIC for the long length-scales and CS
covariance function for the short length-scales. We give theoretical and
experimental results and show that under certain conditions the proposed model
has the same computational complexity as FIC. We also compare the model
performance of the proposed model to additive models approximated by fully and
partially independent conditional (PIC). We use real data sets and show that
our model outperforms FIC and PIC approximations for data sets with two
additive phenomena.

results on a number of synthetic and real-world clustering problems. They are
appealing because they offer computational benefits over latent-mean models and
can handle arbitrary pairwise similarity measures between data points. However,
when trying to recover underlying structure in clustering problems, tailored
similarity measures are often not enough; we also desire control over the
distribution of cluster sizes. Priors such as Dirichlet process priors allow
the number of clusters to be unspecified while expressing priors over data
partitions. To our knowledge, they have not been applied to exemplar-based
models. We show how to incorporate priors, including Dirichlet process priors,
into the recently introduced affinity propagation algorithm. We develop an
efficient maxproduct belief propagation algorithm for our new model and
demonstrate experimentally how the expanded range of clustering priors allows
us to better recover true clusterings in situations where we have some

Moreover, the complexity of variational inference for the dDTM grows quickly as

discretization. We demonstrate the cDTM on two news corpora, reporting both
