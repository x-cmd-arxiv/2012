nondegenerate. We develop two methods for constructing the symplectic groupoids
of log symplectic manifolds. The first is a blow-up construction, corresponding
to the notion of an elementary modification of a Lie algebroid along a
subalgebroid. The second is a gluing construction, whereby groupoids defined on
the open sets of an appropriate cover may be combined to obtain global
integrations.
  This allows us to classify all Hausdorff symplectic groupoids of log
symplectic manifolds in a combinatorial fashion, in terms of a certain graph of
fundamental groups associated to the manifold. Using the same ideas, and as a
first step, we also construct and classify the groupoids integrating the Lie
algebroid of vector fields tangent to a smooth hypersurface.

presented which allows us to rigorously describe the simultaneous creation of
phonons, $R^-$, and $R^+$ rotons in helium by either a phonon from the solid or
a helium quasiparticle incident on the interface. The interaction of all $HeII$
quasiparticles with the interface, and their transmission, reflection and
conversion into each other, is described in a unified way. The angles of
propagation and the probabilities of creating quasiparticles are obtained for
all cases. Andreev reflection of helium phonons and rotons is predicted. The
energy flows through the interface due to phonons, $R^-$, and $R^+$ rotons are
derived. The small contribution of the $R^-$ rotons is due to the small
probability of an $R^-$ roton being created by a phonon in the solid, and vice
versa. This explains the failure to directly create beams of $R^-$ rotons prior
to the experiments of Tucker and Wyatt in 1999. New experiments for creating
$R^-$ rotons, by beams of high-energy phonons (h-phonons), are suggested.

a regulation of the bacterial population size. The latter and the fluctuations

almost surely to extinction. Therefore, we are interested in the long time

(LTD) at glutamatergic hippocampal synapses are well characterized examples of
long-term synaptic plasticity. Persistent increased activity of the enzyme
protein kinase M (PKM) is thought essential for maintaining LTP. Additional
spatial and temporal features that govern LTP and LTD induction are embodied in
the synaptic tagging and capture (STC) and cross capture hypotheses. Only
synapses that have been ""tagged"" by an stimulus sufficient for LTP and learning
can ""capture"" PKM. A model was developed to simulate the dynamics of key
molecules required for LTP and LTD. The model concisely represents
relationships between tagging, capture, LTD, and LTP maintenance. The model
successfully simulated LTP maintained by persistent synaptic PKM, STC, LTD, and
cross capture, and makes testable predictions concerning the dynamics of PKM.
The maintenance of LTP, and consequently of at least some forms of long-term
memory, is predicted to require continual positive feedback in which PKM
enhances its own synthesis only at potentiated synapses. This feedback
underlies bistability in the activity of PKM. Second, cross capture requires
the induction of LTD to induce dendritic PKM synthesis, although this may
require tagging of a nearby synapse for LTP. The model also simulates the
effects of PKM inhibition, and makes additional predictions for the dynamics of
CaM kinases. Experiments testing the above predictions would significantly
advance the understanding of memory maintenance.

drop bodies, connected by a thin liquid neck move over the substrate. Supported
by new experimental data a thin film hydrodynamic analysis of this state is

with the full resolution model. The relative RMS error of the surface
brightness <4 % at all wavelengths, and in regions of high column density the
relative RMS error was only 10^{-4}. Computation with the adaptive model was
faster by a factor of ~5. The new method for calculating the scattered flux is
faster by a factor of ~4 in large models with a deep hierarchy structure, when
images of the scattered light are computed towards several observing
directions. The efficiency of the subiteration algorithm is highly dependent on
the details of the model. In the circumstellar disc test the speed-up was a

be most beneficial in models where a large number of small, dense regions are

controlling the true number of equilibria, including those unobserved. We

common belief in the vision community (including ours, before this study) is
that their ordering of contributions reflects the performance of detector in
practice. However, what we have experimentally found is that the ordering of

number of components, and switching the initialization step from their
aspect-ratio, left-right flipping heuristics to appearance-based clustering,
considerable improvement in performance is obtained. But more intriguingly, we
show that with these new components, the part deformations can now be

idea might have wider applications in addition to object detection.

computation, called \emph{multiparty cloud computation} (\MCC): Given $k$
clients storing their data in the cloud, how can they perform the joint
functionality by contributing their private data as inputs, and making use of
cloud's powerful computation capability. Namely, the clients wish to oursource
computation to the cloud together with their private data stored in the cloud,
which naturally happens when the computation is involved with large datasets,
e.g., to analyze malicious URLs. We note that the \MCC\ problem is different
from widely considered concepts, e.g., secure multiparty computation and
multiparty computation with server aid.

three promising properties: proxy re-encryption -- transforming encrypted data

decrypting encrypted data by combining secret key shares obtained by a set of

However, the analysis is quite arcane and complicated and works by iteratively
improving an infeasible schedule. Here, we provide a more accessible analysis

Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of dual-hop transmission from a source to a destination via two
parallel full-duplex relays in block Rayleigh fading environment is
investigated. All nodes in the network are assumed to be oblivious to their
forward channel gains; however, they have perfect information about their
backward channel gains. The focus of this paper is on simple, efficient, and
practical relaying schemes to increase the expected-rate at the destination.
For this purpose, various combinations of relaying protocols and the broadcast
approach (multi-layer coding) are proposed. For the decode-forward (DF)
relaying, the maximum finite-layer expected-rate as well as two upper-bounds on
the continuous-layer expected-rate are obtained. The main feature of the
proposed DF scheme is that the layers being decoded at both relays are added
coherently at the destination although each relay has no information about the
number of layers being successfully decoded by the other relay. It is proved
that the optimal coding scheme is transmitting uncorrelated signals via the
relays. Next, the maximum expected-rate of ON/OFF based amplify-forward (AF)
relaying is analytically derived. For further performance improvement, a hybrid
decode-amplify-forward (DAF) relaying strategy, adopting the broadcast approach
at the source and relays, is proposed and its maximum throughput and maximum
finite-layer expected-rate are presented. Moreover, the maximum throughput and
maximum expected-rate in the compress-forward (CF) relaying adopting the
broadcast approach, using optimal quantizers and Wyner-Ziv compression at the
relays, are fully derived. All theoretical results are illustrated by numerical
simulations. As it turns out from the results, when the ratio of the relay
power to the source power is high, the CF relaying outperforms DAF (and hence
outperforms both DF and AF relaying); otherwise, DAF scheme is superior.

Lynden-Bell for the Jupiter-Io system, has been applied to different types of
binary systems in recent years. We show that there exists an upper limit to the
magnetic interaction torque and energy dissipation rate in such model. This
arises because when the resistance of the circuit is too small, the large
current flow severely twists the magnetic flux tube connecting the two binary
components, leading to breakdown of the circuit. Applying this limit, we find
that in coalescing neutron star binaries, magnetic interactions produce
negligible correction to the phase evolution of the gravitational waveform,
even for magnetar-like field strengths. However, energy dissipation in the
binary magnetosphere may still give rise to electromagnetic radiation prior to
the final merger. For ultra-compact white dwarf binaries, we find that DC
circuit does not provide adequate energy dissipation to explain the observed
X-ray luminosities of several sources. For exoplanetary systems containing
close-in Jupiters or super-Earths, magnetic torque and dissipation are
negligible, except possibly during the early T Tauri phase, when the stellar
magnetic field is stronger than 10^3G.

respectively. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) focuses on the latent dimensions
in textual data; social network analysis (SNA) on the observable networks. The
two coupled topographies of information-processing in the network space and
meaning-processing in the vector space operate with different (nonlinear)
dynamics. The historical dynamics of information processing in observable
networks organizes the system into instantiations; the systems dynamics,
however, can be considered as self-organizing in terms of fluxes of
communication along the various dimensions that operate with different codes.
The development over time adds evolutionary differentiation to the historical
integration; a richer structure can process more complexity.

for both science and engineering. Here, we present an interesting idea of using
pencil leads, which are made of graphite and clay, to generate electricity from
the thermal motion of ions in aqueous electrolyte solution at room temperature.
When two pencil leads were placed in parallel in the solutions, output power of
0.655, 1.023, 1.023 and 1.828 nW were generated in 3 M KCl, NaCl, NiCl2 and
CuCl2 solutions, respectively. Besides, we also demonstrate that two pieces of
reduced graphene oxide films and /or few-layer graphene films can generate much
more electricity when dipped into the solutions, while there was no electrodes
contact with the solution. This finding further verified that the electricity
was not resulted from the chemical reaction between the electrodes and the

harvested with low dimensional materials, such as graphene, or with the surface
of solid material without the presence of temperature gradient. However, the
mechanism is still unclear.

steep density profile, $\rho \sim r^{-2.25}$. The high energy electrons and
positrons from the dark matter annihilation can inverse Compton scatter (ICS)
with the background photons, such as CMB photons, to acquire higher energy. On
the other hand, the synchrotron radiation can also be produced when they meet
the magnetic field. In this paper, we study the signals from the UCMHs due to
the dark matter annihilation for the radio, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray band. We
found that for the radio emission the UCMHs can provide one kind of source for
the radio excess observed by ARCADE 2.
  But the X-ray signals due to the ICS effect or the $\gamma$-ray signals
mainly due to the prompt emission from dark matter would exceed the present
observations, such as Fermi, COMPTEL and CHANDRA. We found that the strongest
limits on the fraction of UCMHs come from the X-ray observations and the
constraints from the radio data are the weakest.

simulations, we found that various limited mobility patterns such as
sub-diffusion, trapping, and logarithmic diffusion could be observed. By the
memory, a long-ranged directional anti-correlation kinetically-induces
anomalous sub-diffusive and trapping behaviors, and transition between them.
With random jumps by the impulse parameter, a trapped walker can escape from
the trap very slowly, resulting in an ultraslow logarithmic diffusive behavior.
Our results suggest that the memory of walker's has-beens can be one mechanism
