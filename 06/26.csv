quadrature operators of light within a reservoir connected to dissipative
quantum systems. We formulate the study of quadrature trajectories in terms of
characteristic operators and show that in the long time limit the statistics of
such trajectories obey a large-deviation principle. We take our motivation from
homodyne detection schemes which allow the statistics of quadrature operator of
the light field to be measured. We illustrate our approach with four examples
of increasing complexity: a driven two-level system, a `blinking' three-level
system, a pair of weakly-coupled two-level driven systems, and the micromaser.
We discuss how quadrature operators can serve as alternative order parameters
for the classification of dynamical phases, which is particularly useful in
cases where the statistics of quantum jumps cannot distinguish between such
phases. The formalism we introduce also allows us to analyse the properties of
the light emitted by quantum jump trajectories which fluctuate far from the
typical dynamics.

inner product. We focus on devising a fixed matrix A in R^{m x n} and a
deterministic recovery/estimation procedure which work for all possible input
vectors simultaneously. Our results improve upon existing work, the following
being our main contributions:
  * A proof that linf/l1 sparse recovery and inner product estimation are
equivalent, and that incoherent matrices can be used to solve both problems.
Our upper bound for the number of measurements is m=O(eps^{-2}*min{log n, (log
n / log(1/eps))^2}). We can also obtain fast sketching and recovery algorithms
by making use of the Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform. Both our running
times and number of measurements improve upon previous work. We can also obtain
better error guarantees than previous work in terms of a smaller tail of the
input vector.
  * A new lower bound for the number of linear measurements required to solve
l1/l1 sparse recovery. We show Omega(k/eps^2 + klog(n/k)/eps) measurements are
required to recover an x' with |x - x'|_1 <= (1+eps)|x_{tail(k)}|_1, where
x_{tail(k)} is x projected onto all but its largest k coordinates in magnitude.
  * A tight bound of m = Theta(eps^{-2}log(eps^2 n)) on the number of
measurements required to solve deterministic norm estimation, i.e., to recover
|x|_2 +/- eps|x|_1.
  For all the problems we study, tight bounds are already known for the
randomized complexity from previous work, except in the case of l1/l1 sparse

have provided strong support for existing dynamical evidence for an
intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) of mass 1.8 +/- 0.5 x 10^4 solar masses at
the cluster center. However, given the relatively low significance and
astrometric accuracy of the radio detection, and the non-simultaneity of the
X-ray and radio measurements, this identification required further
confirmation. Here we present deep, high angular resolution, strictly
simultaneous X-ray and radio observations of G1. While the X-ray emission (L_X
= 1.74^{+0.53}_{-0.44} x 10^{36} (d/750 kpc)^2 erg/s in the 0.5-10 keV band)
remained fully consistent with previous observations, we detected no radio
emission from the cluster center down to a 3-sigma upper limit of 4.7
microJy/beam. Our favored explanation for the previous radio detection is
flaring activity from a black hole low mass X-ray binary (LMXB). We performed a
new regression of the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, valid for
determining black hole mass from radio and X-ray observations of sub-Eddington
black holes, finding log M_{BH} = (1.638 +/- 0.070)log L_R - (1.136 +/-
0.077)log L_X - (6.863 +/- 0.790), with an empirically-determined uncertainty
of 0.44 dex. This constrains the mass of the X-ray source in G1, if a black
hole, to be <9700 solar masses at 95% confidence, suggesting that it is a
persistent LMXB. This annuls what was previously the most convincing evidence
from radiation for an IMBH in the Local Group, though the evidence for an IMBH
in G1 from velocity dispersion measurements remains unaffected by these
results.

the Keck-II telescope to derive radial velocities for candidate member stars of
these objects and thereby identify the stars that are most likely actual
members. Eleven most probable stellar members (of 13 candidates) are found for
AndXXII. We obtain an upper limit of sigma_v < 6.0 km s-1 for the velocity
dispersion of AndXXII, [Fe/H] ~ -1.6 for its metallicity, and 255pc for the
Plummer radius of its projected density profile. We construct a colour
magnitude diagram for AndXXII and identify both the red giant branch and the
horizontal branch. The position of the latter is used to derive a heliocentric
distance to And XXII of 853 pm 26 kpc. The combination of the radial velocity,
distance, and angular position of AndXXII indicates that it is a strong
candidate for being the first known satellite of M33 and one of the very few
examples of a galactic satellite of a satellite. N-body simulations imply that
this conclusion is unchanged even if M31 and M33 had a strong encounter in the
past few Gyr. We test the hypothesis that the extended clusters highlight
tidally stripped galaxies by searching for an excess cloud of halo-like stars
in their vicinity. We find such a cloud for the case of EC1 but not EC2. The
three objects imply a dynamical mass for M33 that is consistent with previous

bi-fundamental tachyon in its open string spectrum, for any separation less
than the critical distance. The dynamics of this system would be described by
the Garousi's effective action for any non-zero separation. Our study shows
however that the domain of validity of this action only includes space-like
tachyon condensation. Previous studies led by Bagchi and Sen showed that, in a
partial sub-critical domain, exists a conformal field theory (CFT), which
describes a dynamical condensation at static distance, called rolling tachyon.
We show that this CFT actually exists on the whole tachyonic domain. Thanks to
this demonstration, we prove that the domain of validity of Garousi's action
excludes time-dependent tachyon condensation, and we justify the computation of
the partition fonction along the rolling tachyon on the whole sub-critical
domain. Using a method proposed by Kutasov and Niarchos, we determine a
quadratic effective action for the tachyon and distance fields, at least valid
in the whole tachyonic domain around the rolling tachyon solution. In addition,
we studied the non linear sigma model of perturbative deformations along the
rolling tachyon CFT. The beta-function of the renormalization group, that we
obtained, are in good agreement with the equations of movement derived from the
proposed quadratic effective action. This stands as an independent confirmation

upon four key biological parameters: the strength of the transcription factor
binding sites, the concentration of the transcription factor, and the length
and sequence of the DNA loop. Our studies lead to the surprising insight that
sequences that are thought to be especially favorable for nucleosome formation
because of high flexibility lead to no systematically detectable effect of
sequence on looping, and begin to provide a picture of the distinctions between
the short length scale mechanics of nucleosome formation and looping.

240, 330 and 610 MHz of the complex radio source at the center of the NGC1407

emission enclosing the central twin-jet radio galaxy. This has been interpreted
as an indication of two possible radio outbursts occurring at different times.
Both the inner double and diffuse component are detected in the new GMRT images
at high levels of significance. Combining the GMRT observations with archival
Very Large Array data at 1.4 and 4.9 GHz, we derive the total spectrum of both
components. The inner double has a spectral index \alpha=0.7, typical for
active, extended radio galaxies, whereas the spectrum of the large-scale
emission is very steep, with \alpha=1.8 between 240 MHz and 1.4 GHz. The
radiative age of the large-scale component is very long, ~300 Myr, compared to
~30 Myr estimated for the central double, confirming that the diffuse component
was generated during a former cycle of activity of the central galaxy. The
current activity have so far released an energy which is nearly one order of
magnitude lower than that associated with the former outburst. The group X-ray
emission in the Chandra and XMM-Newton images and extended radio emission show
a similar swept-back morphology. We speculate that the two structures are both
affected by the motion of the group core, perhaps due to the core sloshing in
response to a recent encounter with the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC1400.

eccentricities less than 0.04. The spin axis of the primary body and the

assembly redshifts $\zdm\approx 1-3$, which we found earlier for Coma. The
dynamical mass following the light is larger than expected for a Kroupa stellar
IMF, especially in galaxies with high velocity dispersion $\sigeff$ inside the

galaxies. Alternatively, some dark matter in massive galaxies could follow the
light closely. Combining with our comparison sample of Coma early-types, we now
have 5 of 24 galaxies where (1) mass follows light to $1-3\,\reff$, (2) the

two-dimensional Fokker-Planck method, with the goal of providing a model for
the formation of supermassive stars which could serve as seed objects for the
supermassive black holes of quasars. This work follows and expands on earlier
1-D studies of spherical clusters of main-sequence stars. The 2-D approach
allows for the study of rotating systems, as would be expected due to
cosmological tidal torquing; other physical effects included are collisional
mergers of stars and a bulk stellar bar perturbation in the gravitational
potential. The 3 Myr main-sequence lifetime for large stars provides an upper
limit on simulation times. Two general classes of initial systems are studied:
Plummer spheres, which represent stellar clusters, and \gamma=0 spheres, which
model galactic spheroids.
  At the initial densities of the modeled systems, mass segregation and runaway
stellar collisions alone are insufficient to induce core collapse within the
lifetime limit if no bar perturbation is included. However, core collapse is
not a requirement for the formation of a massive object: the choice of stellar
initial mass function is found to play a crucial role. When using an IMF
similar to that observed for dense stellar clusters the simulations show that
the stellar system forms massive (250M_\odot) objects by collisional mergers;
in almost all such cases the presence of a stellar bar allows for sufficient
additional outward transport of angular momentum that a core-collapse state is
reached with corresponding further increase in the rate of formation of massive
objects. In contrast, simulations using an IMF similar to that observed for
field stars in general (which is weighted more towards lower masses) produce no
massive objects, and reach core collapse only for initial models which
represent the highest-density galactic spheriods.

guidance to a behaving agent, even in the absence of sensory information. It is
not clear how representations are developed and whether or not they are
necessary or even essential for intelligent behavior. We argue here that the
ability to represent relevant features of the environment is the expected
consequence of an adaptive process, give a formal definition of representation
based on information theory, and quantify it with a measure R. To measure how R
changes over time, we evolve two types of networks---an artificial neural
network and a network of hidden Markov gates---to solve a categorization task
using a genetic algorithm. We find that the capacity to represent increases
during evolutionary adaptation, and that agents form representations of their
environment during their lifetime. This ability allows the agents to act on
sensorial inputs in the context of their acquired representations and enables
complex and context-dependent behavior. We examine which concepts (features of
the environment) our networks are representing, how the representations are
logically encoded in the networks, and how they form as an agent behaves to
solve a task. We conclude that R should be able to quantify the representations
within any cognitive system, and should be predictive of an agent's long-term
adaptive success.

fixes several issues of the continuum description that made the overlap with

correct relative and total momenta. Our prescription preserves the (possible)

Berry curvature. By relaxing the maximally localized hybrid Wannier orbital
prescription, we can form an orthonormal basis of states which, upon gauge
fixing, can be used in lieu of the Landau orbitals. We find that the exact

to maximize the rate, the secondary relays must transmit with power
proportional to n^(-1) (thus the sum of relay powers is bounded) and also that
the secondary source may not operate at its maximum allowable power. The
tradeoff between the secondary rate and the interference on the primary is also
characterized, showing that the primary interference can be reduced
asymptotically to zero as n increases, while still maintaining a secondary rate
that grows proportionally to log n. Finally, to address the rate loss due to
half-duplex relaying in the secondary, we propose an alternating relay protocol
and investigate its performance.

adds orbital harmonics to the Fourier transform of the GW signal and
relativistic pericenter precession leads to a three-way splitting of each

with different initial eccentricity using the Fisher matrix method and a Monte

parameter estimation by breaking degeneracies between different parameters. In

significantly for higher-mass binaries due to eccentricity. The typical sky
position errors are $\sim1 $deg for a nonspinning, $10^7\,M_{\odot}$ equal-mass

to a synthetic catalog of 500 lenses with power-law potential and external
shear. For simplicity we focus on double-image lenses (the largest fraction of
lens in the simulated sample) and select a subsample for which astrometry and
time-delays provide strong evidence for a simple power-law model description.
Through a likelihood analysis we recover the input value of the Hubble constant

description with high statistical significance. Assuming a flat \LambdaCDM

Hubble constant H_0=76+15-5 km/s/Mpc having marginalized over the lens model
parameters, the cosmic matter density and consistently propagated the
observational errors on the angular position of the images. The next generation
of cosmic structure surveys will provide larger lens datasets and the method

diminished dust optical depths in the inner regions of protoplanetary

context of current models of grain growth and transport.
  Methods: A set of dust evolution models with different disk shapes, masses,
turbulence parameters, and drift efficiencies is combined with radiative
transfer calculations in order to derive theoretical spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and images.
  Results: We find that grain growth and transport effects can indeed produce
dips in the infrared SED, as typically found in observations of transition
disks. Our models achieve the necessary reduction of mass in small dust by
producing larger grains, yet not large enough to be fragmenting efficiently.
However, this population of large grains is still detectable at millimeter
wavelengths. Even if perfect sticking is assumed and radial drift is neglected,
a large population of dust grains is left behind because the time scales on
which they are swept up by the larger grains are too long. This mechanism thus
fails to reproduce the large emission cavities observed in recent
millimeter-wave interferometric images of accreting transition disks.

and analysed, in both the local ISM and in nearby normal galaxies. Generally, a
power-law describes the relationship well with an index ranging from 0.2-0.6,
now referred to as one of ""Larson's Relationships."" The nature of turbulence
and star formation is considered to be intimately related to these
relationships, so evaluating the sigma-R correlations in various environments
is important for developing a comprehensive understanding of the ISM. We
measure the sigma-R relationship in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the
Galactic Centre using spectral line observations of the high density tracers
N2H+, HCN, H13CN, and HCO+. We use dendrograms, which map the hierarchical
nature of the position-position-velocity (PPV) data, to compute sigma and R of
contiguous structures. The dispersions range from ~2-30 km/s in structures
spanning sizes 2-40 pc, respectively. By performing Bayesian inference, we show
that a power-law with exponent 0.3-1.1 can reasonably describe the sigma-R
trend. We demonstrate that the derived sigma-R relationship is independent of
the locations in the PPV dataset where sigma and R are measured. The uniformity
in the sigma-R relationship suggests turbulence in the CMZ is driven on the
large scales beyond >30 pc. We compare the CMZ sigma-R relationship to that
measured in the Galactic molecular cloud Perseus. The exponents between the two
systems are similar, suggestive of a connection between the turbulent
properties within a cloud to its ambient medium. Yet, the velocity dispersion
in the CMZ is systematically higher, resulting in a coefficient that is nearly
five times larger. The systematic enhancement of turbulent velocities may be
due to the combined effects of increased star formation activity, larger
densities, and higher pressures relative to the local ISM.

HST ACS/SBC reveals structured UV morphology in 93% of the sample, consistent
with low-level ongoing SF (~0.5 Ms/yr). In 3/4 of the sample the SF is extended
on galaxy scales (25-75 kpc), while the rest contains smaller (5-15 kpc) SF
patches in the vicinity of an ETG - presumably gas-rich satellites being
disrupted. Optical imaging reveals that all ETGs with galaxy-scale SF in our
sample have old stellar disks (mostly S0 type). None is classified as a true
elliptical. In our sample, galaxy-scale SF takes the form of UV rings of
varying sizes and morphologies. For the majority of such objects we conclude
that the gas needed to fuel current SF has been accreted from the IGM, probably
in a prolonged, quasi-static manner, leading in some cases to additional disk
buildup. The remaining ETGs with galaxy-scale SF have UV and optical
morphologies consistent with minor merger-driven SF or with the final stages of
SF in fading spirals. Our analysis excludes that all recent SF on the red
sequence resulted from gas-rich mergers. We find further evidence that
galaxy-scale SF is almost exclusively an S0 phenomenon (~20% S0s have SF) by
examining the overall optically red SDSS ETGs. Conclusion is that significant
number of field S0s maintain or resume low-level SF because the preventive
feedback is not in place or is intermittent. True ellipticals, on the other
hand, stay entirely quiescent even in the field.

quantify four different galactic environments, namely: (1) the mass of the host
group halo; (2) the projected halo-centric distance; (3) the rank of galaxies
as central or satellites within their group halos; and (4) the filamentary
large-scale structure (LSS) density. No self-consistent identification of a
central galaxy is found in ~40% of <10^13.5 M_sun groups, from which we
estimate that ~15% of groups at these masses are dynamically unrelaxed systems.
Central galaxies in relaxed and unrelaxed groups have in general similar
properties, suggesting that centrals are regulated by their mass and not by
their environment. Centrals in relaxed groups have however ~30% larger sizes
than in unrelaxed groups, possibly due accretion of small satellites in
virialized group halos. At M>10^10 M_sun, satellite galaxies in relaxed and
unrelaxed groups have similar size, color and (specific) star formation rate
distributions; at lower galaxy masses, satellites are marginally redder in
relaxed relative to unrelaxed groups, suggesting quenching of star formation in
low-mass satellites by physical processes active in relaxed halos. Finally,
relaxed and unrelated groups show similar stellar mass conversion efficiencies,
peaking at halo masses around 10^12.5 M_sun. In the enclosed ZENS catalogue we

the recently introduced concept of quasi-integrability. We show that such
models possess an infinite number of quasi-conserved charges which present
intriguing properties in relation to very specific space-time parity
transformations. For the case of two-soliton solutions where the fields are
eigenstates of this parity, those charges are asymptotically conserved in the
scattering process of the solitons. Even though the charges vary in time their
values in the far past and the far future are the same. Such results are
obtained through analytical and numerical methods, and employ adaptations of
algebraic techniques used in integrable field theories. Our findings may have
important consequences on the applications of these models in several areas of
non-linear science. We make a detailed numerical study of the modified NLS
potential of the form V = |psi|^(2(2+epsilon)), with epsilon being a
perturbation parameter. We perform numerical simulations of the scattering of
solitons for this model and find a good agreement with the results predicted by
the analytical considerations. Our paper shows that the quasi-integrability
concepts recently proposed in the context of modifications of the sine-Gordon
model remain valid for perturbations of the NLS model.

galaxies in redshift surveys on small scales, but there are numerous additional
terms that arise on large scales. Some of these terms can be described using
Newtonian dynamics and have been discussed in the literature, while the others
require proper general relativistic description that was only recently
developed. Accounting for these terms in galaxy clustering is the first step
toward tests of general relativity on horizon scales. The effects can be
classified as two terms that represent the velocity and the gravitational
potential contributions. Their amplitude is determined by effects such as the
volume and luminosity distance fluctuation effects and the time evolution of
galaxy number density and Hubble parameter. We compare the Newtonian
approximation often used in the redshift-space distortion literature to the
fully general relativistic equation, and show that Newtonian approximation
accounts for most of the terms contributing to velocity effect. We perform a
Fisher matrix analysis of detectability of these terms and show that in a
single tracer survey they are completely undetectable. To detect these terms
one must resort to the recently developed methods to reduce sampling variance
and shot noise. We show that in an all-sky galaxy redshift survey at low
redshift the velocity term can be measured at a few sigma if one can utilize
halos of mass M>10^12 Msun (this can increase to 10-sigma or more in some more
optimistic scenarios), while the gravitational potential term itself can only
be marginally detected. We also demonstrate that the general relativistic
effect is not degenerate with the primordial non-Gaussian signature in galaxy
bias, and the ability to detect primordial non-Gaussianity is little
compromised.

luminosity functions and their redshift evolution as well as indirect
constraints on the space density of lower luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei
based on the galaxy stellar mass function. Since the hypothesis of a
reionization due to LBGs alone requires a significant contribution of faint
dwarf galaxies and a LyC photon escape fraction (f_esc) of the order of ~20%,
in tension with present observational constraints, we examine under which
hypothesis AGNs and LBGs may provide a combined relevant contribution to the
reionization. We show that a relatively steep faint-end of the AGN luminosity
function, consistent with present constraints, provides a relevant (although
sub-dominant) contribution, thus allowing us to recover the required ionizing
photon rates with f_esc~5% up to z~7. At higher redshifts, we test the case for
a luminosity-dependent f_esc scenario and we conclude that, if the observed
LBGs are indeed characterized by very low f_esc, values of the order of
f_esc~70% are needed for objects below our detection threshold, for this galaxy
population to provide a substantial contribution to reionization. Clearly, the
study of the properties of faint sources (both AGNs and LBGs) is crucial.

We explain
why the existing data converge on the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop as a
tremor generator and consider a conductance-based model of subthalamo-pallidal
circuits embedded into a simplified representation of the basal
ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit to investigate the dynamics of this loop. We
show how variation of the strength of dopamine-modulated connections in the
basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop (representing the decreasing dopamine level
in Parkinson's disease) leads to the occurrence of tremor-like burst firing.
These tremor-like oscillations are suppressed when the connections are
modulated back to represent a higher dopamine level (as it would be the case in
dopaminergic therapy), as well as when the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop
is broken (as would be the case for ablative anti-parkinsonian surgeries).
Thus, the proposed model provides an explanation for the basal
ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop mechanism of tremor generation. The strengthening
of the loop leads to tremor oscillations, while the weakening or disconnection
of the loop suppresses them. The loop origin of parkinsonian tremor also
suggests that new tremor-suppression therapies may have anatomical targets in
different cortical and subcortical areas as long as they are within the basal
ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.

free motions of scalar particles on curved surfaces of given isometry algebras
can be mapped on 1D Schroedinger equations with particular potentials. As long
as the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a curved surface is proportional to one of
the Casimir invariants of the isometry algebra, free motion on the surface is
described by means of the eigenvalue problem of that very Casimir operator and
the excitation modes are classified according to the irreps of the algebra of
interest. In consequence, also the spectra of the equivalent Schroedinger
operators are classified according to the same irreps. We here use the
potential algebra concept as a guidance in the search for an interaction
describing conformal degeneracies. For this purpose we subject the so(4)
isometry algebra of the S^3 ball to a particular non-unitary similarity
transformation and obtain a deformed isometry copy to S^3 such that free motion
on the copy is equivalent to a cotangent perturbed motion on S^3, and to the 1D
Schroedinger operator with the trigonometric Rosen-Morse potential as well. The
latter presents itself especially well suited for quark-system studies insofar
as its Taylor series decomposition begins with a Cornell-type potential and in
accord with lattice QCD predictions. We fit the strength of the cotangent
potential to the spectra of the unflavored high-lying mesons and obtain a value
compatible with the light dilaton mass. We conclude that while the conformal
group symmetry of QCD following from AdS_5/CFT_4 may be broken by the dilaton
mass, it still may be preserved as a symmetry algebra of the potential, thus
explaining the observed conformal degeneracies in the unflavored hadron
spectra, both baryons and mesons.

acceleration and electron-positron plasma generation at low altitude in the
polar magnetic flux tubes of Rotation Powered Pulsars, when the stellar surface
is free to emit whatever charges and currents are demanded by the force-free
magnetosphere. We observe novel behavior. a) When the current density is less
than the Goldreich-Julian (GJ) value (0<j/j_{GJ}<1), space charge limited
acceleration of the current carrying beam is mild, with the full GJ charge
density being comprised of the charge density of the beam, co-existing with a
cloud of electrically trapped particles with the same sign of charge as the
beam. The voltage drops are on the order of mc^2/e, and pair creation is
absent. b) When the current density exceeds the GJ value (j/j_{GJ}>1), the
system develops high voltage drops, causing emission of gamma rays and intense
bursts of pair creation. The bursts exhibit limit cycle behavior, with
characteristic time scales somewhat longer than the relativistic fly-by time
over distances comparable to the polar cap diameter (microseconds). c) In
return current regions, where j/j_{GJ}<0, the system develops similar bursts of
pair creation. In cases b) and c), the intermittently generated pairs allow the
system to simultaneously carry the magnetospherically prescribed currents and
adjust the charge density and average electric field to force-free conditions.
We also elucidate the conditions for pair creating beam flow to be steady,
finding that such steady flows can occupy only a small fraction of the current
density parameter space of the force-free magnetospheric model. The generic
polar flow dynamics and pair creation is strongly time dependent. The model has
an essential difference from almost all previous quantitative studies, in that
we sought the accelerating voltage as a function of the applied current.

This first work presents the sample and the observations, discusses the cluster

individuates the most likely planetary host candidates. We observed a total of
88 main-sequence stars, subgiants, and giants all highly probable members of

exoplanets are present by obtaining radial velocities with precisions as good
as 10 m/s. To date, we have performed 680 single observations (Dec. 2011) and a
preliminary analysis of data, spanning a period of up to eight years. Although
the sample was pre-selected to avoid the inclusion of binaries, we identify 11
previously unknown binary candidates. Eleven stars clearly displayed larger RV
variability and these are candidates to host long-term substellar companions.
The average RV is also independent of the stellar magnitude and evolutionary
status, confirming that the difference in gravitational redshift between giants
and dwarfs is almost cancelled by the atmospheric motions. We use the subsample
of solar-type stars to derive a precise true RV for this cluster. We finally
create a catalog of binaries and use it to clean the color magnitude diagram
(CMD). As conclusion, by pushing the search for planets to the faintest
possible magnitudes, it is possible to observe solar analogues in open
clusters, and we propose 11 candidates to host substellar companions.

fit the rest-frame 5-300 um emission using a two component, starburst and
active galactic nucleus (AGN), model. The total infrared (8 - 1000 um)
luminosity of this galaxy is (1.97+/-0.28)x10^13 Lsun with (1.17+/-0.27) and
(0.79+/-0.09)x10^13 Lsun due to the AGN and starburst components respectively.
The high derived AGN accretion rate of \sim20% Eddington, and the measured star
formation rate (SFR) of 1390pm150 Msun/yr, suggest that this massive system is
in a special phase of rapid central black hole and host galaxy growth, likely
caused by a gas rich merger in a dense environment. The accretion rate is
sufficient to power both the jets and the previously observed large outflow.
The high SFR and strong outflow suggest this galaxy could potentially exhaust
its fuel for stellar growth in a few tens of Myr, although the likely merger of
the radio galaxy with nearby satellites suggest bursts of star formation may
recur again on time scales of several hundreds of Myr. The age of the radio
lobes implies the jet started after the current burst of star formation, and
therefore we are possibly witnessing the transition from a merger-induced
starburst phase to a radio-loud AGN phase. We also note tentative evidence for
[CII]158um emission. This paper marks the first results from the Herschel

finite complexified fields Fp^2 (based on primes p congruent to 3 mod{4}) as
the basis for computations in a theory of discrete quantum computing, which
would therefore become a computable theory. Because the states of a discrete
n-qubit system are in principle enumerable, we are able to determine the
proportions of entangled and unentangled states. In particular, we extend the
Hopf fibration that defines the irreducible state space of conventional
continuous n-qubit theories (which is the complex projective space CP{2^{n}-1})
to an analogous discrete geometry in which the Hopf circle for any n is found
to be a discrete set of p+1 points. The tally of unit-length n-qubit states is
given, and reduced via the generalized Hopf fibration to DCP{2^{n}-1}, the
discrete analog of the complex projective space, which has p^{2^{n}-1}
(p-1)\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} (p^{2^{k}}+1) irreducible states. Using a measure of
entanglement, the purity, we explore the entanglement features of discrete
quantum states and find that the n-qubit states based on the complexified field
Fp^2 have p^{n} (p-1)^{n} unentangled states (the product of the tally for a
single qubit) with purity 1, and they have p^{n+1}(p-1)(p+1)^{n-1} maximally
entangled states with purity zero.

formation of the first metal-enriched, Pop II stars becomes possible. In turn,
Pop III star formation and early metal enrichment are slowed by the high energy
radiation emitted by Pop II stars. Thus, through the SNe and radiation they
produce, Populations II and III coevolve in the early Universe, one regulated
by the other. We present large (4 Mpc)^3, high resolution cosmological
simulations in which we self-consistently model early metal enrichment and the
stellar radiation responsible for the destruction of the coolants (H2 and HD)
required for Pop III star formation. We find that the molecule-dissociating
stellar radiation produced both locally and over cosmological distances reduces
the Pop III star formation rate at z > 10 by up to an order of magnitude
compared to the case in which this radiation is not included. However, we find
that the effect of LW feedback is to enhance the amount of Pop II star
formation. We attribute this to the reduced rate at which gas is blown out of
dark matter haloes by SNe in the simulation with LW feedback, which results in
larger reservoirs for metal-enriched star formation. Even accounting for metal
enrichment, molecule-dissociating radiation and the strong suppression of
low-mass galaxy formation due to reionization at z < 10, we find that Pop III
stars are still formed at a rate of ~ 10^-5 M_sun yr^-1 Mpc^-3 down to z ~ 6.
This suggests that the majority of primordial pair-instability SNe that may be
uncovered in future surveys will be found at z < 10. We also find that the
molecule-dissociating radiation emitted from Pop II stars may destroy H2
molecules at a high enough rate to suppress gas cooling and allow for the
formation of supermassive primordial stars which collapse to form ~ 100,000
solar mass black holes.

found an extra negative divergent ""contact term"" with no known statistical
interpretation. We compare this contact term to a similar term that arises for
nonminimally-coupled scalar fields. Although both divergences may be
interpreted as terms in the Wald entropy, we point out that the contact term
for gauge fields comes from a gauge-dependent ambiguity in Wald's formula.
Revisiting Kabat's derivation of the contact term, we show that it is sensitive
to the treatment of infrared modes. To explore these infrared issues, we
consider two-dimensional compact manifolds, such as Euclidean de Sitter space,
and show that the contact term arises from an incorrect treatment of zero

obtained and, within the realm of warped geometry, we show that the model is
consistent if and only if $\lambda$ takes its relativistic value 1.
Furthermore, since the first derivative of the warp factor is discontinuous
over the branes, we show that the elimination of problematic terms involving
the square of the warp factor second order derivatives are eliminated by
imposing detailed balance condition in the bulk. Afterwards, the Israel's
junction conditions are computed, allowing the attainment of an effective
Lagrangian in the visible brane. In particular, for a (4+1)-dimensional
Horava-like model defined in the bulk without cosmological constant, we show
that the resultant effective Lagrangian in the brane corresponds to a
(3+1)-dimensional Horava-like model with an emergent positive cosmological
constant but without detailed balance condition. Now, restoration of detailed
balance condition, at this time imposed over the brane, plays an interesting
role by fitting accordingly the sign of the arbitrary constant $\beta$ that
labels the extra terms in the model, insuring a positive brane tension and a
real energy for the graviton within its dispersion relation. To end up with,
the brane consistency equations are obtained and, as a result, we show that the
detailed balance condition again plays an essential role in eliminating bad
behaving terms and that the model admits positive brane tensions in the
compactification scheme if, and only if, $\beta$ is negative, what is in
accordance with the previous result obtained for the visible brane.

coupling (SOC) and Hubbard interaction U in correlated materials. A current
consensus is that the stronger the SOC, the smaller is the critical interaction
Uc required for a spin-orbit Mott insulator, because the atomic SOC splits a
band into different total angular momentum bands narrowing the effective
bandwidth. It was further claimed that at large enough SOC, the stronger the
SOC, the weaker the Uc because in general the effective SOC is enhanced with
increasing electron-electron interaction strength. Contrary to this
expectation, we find that, in orthorhombic perovskite oxides (Pbnm), the
stronger the SOC, the bigger the Uc. This is originated from a line of Dirac
node in Jeff=1/2 bands near the Fermi level inherited from a combination of the
lattice structure and a large SOC. Due to this protected line of nodes, there
are small hole and electron pockets in SrIrO3, and such a small density of
states makes Hubbard interaction less efficient in building a magnetic
insulator. The full phase diagram in U vs. SOC is obtained, where non-magnetic
semimetal, magnetic metal, and magnetic insulator are found. Magnetic ordering
patterns beyond Uc are also presented. We further discuss implications of our

most massive progenitor of a cluster of M_vir=2 10^15 M_sun at z=0), we
evaluate the impact of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on galaxy mass content, BH
self-regulation, and gas distribution inside this massive halo. We find that SN
feedback has a marginal influence on the stellar structure, and no influence on
the mass distribution on large scales. In contrast, AGN feedback alone is able
to significantly alter the stellar-bulge mass content by quenching star
formation when the BH is self-regulating, and by depleting the cold gas
reservoir in the centre of the galaxy. The growth of the BH proceeds first by a
rapid Eddington-limited period fed by direct cold filamentary infall. When the
energy delivered by the AGN is sufficiently large to unbind the cold gas of the
bulge, the accretion of gas onto the BH is maintained both by smooth gas inflow
and clump migration through the galactic disc triggered by merger-induced
torques. The feedback from the AGN has also a severe consequence on the baryon
mass content within the halo, producing large-scale hot superwinds, able to
blow away some of the cold filamentary material from the centre and reduce the
baryon fraction by more than 30 per cent within the halo's virial radius. Thus
in the very young universe, AGN feedback is likely to be a key process, shaping
the properties of the most massive galaxies.

tight circular population appears for a range of TNO physical properties,

circularizing. We introduce a stability parameter to predict the effectiveness

decomposition. Cycles in solar motion and activity of 60 and 20 years were used
to develop an empirical model of Earth temperature variations. The model was
fit to the Hadley global temperature data up to 1950 (time period before
anthropogenic emissions became the dominant forcing mechanism), and then
extrapolated from 1951 to 2009. After subtraction of the model, the residuals
showed an approximate linear upward trend after 1942. Herein we assume that the
residual upward warming observed during the second half of the 20th century has
been mostly induced by a worldwide rapid increase of anthropogenic emissions,
urbanization and land use change. The warming observed before 1942 is
relatively small and it is assumed to have been mostly naturally induced by a
climatic recovery since the Little Ice Age of the 17th century and the Dalton
Minimum at the beginning of the 19th century. The resulting full natural plus
anthropogenic model fits the entire 160 year record very well. Residual
analysis does not provide any evidence for a substantial cooling effect due to
sulfate aerosols from 1940 to 1970. The cooling observed during that period may
be due to a natural 60-year cycle, which is visible in the global temperature
since 1850 and has been observed also in numerous multisecular climatic
records. New solar activity proxy models are developed that suggest a mechanism
for both the 60-year climate cycle and a portion of the long-term warming
trend. Our results suggest that because current models underestimate the
strength of natural multidecadal cycles in the temperature records, the
anthropogenic contribution to climate change since 1970 should be around half
of that previously claimed by the IPCC [2007]. A 21st Century forecast suggests
that climate may warm less than 1^{\circ}C by 2100.

and cold dark matter (CDM) halos found in cosmological simulations can be
understood in terms of the same physical process, collisionless gravitational
collapse. To investigate this, we study a simplified model, the collapse of a
perfectly cold Plummer sphere. First, we examine an N-body simulation of this
model with particles constrained to purely radial orbits. This results in a
final state characterized by a profile slightly steeper than \rho \propto
r^{-2} at small radii and behaving as \rho \propto r^{-4} at large radii, which
can be understood in terms of simple analytic arguments. Next, we repeat our
simulation without the restriction of radial orbits. This results in a
shallower inner density profile, like those found in elliptical galaxies and
CDM halos. We attribute this change to the radial orbit instability (ROI) and
propose a form of the distribution function (DF) motivated by a physical
picture of collapse. As evidence of the link between our model and CDM halos,
we find that our collapse simulation has a final state with pseudo-phase-space
density which scales roughly as \rho/\sigma^3 \propto r^{-1.875}, like that
observed in CDM halos from cosmological simulations (Navarro et al. 2010). The
velocity anisotropy profile is also qualitatively similar to that found near
the centers of these halos. We argue that the discrepancy at large radii (where
CDM halos scale as \rho \propto r^{-3}) is due to the presence of the
cosmological background or continued infall. This leads us to predict that the
outer CDM halo density profile is not ""universal,"" but instead depends on
cosmological environment (be it an underdense void or overdense region).

are they a tragic consequence of a breakdown of coordination? These and other

Parade in Duisburg, Germany, and the crowd disaster on July 24, 2010. Our
analysis reveals a number of misunderstandings that have widely spread. We also
provide a new perspective on concepts such as 'intentional pushing', 'mass
panic', 'stampede', and 'crowd crushs'. The focus of our analysis is on the
contributing causal factors and their mutual interdependencies, not on legal
issues or the judgment of personal or institutional responsibilities. Video
recordings show that, in Duisburg, people stumbled and piled up due to a
'domino effect', resulting from a phenomenon called 'crowd turbulence' or
'crowd quake'. Crowd quakes are a typical reason for crowd disasters, to be
distinguished from crowd disasters resulting from 'panic stampedes' or 'crowd
crushes'. In Duisburg, crowd turbulence was the consequence of amplifying
feedback and cascading effects, which are typical for systemic instabilities.
Accordingly, things can go terribly wrong in spite of no bad intentions from
anyone. Comparing the incident in Duisburg with others, we give recommendations
to help prevent future crowd disasters. In particular, we introduce a new scale
to assess the criticality of conditions in the crowd. This may allow
preventative measures to be taken earlier on. Furthermore, we discuss the
merits and limitations of citizen science for public investigation, considering
that today, almost every event is recorded and reflected in the World Wide Web.

given mass, many planets have inflated radii, while others are surprisingly
compact and may harbor large central cores. Motivated by the observational
sample, this paper considers possible effects from collisions of smaller rocky
planets with gas giant planets. In this scenario, the Jovian planets migrate
first and enter into (approximately) 4 day orbits, whereas rocky planets (mass
= 0.1-20 that of Earth) migrate later and then encounter the gaseous giants.
Previous work indicates that the collision rates are high for such systems.
This paper calculates the trajectories of incoming rocky planets as they orbit
within the gaseous planets and are subjected to gravitational, frictional, and
tidal forces. These collisions always increase the metallicity of the Jovian
planets. If the incoming rocky bodies survive tidal destruction and reach the
central regions, they provide a means of producing large planetary cores. Both
the added metallicity and larger cores act to decrease the radii of the gas
giants at fixed mass. The energy released during these collisions provides the
Jovian planet with an additional heat source; here we determine the radial
layers where kinetic energy of the colliding body is dissipated, including the
energy remaining upon impact with the existing core. This process could have
long-term effects if the colliding body deposits significant energy deep in the
interior, in regions of high opacity. Both Hot Jupiters and newly formed gas
giants have inflated radii, large enough to allow incoming rocky planets to
survive tidal disruption, enhance the central core mass, and deposit
significant energy (in contrast, denser giant planets with the mass and radius
of Jupiter are expected to tidally destroy incoming rocky bodies).

modes and quasi normal ringing in the Apostolatos - Thorne cylindrical shell
model. We consider first an expansion in harmonic modes and show that it
provides a complete solution for the characteristic value problem for the
finite perturbations of a static configuration. As a consequence of this
completeness we obtain a proof of the stability of static solutions under this
type of perturbations. The explicit expression for the mode expansion are then
used to obtain numerical values for some of the quasi normal mode complex
frequencies. Some examples involving the numerical evaluation of the integral
mode expansions are described and analyzed, and the quasi normal ringing
displayed by the solutions is found to be in agreement with quasi normal modes
found previously. Going back to the full relativistic equations of motion we
find their general linear form by expanding to first order about a static
solution. We then show that the resulting set of coupled ordinary and partial
differential equations for the dynamical variables of the system can be used to
set an initial plus boundary values problem, and prove that there is an
associated positive definite constant of the motion that puts absolute bounds
on the dynamic variables of the system, establishing the stability of the
motion of the shell under arbitrary, finite perturbations. We also show that
the problem can be solved numerically, and provide some explicit examples that
display the complete agreement between the purely numerical evolution and that
obtained using the mode expansion, in particular regarding the quasi normal
ringing that results in the evolution of the system. We also discuss the
relation of the present work to some recent results on the same model that have
appeared in the literature.

  with Stochastic Simulation Time","7 pages, 5 figures, technical report",,,,"math.OC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dynamics of many systems nowadays follow not only physical laws but also
man-made rules. These systems are known as discrete event dynamic systems and
their performances can be accurately evaluated only through simulations.
Existing studies on simulation-based optimization (SBO) usually assume
deterministic simulation time for each replication. However, in many
applications such as evacuation, smoke detection, and territory exploration,
the simulation time is stochastic due to the randomness in the system behavior.
We consider the computing budget allocation for SBO's with stochastic
simulation time in this paper, which has not been addressed in existing
literatures to the author's best knowledge. We make the following major
contribution. The relationship between simulation time and performance
estimation accuracy is quantified. It is shown that when the asymptotic
performance is of interest only the mean value of individual simulation time
matters. Then based on the existing optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA)
method for deterministic simulation time we develop OCBA for stochastic
simulation time (OCBAS), and show that OCBAS is asymptotically optimal.
Numerical experiments are used to discuss the impact of the variance of
simulation time, the impact of correlated simulation time and performance
estimation, and to demonstrate the performance of OCBAS on a smoke detection
problem in wireless sensor network. The numerical results also show that OCBA
for deterministic simulation time is robust even when the simulation time is
stochastic.

our argument is that we obtain the bound for the third level iterated integrals

dilute neutron matter is close to the region of the BCS-BEC crossover in a wide
density range, giving rise to spatially compact Cooper pair whose size is
smaller than the average interaparticle distance. This behavior extends to
moderate low density ($\sim 10^{-1}$ of the saturation density) where the
Cooper pair size becomes smallerst ($\sim 5$ fm). The Cooper pair in finite
nuclei also exhibits the spatial correlation favoring the coupling of neutrons
at small relative distances $r \lesim 3$ fm with large probability.
Neutron-rich nuclei having small neutron separation energy may provide us
opportunity to probe the spatial correlation since the neutron pairing and the
spatial correlation persists also in an area of low-density neutron
distribution extending from the surface to far outside the nucleus.

ensure optimal distribution of data and workload among the processing units.
The implementation uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library for

with initial Plummer distribution functions up to core collapse with the number
of stars, N, spanning three orders of magnitude, from 10^5 to 10^7. We find

graphene bilayer studied by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We
show that energy difference of the two VHSs follows \DeltaEvhs ~
\hbar{\nu}F\DeltaK between 1.0^{\circ} and 3.0^{\circ} (here {\nu}F ~
1.1\times106 m/s is the Fermi velocity of monolayer graphene, \DeltaK =
2Ksin(\theta/2) is the shift between the corresponding Dirac points of the
twisted graphene bilayer). This result indicates that the rotation angle
between graphene sheets not results in significant reduction of the Fermi
velocity, which quite differs from that predicted by band structure
calculations. However, around a twisted angle \theta ~ 1.3^{\circ}, the
observed \DeltaEvhs ~ 0.11 eV is much less than the expected value
\hbar{\nu}F\DeltaK ~ 0.28 eV at 1.3^{\circ}. The origin of the reduction of
\DeltaEvhs at 1.3^{\circ} is discussed.

bath of fixed temperature. The probability distribution of such a system, the
Boltzmann distribution, is derived from the uniform probability distribution of
the closed universe consisting of the open system and the heat bath, by taking
the limit where the heat bath is much larger than the system of interest.
Alternatively, the Boltzmann distribution can be derived from the Maximum
Entropy Principle, where the Gibbs-Shannon entropy is maximized under the
constraint that the mean energy of the open system is fixed. To make the
connection between these two apparently distinct methods for deriving the
Boltzmann distribution, it is first shown that the uniform distribution for a
microcanonical distribution is obtained from the Maximum Entropy Principle
applied to a closed system. Then I show that the target function in the Maximum
Entropy Principle for the open system, is obtained by partial maximization of
Gibbs-Shannon entropy of the closed universe over the microstate probability
distributions of the heat bath. Thus, microcanonical origin of the Entropy
Maximization procedure for an open system, is established in a rigorous manner,
showing the equivalence between apparently two distinct approaches for deriving

the stellar coronae. We consider the energy dissipated by the reconnection
between the stellar and planetary magnetic fields as well as that made
available by the modulation of the magnetic helicity of the coronal field
produced by the orbital motion of the planet. We estimate the powers released
by both processes in the case of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric, linear and
non-linear force-free coronal fields finding that they scale as v_r (B_s)^(4/3)
(B_p)^(2/3) (R_p)^2, where v_r is the relative velocity between the stellar and
planetary fields, B_s the mean stellar surface field, B_p the planetary field
at the poles, and R_p the radius of the planet. A chromospheric hot spot or a
flaring activity phased to the orbital motion of the planet are found only when
the stellar field is axisymmetric. In the case of a non-axisymmetric field, the
time modulation of the energy release is multiperiodic and can be easily
confused with the intrinsic stellar variability. We apply our theory to the
systems with some reported evidence of star-planet magnetic interaction finding
a dissipated power at least one order of magnitude smaller than that emitted by
the chromospheric hot spots. The phase lags between the planets and the hot
spots are reproduced by our models in all the cases except for upsilon And. In
conclusion, the chromospheric hot spots rotating in phase with the planets
cannot be explained by the energy dissipation produced by the interaction
between stellar and planetary fields as considered by our models and require a
different mechanism.

characterizing the interaction of porous media and interstitial fluid flow.
This work presents a new formulation for incorporating the effects of pore
pressure in a nonlocal representation of solid mechanics. The result is a
framework for modeling fluid-structure interaction problems with the
discontinuity capturing advantages of an integral based formulation. A number
of numerical examples are used to show that the proposed formulation can be
applied to measure the effect of leak-off during hydraulic fracturing as well
as modeling consolidation of fluid saturated rock and surface subsidence caused
by fluid extraction from a geologic reservoir. The formulation incorporates the
effect of pore pressure in the constitutive description of the porous material
in a way that is appropriate for nonlinear materials, easily implemented in
existing codes, straightforward in its evaluation (no history dependence), and
justifiable from first principles. A mixture theory approach is used (deviating
only slightly where necessary) to motivate an alteration to the peridynamic
pressure term based on the fluid pore pressure. The resulting formulation has a
number of similarities to the effective stress principle developed by Terzaghi
and Biot and close correspondence is shown between the proposed method and the
classical effective stress principle.

mutation, (ii) lysis-lysogeny of bacteria by bacteriophage, and (iii)
horizontal gene transfer (HGT). For the case of bi-directional mutation

manipulated to stay quasi-stationary, the process of lysogeny maps essentially

intermetallic superconductor LaNiGa$_2$ are reported. The appearance of
spontaneous magnetic fields coincides with the onset of superconductivity,
implying that the superconducting state breaks time reversal symmetry,
similarly to non-centrosymmetric LaNiC$_2$. Only four triplet states are
compatible with this observation, all of which are non-unitary triplets. This
suggests that LaNiGa$_2$ is the centrosymmetric analogue of LaNiC$_2$. We argue
that these materials are representatives of a new family of paramagnetic
non-unitary superconductors.

continuum sources, implying a very early stage of evolution. At the same time,
our SiO data indicate the presence of high-velocity outflows related to some of
these clumps. In some cases, strong molecular emission at velocities of the

performed in the framework of full general relativity for the first time. A
truncated moment formalism is employed for a general relativistic neutrino
radiation transport. Several systems in which the black hole mass is $M_{\rm

$\approx 0.14$--$0.38M_{\odot}$ are evolved as models of the remnant formed
after the merger of binary neutron stars or black hole-neutron star binaries.
The equation of state and microphysics for the high-density and
high-temperature matter are phenomenologically taken into account in a
semi-quantitative manner. It is found that the temperature in the inner region
of the torus reaches $\agt 10$ MeV which enhances a high luminosity of
neutrinos $\sim 10^{51}$ ergs/s for $M_{\rm BH}=6M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 10^{52}$

rotational axis and their energy density may be high enough to launch a
low-energy short gamma-ray burst via the neutrino-antineutrino
pair-annihilation process with the total energy deposition $\sim

inaccurate class distribution for each entity is often available from another

classifier built using content features or a simple dictionary. Given the
relational and inaccurate external classifier information, we consider two
graph based settings in which the problem of collective classification can be
solved. In the first setting the class distribution is used to fix labels to a
subset of nodes and the labels for the remaining nodes are obtained like in a
transductive setting. In the other setting the class distributions of all nodes
are used to define the fitting function part of a graph regularized objective
function. We define a generalized objective function that handles both the
settings. Methods like harmonic Gaussian field and local-global consistency
(LGC) reported in the literature can be seen as special cases. We extend the
LGC and weighted vote relational neighbor classification (WvRN) methods to
support usage of external classifier information. We also propose an efficient
least squares regularization (LSR) based method and relate it to information
regularization methods. All the methods are evaluated on several benchmark and
real world datasets. Considering together speed, robustness and accuracy,
experimental results indicate that the LSR and WvRN-extension methods perform

delineate the property of the EFRs. The response of the upper atmosphere is
addressed by the response of the atmosphere at different wavelengths (and thus
at different temperatures). According to our results, the total emerged fluxes
are in the range of (0.44 -- 11.2)$\times10^{19}$ Mx while the maximum area
ranges from 17 to 182 arcsec$^2$. The durations of the emergence are between 1

7 -- 25 arcsec and are also correlated to the duration positively. The
separation speeds are from 0.05 to 1.08 km s$^{-1}$, negatively correlated to
the duration. The derived flux growth rates are (0.1 -- 1.3)$\times10^{19}$ Mx

based on BP. Two iterative receivers based on BP are considered: One receiver
is based on exact BP and the other on an approximate BP with Gaussian

evolution (DE) in the dense limit after taking the large-system limit, in which
the number of users and the spreading factor tend to infinity while their ratio
is kept constant. The two BP receivers are shown to achieve the same
performance as each other in these limits. Furthermore, taking a continuum
limit for the obtained DE equations implies that the performance of the two BP
receivers can be improved up to the performance achieved by the symbol-wise MAP
detection, called individually-optimal detection, via spatial coupling.

of a massive stellar core to a BH and the BNS mergers, performed in the
framework of full general relativity incorporating finite-temperature EOS and
neutrino cooling. For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the
latest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an
initial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\odot}$ presupernova model calculated
by Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,
we clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When
the rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is
deformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in
the central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the
PNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be
launched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed
around it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends
strongly on the rotation initially given. In the BNS merger simulations, we in
addition employ an EOS incorporating a degree of freedom for hyperons. The
numerical simulations show that for the purely nucleonic EOS, a HMNS with a
long lifetime ($\gg 10$ ms) is the outcome for the total mass $M \lesssim
3.0M_{\odot}$. By contrast, the formed HMNS collapses to a BH in a shorter time
scale with the hyperonic EOS for $M \gtrsim 2.7M_{\odot}$. It is shown that the
typical total neutrino luminosity of the HMNS is $\sim 3$--$10\times 10^{53}$
ergs/s and the effective amplitude of gravitational waves from the HMNS is
2--$6 \times 10^{-22}$ at $f\approx 2$--2.5 kHz for a source distance of 100

problem Q if it is possible to efficiently construct an instance of Q with
polynomially bounded parameter value that expresses the logical AND or OR of a
sequence of instances of L. Building on work by Bodlaender et al. (ICALP 2008)
and using a result by Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008) with a refinement by
Dell and van Melkebeek (STOC 2010), we show that if an NP-hard problem
OR-cross-composes into a parameterized problem Q then Q does not admit a
polynomial kernel unless NP \subseteq coNP/poly and the polynomial hierarchy
collapses. Similarly, an AND-cross-composition for Q rules out polynomial
kernels for Q under Bodlaender et al.'s AND-distillation conjecture.
  Our technique generalizes and strengthens the recent techniques of using
composition algorithms and of transferring the lower bounds via polynomial
parameter transformations. We show its applicability by proving kernelization
lower bounds for a number of important graphs problems with structural
(non-standard) parameterizations, e.g., Clique, Chromatic Number, Weighted
Feedback Vertex Set, and Weighted Odd Cycle Transversal do not admit polynomial
kernels with respect to the vertex cover number of the input graphs unless the
polynomial hierarchy collapses, contrasting the fact that these problems are
trivially fixed-parameter tractable for this parameter.
  After learning of our results, several teams of authors have successfully
applied the cross-composition framework to different parameterized problems.
For completeness, our presentation of the framework includes several extensions
based on this follow-up work. For example, we show how a relaxed version of
OR-cross-compositions may be used to give lower bounds on the degree of the

curvature corrections, corresponding to a Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk and a
Hilbert-Einstein term, as well as the strength of the induced gravity term, on
the brane. We are mainly interested in analyzing the early inflationary era of
the brane, which we model within the extreme slow-roll limit, i.e., under a de
Sitter like brane inflation, where the inflaton field is confined on the brane.
We compute the scalar perturbations in this model and compare our results with
those previously obtained for the RS2 scenario with and without an induced
gravity term on the brane or a Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk. The amplitude of
the scalar perturbations is decreased as compared with a pure RS2 model. In
addition, the effect from the Gauss-Bonnet correction in an induced gravity
brane-world model is to decrease the amplitude of the scalar perturbations, and
a similar result is obtained for the induced gravity effect in a Gauss-Bonnet
brane-world. In general, in the high energy limit the amplitude is highly
suppressed by the Gauss-Bonnet effect. Finally, we constrain the model using
the latest WMAP7 data.

nucleosome level in living cells remains largely unknown despite its potential
to play a role in mammalian gene regulation. We investigated the 3-dimensional
folding of a 1 Mbp region of human chromosome 11 containing the {\beta}-globin
genes by integrating looping interactions of the insulator protein CTCF
determined comprehensively by chromosome conformation capture (3C) into a
polymer model of chromatin. We find that CTCF-mediated cell type specific
interactions in erythroid cells are organized to favor contacts known to occur
in vivo between the {\beta}-globin locus control region (LCR) and genes. In
these cells, the modeled {\beta}-globin domain folds into a globule with the
LCR and the active globin genes on the periphery. By contrast, in non-erythroid
cells, the globule is less compact with few but dominant CTCF interactions
driving the genes away from the LCR. This leads to a decrease in contact
frequencies that can exceed 1000-fold depending on the stiffness of the
chromatin and the exact positioning of the genes. Our findings show that an
ensemble of CTCF contacts functionally affects spatial distances between
control elements and target genes contributing to chromosomal organization
required for transcription.

Habilitation thesis",,,,"hep-ph cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When hadrons scatter at high energies, strong color fields, whose dynamics is
described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), are generated at the interaction
point. If one represents these fields in terms of partons (quarks and gluons),
the average number densities of the latter saturate at ultrahigh energies. At
that point, nonlinear effects become predominant in the dynamical equations.
The hadronic states that one gets in this regime of QCD are generically called
""color glass condensates"".
  Our understanding of scattering in QCD has benefited from recent progress in
statistical and mathematical physics. The evolution of hadronic scattering
amplitudes at fixed impact parameter in the regime where nonlinear parton
saturation effects become sizable was shown to be similar to the time evolution
of a system of classical particles undergoing reaction-diffusion processes. The
dynamics of such a system is essentially governed by equations in the
universality class of the stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov
equation, which is a stochastic nonlinear partial differential equation.
Realizations of that kind of equations (that is, ""events"" in a particle physics
language) have the form of noisy traveling waves. Universal properties of the
latter can be taken over to scattering amplitudes in QCD.
  This review provides an introduction to the basic methods of statistical
physics useful in QCD, and summarizes the correspondence between these two
fields and its theoretical and phenomenological implications.

galaxies show a strong evolution from $z = 0$ to $z = 1$, but the FIR LF
evolves much stronger than the FUV one. The FUV is dominantly radiated from
newly formed short-lived OB stars, while the FIR is emitted by dust grains
heated by the FUV radiation field. It is known that dust is always associated
with star formation activity. Thus, both FUV and FIR are tightly related to the
star formation in galaxies, but in a very complicated manner. In order to
disentangle the relation between FUV and FIR emissions, we estimate the UV-IR
bivariate LF (BLF) of galaxies with {\sl GALEX} and {\sl AKARI} All-Sky Survey
datasets. Recently we invented a new mathematical method to construct the BLF
with given marginals and prescribed correlation coefficient. This method makes
use of a tool from mathematical statistics, so called ""copula"". The copula
enables us to construct a bivariate distribution function from given marginal
distributions with prescribed correlation and/or dependence structure. With
this new formulation and FUV and FIR univariate LFs, we analyze various FUV and
FIR data with {\sl GALEX}, {\sl Spitzer}, and {\sl AKARI} to estimate the UV-IR
BLF. The obtained BLFs naturally explain the nonlinear complicated relation
between FUV and FIR emission from star-forming galaxies. Though the faint-end
of the BLF was not well constrained for high-$z$ samples, the estimated linear
correlation coefficient $\rho$ was found to be very high, and is remarkably
stable with redshifts (from 0.95 at $z = 0$ to 0.85 at $z = 1.0$). This implies
the evolution of the UV-IR BLF is mainly due to the different evolution of the
univariate LFs, and may not be controlled by the dependence structure.

superconductors, can be maintained in d>1, only in the presence of a
sufficiently singular effective interaction among the charge carriers. This is
the case when, nearby an instability, the interaction is mediated by

cavity containing a second immiscible fluid is derived. While flow of a
single-phase fluid over a cavity is a standard case investigated in fluid
dynamics, flow over a cavity which is filled with a second immiscible fluid,
has received little attention. The flow filed inside the cavity is considered
to define a boundary condition for the outer flow which takes the form of a
Navier slip condition with locally varying slip length. The slip-length
function is determined from the related problem of lid-driven cavity flow.
Based on the Stokes equations and complex analysis it is then possible to
derive a closed analytical expression for the flow field over the cavity for
both the transversal and the longitudinal case. The result is a comparatively
simple function, which displays the dependence of the flow field on the cavity
geometry and the medium filling the cavity. The analytically computed flow
field agrees well with results obtained from a numerical solution of the
Navier-Stokes equations. The studies presented in this article are of
considerable practical relevance, for example for the flow over
superhydrophobic surfaces.

color-ordered amplitudes. Identities relating various partial amplitudes have
been known since the 80's. They are Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) identities. In 2008,
Bern, Carrasco and Johansson (BCJ) introduced a new set of identities which
reduce the number of independent partial amplitudes to (n-3)!. In recent years,
several formulations for partial amplitudes have been discovered and shown to
be equivalent to each other. These can be thought of as simple dualities in the
sense that different formulations make manifest different properties of the
same object; the amplitude. One such formulation is the ACCK Grassmannian
formulation which makes Yangian invariance of individual partial amplitudes
manifest. A different formulation is the so-called connected formula introduced
by Witten in twistor space and formulated in momentum space by Roiban, Spradlin
and Volovich. It has been argued that the connected formula is ideal for
studying properties which are related to the full amplitude, such as the KK
relations, and not to particular partial amplitudes, like Yangian invariance.
Following this logic, it is very natural to expect that the BCJ identities
should have a very simple proof in the connected formulation. In this short
note we show that this is indeed the case.

the SPIRE instrument on board the Herschel satellite. Variability has been
detected in the flux emitted by the central star with a period of 639 \pm 4
days, in good agreement with determinations in the literature. Variability is
also detected in the bow shock around CW Leo that had previously been detected
in the ultraviolet and Herschel PACS/SPIRE data. Although difficult to prove
directly, our working hypothesis is that this variability is directly related
to that of the central star. In this case, fitting a sine curve with the period
fixed to 639 days results in a time-lag in the variability between bow shock
and the central star of 402 \pm 37 days. The orientation of the bow shock
relative to the plane of the sky is unknown (but see below). For an inclination
angle of zero degrees, the observed time-lag translates into a distance to CW
Leo of 130 \pm 13 pc, and for non-zero inclination angles the distance is
smaller. Fitting the shape of the bow shock with an analytical model (Wilkin
1996), the effect of the inclination angle on the distance may be estimated.
Making the additional assumption that the relative peculiar velocity between
the interstellar medium (ISM) and CW Leo is determined entirely by the star
space velocity with respect to the local standard of rest (i.e. a stationary
ISM), the inclination angle is found to be (-33.3 \pm 0.8) degrees based on the
observed proper motion and radial velocity. Using the Wilkin model, our current
best estimate of the distance to CW Leo is 123 \pm 14 pc. For a distance of 123
pc, we derive a mean luminosity of 7790 \pm 150 Lsol (internal error).

connected critical point is the ball under mild assumptions on the boundary, in
the small energy/mass regime. In particular this class includes all
rectifiable, connected 1-manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We also classify the
simply connected critical points on the torus in this regime, showing the only
possibilities are the stripe pattern and the ball. In $\mathbb{R}^2$, this can
be seen as a partial union of the well known result of Fraenkel \cite{Fraenkel}
for uniqueness of critical points to the Newtonian Potential energy, and
Alexandrov for the perimeter functional \cite{alexandrov}, however restricted
to the plane. The proof of the result in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is analogous to the
curve shortening result due to Gage \cite{Gage2}, but involving a non-local
perimeter functional, as we show the energy of convex sets strictly decreases
along the flow. Using the same techniques we obtain a stability result for
minimizers in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and for the stripe pattern on the torus, the

such a set-up we have in mind, for example, semiconductor quantum dots coupled
to an ensemble of nuclear spins in the host material or molecular orbitals
coupled to a local magnetic moment. Using a semiclassical approximation, we
derive a set of Ehrenfest equations of motion for the electron density matrix

coupling they turn out to be nonlinear and, importantly, also coherences
between electron states with different spin directions need to be considered.
The electronic spin-polarized leads are implemented in form of a Lindblad-type
dissipator in the infinite bias limit. We have solved this involved dynamical
system numerically for various isotropic and anisotropic coupling schemes. For
isotropic spin coupling and spin-polarized leads we study the effect of
current-induced magnetization of the attached spin and compare this with a

accordingly establish an accurate lower limit on the mass of the scalar

signals from compressed sensing measurements that have undergone nonuniform

problem based on Gaussian models (bounded l2-norm) for the quantization
distortion yield results that, while often acceptable, may not be fully
consistent: re-measurement and quantization of the reconstructed signal do not
necessarily match the initial observations. Quantization distortion instead
more closely resembles heteroscedastic uniform noise, with variance depending
on the observed quantization bin. Generalizing our previous work on uniform
quantization, we show that for nonuniform quantizers described by the
""compander"" formalism, quantization distortion may be better characterized as
having bounded weighted lp-norm (p >= 2), for a particular weighting. We
develop a new reconstruction approach, termed Generalized Basis Pursuit DeNoise
(GBPDN), which minimizes the sparsity of the reconstructed signal under this
weighted lp-norm fidelity constraint. We prove that for B bits per measurement
and under the oversampled QCS scenario (when the number of measurements is
large compared to the signal sparsity) if the sensing matrix satisfies a
proposed generalized Restricted Isometry Property, then, GBPDN provides a
reconstruction error of sparse signals which decreases like
O(2^{-B}/\sqrt{p+1}): a reduction by a factor \sqrt{p+1} relative to that
produced by using the l2-norm. Besides the QCS scenario, we also show that
GBPDN applies straightforwardly to the related case of CS measurements
corrupted by heteroscedastic Generalized Gaussian noise with provable
reconstruction error reduction. Finally, we describe an efficient numerical
procedure for computing GBPDN via a primal-dual convex optimization scheme, and
demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations.

sphere. If a finite amount of heat is supplied, the stresses gradually
disappear as temperature becomes homogeneous throughout the sphere. We show
that before this happens, there is a temporary lowering of pressure and density
in the interior of the sphere, inducing a transient lowering of the temperature
here. For ordinary solids this effect is small because c_p is almost equal to
c_V. For fluent liquids the effect is negligible because their dynamic shear
modulus vanishes. For a liquid at its glass transition, however, the effect is
generally considerably larger than in solids. This paper presents analytical
solutions of the relevant coupled thermoviscoelastic equations. In general,
there is a difference between the isobaric specific heat, c_p, measured at
constant isotropic pressure and the longitudinal specific heat, c_l, pertaining
to mechanical boundary conditions that confine the associated expansion to be
longitudinal. In the exact treatment of heat propagation the heat diffusion
constant contains c_l rather than c_p. We show that the key parameter
controlling the magnitude of the ""cooling-by-heating"" effect is the relative
difference between these two specific heats. For a typical glass-forming
liquid, when temperature at the surface is increased by 1 K, a lowering of the
temperature in the sphere center of order 5 mK is expected if the experiment is
performed at the glass transition. The cooling-by-heating effect is confirmed
by measurements on a 19 mm diameter glucose sphere at the glass transition.

helioseismic data in an attempt to verify Karoff and Kjeldsen (2008) results as
well as compare the post-flare acoustic power spectrum to the pre-flare
acoustic power spectrum for 31 solar flares. Among the 31 flares analyzed, we
observe that a decrease in acoustic power after the solar flare is just as
likely as an increase. Furthermore, while we do observe variations in acoustic
power that are most likely associated with the usual p-modes associated with
solar convection, these variations do not show any significant temporal
association with flares. We find no evidence that consistently supports flare
driven high-frequency waves.

introduced in [1,2] for the graded (two-sided) ideals of $K\ < x_i\ >$ is
extended in this paper also to the nongraded case. This amounts to the
possibility of modelizing nongraded noncommutative presented algebras by means
of a class of graded commutative algebras that are invariant under the action
of the monoid $\mathbb N$ of natural numbers. For such purpose we develop the
notion of saturation for the graded ideals of $K\ < x_i,t\ >$, where $t$ is an
extra variable and for their letterplace analogues in the commutative
polynomial algebra $K[x_{ij},t_j]$, where $j$ ranges in $\mathbb N$. In
particular, one obtains an alternative algorithm for computing inhomogeneous
noncommutative Gr\""obner bases using just homogeneous commutative polynomials.
The feasibility of the proposed methods is shown by an experimental
implementation developed in the computer algebra system Maple and by using
standard routines for the Buchberger algorithm contained in Singular.

that the accreting object has zero pressure, might not hold in many galaxies
because of the pressure exerted by stellar winds of star orbiting the central
super massive black hole (SMBH). Hence, the Bondi accretion cannot be used in
these cases, such as in the galaxy NGC 3115. The winds of these high-velocity
stars are shocked to temperatures above the virial temperature of the galaxy,
leading to the formation of a hot bubble of size ~0.1-10 pc near the center.
This hot bubble can substantially reduce the mass accretion rate by the SMBH.
If the density of the hot bubble is lower than that of the interstellar medium
(ISM), a density-inversion layer is formed. As the gas loses energy by X-ray
radiation, eventually more mass of the cooling shocked stellar winds will be
accreted to the SMBH. This accretion will be of cold clumps. After a period of
millions of years of low AGN activity, therefore, a stronger AGN activity will
occur that will heat and expel gas, much as in cooling flow clusters. Adding to
other problems of the Bondi process, our results render the Bondi accretion
irrelevant for AGN feedback in cooling flow in galaxies and small groups of
galaxies and during galaxy formation.

  influences on molecular processes","Accepted for publication in Journal of Theoretical Biology",,,,"q-bio.NC physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent calculations further supports the premise that large-scale synchronous
firings of neurons may affect molecular processes. The context is scalp
electroencephalography (EEG) during short-term memory (STM) tasks. The
mechanism considered is $\mathbf{\Pi} = \mathbf{p} + q \mathbf{A}$ (SI units)
coupling, where $\mathbf{p}$ is the momenta of free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves
$q$ the charge of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in units of the electron charge, and
$\mathbf{A}$ the magnetic vector potential of current $\mathbf{I}$ from
neuronal minicolumnar firings considered as wires, giving rise to EEG. Data has
processed using multiple graphs to identify sections of data to which
spline-Laplacian transformations are applied, to fit the statistical mechanics
of neocortical interactions (SMNI) model to EEG data, sensitive to synaptic
interactions subject to modification by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves.
