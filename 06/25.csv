\pm 0.000006 days) companion to the F-type main sequence star TYC 2930-00872-1.
A long-term trend in the radial velocities indicates the presence of a tertiary
stellar companion with $P > 2000$ days. High-resolution spectroscopy of the
host star yields T_eff = 6427 +/- 33 K, log(g) = 4.52 +/- 0.14, and
[Fe/H]=-0.04 +/- 0.05. These parameters, combined with the broad-band spectral
energy distribution and parallax, allow us to infer a mass and radius of the
host star of M_1=1.21 +/- 0.08 M_\odot and R_1=1.09_{-0.13}^{+0.15} R_\odot. We
are able to exclude transits of the inner companion with high confidence. The
host star's spectrum exhibits clear Ca H and K core emission indicating stellar
activity, but a lack of photometric variability and small v*sin(I) suggest the
primary's spin axis is oriented in a pole-on configuration. The rotational
period of the primary from an activity-rotation relation matches the orbital
period of the inner companion to within 1.5 \sigma, suggesting they are tidally
locked. If the inner companion's orbital angular momentum vector is aligned
with the stellar spin axis, as expected through tidal evolution, then it has a
stellar mass of M_2 ~ 0.3-0.4 M_\odot. Direct imaging limits the existence of
stellar companions to projected separations < 30 AU. No set of spectral lines
and no significant flux contribution to the spectral energy distribution from
either companion are detected, which places individual upper mass limits of M <
1.0 M_\odot, provided they are not stellar remnants. If the tertiary is not a
stellar remnant, then it likely has a mass of ~0.5-0.6 M_\odot, and its orbit
is likely significantly inclined from that of the secondary, suggesting that
the Kozai-Lidov mechanism may have driven the dynamical evolution of this
system.

increasing attention in recent years and is now accepted as a crucial element
in the early evolution of low-mass stars. FUor and EXor eruptions of young

surrounding disk. FUors display optical outbursts of $\sim$ 4 mag or more and
last for several decades, whereas EXors show smaller outbursts ($\Delta$m
$\sim$ 2 - 3 mag) that last from a few months to a few years and may occur

phenomenon in early stellar evolution, during which a young low-mass YSO
brightens by up to several optical magnitudes. Hence, long-term observations of
this class of eruptive variable are important to design theoretical models of

decay of high-order methods, by activating a larger set of degrees of freedom

certain sparsity classes of the Gevrey type, which describe a (sub-)exponential

novel structural analysis, the topological cluster classification. We find that
at densities where the hard sphere fluid becomes metastable, the dominant

magnetic reconnection driven by an external perturbation, but the formation of
a genuine current sheet equilibrium remains poorly understood. This problem has
been considered more extensively in two-dimensions, but lacks a generalization
into 3D fields.
  Aims: 3D magnetic nulls are more complex than 2D nulls and the field can take
a greater range of magnetic geometries local to the null. Here, we focus on one
type and consider the dynamical non-resistive relaxation of 3D spiral nulls
with initial spine-aligned current. We aim to provide a valid
magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, and describe the electric current accumulations
in various cases, involving a finite plasma pressure.
  Methods: A full MHD code is used, with the resistivity set to zero so that
reconnection is not allowed, to run a series of experiments in which a
perturbed spiral 3D null point is allowed to relax towards an equilibrium, via
real, viscous damping forces. Changes to the initial plasma pressure and other
magnetic parameters are investigated systematically.
  Results: For the axi-symmetric case, the evolution of the field and the
plasma is such that it concentrates the current density in two cone-shaped
regions along the spine, thus concentrating the twist of the magnetic field
around the spine, leaving a radial configuration in the fan plane. The plasma
pressure redistributes in order to maintain the current density accumulations.
However, it is found that changes in the initial plasma pressure do not modify
the final state significantly. In the cases where the initial magnetic field is
not axi-symmetric, a infinite-time singularity of current perpendicular to the
fan is found at the location of the null.

the initial coordinate space eccentricity, $v_{2}/\varepsilon$, as a function

We endeavor, through accurate ground-based observational campaigns, to
characterize these SNe at increasingly high redshifts. We obtained a series of
optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ic SN2012bz
associated with the Swift long-duration GRB120422A (z=0.283) using the 3.6-m
TNG and the 8.2-m VLT telescopes. The peak times of the light curves of
SN2012bz in various optical filters differ, with the B-band and i'-band light
curves reaching maximum at ~9 and ~23 rest-frame days, respectively. The
bolometric light curve has been derived from individual bands photometric
measurements, but no correction for the unknown contribution in the
near-infrared (probably around 10-15%) has been applied. Therefore, the present
light curve should be considered as a lower limit to the actual UV-optical-IR
bolometric light curve. This pseudo-bolometric curve reaches its maximum (Mbol
= -18.56 +/- 0.06) at 13 +/- 1 rest-frame days; it is similar in shape and
luminosity to the bolometric light curves of the SNe associated with z<0.2 GRBs
and more luminous than those of SNe associated with XRFs. A comparison with the
model generated for the bolometric light curve of SN2003dh suggests that
SN2012bz produced only about 15% less 56Ni than SN2003dh, about 0.35 Msol.
Similarly the VLT spectra of SN2012bz, after correction for Galactic extinction
and for the contribution of the host galaxy, suggest comparable explosion
parameters with those observed in SN2003dh (EK~3.5 x 10^52 erg, Mej~7 Msol) and
a similar progenitor mass (~25-40 Msol). GRB120422A is consistent with the
Epeak-Eiso and the EX,iso-Egamma,iso-E_peak relations. GRB120422A/SN2012bz
shows the GRB-SN connection at the highest redshift so far accurately monitored
both photometrically and spectroscopically.

calculations of the trajectories of particles in a marginally gravitationally
unstable solar nebula during an FU Orionis outburst, which show that 0.1 to 10
cm-sized particles traverse radial distances of 10 AU or more, inward and
outward, in less than 200 yrs, exposing the particles to temperatures from
$\sim$ 60 K to $\sim$ 1500 K. Such trajectories can thus account for the
discovery of refractory particles in comets. Refractory particles should
acquire Wark-Lovering-like rims as they leave the highest temperature regions
of the disk, and these rims should have significant variations in their stable
oxygen isotope ratios. Particles are likely to be heavily modified or destroyed
if they pass within 1 AU of the Sun, and so are only likely to survive if they
formed in the final few FU Orionis outbursts, or were transported to the outer
reaches of the solar system. Calcium, aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) from
primitive meteorites are the oldest known solar system objects and have a very

redshifts between 0.4 and 1.4. We combine new measurements of near-ultraviolet,
low-ionization absorption lines with previously measured masses, luminosities,
colors, and star formation rates to describe the demographics and properties of
galactic flows. Among star-forming galaxies with blue colors, we find a net
blueshift of the FeII absorption greater than 200 km/s (100 km/s) towards 2.5%
(20%) of the galaxies. The fraction of blueshifted spectra does not vary
significantly with stellar mass, color, or luminosity but does decline at
specific star formation rates less than roughly 0.8 Gyr^{-1}. The insensitivity
of the blueshifted fraction to galaxy properties requires collimated outflows
at these redshifts, while the decline in outflow fraction with increasing
blueshift might reflect the angular dependence of the outflow velocity. The low
detection rate of infalling gas, 3 to 6% of the spectra, suggests an origin in
(enriched) streams favorably aligned with our sightline. We find 4 of these 9
infalling streams have projected velocities commensurate with the kinematics of
an extended disk or satellite galaxy. The strength of the MgII absorption
increases with stellar mass, B-band luminosity, and U-B color, trends arising
from a combination of more interstellar absorption at the systemic velocity and
less emission filling in more massive galaxies. Our results provides a new
quantitative understanding of gas flows between galaxies and the circumgalactic
medium over a critical period in galaxy evolution.

that similar strings are more likely to get paired off for HD computation. To

non-overlapping position specific subsequences between strings which is
inspired by an alignment-free protein sequence comparison algorithm. Tests are
performed to evaluate the quality of b-walks, i.e. slow adaptive walks

between microwave electricity and mechanical motion. Here we demonstrate that
the state of an itinerant microwave field can be coherently transferred into,
stored in, and retrieved from a mechanical oscillator with amplitudes at the
single quanta level. Crucially, the time to capture and to retrieve the
microwave state is shorter than the quantum state lifetime of the mechanical

433 Eros show a significant depletion of craters below approx. 100 m in
diameter. Possible mechanisms that were brought up to explain this lack of
craters were seismic crater erasure and self armoring of a coarse, boulder
covered asteroid surface. While seismic shaking has been studied in this
context, the concept of armoring lacks a deeper inspection and an experimental
ground truth. We therefore present cratering experiments of glass bead
projectiles impacting into granular glass bead targets, where the grain sizes
of projectile and target are in a similar range. The impact velocities are in
the range of 200 to 300 m/s. We find that craters become fainter and irregular
shaped as soon as the target grains are larger than the projectile sizes and
that granular craters rarely form when the size ratio between projectile and
target grain is around 1:10 or smaller. In that case, we observe a formation of
a strength determined crater in the first struck target grain instead. We
present a simple model based on the transfer of momentum from the projectile to
this first target grain, which is capable to explain our results with only a
single free parameter, which is moreover well determined by previous
experiments. Based on estimates of typical projectile size and boulder size on
Itokawa and Eros, given that our results are representative also for km/s
impact velocities, armoring should play an important role for their evolution.

compared with the ambient solar wind. Inside the BL, the core electron flux
increases quasi-isotropically and the increments decrease monotonously with
energy from ~30% (at 18 eV) to ~10% (at 70 eV); the suprathermal electron flux
usually increases in either parallel or antiparallel direction; the correlation
coefficient of electron flux variations in parallel and antiparallel directions
changes sharply from ~0.8 below 70 eV to ~0 above 70 eV. Similar results are
also found for RE. However, different phenomena are found across the shock
where the electron flux variations first increase and then decrease with a peak
increment (>200%) near 100 eV. The correlation coefficient of electron flux
variations in parallel and antiparallel directions is always around 0.8. The
similar behavior of flux variations in BL and RE suggests that reconnection may
commonly occur in BL. Our work also implies that the strong energy dependence

This galaxy is comprised of two orthogonal discs, one of which contains old
stars (old stellar disc), and the other, containing both younger stars and the
cold gas (polar disc) of the galaxy. By exploring the shape of the inner region
of the dark matter halo, we are able to confirm that the halo shape is a oblate
ellipsoid flattened in the direction of the polar disc. We also note that there
is a twist in the shape profile, where the innermost 3 kpc of the halo flattens
in the direction perpendicular to the old disc, and then aligns with the polar
disc out until the virial radius. This result is then compared to the halo
shape inferred from the circular velocities of the two discs. We also use the
temporal information of the simulation to track the system's evolution, and
identify the processes which give rise to this unusual galaxy type. We confirm
the proposal that the polar disc galaxy is the result of the last major merger,
where the angular moment of the interaction is orthogonal to the angle of the
infalling gas. This merger is followed by the resumption of coherent gas
infall. We emphasise that the disc is rapidly restored after the major merger
and that after this event the galaxy begins to tilt. A significant proportion
of the infalling gas comes from filaments. This infalling gas from the filament
gives the gas its angular momentum, and, in the case of the polar disc galaxy,
the direction of the gas filament does not change before or after the last

tightly packed ~250-pixel MKID arrays using lumped-element resonators etched
from a thin layer of superconducting TiNx deposited on a silicon substrate. The
high pixel packing density in our initial design resulted in large microwave
crosstalk due to electromagnetic coupling between the resonators. Our second
design eliminates this problem by adding a grounding shield and using a
double-wound geometry for the meander inductor to allow conductors with
opposite polarity to be in close proximity. In addition, the resonator
frequencies are distributed in a checkerboard pattern across the array. We
present details for the two resonator and array designs and describe a circuit
model for the full array that predicts the distribution of resonator
frequencies and the crosstalk level. We also show results from a new
experimental technique that conveniently measures crosstalk without the need
for an optical setup. Our results reveal an improvement in crosstalk from 57%
in the initial design down to \leq 2% in the second design. The general
procedure and design guidelines in this work are applicable to future large
arrays employing microwave resonators.

II and Class I/II) candidates using IRAC color-color diagrams. It is found that
Class I sources are preferentially located at the outskirts of the HII region
and associated with enhanced H2 emission; none of them are located near the
central cluster. Combining the optical to mid-infrared (MIR) photometry of the
YSO candidates and using the spectral energy distribution fitting models, we
constrained stellar parameters and the evolutionary status of 33 YSO
candidates. Most of them are interpreted by the model as low-mass (< 4 solar
masses) YSOs; however, we also detected a massive YSO (~9 solar masses) of
Class I nature, embedded in a cloud of visual extinction of ~24 mag. Present
analysis suggests that the Class I sources are indeed younger population of the
region relative to Class II sources (age ~ 4.5 x 10^6 yr). We suggest that the
majority of the Class I sources, including the massive YSOs, are
second-generation stars of the region whose formation is possibly induced by
the expansion of the HII region powered by a ~ 4 x 10^6 yr B0 main-sequence
star.

less than 10 days---likely are relics of dynamical processes that shape all
planetary system architectures. Socrates et al. (2012) argued that high
eccentricity migration (HEM) mechanisms proposed for situating these close-in
planets should produce an observable population of highly eccentric proto-hot
Jupiters that have not yet tidally circularized. HEM should also create
failed-hot Jupiters, with periapses just beyond the influence of fast
circularization. Using the technique we previously presented for measuring
eccentricities from photometry (the ""photoeccentric effect""), we are distilling
a collection of eccentric proto- and failed-hot Jupiters from the Kepler
Objects of Interest (KOI). Here we present the first, KOI-1474.01, which has a
long orbital period (69.7340 days) and a large eccentricity e =
0.81+0.10/-0.07, skirting the proto-hot Jupiter boundary. Combining Kepler
photometry, ground-based spectroscopy, and stellar evolution models, we
characterize host KOI-1474 as a rapidly-rotating F-star. Statistical arguments
reveal that the transiting candidate has a low false-positive probability of
3.1%. KOI-1474.01 also exhibits transit timing variations of order an hour. We
explore characteristics of the third-body perturber, which is possibly the
""smoking-gun"" cause of KOI-1474.01's large eccentricity. Using the host-star's
rotation period, radius, and projected rotational velocity, we find
KOI-1474.01's orbit is marginally consistent with aligned with the stellar spin
axis, although a reanalysis is warranted with future additional data. Finally,
we discuss how the number and existence of proto-hot Jupiters will not only
demonstrate that hot Jupiters migrate via HEM, but also shed light on the
typical timescale for the mechanism.

over the Internet fiber network. The stable frequency optical signal is
processed enabling uninterrupted propagation on both directions. The robustness
and the performance of the link are enhanced by a cost effective fully
automated optoelectronic station. This device is able to coherently regenerate
the return optical signal with a heterodyne optical phase locking of a low
noise laser diode. Moreover the incoming signal polarization variation are
tracked and processed in order to maintain beat note amplitudes within the
operation range. Stable fibered optical interferometer enables optical
detection of the link round trip phase signal. The phase-noise compensated link
shows a fractional frequency instability in 10 Hz bandwidth of 5x10-15 at one
second measurement time and 2x10-19 at 30 000 s. This work is a significant
step towards a sustainable wide area ultrastable optical frequency distribution

model for GRBs beyond 10^{54}erg, well outside the energy range where it has
been successfully tested up to now (10^{49}-10^{53}erg). We find that in the
low energy region, the prompt emission spectra observed by Swift BAT reveals
more power than theoretically predicted. The opportunities offered by these
observations to improve the fireshell model are outlined. One of the
distinguishing features of the fireshell model is that it relates the observed
spectra to the spectrum in the comoving frame of the fireshell. Originally, a
fully radiative condition and a comoving thermal spectrum were adopted. An
additional power-law in the comoving thermal spectrum is required [...] in the
fireshell model for GRBs 080319B and 050904. A new phenomenological parameter
\alpha is correspondingly introduced in the model. We perform numerical
simulations of the prompt emission in the Swift BAT bandpass by assuming
different values of \alpha [...]. We compare them with the GRB080319B and
GRB050904 observed time-resolved spectra, as well as with their time-integrated
spectra and light curves. Although GRB080319B and GRB050904 are at very
different redshifts (z=0.937 and z=6.29 respectively), a value of \alpha=-1.8
leads for both of them to a good agreement between the numerical simulations
and the observed BAT light curves, time-resolved and time-integrated spectra.
Such a modified spectrum is also consistent with the observations of previously
analyzed less energetic GRBs and reasons for this additional agreement are
given. Perspectives for future low energy missions are outlined.

to the edges of the strip. Depending on the boundary conditions, the imaginary
modes emerge below or above the bulk critical temperature, or below the wetting
temperature of a single surface with surface magnetic field. The bound states
are responsible for the strong asymmetry of the Casimir forces between the
super- and sub-critical regimes and for their sign. Our analysis uses the fact
that the Casimir forces have two mathematical forms. We show that these very
different representation are the same and in the process find the origin of the
asymmetry.

this paper in order to maximize the SU's throughput, the SU's transceivers
beamforming is designed through new model considering the presence of the PU's

system performance; proposed beamforming design considers intra-system
interference between PUs and SUs. An optimization problem based on maximizing
CR network throughput subject to controlling interference power from SU
transmitter to PU receiver has been formulated. Due to limited cooperation
between PU and SU network, channel state information (CSI) between two networks
are assumed to be partially available, subsequently conventional CSI
uncertainty model known as norm bounded error model has been employed. The
proposed optimization problem, which is basically difficult to solve, has been
converted to a semi definite program which can be efficiently solved by
optimization toolbox software e.g., CVX-Mathlab. Furthermore, alternative time
efficient and close form solutions are derived. The superiority of the proposed
approach in comparison with the previous works has been confirmed through the

be mainly intrinsic; though superparamagnetic Mn nanoparticles also has a minor

time-resolved dependence of the intrinsic peak energy $E_{p,i}$ of the $E F(E)$
spectrum on the corresponding isotropic bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm iso}$.
The $E_{p,i}$--$L_{\rm iso}$ relation or the equivalent relation between
$E_{p,i}$ and the bolometric released energy $E_{iso}$, derived using the time
averaged spectra of long GRBs with known redshift, is well established, but its
physical origin is still a subject of discussion. In addition, some authors
maintain that these relations are the result of instrumental selection effects.
We find that not only a relation between the measured peak energy $E_p$ and the
corresponding energy flux, but also a strong $E_{p,i}$ versus $L_{\rm iso}$
correlation are found within each burst and merging together the time resolved
data points from different GRBs. We do not expect significant instrumental
selection effects that can affect the obtained results, apart from the fact
that the GRBs in our sample are sufficiently bright to perform a time-resolved
spectroscopy and that they have known redshift. If the fundamental physical
process that gives rise to the GRB phenomenon does not depend on its
brightness, we conclude that the found $E_{p,i}$ versus $L_{\rm iso}$
correlation within each GRB is intrinsic to the emission process, and that the
correlations discovered by Amati et al. and Yonetoku et al. are likely not the
result of selection effects. We also discuss the properties of the correlations
found.

Large Area Telescope (LAT), population synthesis has become a powerful tool for
comparing their collective properties with model predictions. We synthesised a
pulsar population based on a radio emission model and four gamma-ray gap models
(Polar Cap, Slot Gap, Outer Gap, and One Pole Caustic) normalizing to the
number of detected radio pulsars in select group of surveys. The luminosity and
the wide beams from the outer gaps can easily account for the number of Fermi
detections in 2 years of observations. The wide slot-gap beams requires an
increase by a factor of ~10 of the predicted luminosity to produce a reasonable
number of gamma-ray pulsars. Such large increases in the luminosity may be
accommodated by implementing offset polar caps. The narrow polar-cap beams
contribute at most only a handful of LAT pulsars. Standard distributions in
birth location and pulsar spin-down power (Edot) fail to reproduce the LAT
findings: all models under-predict the number of LAT pulsars with high Edot,
and they cannot explain the high probability of detecting both the radio and
gamma-ray beams at high Edot. The beaming factor remains close to 1 over 4
decades in Edot evolution for the slot gap whereas it significantly decreases
with increasing age for the outer gaps. The evolution of the slot-gap
luminosity with Edot is compatible with the large dispersion of gamma-ray
luminosity seen in the LAT data. The stronger evolution predicted for the outer
gap, which is linked to the polar cap heating by the return current, is
apparently not supported by the LAT data. The LAT sample of gamma-ray pulsars
therefore provides a fresh perspective on the early evolution of the luminosity
and beam width of the gamma-ray emission from young pulsars, calling for thin
and more luminous gaps.

the nonequilibrium distribution of atoms of oxygen, originating at the

the complex magnetic susceptibility of YBa2 Cu3O7-{\delta} thin films on the

The increase of pinning forces results in the increase of critical current

proposed by statisticians four decades ago as a way to maximize overlap in
repeated surveys. Coordinated sampling had been since used for summarizing
massive data sets.
  The usefulness of a sampling scheme hinges on the scope and accuracy within
which queries posed over the original data can be answered from the sample. We
aim here to gain a fundamental understanding of the limits and potential of
coordination. Our main result is a precise characterization, in terms of simple
properties of the estimated function, of queries for which estimators with
desirable properties exist. We consider unbiasedness, nonnegativity, finite
variance, and bounded estimates.
  Since generally a single estimator can not be optimal (minimize variance
simultaneously) for all data, we propose {\em variance competitiveness}, which
means that the expectation of the square on any data is not too far from the
minimum one possible for the data. Surprisingly perhaps, we show how to
construct, for any function for which an unbiased nonnegative estimator exists,
a variance competitive estimator.

metric, seconds per Bell pair of a particular fidelity, where a single Bell
pair is the resource consumed to perform one quantum teleportation. Simulations
that include both the physical interactions and the extensive classical
messaging confirm that Dijkstra's algorithm works well in a quantum context.
Simulating about three hundred heterogeneous paths, comparing our path cost and
the total work along the path gives a coefficient of determination of 0.88 or
better.

axisymmetric motion of string loops with energy high enough, when the string
loop can overcome the gravitational attraction and escape to infinity. We
demonstrate that string loops can be scattered near the black hole horizon, and
the energy of string oscillations can be efficiently converted to the energy of
their linear motion. Such a transmutation effect can potentially represent
acceleration of jets in active galactic nuclei and microquasars. We give the
conditions limiting energy available for conversion onto the jetlike motion.
Surprisingly, we are able to show that string loops starting from rest can be
accelerated up to velocities v\simc even in the field of Schwarzschild black
holes, if their angular momentum parameter is low enough. Such loops could
serve as an explanation of highly relativistic jets observed in some quasars

so-called static radius where it accelerates the linear motion of the string

calculation is carried out within the framework of the Rouse-Zimm approach to
chain dynamics, using a variant of a nonlinear elastic model to enforce finite
extensibility. Under the assumption that the sole effect of the confining
surface is to modify the pre-averaged hydrodynamic interaction, we find that
the calculated fractional chain extension x is considerably smaller than its
value in the bulk. Furthermore, the variation of x with a dimensionless shear
rate (the Weissenberg number, Wi) is in good qualitative agreement with data
from experiments on the flow-induced stretching of lambda- phage DNA near a

objective of this work is to deduce a solar corona model from the spacecraft
navigation data acquired at the time of solar conjunctions and to estimate its
average electron density. The corrected or improved data are then used to fit
the dynamical modeling of the planet motions, called planetary ephemerides. We
analyzed the radio science raw data of the MGS spacecraft using the orbit
determination software GINS. The range bias, obtained from GINS and provided by
ESA for MEX and VEX, are then used to derive the electron density profile.
These profiles are obtained for different intervals of solar distances: from
12Rs to 215Rs for MGS, 6Rs to 152Rs for MEX, and form 12Rs to 154Rs for VEX.
They are acquired for each spacecraft individually, for ingress and egress
phases separately and both phases together, for different types of solar winds
(fast, slow), and for solar activity phases (minimum, maximum). We compared our
results with the previous estimations that were based on in situ measurements,
and on solar type III radio and radio science studies made at different phases
of solar activity and at different solar wind states. Our results are
consistent with estimations obtained by these different methods. Moreover,
fitting the planetary ephemerides including complementary data that were
corrected for the solar corona perturbations, noticeably improves the
extrapolation capability of the planetary ephemerides and the estimation of the

that the crossing number $\crg (K_{n})$ of $K_n$ is exactly Z(n). This is also
known as Guy's conjecture as he later popularized it. Towards the end of the
century, substantially different drawings of $K_{n}$ with Z(n) crossings were
found. These drawings are \emph{2-page book drawings}, that is, drawings where
all the vertices are on a line $\ell$ (the spine) and each edge is fully
contained in one of the two half-planes (pages) defined by $\ell$. The
\emph{2-page crossing number} of $K_{n} $, denoted by $\nu_{2}(K_{n})$, is the
minimum number of crossings determined by a 2-page book drawing of $K_{n}% $.
Since $\crg(K_{n}) \le\nu_{2}(K_{n})$ and $\nu_{2}(K_{n}) \le Z(n)$, a natural
step towards Hill's Conjecture is the %(formally) weaker conjecture
$\nu_{2}(K_{n}) = Z(n)$, popularized by Vrt'o. %As far as we know, this natural
%conjecture was first raised by Imrich Vrt'o in 2007. %Prior to this paper,
results known for $\nu_2(K_n)$ were basically %the same as for $\crg (K_n)$.
Here In this paper we develop a novel and innovative technique to investigate
crossings in drawings of $K_{n}$, and use it to prove that $\nu_{2}(K_{n}) =
Z(n) $. To this end, we extend the inherent geometric definition of $k$-edges
for finite sets of points in the plane to topological drawings of $K_{n}$. We
also introduce the concept of ${\leq}{\leq}k$-edges as a useful generalization
of ${\leq}k$-edges and extend a powerful theorem that expresses the number of
crossings in a rectilinear drawing of $K_{n}$ in terms of its number of $(\le
k)$-edges to the topological setting.

the interval $[0,1)$ into $n$ intervals $I_1$,..., $I_n$ such that for every
$i\in{1,...,n}$, the restriction $f|_{I_i}$ is $\kappa$-Lipschitz for some

can be investigated in detail with radio, optical and X-ray observations. SNR
J0453-6829 is an X-ray and radio-bright remnant in the LMC, within which
previous studies revealed the presence of a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), making it
one of the most interesting SNRs in the Local Group of galaxies. We study the
emission of SNR J0453-6829 to improve our understanding of its morphology,
spectrum, and thus the emission mechanisms in the shell and the PWN of the
remnant. We obtained new radio data with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
and analysed archival XMM-Newton observations of SNR J0453-6829. We studied the
morphology of SNR J0453-6829 from radio, optical and X-ray images and
investigated the energy spectra in the different parts of the remnant. Our
radio results confirm that this LMC SNR hosts a typical PWN. The prominent
central core of the PWN exhibits a radio spectral index alpha_Core of
-0.04+/-0.04, while in the rest of the SNR shell the spectral slope is somewhat
steeper with alpha_Shell = -0.43+/-0.01. We detect regions with a mean
polarisation of P ~ (12+/-4)% at 6 cm and (9+/-2)% at 3 cm. The full remnant is
of roughly circular shape with dimensions of (31+/-1) pc x (29+/-1) pc. The
spectral analysis of the XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS spectra allowed us to derive
physical parameters for the SNR. Somewhat depending on the spectral model, we
obtain for the remnant a shock temperature of around 0.2 keV and estimate the
dynamical age to 12000-15000 years. Using a Sedov model we further derive an
electron density in the X-ray emitting material of 1.56 cm^-3, typical for LMC
remnants, a large swept-up mass of 830 solar masses, and an explosion energy of
7.6 x 10^50 erg. These parameters indicate a well evolved SNR with an X-ray
spectrum dominated by emission from the swept-up material.

nucleation of a vortex under the nanocontact, assuming a thermally-activated
process, is consistent with a local temperature increase between 150 K and 220
K. Simulations of heat generation and diffusion for the actual tridimensional
geometry were conducted. They indicate a temperature-independent efficiency of
the heat sinking from the electrodes, combined with a localized heating source
arising from a nanocontact resistance that is also essentially
temperature-independent. For practical currents, we conclude that the local
increase of temperature is typically 160 K and it extends 450 nm about the
nanocontact. Our findings imply that taking into account the current-induced
heating at the nanoscale is essential for the understanding of magnetization
dynamics in nanocontact systems.

Azimuthal amplitudes of the beam-helicity asymmetry are extracted from a data

particles in the final state including the recoiling proton. The installation
of a recoil detector, while reducing the acceptance of the experiment, allows
the elimination of background from $ep\rightarrow eN\pi\gamma$ events, which
was estimated to contribute an average of about 12% to the signal in previous

investigated within a previously developed electrostatic self-consistent (SC)
theory (R.R. Netz and H. Orland, Eur. Phys.J. E 11, 301 (2003)). To this aim,
we introduce two computational approaches that allow to solve the SC equations
beyond the loop expansion. Both approaches can handle the case of
dielectrically discontinuous boundaries where the one-loop theory is known to
fail. By comparing the theoretical results obtained from these schemes with the
results of the MC simulations that we ran for ions at neutral single dielectric
interfaces as well as with previous MC data for charged interfaces, we first
show that the weak coupling (WC) Debye-Huckel (DH) theory remains
quantitatively accurate up to the bulk ion density rhob=0.01 M, whereas the SC
theory exhibits a good quantitative accuracy up to rhob=0.2 M. Then, we derive
from the perturbative SC scheme the one-loop theory of asymmetrically
partitioned salt systems around a dielectrically homogeneous charged surface.
It is shown that correlation effects originate in these systems from a
competition between the salt screening loss at the interface driving the ions
to the bulk region, and the interfacial counterion screening excess attracting
them towards the surface. In the case of weak surface charges, the interfacial
salt screening loss is the dominant effect. As a result, correlations decrease
the MF density of both coions and counterions. With increasing surface charge,
the surface-attractive counterion screening excess starts to dominate, and
correlation effects amplify in this regime the MF density of both type of ions.
We also show that at a characteristic value of the electrostatic coupling
parameter, electrostatic correlations result in a charge inversion effect.

In this paper, we show that an optimized variant of Ohlebusch's unraveling for
a deterministic CTRS is sound w.r.t. reduction if the corresponding unraveled
TRS is left-linear or both right-linear and non-erasing. We also show that
soundness of the variant implies that of Ohlebusch's unraveling. Finally, we
show that soundness of Ohlebusch's unraveling is the weakest in soundness of
the other unravelings and a transformation, proposed by Serbanuta and Rosu, for
(normal) deterministic CTRSs, i.e., soundness of them respectively implies that
of Ohlebusch's unraveling.

the lineshape of such phonons reflects the inhomogeneous nature of the vortex

lineshapes can be well described by a model considering the phonon as a local

difficult to build due to the wide range of different approaches people can

arise from both the unpredictability of client's behaviours and from noise in
sensor readings. Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) models
have been used successfully as the reasoning engine behind such assistive
systems for small multi-step tasks such as hand washing. POMDP models are a
powerful, yet flexible framework for modelling assistance that can deal with
uncertainty and utility. Unfortunately, POMDPs usually require a very labour
intensive, manual procedure for their definition and construction. Our previous
work has described a knowledge driven method for automatically generating POMDP
activity recognition and context sensitive prompting systems for complex tasks.
We call the resulting POMDP a SNAP (SyNdetic Assistance Process). The
spreadsheet-like result of the analysis does not correspond to the POMDP model
directly and the translation to a formal POMDP representation is required. To
date, this translation had to be performed manually by a trained POMDP expert.
In this paper, we formalise and automate this translation process using a
probabilistic relational model (PRM) encoded in a relational database. We
demonstrate the method by eliciting three assistance tasks from non-experts. We
validate the resulting POMDP models using case-based simulations to show that
they are reasonable for the domains. We also show a complete case study of a
designer specifying one database, including an evaluation in a real-life

deceleration of the forward shock wave driven by the gamma-ray burst ejecta

interstellar turbulence on shock wave propagation. It is shown that the shock
wave decelerates more quickly than previously assumed without the turbulence.
As an observational consequence, an earlier jet break will appear in the light
curve of the forward shock wave. The scatter of the jet-corrected energy
release for gamma-ray burst, inferred from the jet-break, may be partly due to
the physical uncertainties in the turbulence/shock wave interaction. This
uncertainties also exist in two shell collisions in the well-known internal
shock model proposed for gamma-ray burst prompt emission. The large scatters of

gamma-ray burst is not a good standard candle. We also discuss the other

an excellent opportunity to undertake an unbiased survey of a large, nearby,
molecular cloud complex for molecular outflow activity. Our study provides
information on the extent, energetics and frequency of outflows in this region,
which are then used to assess the impact of outflows on the parent molecular
cloud. The search identified 20 outflows in the Taurus region, 8 of which were
previously unknown. Both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO data cubes from the Taurus
molecular map were used, and dynamical properties of the outflows are derived.
Even for previously known outflows, our large-scale maps indicate that many of
the outflows are much larger than previously suspected, with eight of the flows
(40%) being more than a parsec long. The mass, momentum and kinetic energy from
the 20 outflows are compared to the repository of turbulent energy in Taurus.
Comparing the energy deposition rate from outflows to the dissipation rate of
turbulence, we conclude that outflows by themselves cannot sustain the observed
turbulence seen in the entire cloud. However, when the impact of outflows is
studied in selected regions of Taurus, it is seen that locally, outflows can
provide a significant source of turbulence and feedback. Five of the eight
newly discovered outflows have no known associated stellar source, indicating
that they may be embedded Class 0 sources. In Taurus, 30% of Class I sources
and 12% of Flat spectrum sources from the Spitzer YSO catalogue have outflows,
while 75% of known Class 0 objects have outflows. Overall, the paucity of
outflows in Taurus compared to the embedded population of Class I and Flat
Spectrum YSOs indicate that molecular outflows are a short-lived stage marking
the youngest phase of protostellar life.

diagram and not unique for some classes of knots, is replaced by a system of
eight prototiles (knot mosaics) which, once assembled according to a set of
combinatorial rules, reproduces unambiguously any unoriented knot diagram. A
Reed-Muller scheme is used to encode with redundancy the eight prototiles into
blocks and, once the blank tile is added and suitably encoded, the knot diagram
is turned into an N X N mosaic, uniquely associated with a string of length 4
N^2 bits. The complexity of the knot, measured topologically by the number of
crossings, is in turn polynomially related to the number of tiles of the
associated mosaic, and for knot diagrams of higher complexity the mosaic
encoding provides a design of the knot-based protocol which is fault-tolerant
under random 1-bit flips. It is also argued that the knot mosaic alphabet might
be used in other applications which require high-capacity data transmission.

length decay as a power law distribution with distance. Indications that such
systems can be characterized by the concept of dimension were found recently.
Here, we present further support for this claim, based on extensive numerical
simulations for model networks embedded on lattices of dimensions $d_e=1$ and
$d_e=2$.
  We evaluate the dimension $d$ from the power law scaling of (a) the mass of
the network with the Euclidean radius $r$ and (b) the probability of return to
the origin with the distance $r$ travelled by the random walker. Both
approaches yield the same dimension. For networks with $\delta < d_e$, $d$ is
infinity, while for $\delta > 2d_e$, $d$ obtains the value of the embedding
dimension $d_e$. In the intermediate regime of interest $d_e \leq \delta < 2
d_e$, our numerical results suggest that $d$ decreases continously from $d =
\infty$ to $d_e$, with $d - d_e \sim (\delta - d_e)^{-1}$ for $\delta$ close to
$d_e$. Finally, we discuss the scaling of the mass $M$ and the Euclidean
distance $r$ with the topological distance $\ell$. Our results suggest that in
the intermediate regime $d_e \leq \delta < 2 d_e$, $M(\ell)$ and $r(\ell)$ do
not increase with $\ell$ as a power law but with a stretched exponential,
$M(\ell) \sim \exp [A \ell^{\delta' (2 - \delta')}]$ and $r(\ell) \sim \exp [B
\ell^{\delta' (2 - \delta')}]$, where $\delta' = \delta/d_e$. The parameters
$A$ and $B$ are related to $d$ by $d = A/B$, such that $M(\ell) \sim
r(\ell)^d$. For $\delta < d_e$, $M$ increases exponentially with $\ell$, as
known for $\delta=0$, while $r$ is constant and independent of $\ell$. For
$\delta \geq 2d_e$, we find power law scaling, $M(\ell) \sim \ell^{d_\ell}$ and
$r(\ell) \sim \ell^{1/d_{min}}$, with $d_\ell \cdot d_{min} = d$.

they can not heat up the electrons significantly before they are trapped by the
faster beam-aligned modes. Two circular electron velocity distributions
develop, which are centred around the velocity of each ion beam. They develop
due to the scattering of the electrons by the electrostatic wave potentials.

particles (that is: the material point, the test-particle and the diluted
particle (droplet model)) can be identified as limit-cases of a quantum regime
in which pairs of particles interact without getting entangled with each other.
This entanglement-free regime also provides a simplified model of what is
called in the decoherence approach ""islands of classicality"", that is,
preferred bases that would be selected through evolution by a Darwinist
mechanism that aims at optimising information. We show how, under very general
conditions, coherent states are natural candidates for classical pointer
states. This occurs essentially because, when a (supposedly bosonic) system
coherently exchanges only one quantum at a time with the (supposedly bosonic)
environment, coherent states of the system do not get entangled with the
environment, due to the bosonic symmetry.

CIP image are introduced that substantially improve the quality of the
visualisation. One improvement is interpolating of the greyscale images in time

the hue of the color is cycled through more than once in an image. The hue
cycling allows the variation of the hue to be concentrated in structures of

time and before zero time can be indicated by greyscale. If there is an end
time point hue cycling can be applied before the end time and pixels can be set
to black after the end time. An angiogram of a brain is used to demonstrate the
substantial improvements hue cycling brings to CIP images. A third improvement

interpretation of the complex conjugate quantities such as the conjugate wave

exponential association function. Analysing this model, the plateau value was
found to be 2.810. Moreover, the half-life value was computed as 433.1s from
the model. The maximum flare rise time was found to be 1164s, while the maximum
flare total duration was found to be 3472s. The results of the flare timescales
indicate that the geometry of the flaring loop on the surface of the star might
be similar to those seen on analogues of DO Cep. Consequently, considering both
the half-life value and flare timescales, the flares detected on the surface of
DO Cep get maximum energy in longer times, while the geometries of the flaring
loops or areas get smaller.

and evolution. Observational and experimental situations in cosmology do not
allow us to proceed purely based on the empirical means. We examine in which
sense our cosmological assumptions in fact have shaped our current cosmological
worldview with consequent inevitable limits. Cosmology, as other branches of
science and knowledge, is a construct of human imagination reflecting the
popular belief system of the era. The question at issue deserves further
philosophic discussions. In Whitehead's words, ""philosophy, in one of its
functions, is the critic of cosmologies"". (Whitehead 1925)

(LAB) isolated from home-made fermented vegetables against common food borne
pathogens. The antagonistic properties of these isolates against Escherichia
coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica and Bacillus cereus were
examined using agar well diffusion method. Four LAB namely MF6, MF10, MF13, and
MF15 identified as Lactobacillus animalis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus,
Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus reuteri, respectively were effective
against all selected pathogenic strains. Amongst the four isolates, MF6
exhibited the highest antibacterial activity, against all the indicator
pathogens tested except Y. enterocolitic. Its activity was maximum against
E.coli with a Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 18.7 to 21.3 mm and least
for Y. enterocolitica (10 \pm 1.1 mm). Isolate MF13 also showed antimicrobial
property against all tested pathogens showing highest activity against Y.

was in direct contrast to isolate MF6. Isolate MF15 showed greater activity
against E.coli (12 \pm 0.8 mm) and least against S. aureus (8 \pm 1.7 mm).
Least antimicrobial property was observed in isolate MF10, with a ZOI in the
range of 2.5-7 mm. The degree of antimicrobial property among the isolates was
in the order of MF6>MF13>MF15>MF10. Overall, the isolated LAB showed the
remarkable inhibitory effect against both Gram positive and Gram negative
pathogenic strains. However, the spectrum of inhibition was different for the
isolates tested. These results suggest that this potent isolates could be used
as a natural biopreservatives in different food products.

  Semiclassical transition to the classical thermodynamics","18 pages, Latex, new results added",,,,"cond-mat.quant-gas","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The number-theoretical problem of partition of an integer corresponds to
$D=2$. This problem obeys the Bose--Eeinstein statistics, where repeated terms
are admissible in the partition, and to the Fermi--Dirac statistics, where they
are inadmissible. The Hougen--Watson P,Z-diagram shows that this problem splits
into two cases: the positive pressure domain corresponds to the Fermi system,
and the negative, to the Bose system. This analogy can be applied to the van
der Waals thermodynamics.
  The thermodynamic approach is related to four potentials corresponding to the
energy, free energy, thermodynamic Gibbs potential, enthalpy. The important
notion of de Broglie's wavelength permits passing from particle to wave packet,
in particular, to Bose and Fermi distributions.
  Particles of ideal Bose and Fermi gases and the decay of a boson consisting
of two fermions into separate fermions are studied. The case of finitely many
particles $N$ of the order of $10^2$ is considered by heuristic considerations
like those Fock used to derive the Hartree--Fock equation. The case of $N\ll1$
is studied by Gentile statistics, tropical geometry and nonstandard analysis
(Leibnitz differential or monad). A relation for the energy of neutron
separation from the atomic nucleus is obtained when the atomic nucleus volume
and de Broglie's wavelength are known. The Appendix is author's paper written
in 1995.

particle systems composed of few components. Therefore, the mixing of isolated
particle systems S=S1+S2 has been studied. Two cases are considered T1=T2 and
T1\leqT2, where T1,T2 are the initial temperatures of the system S1 and S2
respectively. The concept of similar systems containing interacting particles
is introduced. These systems are defined by a common temperature and an
identical time evolution process, i.e. the approach to the same thermodynamic
equilibrium. The main results are: 1) The properties of the similar particle
systems yield the non-additive entropy and free energy. The Gibbs Paradox is
not a paradox. 2) The relation between the initial temperatures T1 and T2
governs the mixing process. 3) In the two cases T1=T2, T1\leqT2 mixing of the
systems S1, S2 results in a uniform union system S=S1+S2. The systems S, S1, S2
are similar one to the other. 4) The mixing process is independent of the
extensive quantities (volume, particle number, energy) and of the particle
type. Only the mean energy plays an important role in the mixing of the systems
S1, S2. 5) Mixing in the case T1\leqT2 is in essence a thermalization process,
but mixing in the case T1=T2 is not a thermodynamic process. 6)Mixing is an
irreversible process. Keywords: Entropy; Similar systems of interacting
particles; Mixing of systems; Thermal equilibrium
