each electron occupies a Rydberg state of an H atom. We show that two-electron

compute the screened nuclear charge that drives the explosion of the nuclei

picture unveils several locally stable solutions exchange stabilities, through
the presence of first and second order phase transitions. We also detect the
presence of metastable states. In the second part, we focus on mixed states.

We review the recent developments in the theory of multiple M2-branes and
3-algebras leading to multiple D2-brane theories. The inclusion of flux terms
for the supersymmetric BLG and ABJM theories of closed M2-branes is discussed
and then generalised to open M2-branes. Here the boundary condition is derived
and different BPS configurations are examined where we find a mass deformed
Basu-Harvey equation for the M2-M5 system. The Lorentzian 3-algebra is then
employed for obtaining a theory of D2-branes in a flux background, we then
obtain the new fuzzy funnel solution of the system of D2-D4 branes in a flux.
Matrix theories and their compactifications as well as noncommutative geometry
and noncommutative gauge theories are reviewed with a discussion of their
generalisations to three dimensions to be used to describe the M-theory three
form potential $C_3$. A new feature of string theory is then obtained called
the quantum Nambu geometry (QNG). It is found by considering the action for
D1-strings in a RR flux background and we demonstrate that there is a large
flux double scaling limit where the action is dominated by a Chern-Simons-Myers
coupling term. A classical solution to this is the quantised spacetime known as
the quantum Nambu geometry. Various matrix models are obtained from this
action, these are the large flux dominated terms of the full actions for the
corresponding matrix models. The QNG gives rise to an expansion of D1-strings
to D4-branes in the IIA theory, so we obtain an action for the large flux terms
for this action which is verified by a dimensional reduction of the PST action
describing M5-branes. We make a generalisation of the D4-brane action to
describe M5-branes using a duality. We are describing the 3-form self-dual
field strength of a non-abelian generalisation of the PST action.

approach incorporating methods that greatly improve the accuracy compared with
previous approaches in this context. Several applications are presented serving
as test problems for both a static medium and an expanding medium, including
inhomogeneities in the density and velocity fields. Solutions are obtained in
the coherent scattering limit and for Doppler RII redistribution with and
without recoils. We find generally that the radiation intensity is linear in
the cosine of the azimuthal angle with respect to radius to high accuracy over
a broad frequency region across the line centre for both linear and perturbed
velocity fields, yielding the Eddington factors f(nu) = 1/3 and g(nu) = 3/5. We
show the radiation field produced by a point source divides into three spatial
regimes for a uniformly expanding homogeneous medium: at radii r small compared
with a characteristic radius r*, the mean intensity near line centre varies as
1/ r^(7/3), while at r > r* it approaches 1/ r^2; for r << r* it is modified by
frequency redistribution. Before the reionization epoch, r* takes on the
universal value 1.1 Mpc, independent of redshift. The mean intensity and
scattering rate are found to be very sensitive to the gradient of the velocity
field, growing exponentially with the amplitude of the perturbation as the
limit of a vanishing velocity gradient is approached near the source. We expect
the 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization to thus be a sensitive probe of
both the density and the peculiar velocity fields.

caused by the decrease of the magnitude of the polarization in the

  Diversity Data",,"Genetics 191:593-605, 2012",,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic
diversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly
carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise
early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the
interplay between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking
results in a characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype
variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection
coefficient of the sweep. Based on this result, we develop an estimator for the
selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the novel
variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on
preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.
Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the
size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator
requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth in order
to capture low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms
standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the
accuracy of our estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over
time as a consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of
recombination, soft sweeps, and demography. As an example for its use, we apply
our estimator to deep sequencing data from HIV populations.

We wish to establish which of various models of the prompt emission are
compatible with this interpretation. We successively consider internal shocks,
photospheric emission, and magnetic reconnection and obtain the typical decay
timescale at the end of the prompt phase in each case. Only internal shocks
naturally predict a decay timescale comparable to the burst duration, as
required to explain XRT observations in terms of high latitude emission. The
decay timescale of the high latitude emission is much too short in photospheric

behavior of the central engine. Reconnection models require some ad hoc
assumptions to agree with the data, which will have to be validated when a
better description of the reconnection process becomes available.

which lead to the loss of all mutation free individuals, a process known as
Muller's ratchet. Even though Muller's ratchet is a paradigmatic process in
population genetics, a quantitative understanding of its rate is still lacking.
The difficulty lies in the nontrivial nature of fluctuations in the fitness
distribution which control the rate of extinction of the fittest genotype. We
address this problem using the simple but classic model of mutation selection
balance with deleterious mutations all having the same effect on fitness. We
show analytically how fluctuations among the fittest individuals propagate to
individuals of lower fitness and have a dramatically amplified effects on the
bulk of the population at a later time. If a reduction in the size of the
fittest class reduces the mean fitness only after a delay, selection opposing
this reduction is also delayed. This delayed restoring force speeds up Muller's
ratchet. We show how the delayed response can be accounted for using a path
integral formulation of the stochastic dynamics and provide an expression for
the rate of the ratchet that is accurate across a broad range of parameters.

of an initial thermal equilibrium state of the theory under variations of the
bosonic or fermionic mass, to leading order in m/T<<1. When the masses are made
to vary in time, novel new counterterms must be introduced to renormalize the
boundary theory. We consider transitions the conformal super-Yang-Mills theory
to the mass deformed gauge theory and also the reverse transitions. By
construction, these transitions are controlled by a characteristic time scale
\calt and we show how the response of the system depends on the ratio of this
time scale to the thermal time scale 1/T. The response shows interesting
scaling behaviour both in the limit of fast quenches with T\calt<<1 and slow
quenches with T\calt>>1. In the limit that T\calt\to\infty, we observe the
expected adiabatic response. For fast quenches, the relaxation to the final
equilibrium is controlled by the lowest quasinormal mode of the bulk scalar
dual to the quenched operator. For slow quenches, the system relaxes with a
(nearly) adiabatic response that is governed entirely by the late time profile
of the mass. We describe new renormalization scheme ambiguities in defining

financial variables such as FX rates, stock prices, etc. Considerable efforts
have been devoted to pricing derivatives written on underliers governed by such
processes, and the corresponding implied volatility surfaces have been analyzed
in some detail. In the non-asymptotic regimes, option prices are described by
the Lewis-Lipton formula which allows one to represent them as Fourier
integrals; the prices can be trivially expressed in terms of their implied
volatility. Recently, attempts at calculating the asymptotic limits of the
implied volatility have yielded several expressions for the short-time,
long-time, and wing asymptotics. In order to study the volatility surface in
required detail, in this paper we use the FX conventions and describe the
implied volatility as a function of the Black-Scholes delta. Surprisingly, this
convention is closely related to the resolution of singularities frequently
used in algebraic geometry. In this framework, we survey the literature,
reformulate some known facts regarding the asymptotic behavior of the implied
volatility, and present several new results. We emphasize the role of
fractional differentiation in studying the tempered stable exponential Levy
processes and derive novel numerical methods based on judicial
finite-difference approximations for fractional derivatives. We also briefly
demonstrate how to extend our results in order to study important cases of
local and stochastic volatility models, whose close relation to the L\'evy
process based models is particularly clear when the Lewis-Lipton formula is
used. Our main conclusion is that studying asymptotic properties of the implied
volatility, while theoretically exciting, is not always practically useful
because the domain of validity of many asymptotic expressions is small.

kinematically linked to the observed red/blue shifts of the corresponding
galactic rotation curves under a minimal set of assumptions: the emitted
photons come from stable timelike circular geodesic orbits of stars in a static
spherically symmetric gravitational field, and propagate to us along null
geodesics. It is remarkable that this relation can be established without
appealing at all to a concrete theory of gravitational interaction. Here we
generalize this kinematical spherically symmetric approach to the galactic
rotation curves problem to the stationary axisymmetric realm since this is
precisely the symmetry that spiral galaxies possess. Thus, by making use of the
most general stationary axisymmetric metric, we also consider stable circular
orbits of stars that emit signals which travel to a distant observer along null
geodesics and express the galactic red/blue shifts in terms of three arbitrary
metric functions, clarifying the contribution of the rotation as well as the
dragging of the gravitational field. This stationary axisymmetric approach
distinguishes between red and blue shifts emitted by circularly orbiting
receding and approaching stars, respectively, even when they are considered
with respect to the center of a spiral galaxy, indicating the need of precise
measurements in order to confront predictions with observations. We also point
out the difficulties one encounters in the attempt of determining the metric

controlling the interference between the light scattered by the antenna modes;

of its strong radiation-hardness causal to its large band gap and strong

point profit from tiny leakage currents and small pixel capacitances of diamond
resulting in low noise figures when compared to silicon. On the other hand, the
charge signal from traversing high energy particles is smaller in diamond than
in silicon by a factor of about 2.2. Therefore, a quantitative determination of
the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of diamond in comparison with silicon at
fluences in excess of 10$^{15}$ n$_{eq}$ cm$^{-2}$, which are expected for the
LHC upgrade, is important. Based on measurements of irradiated diamond sensors
and the FE-I4 pixel readout chip design, we determine the signal and the noise
of diamond pixel detectors irradiated with high particle fluences. To
characterize the effect of the radiation damage on the materials and the signal
decrease, the change of the mean free path $\lambda_{e/h}$ of the charge
carriers is determined as a function of irradiation fluence. We make use of the
FE-I4 pixel chip developed for ATLAS upgrades to realistically estimate the
expected noise figures: the expected leakage current at a given fluence is
taken from calibrated calculations and the pixel capacitance is measured using
a purposely developed chip (PixCap). We compare the resulting S/N figures with
those for planar silicon pixel detectors using published charge loss
measurements and the same extrapolation methods as for diamond. It is shown
that the expected S/N of a diamond pixel detector with pixel pitches typical
for LHC, exceeds that of planar silicon pixels at fluences beyond 10$^{15}$

Type Ia explosion. With an age of 407 years, and an angular diameter of ~ 4',
Kepler is estimated to be between 3.0 and 7.0 kpc distant. Unlike other
Galactic Type Ia supernova remnants such as Tycho and SN 1006, and SNR
0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, Kepler shows evidence for a strong
circumstellar interaction. A bowshock structure in the north is thought to
originate from the motion of a mass-losing system through the interstellar
medium prior to the supernova. We present results of hydrodynamical and
spectral modeling aimed at constraining the circumstellar environment of the
system and the amount of 56Ni produced in the explosion. Using models that
contain either 0.3 M_sun (subenergetic) or 1 M_sun (energetic) of 56Ni, we
simulate the interaction between supernova Ia ejecta and various circumstellar
density models. Based on dynamical considerations alone, we find that the
subenergetic models favor a distance to the SNR of < 6.4 kpc, while the model
that produces 1 M_sun of 56Ni requires a distance to the SNR of > 7 kpc. The
X-ray spectrum is consistent with an explosion that produced ~ 1 M_sun of 56Ni,
ruling out the subenergetic models, and suggesting that Kepler's SNR was a SN
1991T-like event. Additionally, the X-ray spectrum rules out a pure 1/r^2 wind
profile expected from isotropic mass loss up to the time of the supernova.
Introducing a small cavity around the progenitor system results in modeled
X-ray spectra that are consistent with the observed spectrum. If a wind shaped
circumstellar environment is necessary to explain the dynamics and X-ray
emission from the shocked ejecta in Kepler's SNR, then we require that the
distance to the remnant be greater than 7 kpc.

the randomness in the generation units, due to the stochastic nature of the
generation sources and of the mechanical degradation/failure behavior of the
generation systems. The universal generating function (UGF) technique is used
for the individual component multi-state modeling. A multiplication-type
composition operator is introduced to combine the UGFs for the mechanical
degradation and renewable generation source states into the UGF of the
renewable generator power output. The overall multi-state DG system UGF is then
constructed and classical reliability indices (e.g. loss of load expectation
(LOLE), expected energy not supplied (EENS)) are computed from the DG system
generation and load UGFs. An application of the model is shown on a DG system
adapted from the IEEE 34 nodes distribution test feeder.

matter in the Universe. The ability to detect the directionality of recoil
nuclei will considerably facilitate detection of WIMPs. In this paper we
propose a novel type of dark matter detector: detectors made of DNA or RNA
could provide nanometer resolution for tracking, an energy threshold of 0.5
keV, and can operate at room temperature. When a WIMP from the Galactic Halo
elastically scatters off of a nucleus in the detector, the recoiling nucleus
then traverses hundreds of strings of single stranded nucleic acids (ssNA) with
known base sequences and severs ssNA strands along its trajectory. The location
of the break can be identified by amplifying and identifying the segments of
cut ssNA using techniques well known to biologists. Thus the path of the
recoiling nucleus can be tracked to nanometer accuracy. In one such detector
concept, the transducers are nanometer-thick Au-foils of 1m x 1m, and the
direction of recoiling nuclei is measured by ""NA Tracking Chamber"" consisting
of ordered array of ssNA strands. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and ssNA
sequencing are used to read-out the detector. The proposed detector is smaller
and cheaper than other alternatives: 1 kg of gold and 0.1 to 4 kg of ssNA
(depending on length and strand density), packed into 0.01m$^3$, can be used to
study 10 GeV WIMPs. A variety of other detector target elements could be used
in this detector to optimize for different WIMP masses and to identify WIMP
properties. By leveraging advances in molecular biology, we aim to achieve
about 1,000-fold better spatial resolution than in conventional WIMP detectors
at reasonable cost.

dependent and non-identically distributed) Bernoulli random variables. Upper
bounds on the error that follows from an approximation of this entropy by the
entropy of a Poisson random variable with the same mean are derived via the
Chen-Stein method. The second part of this work derives new lower bounds on the
total variation (TV) distance and relative entropy between the distribution of
the sum of independent Bernoulli random variables and the Poisson distribution.
The starting point of the derivation of the new bounds in the second part of
this work is an introduction of a new lower bound on the total variation
distance, whose derivation generalizes and refines the analysis by Barbour and
Hall (1984), based on the Chen-Stein method for the Poisson approximation. A
new lower bound on the relative entropy between these two distributions is
introduced, and this lower bound is compared to a previously reported upper
bound on the relative entropy by Kontoyiannis et al. (2005). The derivation of
the new lower bound on the relative entropy follows from the new lower bound on
the total variation distance, combined with a distribution-dependent refinement
of Pinsker's inequality by Ordentlich and Weinberger (2005). Upper and lower
bounds on the Bhattacharyya parameter, Chernoff information and Hellinger
distance between the distribution of the sum of independent Bernoulli random
variables and the Poisson distribution with the same mean are derived as well
via some relations between these quantities with the total variation distance
and the relative entropy. The analysis in this work combines elements of
information theory with the Chen-Stein method for the Poisson approximation.
The resulting bounds are easy to compute, and their applicability is
exemplified.

are closely linked to morphology: compact galaxies with semi-major axis radii r
<~ 2 kpc are substantially more likely than their larger counterparts to
exhibit LyA in emission. Although LyA emission strength varies widely within
galaxies of a given morphological type, all but one of 19 galaxies with LyA
equivalent width W_LyA > 20 Angstroms have compact and/or multiple-component

Galaxies of all morphological types drive similarly strong outflows (as traced
by the blue wing of interstellar absorption line features), but the outflows of
larger galaxies are less highly ionized and exhibit larger optical depth at the
systemic redshift that may correspond to a decreasing efficiency of feedback in
evacuating gas from the galaxy. This v ~ 0 km/s gas is responsible both for
shifting the mean absorption line redshift and attenuating W_LyA (via a longer
resonant scattering path) in galaxies with larger rest-optical half light
radii. In contrast to galaxies at lower redshifts, there is no evidence for a
correlation between outflow velocity and inclination, suggesting that outflows
from these puffy and irregular systems may be poorly collimated. (Abbrev.)

describe the (non-linear) matter distribution, and the conditional luminosity
function (CLF) to specify the halo occupation statistics. For a given choice of
cosmological parameters, this model can be used to predict the galaxy
luminosity function, as well as the two-point correlation functions of

analytical model, which we test against mock galaxy redshift surveys
constructed from high-resolution numerical $N$-body simulations. We demonstrate
that our model, which includes scale-dependence of the halo bias and a proper
treatment of halo exclusion, reproduces the 3-dimensional galaxy-galaxy
correlation and the galaxy-matter cross-correlation (which can be projected to
predict the observables) with an accuracy better than 10 (in most cases 5)
percent. Ignoring either of these effects, as is often done, results in
systematic errors that easily exceed 40 percent on scales of $\sim 1
h^{-1}\Mpc$, where the data is typically most accurate. Finally, since the
projected correlation functions of galaxies are never obtained by integrating
the redshift space correlation function along the line-of-sight out to
infinity, simply because the data only cover a finite volume, they are still
affected by residual redshift space distortions (RRSDs). Ignoring these, as
done in numerous studies in the past, results in systematic errors that easily
exceed 20 perent on large scales ($r_\rmp \gta 10 h^{-1}\Mpc$). We show that it
is fairly straightforward to correct for these RRSDs, to an accuracy better

another solution: movement of the walls in a cyclical fashion to introduce a

VIMOS Supernova Survey (SVISS). The sample contains 16 supernovae in total. The
discovered supernovae have been classified as core collapse or type Ia
supernovae (9 and 7, respectively) based on their light curves, colour
evolution and host galaxy photometric redshift. The rates we find for the core
collapse supernovae are 3.29 (-1.78,-1.45)(+3.08,+1.98) x 10^-4 yr^-1 Mpc^-3
h70^3 (with statistical and systematic errors respectively) at average redshift
0.39 and 6.40 (-3.12,-2.11)(+5.30,+3.65) x 10^-4 yr^-1 Mpc^-3 h70^3 at average
redshift 0.73. For the type Ia supernovae we find a rate of 1.29
(-0.57,-0.28)(+0.88,+0.27) x 10^-4 yr^-1 Mpc^-3 h70^3 at average redshift 0.62.
All of these rate estimates have been corrected for host galaxy extinction,
using a method that includes supernovae missed in infrared bright galaxies at
high redshift. We use Monte Carlo simulations to make a thorough study of the
systematic effects from assumptions made when calculating the rates and find
that the most important errors come from misclassification, the assumed mix of
faint and bright supernova types and uncertainties in the extinction
correction. We compare our rates to other observations and to the predicted
rates for core collapse and type Ia supernovae based on the star formation
history and different models of the delay time distribution. Overall, our
measurements, when taking the effects of extinction into account, agree quite
well with the predictions and earlier results. Our results highlight the
importance of understanding the role of systematic effects, and dust extinction
in particular, when trying to estimate the rates of supernovae at moderate to
high redshift.

to constrain the architectures and relative inclinations of planetary systems
within approximately 0.5 AU of their host stars. We use the triple-transit
systems from the Kepler 16-months data as templates for physical triple-planet
systems and perform synthetic transit observations. We find that all the Kepler
triple-transit and double-transit systems can be produced from the
triple-planet templates, given a low mutual inclination of around five degrees.
Our analysis shows that the Kepler data contains a population of planets larger
than four Earth radii in single-transit systems that can not arise from the
triple-planet templates. We explore the hypothesis that high-mass counterparts
of the triple-transit systems underwent dynamical instability to produce a
population of massive double-planet systems of moderately high mutual
inclination. We perform N-body simulations of mass-boosted triple-planet
systems and observe how the systems heat up and lose planets, most frequently
by planet-planet collisions, yielding transits in agreement with the large
planets in the Kepler single-transit systems. The resulting population of
massive double-planet systems can nevertheless not explain the additional
excess of low-mass planets among the observed single-transit systems and the
lack of gas-giant planets in double-transit and triple-transit systems.
Planetary instability of systems of triple gas-giant planets can be behind part
of the dichotomy between systems hosting one or more small planets and those
hosting a single giant planet. The main part of the dichotomy, however, is more
likely to have arisen already during planet formation when the formation,
migration or scattering of a massive planet, triggered above a threshold
metallicity, suppressed the formation of other planets in sub-AU orbits.

the J-band, sky background in the Canadian High Arctic. There has been
considerable recent interest in the development of an astronomical observatory
in Ellesmere Island; initial site testing has shown promise for a world-class
site. Encouragement for our study came from sky background measurements on the
high Antarctic glacial plateau in winter that showed markedly lower NIR
emission when compared to good mid-latitude astronomical sites due to reduced
emission from OH airglow lines. This is possibly a Polar effect and may also be
present in the High Arctic. To test this hypothesis, we carried out an
experiment which measured the the J-band sky brightness in the High Arctic
during winter. We constructed a zenith-pointing, J-band photometer, and
installed it at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL)
near Eureka, Nunavut (latitude: 80 degrees N). We present the design of our
photometer and our results from our short PEARL observing campaign in February
2012. Taken over a period of four days, our measurements indicate that the
J-band sky brightness varies between 15.5-15.9 mag arcsec^2, with a measurement
uncertainty of 0.15 mag dominated entirely by systematic errors present in our
radiometric calibration. On our best night, we measured a fairly consistent sky
brightness of 15.8 +/- 0.15 mag arcsec^2. This is not corrected for atmospheric
extinction, which is typically <0.1 mag in the J-band on a good night. The
measured sky brightness is comparable to an excellent mid-latitude site, but is
not as dark as claimed by the Antarctic measurements. We discuss possible
explanations of why we do not see as dark skies as in the Antarctic. Future
winter-long sky brightness measurements are anticipated to obtain the necessary
statistics to make a proper comparison with the Antarctic measurements.

  Cosmological Implications","thesis, 160 pages, 10 figures",,,,"hep-th hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is about the use of a novel, exact functional quantization method
as applied to two commonly studied actions in theoretical physics. The
functional method in question has its roots in the exact renormalisation group
flow techniques pioneered by Wilson, but with the flow parameter not limited to
the familiar momentum cutoff. Finding a configuration satisfying an expression
for the exact effective action which does not vary with this parameter provides
the basis for finding solutions to the physical actions we study. Firstly, the
method is applied to an expression for the bare action of the pseudo-scalar
axion used to explain the strong CP problem in QCD. When quantized, we find
that the effective potential of the axion, when interactions are not
considered, is necessarily flattened by spinodal instability effects. We regard
this flattening asrepresenting the very early stage in the development of the
axion potential, when the Peccei-Quinn U(1) symmetry is spontaneously broken
resulting in a double-well potential. Using commonly quoted values for the
parameters of such a potential, we devise an expression for the energy density
of the emerging axion potential and this is compared to dark energy. We then
apply the functional method to the bosonic string with time varying graviton,
dilaton and antisymmetric tensor (resulting in the string-axion) background
fields. We achieve a demonstration of conformal invariance in a
non-perturbative manner in the beta functions, contrasting with conventional
string cosmology where cancellation of a perturbative expansion is performed.
We then offer some hints as to possible cosmological implications of our
configuration in terms of optical anisotropy.

sources in large data cubes that are dominated by noise. This is a 3D challenge
as the sources we wish to catalog are spread over several spatial pixels and
spectral channels. While 2D searches can be applied, e.g., channel by channel,
optimal searches take into account the 3-dimensional nature of the sources. In
this overview I will focus on HI 21-cm spectral line source detection in
extragalactic surveys, in particular HIPASS, the ""HI Parkes All-Sky Survey"" and
WALLABY, the ""ASKAP HI All-Sky Survey"". I use the original HIPASS data to
highlight the diversity of spectral signatures of galaxies and gaseous clouds,
both in emission and absorption. Among others, I report the discovery of a 680
km/s wide HI absorption trough in the megamaser galaxy NGC 5793. Issues such as
source confusion and baseline ripples, typically encountered in single-dish HI
surveys, are much reduced in interferometric HI surveys. Several large HI
emission and absorption surveys are planned for the Australian Square Kilometre
Array Pathfinder (ASKAP): here we focus on WALLABY, the 21-cm survey of the sky
(Dec < +30 degr; z < 0.26) which will take about one year of observing time
with ASKAP. Novel phased array feeds (""radio cameras"") will provide 30 square
degrees instantaneous field-of-view. WALLABY is expected to detect more than
500 000 galaxies, unveil their large-scale structures and cosmological
parameters, detect their extended, low-surface brightness disks as well as gas
streams and filaments between galaxies. It is a precursor for future HI surveys
with SKA Phase I and II, exploring galaxy formation and evolution. The
compilation of highly reliable and complete source catalogs will require
sophisticated source-finding algorithms as well as accurate source
parametrisation.

of the magnetization should be slow. When the velocity of vortices is low, they
are dressed by nonuniform magnetization and move as polarons. In this case, the
viscosity of vortices proportional to the magnetic relaxation time is enhanced
significantly. As velocity increases, the polarons dissociate and the viscosity
drops to the usual Bardeen-Stephen one, resulting in a jump in the I-V curve.

required for re-ionizing the universe. The alternative, galaxies as sources of
ionizing photons, suffers from the problem that known types of galaxies are
almost completely opaque to ionizing photons. For reionization to happen,
either large numbers of (largely undiscovered) sources are required, or the
known populations of galaxies need to have had a much larger escape fraction
for ionizing radiation in the past. We discuss recent discoveries of faint z~3
Lyman alpha emitters with asymmetric, extended Lyman alpha emission regions,
which apparently are related to interacting galaxies. The unusually shaped line
profiles and the underlying stellar populations of these objects suggest the
presence of damaged gaseous halos, infall of gas, tidal or stripped stellar
features and young populations of hot stars, that would all be conducive to the
release of ionizing radiation. As galaxy interactions and mergers increase with
redshift, these effects can only become more important at earlier times, and so
these interacting z~3 objects may be late, lower redshift analogues of the

measurements in 49 unique clusters. For this combined sample, we study the
chemical abundances of open clusters as a function of distance, age, and
metallicity. We confirm that the metallicity gradient in the outer disk is
flatter than the gradient in the vicinity of the solar neighborhood. We also
confirm that the open clusters in the outer disk are metal-poor with
enhancements in the ratios [alpha/Fe] and perhaps [Eu/Fe]. All elements show
negligible or small trends between [X/Fe] and distance (< 0.02 dex/kpc), but
for some elements, there is a hint that the local (RGC < 13 kpc) and distant
(RGC > 13 kpc) samples may have different trends with distance. There is no
evidence for significant abundance trends versus age (< 0.04 dex/Gyr). We
measure the linear relation between [X/Fe] and metallicity, [Fe/H], and find
that the scatter about the mean trend is comparable to the measurement
uncertainties. Comparison with solar neighborhood field giants shows that the
open clusters share similar abundance ratios [X/Fe] at a given metallicity.
While the flattening of the metallicity gradient and enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios
in the outer disk suggest a different chemical enrichment history to the solar
neighborhood, we echo the sentiments expressed by Friel et al. that definitive
conclusions await homogeneous analyses of larger samples of stars in larger

for the factorization of the integer J(d1,d2) in the case that d1 and d2 are
relatively prime and discriminants of maximal orders. To compute this formula,
they first reduce the problem to counting the number of simultaneous embeddings
of O_d1 and O_d2 into endomorphism rings of supersingular curves, and then
solve this counting problem.
  Interestingly, this counting problem also appears when computing class
polynomials for invariants of genus 2 curves. However, in this application, one
must consider orders O_d1 and O_d2 that are non-maximal. Motivated by the
application to genus 2 curves, we generalize the methods of Gross and Zagier
and give a computable formula for v_p(J(d1,d2)) for any distinct pair of
discriminants d1,d2 and any prime p>2. In the case that d1 is squarefree and d2
is the discriminant of any quadratic imaginary order, our formula can be stated

ram pressure stripping over timescales comparable to cluster ages. The gas in
these galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,
stellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly
perturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we
investigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram
pressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with
more turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails
of the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main
conclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of
the average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from
galaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases
sharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes
place near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the
boost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the ""random walk"" of the ISM from the
central regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the
ram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can
be temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of
the turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still
characterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.

characteristic is the primary objective of many microarray studies. As more and
more studies are carried out with observational rather than well controlled
experimental samples, it becomes important to evaluate and properly control the
impact of sample heterogeneity on DE gene finding. Typical methods for
identifying DE genes require ranking all the genes according to a preselected
statistic based on a single model for two or more group comparisons, with or
without adjustment for other covariates. Such single model approaches
unavoidably result in model misspecification, which can lead to increased error
due to bias for some genes and reduced efficiency for the others. We evaluated
the impact of model misspecification from such approaches on detecting DE genes
and identified parameters that affect the magnitude of impact. To properly
control for sample heterogeneity and to provide a flexible and coherent
framework for identifying simultaneously DE genes associated with a single or
multiple sample characteristics and/or their interactions, we proposed a
Bayesian model averaging approach which corrects the model misspecification by
averaging over model space formed by all relevant covariates. An empirical
approach is suggested for specifying prior model probabilities. We demonstrated
through simulated microarray data that this approach resulted in improved
performance in DE gene identification compared to the single model approaches.
The flexibility of this approach is demonstrated through our analysis of data
from two observational microarray studies.

formalism predicts correlations between different spin components that would

of the spin components, the resolution and back-action errors of the
intermediate measurement can be described by random spin flips acting on an
intrinsic joint probability. If the error rates are known, the intrinsic joint
probability can be reconstructed from the noisy statistics of the actual
measurement outcomes. In this paper, we use the spin-flip model of measurement
errors to analyze experimental data on photon polarization obtained with an
interferometric setup that allows us to vary the measurement strength and hence
the balance between resolution and back-action errors. We confirm that the

stars we obtain the detailed star formation and chemical evolution history of
Fornax. Fornax is dominated by intermediate age (1-10 Gyr) stellar populations,
but also includes ancient (10-14 Gyr), and young (<1 Gyr) stars. We show that
Fornax displays a radial age gradient, with younger, more metal-rich
populations dominating the central region. This confirms results from previous
works. Within an elliptical radius of 0.8 degrees, or 1.9 kpc from the centre,
a total mass in stars of 4.3x10^7 Msun was formed, from the earliest times
until 250 Myr ago. Using the detailed star formation history, age estimates are
determined for individual stars on the upper RGB, for which spectroscopic
abundances are available, giving an age-metallicity relation of the Fornax dSph
from individual stars. This shows that the average metallicity of Fornax went
up rapidly from [Fe/H]<-2.5 dex to [Fe/H]=-1.5 dex between 8-12 Gyr ago, after
which a more gradual enrichment resulted in a narrow, well-defined sequence
which reaches [Fe/H]\sim-0.8 dex, \sim3 Gyr ago. These ages also allow us to
measure the build-up of chemical elements as a function of time, and thus
determine detailed timescales for the evolution of individual chemical
elements. A rapid decrease in [Mg/Fe] is seen for the stars with [Fe/H]>-1.5
dex, with a clear trend in age.

($T_{\rm eff}>11\,500\,{\rm K}$) with diffusion-dominated atmospheres are slow
rotators like the hot subdwarf stars located on the extreme horizontal branch,
which lost more envelope and therefore angular momentum in the red-giant phase.
The uniform rotation distributions of single and wide binary sdBs pose a
challenge to our understanding of hot subdwarf formation. Especially the high
fraction of helium white dwarf mergers predicted by theory seems to be
inconsistent with the results presented here.

setups obliterate the differences between the toric code and equivalent graph
states; hence we search for the smallest setups on the square- and triangular
lattice, such that the quasi-locality of the toric code hamiltonian becomes a
distinctive feature. To this end, a purely geometric procedure to transform a

combination with an algorithmic computation of LC-equivalent graph states, we
find the smallest non-trivial setup on the square lattice to contain 5

the most fundamental goals in extragalactic astronomy. While star formation
rates and the merger history are now measured with increasingly high certainty,
the role of gas accretion from the intergalactic medium in supplying gas for
star formation still remains largely unknown. We present in this paper indirect
evidence for the accretion of gas into massive galaxies with initial stellar
masses M_*>10^{11} M_sol and following the same merger adjusted co-moving
number density at lower redshifts during the epoch 1.5 < z < 3, using results
from the GOODS NICMOS Survey (GNS). We show that the measured gas mass
fractions of these massive galaxies are inconsistent with the observed star
formation history for the same galaxy population. We further demonstrate that
this additional gas mass cannot be accounted for by cold gas delivered through
minor and major mergers. We also consider the effects of gas outflows and gas
recycling due to stellar evolution in these calculations. We argue that to
sustain star formation at the observed rates there must be additional methods
for increasing the cold gas mass, and that the likeliest method for
establishing this supply of gas is by accretion from the intergalactic medium.
We calculate that the average gas mass accretion rate into these massive
galaxies between 1.5 < z < 3.0, is \dot{M} = 96+/-19 M_sol/yr after accounting
for outflowing gas. We show that during this epoch, and for these very massive
galaxies, 49+/-20% of baryonic mass assembly is a result of gas accretion and
unresolved mergers. However, 66+/-20% of all star formation in this epoch is
the result of gas accretion. This reveals that for the most massive galaxies at
1.5< z< 3 gas accretion is the dominant method for instigating new stellar mass
assembly.

how standard valuation models fit in case of T- Bonds that are traded on MSE
and to verify whether they offer reliable results compared with average bonds
prices on MSE. We test the sensitivity of T- Bonds on MSE on interest rate
changes and determine that convexity is more accurate measure as approximation
of bond prices changes than duration. Final conclusion is that T-Bonds traded
at MSE are not sensitive on interest rate changes due to institutional
investors' permanent higher demand and at the same time market limited offer of
risk-free instruments.

interplay between different length scales, namely, the persistence length
$\ell_{p}$, and the disorder correlation length $p$, in addition to the
fraction of hydrophobic patches $f$ play a major role in altering the
equilibrium morphologies and mechanical response. In particular, we show a
plethora of equilibrium morphologies for this system, \textit{e.g.} core-shell,
looped (with hybridised hydrophilic-hydrophobic sections), and extended coils
as a function of these parameters. A competition of bending energy and
hybridisation energies between two types of beads determines the equilibrium
morphology. Further, mechanical properties of such polymer architectures are
crucially dependent on their native conformations, and in turn on the disorder
realisation along the chain backbone. Thus, for flexible chains, a globule to
extended coil transition is effected via a tensile force for all disorder
realisations. However, the exact nature of the force-extension curves are
different for the different disorder realisations. In contrast, we find that
force-extension behavior of semi-flexible chains with different equilibrium
configurations \textit{e.g.} core-shell, looped, \textit{etc.} reveal a cascade

complexity related to the spin flip dynamics of the 2D Ising Ferromagnet at

three different entropy estimation algorithms to asses entropy rate and
statistical complexity of binary sequences. The latter are obtained by
monitoring the orientation of a single spin on a square lattice of side-length
L=256 at a given temperature parameter over time. The different entropy
estimation procedures are based on the M-block Shannon entropy (a well
established method that yields results for benchmarking purposes),
non-sequential recursive pair substitution (providing an elaborate and an
approximate estimator) and a convenient data compression algorithm contained in
the zlib-library (providing an approximate estimator only). We propose an
approximate measure of statistical complexity that emphasizes on correlations
within the sequence and which is easy to implement, even by means of black-box
data compression algorithms. Regarding the 2D Ising Ferromagnet simulated using
Metropolis dynamics and for binary sequences of finite length, the proposed
approximate complexity measure is peaked close to the critical temperature. For
the approximate estimators, a finite-size scaling analysis reveals that the
peak approaches the critical temperature as the sequence length increases.
Results obtained using different spin-flip dynamics are briefly discussed. The
suggested complexity measure can be extended to non-binary sequences in a
straightforward manner.

We call an Euclidean instanton is to be an oscillating instanton, if there
exists a point where the derivative of the scale factor and the scalar field
vanish at the same time. Then we can prove that the oscillating instanton can
be analytically continued, both as inhomogeneous and homogeneous tunneling
channels. Here, we especially focus on the possibility of a homogeneous
tunneling channel. For the existence of such an instanton, we have to assume
three things: (1) there should be a local maximum and the curvature of the
maximum should be sufficiently large, (2) there should be a local minimum and
(3) the other side of the potential should have a sufficiently deeper vacuum.
Then, we can show that there exists a number of oscillating instanton solutions
and their probabilities are higher compared to the Hawking-Moss instantons. We
also check the possibility when the oscillating instantons are comparable with
the Coleman-DeLuccia channels. Thus, for a general vacuum decay problem, we
should not ignore the oscillating instanton channels.

on the distance from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Hubble
constant h (these priors have been included in order to help break the

to explore the probability distributions of the cosmographic parameters we use
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method (MCMC). We finally investigate implications
of our results for the dark energy, in particular, we focus on the
parametrization of the dark energy equation of state (EOS). Actually, a
possibility to investigate the nature of dark energy lies in measuring the dark
energy equation of state, w, and its time (or redshift) dependence at high
accuracy. However, since w(z) is not directly accessible to measurement,
reconstruction methods are needed to extract it reliably from observations.

Ca2+-activated, electroneutral ATP-Mg/Pi carrier (APC). The APC is a protein in
the mitochondrial carrier super family that localizes to the inner
mitochondrial membrane (IMM). It is known to modulate a number of processes
that depend on mitochondrial AdN content, such as gluconeogenesis, protein
synthesis, and citrulline synthesis. Despite this critical role, a kinetic
model of the underlying mechanism has not been developed and validated. Here, a
biophysical model of the APC is developed that is thermodynamically balanced
and accurately reproduces a number of reported data sets from isolated rat
liver and rat kidney mitochondria. The model is based on an ordered bi-bi
mechanism for hetero-exchange of ATP and Pi and also includes homo-exchanges of
ATP and Pi to explain both the initial rate and time course data on ATP and Pi
transport via the APC. The model invokes seven kinetic parameters regarding the
APC mechanism and three parameters related to matrix pH regulation by external
Pi. These parameters are estimated based on nineteen independent data curves;
the estimated parameters are validated using six additional data curves. The
model takes into account the effects of pH, Mg2+ and Ca2+ on ATP and Pi
transport via the APC and supports the conclusion that the pH gradient across
the IMM serves as the primary driving force for AdN uptake or efflux. Moreover,
computer simulations demonstrate that extra-matrix Ca2+ modulates the turnover
rate of the APC and not the binding affinity of ATP, as previously suggested.

N^2 x N^2 matrix representations of the 4-algebra (and as a byproduct of the
3-algebra which makes the regularization of S^3 also possible).

plasmonic, optical and electronic devices. Here we trace on an attosecond time
scale the birth of collective excitations in a finite system and find distinct
new features in this regime. Combining quantum chemical computation with
quantum kinetic methods we calculate the time-dependent light absorption and
refraction in fullerene that serve as indicators for the emergence of
collective modes. We explain the numerically calculated novel transient
features by an analytical model and point out the relevance for ultra-fast
photonic and electronic applications. A scheme is proposed to measure the
predicted effects via the emergent attosecond metrology.

Richardson--Obukhov law, which is usually explained by a scale-dependent
effective diffusivity. Here, supported by state-of-the-art numerics, we revisit
this argument. The Lagrangian correlation time of velocity differences is found
to increase too quickly for validating this approach, but acceleration
differences decorrelate on dissipative timescales. This results in an
asymptotic diffusion $\propto t^{1/2}$ of velocity differences, so that the
long-time behavior of distances is that of the integral of Brownian motion. The
time of convergence to this regime is shown to be that of deviations from
Batchelor's initial ballistic regime, given by a scale-dependent energy
dissipation time rather than the usual turnover time. It is finally argued that
the fluid flow intermittency should not affect this long-time behavior of

Low-Thrust, many-revolution transfers. The main feature of the novel approach
is a considerable reduction in the control parameters and a consequent gain in
computational speed. Each spiral is built by using a predefined pattern for
thrust direction and switching structure. The pattern is then optimised to
minimise propellant consumption and transfer time. The variation of the orbital
elements due to the thrust is computed analytically from a first-order solution
of the perturbed Keplerian motion. The proposed approach allows for a realistic
estimation of {\Delta}V and time of flight required to transfer a spacecraft
between two arbitrary orbits. Eccentricity and plane changes are both accounted
for. The novel approach is applied here to the design of missions for the
removal of space debris by means of an Ion Beam Shepherd Spacecraft. In
particular, two slightly different variants of the proposed low-thrust control
model are used for the different phases of the mission. Thanks to their low
computational cost they can be included in a multiobjective optimisation
problem in which the sequence and timing of the removal of five pieces of
debris are optimised to minimise propellant consumption and mission duration.
