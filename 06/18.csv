ESA, the ""Space Optical Clocks"" (SOC) project aims to install and to operate an
optical lattice clock on the ISS towards the end of this decade, as a natural
follow-on to the ACES mission, improving its performance by at least one order
of magnitude. The payload is planned to include an optical lattice clock, as
well as a frequency comb, a microwave link, and an optical link for comparisons
of the ISS clock with ground clocks located in several countries and
continents. Undertaking a necessary step towards optical clocks in space, the
EU-FP7-SPACE-2010-1 project no. 263500 (SOC2) (2011-2015) aims at two
""engineering confidence"", accurate transportable lattice optical clock
demonstrators having relative frequency instability below 1\times10^-15 at 1 s
integration time and relative inaccuracy below 5\times10^-17. This goal
performance is about 2 and 1 orders better in instability and inaccuracy,
respectively, than today's best transportable clocks. The devices will be based
on trapped neutral ytterbium and strontium atoms. One device will be a
breadboard. The two systems will be validated in laboratory environments and
their performance will be established by comparison with laboratory optical
clocks and primary frequency standards. In this paper we present the project
and the results achieved during the first year.

prominent, well-studied modulated radio and gamma-ray emission. Changes in its
radio morphology suggested in the past the hypothesis of a precessing
microquasar. In 2006, a set of VLBA observations performed all around the orbit
were not used to study the precession because the souce was explained in the
context of the pulsar model, the alternative model for this system. However, a
successive radio spectral index analysis has confirmed the predictions of the
microquasar scenario in LSI+61303. At the light of these results we reanalysed
the set of VLBA observations that constitutes a unique tool to determine the
precession period and render a better understanding of the physical mechanism
behind the precession. We improved the dynamic range of the images by a factor
of four using self-calibration, and the self-calibrated maps reveal, in six out
of ten images, a double-sided structure. The double-sided structure has
variable position angle and switches at some epochs to a one-sided structure.
These variations indicate a scenario where the precessing jet, inducing
variable Doppler boosting, points close to our line of sight - a microblazar,
the galactic version of the extra-galactic blazars. High energy observations of
LSI+61303 are consistent with the microblazar nature of this object. Moreover,
we suggest in LSI+61303 the first case of core shift effect observed in a
microquasar. Because of this effect, well known in AGN, the cm-core of the jet
is rather displaced from the system center. In LSI+61303, the cm-core of the
jet traces a large ellipse, 7 times larger than the orbit, in a period of about
28 d. Our hypothesis is that this ellipse is the cross-section of the
precession cone of the jet at the distance of the 3.6 cm-core, and its period
is the precession period.

the regularization method that enjoys the best justification is that of
Detweiler and Whiting, which is based on a four-dimensional Green's function.

We prove that the analytic germs at the origin 1 of representation varieties

nilpotent groups. When the CDG algebra has positive weights, we elucidate some
of the structure of (rank one complex) topological and algebraic jump loci: up
to degree $q$, all their irreducible components passing through the origin are
connected affine subtori, respectively rational linear subspaces. Furthermore,
the global exponential map sends all algebraic cohomology jump loci, up to

(M-1)(N-1)>1. This solves an open problem proposed in [J. Mod. Opt. 47 (2000),

bar/boxy bulge model, and is qualitatively consistent with the observed one in
many aspects. End-to-end separations of the X-shaped structure in the radial
and vertical directions are roughly 3 kpc and 1.8 kpc, respectively. The
X-shaped structure contains about 7% of light in the boxy bulge region, but it
is significant enough to be identified in observations. An X-shaped structure
naturally arises in the formation of bar/boxy bulges, and is mainly associated
with orbits trapped around the vertically-extended x_1 family. Like the bar in
our model, the X-shaped structure tilts away from the Sun--Galactic center line
by 20 degrees. The X-shaped structure becomes increasingly symmetric about the
disk plane, so the observed symmetry may indicate that it formed at least a few
billion years ago. The existence of the vertical X-shaped structure suggests
that the formation of the Milky Way bulge is shaped mainly by internal disk
dynamical instabilities.

improvement in the overall agreement with experiment as Tran and Blaha [{\em

some cases. Furthermore, since there is no exchange and correlation energy term
from which the mBJLDA potential can be deduced, a direct optimization procedure
to get the lattice parameter in a consistent way is not possible as in the
usual theory. These authors suggest that a LDA or a GGA optimization procedure
is used previous to a band structure calculation and the resulting lattice
parameter introduced into the 2011 code. This choice is important since small
percentage differences in the lattice parameter can give rise to quite higher
percentage deviations from experiment in the predicted band gap value.

stripping processes off a target nucleus consisting of ${A}$ nucleons are
treated within the framework of the few-body integral equations theory. The
generalized Faddeev equations in the AGS form, which take into account the
target excitations, with realistic optical potentials provide the most advanced
and complete description of the deuteron stripping. The main problem in
practical application of such equations is the screening of the Coulomb
potential, which works only for light nuclei. In this paper we present a new
formulation of the Faddeev equations in the AGS form taking into account the
target excitations with explicit inclusion of the Coulomb interaction. By
projecting the $(A+2)$-body operators onto target states, matrix three-body
integral equations are derived which allow for the incorporation of the excited
states of the target nucleons. Using the explicit equations for the partial
Coulomb scattering wave functions in the momentum space we present the AGS
equations in the Coulomb distorted wave representation without screening
procedure. We also use the explicit expression for the off-shell two-body
Coulomb scattering $T$-matrix which is needed to calculate the effective
potentials in the AGS equations. The integrals containing the off-shell Coulomb
T-matrix are regularized to make the obtained equations suitable for
calculations. For $NN$ and nucleon-target nuclear interactions we assume the
separable potentials what significantly simplifies solution of the AGS
equations.

estimation of hidden parameters in a sensor network with communications

measure a common scalar unknown parameter. We assume that a fraction of the

goal for each node is to simultaneously identify its class (faulty or
non-faulty) and estimate the common parameter.
  We propose a novel cooperative iterative algorithm which copes with the

performance. Our main result is a rigorous proof of the convergence of the
algorithm and a characterization of the limit behavior. We also show that, in
the limit when the number of sensors goes to infinity, the common unknown
parameter is estimated with arbitrary small error, while the classification
error converges to that of the optimal centralized maximum likelihood
estimator. We also show numerical results that validate the theoretical

rules of evolution that describe the MDW avalanches. From the values of the
roughness exponents, global $\zeta$, local $\zeta_\text{loc}$, and spectral
$\zeta_s$, obtained from the global interface width, hight-difference
correlation function and structure function, respectively, recent works have
concluded that the universality classes should be analyzed in the context of
the anomalous scaling theory. We show that the model is included in the group
of systems with intrinsic anomalous scaling ($\zeta\simeq 1.5 $,
$\zeta_\text{loc}=\zeta_s\simeq 0.5 $), and that the surface of the MDW is
multi-affine. With these results, we hope to establish in short term the
scaling relations that verify the critical exponents of the model, including
the dynamic exponent $z$, the exponents of the distributions of avalanche-size
$\tau$ and -duration $\alpha$, among others.

parameter log U = -3.5 is in accord with its weak X-ray emission. We find no
high-ionization gas near the nucleus, adding to evidence that the AGN is
currently at low radiative output (perhaps now dominated by kinetic energy).
The nucleus is accompanied by an expanding ring of ionized gas 500 pc in
projected diameter on the side opposite Hanny's Voorwerp, with Doppler offset
300 km/s from the nucleus (kinematic age < 7 x10^5 years). [O III] and H-alpha
+ [N II] images show fine structure in Hanny's Voorwerp, with limb-brightened
sections and small areas where H-alpha is strong. We identify these as regions
ionized by recent star formation, in contrast to the AGN ionization of the
entire cloud. These candidate ""normal"" H II regions contain blue continuum
objects, whose colors are consistent with young stellar populations; they
appear only in a 2-kpc region toward IC 2497 in projection. The
ionization-sensitive ratio [O III]/H-alpha shows no discernible pattern near
the prominent ""hole"" in the ionized gas. The independence of ionization and
surface brightness suggests that substantial spatial structure remains
unresolved, to such an extent that the surface brightness sample the number of
denser filaments rather than the characteristic density in emission regions.
These results fit with our picture of an ionization echo from an AGN whose
ionizing luminosity has dropped by a factor > 100 (and possibly much more)

mass of the black-hole remnant resulting from the merger of a generic binary

test-particle limit for extreme mass-ratio binaries, our formula reproduces
well the results of all the numerical-relativity simulations published so far,
both when applied at separations of a few gravitational radii, and when applied
at separations of tens of thousands of gravitational radii. These validations
make our formula a useful tool in a variety of contexts ranging from
gravitational-wave physics to cosmology. As representative examples, we first
illustrate how it can be used to decrease the phase error of the
effective-one-body waveforms during the ringdown phase. Second, we show that,
when combined with the recently computed self-force correction to the binding
energy of nonspinning black-hole binaries, it provides an estimate of the
energy emitted during the merger and ringdown. Finally, we use it to calculate
the energy radiated in gravitational waves by massive black-hole binaries as a
function of redshift, using different models for the seeds of the black-hole
population.

replication for reliability. Recently, erasure codes were used to reduce the

off-the-shelf erasure codes is their high-repair cost during single node
failure events. A major open problem in this area has been the design of codes
that {\it i)} are repair efficient and {\it ii)} achieve arbitrarily high data

  In this paper, we explore the repair metric of {\it locality}, which
corresponds to the number of disk accesses required during a
{\color{black}single} node repair. Under this metric we characterize an
information theoretic trade-off that binds together locality, code distance,
and the storage capacity of each node. We show the existence of optimal {\it
locally repairable codes} (LRCs) that achieve this trade-off. The achievability
proof uses a locality aware flow-graph gadget which leads to a randomized code
construction. Finally, we present an optimal and explicit LRC that achieves
arbitrarily high data-rates. Our locality optimal construction is based on
simple combinations of Reed-Solomon blocks.

kinematical Hilbert space of the covariant formulation of quantum mechanics,

step from commuting spacetime coordinates to the $\kappa$-Minkowski case, where
the spatial coordinates do not commute with the time coordinate. The
empowerment provided by this kinematical-Hilbert space representation allows us
to give a crisp characterization of the ""fuzziness"" of $\kappa$-Minkowski

show that relative locality, which had been previously formulated exclusively

dependence of the fuzziness of a spacetime point on the distance at which an
observer infers properties of the event that marks the point.

through an elastic element, it is possible to achieve a reduction of
transmissibility of vibrations through a piezoelectric actuator by reducing its

originating from stars, however ideally one is interested in measuring
structure using the stellar mass distribution. Not only does stellar mass trace
out the underlying distribution of matter, it also minimises the effects of
star formation and dust on the appearance and structure of a galaxy. We present
in this paper a study of the stellar mass distributions and structures of
galaxies at z<1 as found within the GOODS fields. We use pixel by pixel
K-corrections to construct stellar mass and mass-to-light ratio maps of 560
galaxies of known morphology at magnitudes z_{850}<24. We measure structural
and size parameters using these stellar mass maps, as well as on ACS BViz band
imaging. This includes investigating the structural CAS-Gini-M_{20} parameters
and half-light radius for each galaxy. We compare structural parameters and
half-light radii in the ACS z_{850}-band and stellar mass maps, finding no
systematic bias introduced by measuring galaxy sizes in z_{850}. We furthermore
investigate relations between structural parameters in the ACS BViz bands and
stellar mass maps, and compare our result to previous morphological studies.
Combinations of various parameters in stellar mass generally reveal clear
separations between early and late type morphologies, but cannot easily
distinguish between star formation and dynamically disturbed systems. We also
show that while ellipticals and early-type spirals have fairly constant CAS
values at z<1 we find a tendency for late-type spiral and peculiar
morphological types to have a higher A(M_{*}) at higher redshift. We argue that
this, and the large fraction of peculiars that appear spiral-like in stellar
mass maps, are possible evidence for either an active bulge formation in some
late-type disks at z<1 or the presence of minor merger events.

loss expressions are determined from a leading order statistical analysis of
the existing experimental data on nuclear Drell-Yan differential cross section
ratio as a function of the quark momentum fraction. It is found that with
independence on the nuclear modification of parton distributions, the available
experimental data from lower incident beam energy rule out the incident-parton

modelling of data which is dense in time but sparse in space, obtained from a
split panel design, the most feasible approach to covering space and time with
limited equipment. The data are hourly averaged particle number concentration
(PNC) and were collected, as part of the Ultrafine Particles from Transport
Emissions and Child Health (UPTECH) project. Two weeks of continuous
measurements were taken at each of a number of government primary schools in
the Brisbane Metropolitan Area. The monitoring equipment was taken to each
school sequentially. The school data are augmented by data from long term
monitoring stations at three locations in Brisbane, Australia.
  Fitting the model helps describe the spatial and temporal variability at a
subset of the UPTECH schools and the long-term monitoring sites. The temporal
variation is modelled hierarchically with penalised random walk terms, one
common to all sites and a term accounting for the remaining temporal trend at
each site. Parameter estimates and their uncertainty are computed in a
computationally efficient approximate Bayesian inference environment, R-INLA.
  The temporal part of the model explains daily and weekly cycles in PNC at the
schools, which can be used to estimate the exposure of school children to
ultrafine particles (UFPs) emitted by vehicles. At each school and long-term
monitoring site, peaks in PNC can be attributed to the morning and afternoon
rush hour traffic and new particle formation events. The spatial component of
the model describes the school to school variation in mean PNC at each school
and within each school ground. It is shown how the spatial model can be
expanded to identify spatial patterns at the city scale with the inclusion of
more spatial locations.

evaluate the latency introduced by these protocols to find a new path after a
link failure. Theoretical estimations and simulation results show that, under
dual chain-topologies, this latency can be too long and incompatible with the
needs of loss and delay constrained applications. As the source nodes cannot
detect link failures immediately because of the delay incurred by the
well-known nature of link state protocols in general, and of OLSR Topology
Control (TC) messages in particular, these nodes keep sending packets along
broken paths. We thus study the inconsistencies between the actual network
topology and the nodes' own representation. After analyzing the consequences of
this long latency, we seek to alleviate these problems with the introduction of
adapted mechanisms. We propose three new different schemes and accordingly
extend the original OLSR and MP-OLSR protocols in order to decrease the
expected latency and improve the protocol performance. Simulation results show
a steep decrease of the latency when using these new schemes in dual

ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) observed by PAO, through the statistical
analysis of the arrival direction distribution. For this purpose, we set up the
Cen A dominance model for the UHECR sources, in which Cen A contributes the
fraction $f_{\rm C}$ of the whole UHECR with energy above
$5.5\times10^{19}\,{\rm eV}$ and the isotropic background contributes the
remaining $1-f_{\rm C}$ fraction. The effect of the intergalactic magnetic
fields on the bending of the trajectory of Cen A originated UHECR is
parameterized by the gaussian smearing angle $\theta_s$. Using the
correlational angular distance distribution (CADD), we identify the excess of
UHECR in the Cen A direction and fit the CADD of the observed PAO data by
varying two parameters $f_{\rm C}$ and $\theta_s$ of the Cen A dominance model.
The best-fit parameter values are $f_{\rm C}\approx0.1$ (The corresponding Cen
A fraction observed at PAO is $f_{\rm C,PAO}\approx0.15$, that is, about 10 out
of 69 UHECR.) and $\theta_s=5^\circ$ with the maximum probability $P_{\rm
max}=0.29$. Considering the uncertainty concerning the assumption of isotropic
background in the Cen A dominance model, we extend the viable parameter ranges
to the $2\sigma$ band, $0.09\lesssim f_{\rm C,PAO}\lesssim 0.25$ and
$0^\circ\lesssim \theta_s\lesssim 20^\circ$. This result supports the existence
of a point source extended by the intergalactic magnetic fields in the
direction of Cen A. If Cen A is actually the source responsible for the
observed excess of UHECR, the average deflection angle of the excess UHECR

found in the low-frequency region, and we associate them with nonradial
g-modes. The other periodicities were found in the high-frequency region, which
are likely p-modes. We discovered that most of the periodicities are components
of multiplets with a common spacing. Assuming that multiplets are caused by
rotation, we derive a rotation period of 25.6(1.8) days. The multiplets also
allow us to identify the pulsations to an unprecedented extent for this class
of pulsator. We also detect l<=2 multiplets, which are sensitive to the
pulsation inclination and can constrain limb darkening via geometric
cancellation factors. While most periodicities are stable, we detected several
regions that show complex patterns. Detailed analyses showed these regions are
complicated by several factors. Two are combination frequencies that originate
in the superNyquist region and were found to be reflected below the Nyquist
frequency. The Fourier peaks are clear in the superNyquist region, but the
orbital motion of Kepler smears the Nyquist frequency in the barycentric
reference frame and this effect is passed on to the subNyquist reflections.
Others are likely multiplets but unstable in amplitudes and/or frequencies. The
density of periodicities also make KIC 10139564 challenging to explain using
published models. This menagerie of properties should provide tight constraints
on structural models, making this subdwarf B star the most promising for
applying asteroseismology.

is a tilted component that extends to higher Galactic latitude at lower
Galactic longitude, 10 kpc from the Sun towards the anti-center. It has a sharp
cutoff on the high latitude side. Distance, velocity, and proper motion
measurements are consistent with previous orbit fits. The mean metallicity is
[Fe/H]$=-0.96 \pm 0.03$, which is lower than the thick disk and Monoceros Ring.
The Monoceros Ring is a higher density substructure that is present at
$15\arcdeg<b<22\arcdeg$ at all longitudes probed in this survey. The structure
likely continues towards lower latitudes. The distances are consistent with a
constant distance from the Galactic Center of 17.6 kpc. The mean line-of-sight
velocity of the structure is consistent with a thick disk rotation. However,
the velocity dispersion of these stars is $\sim 15$ km s$^{-1}$, and the
metallicity is [Fe/H]$=-0.80 \pm 0.01$. Both of these quantities are lower than
the canonical thick disk. We suggest that this ring structure is likely
different from the thick disk, though its association with the disk cannot be
definitively ruled out. The Eastern Banded Structure (EBS) is detected
primarily photometrically, near $(l,b)=(225\arcdeg,30\arcdeg)$, at a distance

local free energy functional describing at a mean field level a spin system
with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. In particular, the
antiferromagnetic interaction is assumed to have a range much larger than the
ferromagnetic one. The competition between these two effects is expected to
lead to the spontaneous emergence of a regular alternation of long intervals on
which the spin profile is magnetized either up or down, with an oscillation
scale intermediate between the range of the ferromagnetic and that of the
antiferromagnetic interaction. In this sense, the optimal or quasi-optimal
profiles are ""froth-like"": if seen on the scale of the antiferromagnetic
potential they look neutral, but if seen at the microscope they actually
consist of big bubbles of two different phases alternating among each other. In
this paper we prove the validity of this picture, we compute the oscillation
scale of the quasi-optimal profiles and we quantify their distance in norm from
a reference periodic profile. The proof consists of two main steps: we first
coarse grain the system on a scale intermediate between the range of the
ferromagnetic potential and the expected optimal oscillation scale; in this way
we reduce the original functional to an effective ""sharp interface"" one. Next,
we study the latter by reflection positivity methods, which require as a key
ingredient the exact locality of the short range term. Our proof has the
conceptual interest of combining coarse graining with reflection positivity
methods, an idea that is presumably useful in much more general contexts than
the one studied here.

A measurement is postulated to collapse a wavefunction onto one of the states
of a predetermined set - the measurement basis. This basis origin is not
specified within quantum mechanics. According to the theory of decohernce, a
measurement basis is singled out by the nature of coupling of a quantum system
to its environment. Here we show how a measurement basis emerges in the
evolution of the electronic spin of a single trapped atomic ion due to
spontaneous photon scattering. Using quantum process tomography we visualize
the projection of all spin directions, onto this basis, as a photon is
scattered. These basis spin states are found to be aligned with the scattered
photon propagation direction. In accordance with decohernce theory, they are
subjected to a minimal increase in entropy due to the photon scattering, while,
orthogonal states become fully mixed and their entropy is maximally increased.
Moreover, we show that detection of the scattered photon polarization measures
the spin state of the ion, in the emerging basis, with high fidelity. Lastly,
we show that while photon scattering entangles all superpositions of pointer
states with the scattered photon polarization, the measurement-basis states
themselves remain classically correlated with it. Our findings show that photon
scattering by atomic spin superpositions fulfils all the requirements from a
quantum measurement process.

generally in error. As successive refinements of nucleation-barrier theory, we
consider corrections due to a non-sharp solid-liquid interface and to a
non-spherical cluster shape. Extensive calculations for the Ising model show
that corrections due to a non-sharp and thermally fluctuating interface account
for the barrier shape with excellent accuracy. The experimental solid
nucleation rates that are measured in colloids are better accounted for by
these non-CNT terms, whose effect appears to be crucial in the interpretation

deposition temperature T, the film's morphology is conditioned by the magnitude
and asymmetry of up- and downhill diffusion. Any severe change of this
mechanism leads to a growth instability, which induces an alteration of the
thin film morphology. In order to study this mechanism, ultra-thin Pt films
were deposited via pulsed laser deposition (PLD) onto
yttria-stabilized-zirconia single crystals at different deposition
temperatures. The morphological evolution of Pt thin films has been
investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force
microscopy (AFM) and standard image analysis techniques. The experimentally
obtained morphologies are compared to simulated thin film structures resulting
from a two-dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) approach. Two main
observations have been made: i) Thin Pt films deposited onto zirconia undergo a
growth transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional growth at T > 573
K. The growth transition and related morphological changes are a function of
the deposition temperature. ii) A critical cluster size of i\ast = 4 in
combination with an asymmetric Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES) barrier favoring the
uphill diffusion of atoms allows for a computational reproduction of the
experimentally obtained film morphologies.

quantum phenomena that is radically different from the traditional picture in
the frequency domain. The simulation and interpretation of nonequilibrium
dynamics is a conspicuous challenge for theory. This paper presents a novel
approach to quantum many-body dynamics that is based on a Hamiltonian
formulation of the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy of
equations of motion for reduced density matrices. These equations have an
underlying symplectic structure, and we write them in the form of the classical
Hamilton equations for canonically conjugate variables. Applying canonical
perturbation theory or the Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging method to the resulting
equations yields a systematic approximation scheme. The possibility of using
memory-dependent functional approximations to close the Hamilton equations at a
particular level of the hierarchy is discussed. The geometric structure of the
equations gives rise to reduced geometric phases that are observable even for
noncyclic evolutions of the many-body state. The formalism is applied to a
finite Hubbard chain which undergoes a quench in on-site interaction energy U.
Canonical perturbation theory, carried out to second order, fully captures the
nontrivial real-time dynamics of the model, including resonance phenomena and
the coupling of fast and slow variables.

g-mode frequency spectrum, with a few low-amplitude p-modes at short periods,
and is a promising target for a seismic study aiming to constrain the internal
structure of this star, and of sdB stars in general.
  We have obtained ground-based spectroscopic Balmer-line radial-velocity
measurements of KIC11558725, spanning the 2010 and 2011 observing seasons. From
these data we have discovered that KIC11558725 is a binary with period P=10.05
d, and that the radial-velocity amplitude of the sdB star is 58 km/s.
Consequently the companion of the sdB star has a minimum mass of 0.63 M\odot,
and is therefore most likely an unseen white dwarf.
  We analyse the near-continuous 2010-2011 Kepler light curve to reveal orbital
Doppler-beaming light variations at the 238 ppm level, which is consistent with
the observed spectroscopic orbital radial-velocity amplitude of the subdwarf.
We use the strongest 70 pulsation frequencies in the Kepler light curve of the
subdwarf as clocks to derive a third consistent measurement of the orbital
radial-velocity amplitude, from the orbital light-travel delay.
  We use our high signal-to-noise average spectra to study the atmospheric
parameters of the sdB star, deriving Teff = 27 910K and log g = 5.41 dex, and
find that carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are underabundant relative to the solar
mixture.
  Furthermore, we extract more than 160 significant frequencies from the Kepler
light curve. We investigate the pulsation frequencies for expected period
spacings and rotational splittings. We find period-spacing sequences of
spherical-harmonic degrees \ell=1 and \ell=2, and we associate a large fraction
of the g-modes in KIC11558725 with these sequences. From frequency splittings
we conclude that the subdwarf is rotating subsynchronously with respect to the
orbit.

are consistent with the present data except for the correlation Delta
M_{s,d}-epsilon_K. Motivated by the recent work of Barbieri et al, we compare
the CMFV correlations with the ones present in a special class of models with
an approximate global U(2)^3 flavour symmetry, constrained by a minimal set of
spurions governing the breakdown of this symmetry and the assumption that only
SM operators are relevant in flavour physics. This analog of CMFV to be called
MU(2)^3 allows to avoid the Delta M_{s,d}-epsilon_K tension in question because
of reduced flavour symmetry and implied non-MFV contributions to Delta M_{s,d}.
While the patterns of flavour violation in K meson system is the same as in
CMFV models, the CP-violation in B_{s,d} meson systems can deviate from the one
in the SM and CMFV models. We point out a stringent triple S_{psi K_S}-S_{psi
phi}-|V_ub| correlation in this class of models that could in the future
provide a transparent distinction between different MU(2)^3 models and in the
context of these models determine |V_ub| by means of precise measurements of
S_{psi K_S} and S_{psi phi} with only small hadronic uncertainties. For fixed
S_{psi K_S} the correlation between B(B^+ -> tau^+nu_tau) and S_{psi phi}
follows. We also find that MU(2)^3 models could in principle accommodate a
negative value of S_{psi phi}, provided |V_ub| is found to be in the ballpark
of exclusive determinations and the particular MU(2)^3 model provides a 25%
enhancement of epsilon_K. A supersymmetric U(2)^3 model worked out in the
Barbieri-School appears to satisfy these requirements. However if B(B^+ ->
tau^+nu_tau)>1.0 10^{-4} will be confirmed by future experiments only positive

the Milky Way to obtain plausible limits on the non-spherical structure of
their dark halos. This is motivated by the fact that the observed luminous
parts of the dSphs are actually non-spherical and Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models
predict non-spherical virialized dark halos. Our models consider velocity
anisotropy of stars $\bar{v^2_R} / \bar{v^2_{\phi}}$, which can vary with the
adopted cylindrical coordinates under the assumption $\bar{v^2_z}=\bar{v^2_R}$
for simplicity, and also include an inclination of the system as a fitting
parameter to explain the observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile.
Applying these models to six of the bright dSphs in the Milky Way, we find that
the best-fitting cases for most of the dSphs yield oblate and flattened dark
halos, irrespective of assumed density profiles in their central parts. We also
find that the total mass of the dSphs enclosed within a spheroid with
major-axis length of 300 pc varies from $10^6M_{\odot}$ to $10^7M_{\odot}$,
contrary to the conclusion from spherical models. This suggests the importance
of considering shapes of dark halos in mass models of the dSphs. It is also
found that dark halos of the Galactic dSphs may be more flattened than N-body
predictions, thereby implying our yet incomplete understanding of baryonic
and/or non-baryonic dark matter physics in dwarf galaxy scales.

mechanical behaviors of many biomaterials, including cells and extracellular

for normal blood clotting, protofibrils self-assemble and bundle to form
networks of semiflexible fibers. Here we show that the extraordinary
strain-stiffening response of fibrin networks is a direct reflection of the
hierarchical architecture of the fibrin fibers. We measure the rheology of
networks of unbundled protofibrils and find excellent agreement with an affine
model of extensible wormlike polymers. By direct comparison with these data, we
show that physiological fibrin networks composed of thick fibers can be modeled
as networks of tight protofibril bundles. We demonstrate that the tightness of
coupling between protofibrils in the fibers can be tuned by the degree of
enzymatic intermolecular crosslinking by the coagulation Factor XIII.
Furthermore, at high stress, the protofibrils contribute independently to the
network elasticity, which may reflect a decoupling of the tight bundle
structure. The hierarchical architecture of fibrin fibers can thus account for
the nonlinearity and enormous elastic resilience characteristic of blood clots.

of galaxies plays a fundamental role in the evaluation of the dust attenuation
of star forming galaxies especially at high redshifts. Many authors, however,
pointed out that there is a significant dispersion and/or deviation from the
originally proposed IRX-\beta relation depending on sample selection. We
reexamined the IRX-\beta relation by measuring the far- and near-UV flux
densities of the original sample galaxies with GALEX and AKARI imaging data,
and constructed a revised formula. We found that the newly obtained IRX values
were lower than the original relation because of the significant
underestimation of the UV flux densities of the galaxies, caused by the small
aperture of IUE, Further, since the original relation was based on IRAS data
which covered a wavelength range of \lambda = 42--122\mum, using the data from
AKARI which has wider wavelength coverage toward longer wavelengths, we
obtained an appropriate IRX-\beta relation with total dust emission (TIR):
\log(L_{\rm TIR}/L_{\rm FUV}) = \log [10^{0.4(3.06+1.58\beta)}-1] +0.22. This
new relation is consistent with most of the preceding results for samples
selected at optical and UV, though there is a significant scatter around it. We
also found that even the quiescent class of IR galaxies follows this new
relation, though luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies distribute completely
differently as well known before.

Centaurus A. However, the origin of the excess remains elusive. We simulate the
propagation of different species of particles coming from the direction of
Centaurus A in the Galactic magnetic fields, and find that only particles of
nuclear charge $Z\la 10$ can avoid being deflected outside of the $18^{\circ}$
window of Centaurus A. On the other hand, considering the increasingly heavy
composition of UHECRs at the highest energies measured by PAO, a plausible
scenario for cosmic rays from the direction of Centaurus A can be found if they
consist of intermediate-mass nuclei. The chemical composition of cosmic rays
can be further constrained by lower-energy cosmic rays of the same rigidity. We
find that cosmic ray acceleration in the lobes of Centaurus A is not favored,
while acceleration in the stellar winds that are rich in intermediate-mass
nuclei, could meet the requirement. This suggests that the observed excess may
originate from cosmic ray accelerators induced by stellar explosions in the
star-forming regions of Centaurus A and/or the Centaurus cluster located behind

glass formers. The interaction potential between particles is a modified
Lennard-Jones type potential, with the repulsive part of the potential varying
with an inverse power $q$ of the interparticle distance, and the attractive
part varying with an inverse power $p$. We consider the combinations (12,11)
(model I), (12,6) (model II) and (8,5) (model III) for (q,p) such that the
interaction potential becomes softer from model I to III. We evaluate the
kinetic fragilities from the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients
and relaxation times, and a thermodynamic fragility from the temperature
variation of the configuration entropy. We find that the kinetic fragility
increases with increasing softness of the potential, consistent with previous
results for these model systems, but at variance with the thermodynamic
fragility, which decreases with increasing softness of the interactions, as
well as expectations from earlier results. We rationalize our results by
considering the full form of the Adam-Gibbs relation, which requires, in
addition to the temperature dependence of the configuration entropy, knowledge
of the high temperature activation energies ino rder to determine fragility. We
show that consideration of the scaling of the high temperature activation
energy with the liquid density, analyzed in recent studies, provides a partial
rationalization of the observed behavior.

observed ten outbursts are classified into two types by the patterns of the
relative intensity evolutions in the two energy bands below/above 15 keV. One
type behaves as the 15--50 keV intensity achieves the maximum during the
initial hard-state period and drops greatly at the hard-to-soft state
transition. On the other hand, the other type does as both the 2--15 keV and
the 15--50 keV intensities achieve the maximums after the transition. The
former have the longer initial hard-state ($\gtrsim$ 9 d) than the latter's
($\ltsim$5 d). Therefore, we named them as slow-type (S-type) and fast-type
(F-type), respectively. These two types also show the differences in the
luminosity at the hard-to-soft state transition as well as in the average
luminosity before the outburst started, where the S-type are higher than the
F-type in the both. These results suggest that the X-ray radiation during the
pre-outburst period, which heats up the accretion disk and delays the disk

this infimum is not attained. We also explicitly construct a parametrized

the constructed states beat the lower bound for separable states, they are
entangled. We thus show that there is a gap that separates the values of a

in a compressed form. This allows one to make less measurements than what was
considered necessary to record a signal, enabling faster or more precise
measurement protocols in a wide range of applications. Using an
interdisciplinary approach, we have recently proposed in [arXiv:1109.4424] a
strategy that allows compressed sensing to be performed at acquisition rates
approaching to the theoretical optimal limits. In this paper, we give a more
thorough presentation of our approach, and introduce many new results. We
present the probabilistic approach to reconstruction and discuss its optimality
and robustness. We detail the derivation of the message passing algorithm for
reconstruction and expectation max- imization learning of signal-model
parameters. We further develop the asymptotic analysis of the corresponding
phase diagrams with and without measurement noise, for different distribution
of signals, and discuss the best possible reconstruction performances
regardless of the algorithm. We also present new efficient seeding matrices,
test them on synthetic data and analyze their performance asymptotically.

constrain stellar radii and magnetic fields, often finding values that are
consistent with independent timing techniques. Here, we compare CCD-based data
from Suzaku with Fe K line profiles from archival data taken with gas-based
spectrometers. In general, we find good consistency between the gas-based line
profiles from EXOSAT, BeppoSAX and RXTE and the CCD data from Suzaku,
demonstrating that the broad profiles seen are intrinsic to the line and not
broad due to instrumental issues. However, we do find that when fitting with a
Gaussian line profile, the width of the Gaussian can depend on the continuum
model in instruments with low spectral resolution, though when the different
models fit equally well the line widths generally agree. We also demonstrate
that three BeppoSAX observations show evidence for asymmetric lines, with a
relativistic disk-line model providing a significantly better fit than a
Gaussian. We test this by using the posterior predictive p-value method, and
bootstrapping of the spectra to show that such deviations from a Gaussian are
unlikely to be observed by chance.

discussed and studied. When dealing with coupled dynamical systems, links among
units of the system are commonly quantified by a measure of pairwise
statistical dependence of observed time series (functional connectivity). We
argue that the functional connectivity approach leads to upwardly biased
estimates of small-world characteristics (with respect to commonly used random
graph models) due to partial transitivity of the accepted functional
connectivity measures such as the correlation coefficient. In particular, this
may lead to observation of small-world characteristics in connectivity graphs
estimated from generic randomly connected dynamical systems. The ubiquity and
robustness of the phenomenon is documented by an extensive parameter study of
its manifestation in a multivariate linear autoregressive process, with
discussion of the potential relevance for nonlinear processes and measures.

frog model, including feedback due to the gap's motion, and drag associated
with the Lindblad disk torques that cause Type I migration. Because the moonlet
creates the gap, we expect the gap centroid to track the moonlet, but only
after a time delay t_diff, the time for a ring particle to travel from
conjunction with the moonlet to the end of the gap. We find that frog
librations can persist only if t_diff exceeds the frog libration period P_lib,
and if damping from Lindblad torques balances driving from co-orbital torques.
If t_diff << P_lib, then the libration amplitude damps to zero. In the case of
Bl\'eriot, the frog resonance model can reproduce the observed libration period
P_lib ~ 4 yr. However, our simple feedback prescription suggests that
Bl\'eriot's t_diff ~ 0.01P_lib, which is inconsistent with the observed

related. This can lead to negative transfer when tasks are indeed incoherent.
Recently, a number of approaches have been proposed that alleviate this problem
by discovering the underlying task clusters or relationships. However, they are
limited to modeling these relationships at the task level, which may be
restrictive in some applications. In this paper, we propose a novel MTL
formulation that captures task relationships at the feature-level. Depending on
the interactions among tasks and features, the proposed method construct
different task clusters for different features, without even the need of
pre-specifying the number of clusters. Computationally, the proposed
formulation is strongly convex, and can be efficiently solved by accelerated
proximal methods. Experiments are performed on a number of synthetic and
real-world data sets. Under various degrees of task relationships, the accuracy
of the proposed method is consistently among the best. Moreover, the
feature-specific task clusters obtained agree with the known/plausible task
structures of the data.

however, it is desirable to automatically discover the groups of related tasks
that share a feature space. In this paper we aim at searching the exponentially
large space of all possible groups of tasks that may share a feature space. The
main contribution is a convex formulation that employs a graph-based
regularizer and simultaneously discovers few groups of related tasks, having
close-by task parameters, as well as the feature space shared within each

leading to an efficient algorithm for solving it: if there is no feature space

exist such a feature space for any of its supersets. An efficient active set
algorithm that exploits this simplification and performs a clever search in the

learning and AI communities recently. Empirical evidences show that stock's
high and low prices are temporary and stock price relatives are likely to

strategies are shown to achieve good empirical performance on many real
datasets, they often make the single-period mean reversion assumption, which is
not always satisfied in some real datasets, leading to poor performance when
the assumption does not hold. To overcome the limitation, this article proposes
a multiple-period mean reversion, or so-called Moving Average Reversion (MAR),
and a new on-line portfolio selection strategy named ""On-Line Moving Average
Reversion"" (OLMAR), which exploits MAR by applying powerful online learning
techniques. From our empirical results, we found that OLMAR can overcome the
drawback of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly better
results, especially on the datasets where the existing mean reversion
algorithms failed. In addition to superior trading performance, OLMAR also runs
extremely fast, further supporting its practical applicability to a wide range
of applications.

data, it appears self-evident that having multiple observations would be better
than having just one. However, it turns out that the inconsistencies introduced
when different graph instances have different edge sets pose a serious
challenge. In this work we address this challenge for the problem of finding
maximum weighted cliques.
  We introduce the concept of most persistent soft-clique. This is subset of
vertices, that 1) is almost fully or at least densely connected, 2) occurs in
all or almost all graph instances, and 3) has the maximum weight. We present a
measure of clique-ness, that essentially counts the number of edge missing to
make a subset of vertices into a clique. With this measure, we show that the
problem of finding the most persistent soft-clique problem can be cast either
as: a) a max-min two person game optimization problem, or b) a min-min soft
margin optimization problem. Both formulations lead to the same solution when
using a partial Lagrangian method to solve the optimization problems. By
experiments on synthetic data and on real social network data, we show that the
proposed method is able to reliably find soft cliques in graph data, even if
that is distorted by random noise or unreliable observations.

comprise, based on the observation of a fraction of the global email spam
traffic. Observed mailing campaigns constitute evidence for joint botnet
membership, they are represented by cliques in the graph of all messages. No
evidence against an association of nodes is ever available. We reduce the
problem of identifying botnets to a problem of finding a minimal clustering of
the graph of messages. We directly model the distribution of clusterings given
the input graph; this avoids potential errors caused by distributional
assumptions of a generative model. We report on a case study in which we
evaluate the model by its ability to predict the spam campaign that a given IP
address is going to participate in.

remarkable progress in the past decade. However, most approximation approaches
in this direction are still restricted to matrix factorization. We propose a
new low-rank learning method to improve the clustering performance, which is
beyond matrix factorization. The approximation is based on a two-step bipartite
random walk through virtual cluster nodes, where the approximation is formed by
only cluster assigning probabilities. Minimizing the approximation error
measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence is equivalent to maximizing the
likelihood of a discriminative model, which endows our method with a solid
probabilistic interpretation. The optimization is implemented by a relaxed
Majorization-Minimization algorithm that is advantageous in finding good local
minima. Furthermore, we point out that the regularized algorithm with Dirichlet
prior only serves as initialization. Experimental results show that the new
method has strong performance in clustering purity for various datasets,
especially for large-scale manifold data.

However, learning the class ratio of the test dataset is challenging when no

For Support-vector regression, we require exponentially less attributes

mixture models, FAB for HMMs is derived as an iterative lower bound
maximization algorithm of a factorized information criterion (FIC). It
inherits, from FAB for mixture models, several desirable properties for
learning HMMs, such as asymptotic consistency of FIC with marginal
log-likelihood, a shrinkage effect for hidden state selection, monotonic
increase of the lower FIC bound through the iterative optimization. Further, it
does not have a tunable hyper-parameter, and thus its model selection process
can be fully automated. Experimental results shows that FAB outperforms
states-of-the-art variational Bayesian HMM and non-parametric Bayesian HMM in
terms of model selection accuracy and computational efficiency.

whether adding a new feature to the data representation can improve predictive

evaluating every potential feature by re-training the predictor with it can be
costly. The paper describes an efficient, learner-independent technique for
estimating new feature utility without re-training based on the current
predictor's outputs. The method is obtained by deriving a connection between
loss reduction potential and the new feature's correlation with the loss
gradient of the current predictor. This leads to a simple yet powerful
hypothesis testing procedure, for which we prove consistency. Our theoretical
analysis is accompanied by empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks and a
large-scale industrial dataset.

the marginal variables. This is important in many applications, for example in
feature selection. The estimator is consistent, robust to outliers, and uses
rank statistics only. We derive upper bounds on the convergence rate and
propose independence tests too. We illustrate the theoretical contributions

new representations for domain adaptation. Recently, they have attained record
accuracy on standard benchmark tasks of sentiment analysis across different
text domains. SDAs learn robust data representations by reconstruction,
recovering original features from data that are artificially corrupted with
noise. In this paper, we propose marginalized SDA (mSDA) that addresses two
crucial limitations of SDAs: high computational cost and lack of scalability to
high-dimensional features. In contrast to SDAs, our approach of mSDA
marginalizes noise and thus does not require stochastic gradient descent or
other optimization algorithms to learn parameters ? in fact, they are computed
in closed-form. Consequently, mSDA, which can be implemented in only 20 lines
of MATLAB^{TM}, significantly speeds up SDAs by two orders of magnitude.
Furthermore, the representations learnt by mSDA are as effective as the
traditional SDAs, attaining almost identical accuracies in benchmark tasks.
