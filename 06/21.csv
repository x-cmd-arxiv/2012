certain boundary value problems for the Laplace equation in terms of a single
integral involving the given boundary data. We show that such explicit formulae
can be used to obtain novel identities for special functions. A convenient tool
for deriving this type of identities is the so-called \emph{global relation},
which has appeared recently in a wide range of boundary value problems. As a
concrete application, we analyze the Neumann boundary value problem for the
Laplace equation in the exterior of the so-called Hankel contour, which is the
contour that appears in the definition of both the gamma and the Riemann zeta
functions. By utilizing the explicit solution of this problem, we derive a
plethora of novel identities involving the hypergeometric function.

spatial resolution (~100 km) in polarized light by the IMaX spectropolarimeter
onboard the Sunrise balloon. We identify 497 small-scale (~400 km) magnetic
loops, appearing at an effective rate of 0.25 loop h^{-1} arcsec^{-2}; further,
we argue that this number and rate are underestimated by ~30%. However, we find
that these small dipoles do not appear uniformly on the solar surface: their
spatial distribution is rather filamentary and clumpy, creating dead calm
areas, characterized by a very low magnetic signal and a lack of organized
loop-like structures at the detection level of our instruments, that cannot be
explained as just statistical fluctuations of a Poisson spatial process. We
argue that this is an intrinsic characteristic of the mechanism that generates
the magnetic fields in the very quiet Sun. The spatio-temporal coherences and
the clumpy structure of the phenomenon suggest a recurrent, intermittent

we specify a translation from PCF to the untyped lambda calculus which is
faithful with respect to reduction in the source and target languages.

that positive alphas are illusionary. Specifically, we show that the critical
assumption used in Jarrow (2010, pg. 20), to derive the illusionary alpha
result, is based on a zero set for CAPM with Lebesgue measure zero. So
conclusions based on that assumption may well have probability measure zero of
occurrence as well. Technically, the existence of [Tanaka] local time on a zero
set for CAPM implies existence of positive alphas. In fact, we show that
positive alpha exists under the same scenarios of ""perpetual event swap"" and
""market systemic event"" Jarrow (2010) used to formulate the illusionary
positive alpha result. First, we prove that as long as asset price volatility
is greater than zero, systemic events like market crash will occur in finite
time almost surely. Thus creating an opportunity to hedge against that event.
Second, we find that Jarrow's ""false positive alpha"" variable constitutes
portfolio manager reward for trading strategy. For instance, we show that
positive alpha exists if portfolio managers develop hedging strategies based on
either (1) an exotic [barrier] option on the underlying asset - with barrier
hitting time motivated by the ""market systemic"" event, or (2) a swaption
strategy for the implied interest rate risk inherent in Jarrow's triumvirate of

2007 by Jouko V\""a\""aan\""anen as an extension of first-order (resp. modal)
logic by the dependence operator =(). For first-order (resp. propositional)
variables x_1,...,x_n, =(x_1,...,x_n) intuitively states that the value of x_n
is determined by those of x_1,...,x_n-1.
  We consider fragments of modal dependence logic obtained by restricting the
set of allowed modal and propositional connectives. We classify these fragments
with respect to the complexity of their satisfiability and model-checking
problems. For satisfiability we obtain complexity degrees from P over NP,
Sigma_P^2 and PSPACE up to NEXP, while for model-checking we only classify the
fragments with respect to their tractability, i.e. we either show
NP-completeness or containment in P.
  We then study the extension of modal dependence logic by intuitionistic
implication. For this extension we again classify the complexity of the
model-checking problem for its fragments. Here we obtain complexity degrees
from P over NP and coNP up to PSPACE.
  Finally, we analyze first-order dependence logic, independence-friendly logic
and their two-variable fragments. We prove that satisfiability for two-variable
dependence logic is NEXP-complete, whereas for two-variable
independence-friendly logic it is undecidable; and use this to prove that the
latter is also more expressive than the former.

star, 6 are c-type RR Lyrae, and 2 are long-period/semi-regular variables. V22,
previously classified as a type II Cepheid, appears as a bona-fide RRc in our

properly phased with any reasonable period. The properties of the ab-type RR
Lyrae stars in M28 appear most consistent with an Oosterhoff-intermediate
classification, which is unusual for bona-fide Galactic globulars clusters.
However, the cluster's c-type variables do not clearly support such an
Oosterhoff type, and a hybrid Oosterhoff I/II system is accordingly another
possibility, thus raising the intriguing possibility of multiple populations
being present in M28. Coordinates, periods, and light curves in differential

ten million times energies accessible to human-made particle accelerators.
Evidence suggests that they originate from relatively nearby extragalactic
sources, but the nature of the sources is unknown. We develop a multilevel
Bayesian framework for assessing association of UHECRs and candidate source
populations, and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for estimating model
parameters and comparing models by computing, via Chib's method, marginal
likelihoods and Bayes factors. We demonstrate the framework by analyzing
measurements of 69 UHECRs observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) from
2004-2009, using a volume-complete catalog of 17 local active galactic nuclei
(AGN) out to 15 megaparsecs as candidate sources. An early portion of the data
(""period 1,"" with 14 events) was used by PAO to set an energy cut maximizing
the anisotropy in period 1; the 69 measurements include this ""tuned"" subset,
and subsequent ""untuned"" events with energies above the same cutoff. Also,
measurement errors are approximately summarized. These factors are problematic
for independent analyses of PAO data. Within the context of ""standard candle""
source models (i.e., with a common isotropic emission rate), and considering
only the 55 untuned events, there is no significant evidence favoring
association of UHECRs with local AGN vs. an isotropic background. The
highest-probability associations are with the two nearest, adjacent AGN,
Centaurus A and NGC 4945. If the association model is adopted, the fraction of
UHECRs that may be associated is likely nonzero but is well below 50%. Our
framework enables estimation of the angular scale for deflection of cosmic rays
by cosmic magnetic fields; relatively modest scales of $\approx\!3^{\circ}$ to
$30^{\circ}$ are favored. Models that assign a large fraction of UHECRs to a
single nearby source (e.g., Centaurus A) are ruled out unless very large
deflection scales are specified a priori, and even then they are disfavored.
However, including the period 1 data alters the conclusions significantly, and
a simulation study supports the idea that the period 1 data are anomalous,
presumably due to the tuning. Accurate and optimal analysis of future data will
likely require more complete disclosure of the data.

and compared to classic Bondi accretion. Radiation losses are essential for
accretion flows to be observed. Unlike Bondi flows, radiating Bondi flows pass
through a sonic point at a finite radius and become supersonic near the center.
The morphology of all radiating Bondi flows is described by a single
dimensionless parameter. In radiating Bondi flows the mass accretion rate
varies approximately as the first power of the central mass -- this differs
significantly from the quadratic dependence on the central mass in classical
Bondi flows. Mass accretion rates onto galaxy or cluster-centered black holes
estimated from traditional and radiating Bondi flows are significantly
different. In radiating Bondi flows the gas temperature increases at large
radii, as in the cores of many galaxy groups and clusters, allowing radiating
Bondi flows to merge naturally with gas arriving from their cluster
environments. Some radiating flows cool completely before reaching the center
of the flow, and this also occurs in cooling site flows in which there is no
central gravitating mass.

model for a single dust belt including a phase function with two components and

some of the surface brightness profile's shape (e.g. the overall ""wavy""

between the SW disk brightness peak and disk's peak mm emission is consistent
with an overdensity of very small, sub-blowout-sized dust and large, 0.1-1

accounting for ~4.5% of the sample of initial conditions studied, corresponds
to planetary orbits that do not show large scale orbital instabilities on the
timescale of our integrations (~200 million years). The long-lived subset of
the allowed initial conditions are those that satisfy the Hill stability
criterion by the largest margin. Any successful theory for the formation of
this system will need to account for why its current state is so close to
unstable regions of phase space.

suggests the spacetime background at the Planck scale may be effectively
two-dimensional, while the latter implies a condition of maximal compression of
matter by the formation of an event horizon for Planckian scattering. We
generalize such a result to an arbitrary number of dimensions, and show that
gravity in higher than four dimensions remains self-complete, but in lower
dimensions it is not. In such a way we established an ""exclusive disjunction""
or ""exclusive or"" (XOR) between the occurrence of self-completeness and
dimensional reduction, with the goal of actually reducing the unknowns for the
scenario of the physics at the Planck scale. Potential phenomenological
implications of this result are considered by studying the case of a
two-dimensional dilaton gravity model resulting from dimensional reduction of
Einstein gravity.

  Since it is difficult to explain 3) via any known physical processes that

after explosion by a stronger ionizing flux on the side of the ejecta where
ignition occurs, probably due to a stronger shock breakout and/or more exposed
radioactive material on one side of the ejecta. This result has important
implications for both progenitor and explosion models.

many clouds with very weak magnetic fields, and the observed scaling $B \propto

We consider the problem of magnetic field evolution in turbulent molecular
clouds and discuss the process of magnetic field diffusion mediated by magnetic
reconnection. For this process that we termed ""reconnection diffusion"" we
provide a simple physical model and explain that this process is inevitable in
view of the present day understanding of MHD turbulence. We address the issue
of the expected magnetization of cores and envelopes in the process of star
formation and show that reconnection diffusion provides an efficient removal of
magnetic flux that depends only on the properties of MHD turbulence in the core
and the envelope. As a result, the magnetic flux trapped during the collapse in
the envelope is being released faster than the flux trapped in the core,
resulting in much weaker fields in envelopes than in cores, as observed. We
provide simple semi-analytical model calculations which support this conclusion
and qualitatively agree with the observational results. We argue that magnetic
reconnection provides a solution to the magnetic flux problem of star formation

Millimeter Array. In addition to their diagnostic power, another advantage of
this combination is the similar observed frequencies (Delta nu_0 ~ 30 GHz) of
the lines, resulting in nearly spatially-matched beams for a fixed aperture,
thus mitigating the effects of resolution/morphology bias in the interpretation
of galaxy-averaged line ratios. Finally we discuss the capability of deep blind
redshift surveys with the high frequency component of the Square Kilometer
Arrray (SKA) in discovering H_2-rich galaxies with very low xi_SF values. These
could be the progenitors of starburst galaxies seen prior to the onset of star
formation; such galaxies could be a class of extreme outliers from local (gas
surface density)-(star formation rate) scaling laws, which would exclude them
from current star formatation or stellar mass selected samples. Our
conservative model suggests that SKA could detect such systems residing at z~3
at a rate of 20-200 per hour.

supersonic flows display enhanced hierarchical structure. We observed a strong
sonic and Alfvenic dependency when we apply the the statistical moments (i.e.
mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) to the dendrogram distribution. Larger
magnetic field and sonic Mach number correspond to larger values of the
moments. Application of the dendrogram to 3D density cubes, also known as
Position-Position-Position cubes (PPP), reveals that the dominant emission
contours in PPP and PPV are related for supersonic gas but not for subsonic. We
also explore the effects of smoothing, thermal broadening and velocity

Non-perturbative features of random subsystems maintain and preserve the

time set). If an asynchronous system is defined by making use of a so called
generator function {\Phi}:{0,1}^{n}{\to}{0,1}^{n}, then it is called regular.
The property of universality means the greatest in the sense of the inclusion.
The purpose of the paper is that of defining and of characterizing the fixed
points, the equivalencies and the dynamical bifurcations of the universal
regular autonomous asynchronous systems. We use analogies with the dynamical
systems theory.

pertains to weak measurements. To accomplish this, we use the transverse
position of a beam as the detector for the conditioned von Neumann measurement
of a system observable. For any coupling strength, any initial states, and any
choice of conditioning, the averages of the detector position and momentum are
completely described by the real parts of three generalized weak values in the
joint Hilbert space. Higher-order detector moments also have similar weak value
expansions. Using the Wigner distribution of the initial detector state, we
find compact expressions for these weak values within the reduced system
Hilbert space. As an application of the approach, we show that for any
Hermite-Gauss mode of a paraxial beam-like detector these expressions reduce to
the real and imaginary parts of a single system weak value plus an additional
weak-value-like contribution that only affects the momentum shift.

potentially habitable exoplanets, there is an urgent need to find examples of
such planets transiting nearby M dwarfs. The MEarth Project is an ongoing
effort to do so, as a ground-based photometric survey designed to detect
exoplanets as small as 2 Earth radii transiting mid-to-late M dwarfs within 33
pc of the Sun. Unfortunately, identifying transits of such planets in
photometric monitoring is complicated both by the intrinsic stellar variability
that is common among these stars and by the nocturnal cadence, atmospheric
variations, and instrumental systematics that often plague Earth-bound
observatories. Here we summarize the properties of MEarth data gathered so far,
and we present a new framework to detect shallow exoplanet transits in wiggly
and irregularly-spaced light curves. In contrast to previous methods that clean
trends from light curves before searching for transits, this framework assesses
the significance of individual transits simultaneously while modeling
variability, systematics, and the photometric quality of individual nights. Our
Method for Including Starspots and Systematics in the Marginalized Probability
of a Lone Eclipse (MISS MarPLE) uses a computationally efficient semi-Bayesian
approach to explore the vast probability space spanned by the many parameters
of this model, naturally incorporating the uncertainties in these parameters
into its evaluation of candidate events. We show how to combine individual
transits processed by MISS MarPLE into periodic transiting planet candidates
and compare our results to the popular Box-fitting Least Squares (BLS) method
with simulations. By applying MISS MarPLE to observations from the MEarth
Project, we demonstrate the utility of this framework for robustly assessing
the false alarm probability of transit signals in real data. [slightly

diffuse gamma-ray background (DGRB) and the DGRB spectral intensity, and their
potential origin from the unresolved blazar population. Using a
physical-evolution model for blazars with a luminosity dependent evolution
(LDDE) and an observationally-determined luminosity-dependent blazar spectral
energy distribution (SED), we find that blazars can account for the observed
anisotropy of the DGRB consistent with their observed source-count
distribution, but are in turn constrained in contributing significantly to the
observed DGRB intensity. For the best-fit LDDE model accounting for the DGRB
anisotropy and source-count distribution, blazars only contribute
5.7^{+2.1}_{-1.0}% (68% CL) of the DGRB intensity above 1 GeV. Requiring a
higher fraction of the DGRB intensity contribution by blazars overproduces the
DGRB anisotropy, and therefore blazars in the LDDE+SED-sequence model cannot
simultaneously account for the DGRB intensity as well as anisotropy. We discuss
the limitations of LDDE models. However, these models do not require the many
unjustified and observationally-inconsistent simplifying
assumptions---including a single power law for all blazar spectra and a simple
broken power-law model for their source-count distribution---that are present
in much previous work.

clusters is thought to be contained within the diffuse intracluster light
(ICL), which extends 100s of kpc from cluster cores. The study of the ICL can
reveal details of the evolutionary histories and processes occurring within
galaxy clusters, however since it has a very low surface brightness it is often
difficult to detect. We present here the first measurements of the ICL as a
fraction of total cluster light at z \sim 1 using deep J-band (1.2 {\mu}m)
imaging from HAWK-I on the VLT. We investigate the ICL in 6 X-ray selected
galaxy clusters at 0.8< z <1.2 and find that the ICL below isophotes {\mu}(J) =
22 mag/arcsec2 constitutes 1-4% of the total cluster light within a radius
R500. This is broadly consistent with simulations of the ICL at a similar
redshift and when compared to nearby observations suggests that the fraction of
the total cluster light that is in the ICL has increased by a factor 2 - 4
since z\sim1. We also find the fraction of the total cluster light contained
within the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) to be 2.0-6.3% at these redshifts,
which in 5 out of 6 cases is larger than the fraction of the ICL component, in
contrast to results from nearby clusters. This suggests that the evolution in
cluster cores involves substantial stripping activity at late times, in
addition to the early build up of the BCG stellar mass through merging. The
presence of significant amounts of stellar light at large radii from these BCGs
may help towards solving the recent disagreement between the semi-analytic
model predictions of BCG mass growth (e.g. De Lucia & Blaziot, 2007) and the
observed large masses and scale sizes reported for BCGs at high redshift.

hallmark of populations that have experienced recent genetic drift. Detection
of these IBD segments has recently become feasible, enabling a wide range of
applications from phasing and imputation to demographic inference. Here, we
study the distribution of IBD sharing in the Wright-Fisher model. Specifically,
using coalescent theory, we calculate the variance of the total sharing between
random pairs of individuals. We then investigate the cohort-averaged sharing:
the average total sharing between one individual and the rest of the cohort. We
find that for large cohorts, the cohort-averaged sharing is distributed
approximately normally. Surprisingly, the variance of this distribution does
not vanish even for large cohorts, implying the existence of ""hyper-sharing""
individuals. The presence of such individuals has consequences for the design
of sequencing studies, since, if they are selected for whole-genome sequencing,
a larger fraction of the cohort can be subsequently imputed. We calculate the
expected gain in power of imputation by IBD, and subsequently, in power to
detect an association, when individuals are either randomly selected or
specifically chosen to be the hyper-sharing individuals. Using our framework,
we also compute the variance of an estimator of the population size that is
based on the mean IBD sharing and the variance in the sharing between inbred
siblings. Finally, we study IBD sharing in an admixture pulse model, and show
that in the Ashkenazi Jewish population the admixture fraction is correlated
with the cohort-averaged sharing.

a two-dimensional vector space. This representation yields perhaps the simplest
nontrivial example of a prehomogeneous vector space that is not irreducible,
and of a coregular space whose underlying group is not semisimple. We show that
the nondegenerate integer orbits of this representation are in natural
bijection with orders in cubic fields having a fixed ""lattice shape"". Moreover,
this correspondence is discriminant-preserving: the value of the invariant
polynomial of an element in this representation agrees with the discriminant of
the corresponding cubic order.
  We use this interpretation of the integral orbits to solve three
classical-style counting problems related to cubic orders and fields. First, we
give an asymptotic formula for the number of cubic orders having bounded
discriminant and nontrivial automorphism group. More generally, we give an
asymptotic formula for the number of cubic orders that have bounded
discriminant and any given lattice shape (i.e., reduced trace form, up to
scaling). Via a sieve, we also count cubic fields of bounded discriminant whose
rings of integers have a given lattice shape. We find, in particular, that
among cubic orders (resp. fields) having lattice shape of given discriminant
$D$, the shape is equidistributed in the class group $\mathrm{Cl}_D$ of binary
quadratic forms of discriminant $D$. As a by-product, we also obtain an
asymptotic formula for the number of cubic fields of bounded discriminant
having any given quadratic resolvent field.

cache coherence in shared-memory parallel systems comprising multi/many cores,
where each store instruction is eagerly made globally visible by invalidating
the private cache (PC) backups of other cores. Consequently, the directory not
only consumes large chip area, but also incurs considerable energy consumption
and performance degradation, due to the large number of Invalidation/Ack
messages transferred in the interconnection network and resulting network
congestion. In this paper, we reveal the interesting fact that the directory is
actually an unnecessary luxury for practical parallel systems. Because of
widely deployed software/hardware techniques involving instruction reordering,
most (if not all) parallel systems work under the weak consistency model, where
a remote store instruction is allowed to be invisible to a core before the next
synchronization of the core, instead of being made visible eagerly by
invalidating PC backups of other cores. Based on this key observation, we
propose a lightweight novel scheme called {\em DLS (DirectoryLess Shared
last-level cache)}, which completely removes the directory and Invalidation/Ack
messages, and efficiently maintains cache coherence using a novel {\em
self-suspicion + speculative execution} mechanism. Experimental results over
SPLASH-2 benchmarks show that on a 16-core processor, DLS not only completely
removes the chip area cost of the directory, but also improves processor

value for the smallest mixing angle ($\theta_z$), we derive and find explicit
realizations of the $(Z_2)^3$ flavor symmetry which characterizes, for the
neutrino mass matrix, uniquely a variant of the tripartite form, originally
conceived to lead to the tri-bimaximal mixing with $\theta_z=0$, so that to
allow now for a non-tri-bimaximal pattern with non-zero $\theta_z$. We impose
this flavor symmetry in a setting including the charged leptons and we see that
it can make room, through higher order terms involving new SM-singlet scalars,
for the mass hierarchy of charged leptons. Moreover, within type-I seesaw
mechanism augmented with the flavor symmetry, certain patterns occurring in
both the Dirac and the Majorana neutrino mass matrices can accommodate all
types of mass hierarchies in the effective neutrino mass matrix, but no
lepton/baryon asymmetry can be generated. Finally, we discuss how type-II
seesaw mechanism, when supplemented with the flavor symmetry, could be used to
interpret the observed baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis.

the method is that it works in d=4 dimensions only and it cannot be used for
calculation of amplitudes in field theory in which we are required to put all
the incoming and outgoing momenta on shell. We generalize the
Belokurov-Usyukina loop reduction technique to non-integer d=4-2e dimensions.
In this paper we show how a two-loop triangle diagram with particular values of

combination of three one-loop scalar diagrams. It is known that any one-loop
massless momentum integral can be presented in terms of Appell's function F_4.
This means that particular diagram considered in the present paper can be
represented in terms of Appell's function F_4 too. Such a generalization of

by this method exactly without decomposition in terms of the parameter e.

is a popular method for computing maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) in
problems with missing data. Each iteration of the al- gorithm formally consists
of an E-step: evaluate the expected complete-data log-likelihood given the
observed data, with expectation taken at current pa- rameter estimate; and an
M-step: maximize the resulting expression to find the updated estimate.
Conditions that guarantee convergence of the EM se- quence to a unique MLE were
found by Boyles (1983) and Wu (1983). In complicated models for
high-dimensional data, it is common to encounter an intractable integral in the
E-step. The Monte Carlo EM algorithm of Wei and Tanner (1990) works around this
difficulty by maximizing instead a Monte Carlo approximation to the appropriate
conditional expectation. Convergence properties of Monte Carlo EM have been
studied, most notably, by Chan and Ledolter (1995) and Fort and Moulines
(2003). The goal of this review paper is to provide an accessible but rigorous
in- troduction to the convergence properties of EM and Monte Carlo EM. No
previous knowledge of the EM algorithm is assumed. We demonstrate the im-
plementation of EM and Monte Carlo EM in two simple but realistic examples. We
show that if the EM algorithm converges it converges to a stationary point of
the likelihood, and that the rate of convergence is linear at best. For Monte
Carlo EM we present a readable proof of the main result of Chan and Ledolter
(1995), and state without proof the conclusions of Fort and Moulines (2003). An
important practical implication of Fort and Moulines's (2003) result relates to
the determination of Monte Carlo sample sizes in MCEM; we provide a brief
review of the literature (Booth and Hobert, 1999; Caffo, Jank and Jones, 2005)

that are not simultaneous. In such auctions, future opportunities affect
strategic considerations of the players. The goal of this paper is to develop a
quantitative understanding of outcomes of such sequential auctions. In earlier
work (Paes Leme et al. 2012) we initiated the study of the price of anarchy in
sequential auctions. We considered sequential first price auctions in the full
information model, where players are aware of all future opportunities, as well
as the valuation of all players. In this paper, we study efficiency in
sequential auctions in the Bayesian environment, relaxing the informational
assumption on the players. We focus on two environments, both studied in the
full information model in Paes Leme et al. 2012, matching markets and matroid
auctions. In the full information environment, a sequential first price cut
auction for matroid settings is efficient. In Bayesian environments this is no
longer the case, as we show using a simple example with three players. Our main
result is a bound of $1+\frac{e}{e-1}\approx 2.58$ on the price of anarchy in
both matroid auctions and single-value matching markets (even with correlated
types) and a bound of $2\frac{e}{e-1}\approx 3.16$ for general matching markets
with independent types. To bound the price of anarchy we need to consider
possible deviations at an equilibrium. In a sequential Bayesian environment the
effect of deviations is more complex than in one-shot games; early bids allow
others to infer information about the player's value. We create effective
deviations despite the presence of this difficulty by introducing a bluffing
technique of independent interest.

one can determine the geometric quotient $V//G = Spec(Sym(V^*))^G$ and can

The structure of a network characterizes the interactions among elements of the
system, and facilitates the study of many dynamical processes taking place on
it. In previous investigations, the topological infrastructure underlying
dynamical systems is simplified as a static and invariable skeleton. However,
this assumption cannot cover the temporal features of many time-evolution
networks, whose components are evolving and mutating. In this letter, utilizing
the log data of WiFi users in a Chinese university campus, we infuse the
temporal dimension into the construction of dynamical human contact network. By
quantitative comparison with the traditional aggregation approach, we find that
the temporal contact network differs in many features, e.g., the reachability,
the path length distribution. We conclude that the correlation between temporal
path length and duration is not only determined by their definitions, but also
influenced by the microdynamical features of human activities under certain
social circumstance as well. The time order of individuals' interaction events
plays a critical role in understanding many dynamical processes via human close
proximity interactions studied in this letter. Besides, our study also provides
a promising measure to identify the potential superspreaders by distinguishing
the nodes functioning as the relay hub.

any thermodynamic system cannot be isolated from the rest of the universe. We
then discuss how these two make the dynamics of thermodynamics systems very
weakly irreversible at the classical and quantum level. Since time-reversal is
no longer a symmetry of realistic systems, the problem of how macroscopic
irreversibility arises from microscopic reversibility becomes irrelevant
becomes there is no longer microscopic reversibility. At the classical level of
thermodynamics system, we show that the H Theorem of Boltzmann is still valid
even without microscopic reversibility. We do this by deriving a modified H
Theorem, which still shows entropy monotonically increasing. At the quantum
level, we show the the effect of CP violation, small irreversible changes on
the internal states of the nuclear and atomic energy levels of thermodynamic
systems. Thus, we remove Loschmidts's objection to Boltzmann's ideas.

problem - Phys. Rev. D82 (2010) 044006. We further elaborate on our proposal
discussing also some new results. The basic ingredients of the model are A) a
chameleonic string dilaton parametrizing the amount of scale symmetry of the
problem in the Einstein frame; B) a dual nature of the concept of particle
where a splitting in local and global components is introduced (for every local
particle a corresponding global particle is present in the theory). In this
paper we proceed stepwise: 1) we point out that the value of the chameleonic
dilaton in the Einstein frame parametrizes also the string length and, in
particular, the string mass is an increasing function of the matter density; 2)
the concept of global particle is clarified (indeed global particles are simply
cosmic strings); 3) in the last quantization step, in the Feynman diagrams of
our model, the UV cut-off (which is chosen to be the string mass) is a function
of the chameleonic dilaton (naturally this stringy regularization is fully
compatible with the chameleonic scale invariance of the model); 4) we show that
a large number of particle species might be useful to keep locally under
control the dangerous variations of the fundamental constants, however, more
research efforts are necessary to make this point clear; 5) the chameleonic
behaviour of matter fields and of the de Broglie wavelength of local matter
particles is pointed out; 6) we briefly touch upon some ideas (which are still
waiting for a full confirmation) regarding a potential connection between the
shortest length scale of nature and the cosmological constant. A detailed
phenomenological analysis of the entire model is required to test these ideas.

both sign combinations lead to the same permittivity and permeability, and are

orders. If at a given moment in time, the buyer is unable to complete his
entire order due to the shortage of sell orders at the required limit price,
the unmatched part of the order is recorded in the order book. Subsequently
these buy unmatched orders may be matched with new incoming sell orders. The
resulting demand curve constitutes the sole input to our model. The clearing
price is then mechanically calculated using the market clearing condition. We
use a Brownian sheet to model the demand curve, and provide some theoretical
assumptions under which such a model is justified.
  Our main result is the proof that if there exists a unique equivalent
martingale measure for the clearing price, then under some mild assumptions
there is no arbitrage. We use the Ito- Wentzell formula to obtain that result,
and also to characterize the dynamics of the demand curve and of the clearing
price in the equivalent measure. We find that the volatility of the clearing
price is (up to a stochastic factor) inversely proportional to the sum of buy
and sell order flow density (evaluated at the clearing price), which confirms
the intuition that volatility is inversely proportional to volume. We also
demonstrate that our approach is implementable. We use real order book data and
simulate option prices under a particularly simple parameterization of our
model.
  The no-arbitrage conditions we obtain are applicable to a wide class of
models, in the same way that the Heath-Jarrow-Morton conditions apply to a wide
class of interest rate models.

(""Dealing with inventory risk"", Preprint 2011) to the case of a rather general
class of mid-price processes, under either exponential or linear PNL utility
functions, and we add an inventory-risk-aversion parameter that penalises the
marker-maker if she finishes her day with a non-zero inventory. This general,
non-martingale framework allows a market-maker to make directional bets on
market trends whilst keeping under control her inventory risk. In order to
achieve this, the marker-maker places non-symmetric limit orders that favour
market orders to hit her bid (resp. ask) quotes if she expects that prices will
go up (resp. down).
  With this inventory-risk-aversion parameter, the market-maker has not only
direct control on her inventory risk but she also has indirect control on the
moments of her PNL distribution. Therefore, this parameter can be seen as a
fine-tuning of the marker-maker's risk-reward profile.
  In the case of a mean-reverting mid-price, we show numerically that the
inventory-risk-aversion parameter gives the market-maker enough room to tailor
her risk-reward profile, depending on her risk budgets in inventory and PNL
distribution (especially variance, skewness, kurtosis and VaR). For example,
when compared to the martingale benchmark, a market can choose to either
increase her average PNL by more than 15% and carry a huge risk, on inventory
and PNL, or either give up 5% of her benchmark PNL to increase her control on
inventory and PNL, as well as increasing her Sharpe ratio by a factor bigger

high-luminosity colliding hadronic beam environments require the use of
multi-level trigger systems to reject colossal background rates in real time.
In analyses like the search for the Higgs boson, there is a need to maximize
the signal acceptance by combining multiple different trigger chains when
forming the offline data sample. In such statistically limited searches,
datasets are often amassed over periods of several years, during which the
trigger characteristics evolve and system performance can vary significantly.
Reliable production cross-section measurements and upper limits must take into
account a detailed understanding of the effective trigger inefficiency for
every selected candidate event. We present as an example the complex situation
of three trigger chains, based on missing energy and jet energy, that were
combined in the context of the search for the Higgs (H) boson produced in
association with a $W$ boson at the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). We
briefly review the existing techniques for combining triggers, namely the
inclusion, division, and exclusion methods. We introduce and describe a novel
fourth in situ method whereby, for each candidate event, only the trigger chain
with the highest a priori probability of selecting the event is considered. We
compare the inclusion and novel in situ methods for signal event yields in the
CDF $WH$ search. This new combination method, by virtue of its scalability to
large numbers of differing trigger chains and insensitivity to correlations

Additivity of logarithmic convexity implies that the function sum of gammas
with non-negative coefficients is also log-convex. In this paper we investigate
the series in reciprocal gamma functions, where each term is clearly
log-concave. Log-concavity is not preserved by addition, so that non-negativity
of the coefficients is now insufficient to draw any conclusions about the sum.
We demonstrate that the sum is log-concave if the sequence of coefficients
times factorial is log-concave and the sum is discrete Wright log-concave if
the coefficents are log-concave. We conjecture that the latter condition is in
fact sufficient for the log-concavity of the sum. We exemplify our general
theorems by deriving known and new inequalities for the modified Bessel, Kummer

efficient in stochastic optimization algorithms, specially when the objective

which include Gaussian, Cauchy and uniform distributions among others. This
paper studies a new class of kernels based on the q-Gaussian distribution, that
has gained popularity in statistical physics over the last decade. Though the

generalize the Gaussian distribution, we observe that this class encompasses
almost all existing smoothing kernels. This motivates us to study SF schemes

present a theorem in the spirit of the no-cloning theorem, which says that it

the structure of filaments, cross-section profiles are often fitted with
Plummer profiles. This profiling is often done with submm studies, such as
Herschel. It would be convenient if filament properties could also be studied
using groundbased NIR data. We compare the filament profiles obtained by NIR
extinction and submm observations to find out if reliable profiles can be
derived using NIR data. We use J-, H-, and K-band data of a filament north of
TMC-1 to derive an extinction map from colour excesses of background stars. We
compare the Plummer profiles obtained from extinction maps with Herschel dust
emission maps. We present 2 methods to estimate profiles from NIR: Plummer
profile fits to median Av of stars or directly to the Av of individual stars.
We compare the methods by simulations. In simulations extinction maps and the
new methods give correct results to within ~10-20 for modest densities. Direct
fit to data on individual stars gives more accurate results than extinction
map, and can work in higher density. In profile fits to real observations,
values of Plummer parameters are generally similar to within a factor of ~2.
Although parameter values can vary significantly, estimates of filament mass
usually remain accurate to within some tens of per cent. Our results for TMC-1
are in agreement with earlier results. High resolution NIR data give more
details, but 2MASS data can be used to estimate profiles. NIR extinction can be
used as an alternative to submm observations to profile filaments. Direct fits
of stars can also be a valuable tool. Plummer profile parameters are not always
well constrained, and caution should be taken when making fits. In the
evaluation of Plummer parameters, one can use the independence of dust emission
and NIR data and the difference in the shapes of the confidence regions.

other is a diffuse relic devoid of a hotspot. The jet points towards the latter
lobe, which is difficult to explain in a standard way within the double-lobed
radio source paradigm. Here, I propose to assume that the nucleus of J1211+743
has undergone a re-ignition of activity and its lobes, presumably both
originally of FR II type, represent an earlier active phase, while the jet
represents the current one. The asymmetry of the lobes is a consequence of the
orientation of the source combined with an activity switch-off that occurred
between two active periods. The relic lobe is on the near side with regard to
the observer, whereas the radiation from the far-side lobe arrives
significantly later owing to its longer distance to the observer. The far-side
lobe is thus perceived to have not yet decayed. On the other hand, the jet
behaves in a standard way, i.e. its projected orientation reflects the near
side of the source. Hence, we are able to explain why the location of the relic
lobe correlates with the direction of the jet.

unlike the previous paper, however, we do not use the approximation that the

oscillation modes [both are the fundamental ($n=1$) in the vertical direction
but in the horizontal direction one is the fundamental ($n_{\rm r}=0$) and the
other the first overtone ($n_{\rm r}=1$)] correspond to the twin kHz QPOs.
Second, the oscillation mode which is the first overtone $(n=2)$ in the
vertical direction and the fundamental in the horizontal direction ($n_{\rm

The latter suggests that the horizontal branch of Z-sources is a sequence of
temperature change in disks whose vertical thickness is strongly terminated.
The temperature increases leftward along the sequence from the apex between
normal and horizontal branches.

language (i.e., a set of relations) $\Gamma$, the goal is to find an assignment

received substantial amount of attention in the past decade. In this paper we
study the fixed-parameter tractability of constraint satisfaction problems
parameterized by the size of the solution in the following sense: one of the
possible values, say 0, is ""free,"" and the number of variables allowed to take
other, ""expensive,"" values is restricted. A size constraint requires that
exactly $k$ variables take nonzero values. We also study a more refined version
of this restriction: a global cardinality constraint prescribes how many
variables have to be assigned each particular value. We study the parameterized
complexity of these types of CSPs where the parameter is the required number
$k$ of nonzero variables. As special cases, we can obtain natural and
well-studied parameterized problems such as Independent Set, Vertex Cover,
d-Hitting Set, Biclique, etc.

dynamics in the A. Pr\'astaro's algebraic topology of quantum super PDE's,
nonlinear quantum propagators in the observed quantum super Yang-Mills PDE,
$\hat{(YM)}[i]$, are further characterized. In particular, nonlinear quantum
propagators with non-zero defect quantum electric-charge, are interpreted as
{\em exotic-quantum supergravity} effects. As an application, the recently
discovered bound-state called $Zc(3900)$, is obtained as a neutral
quasi-particle, generated in a $Q$-quantum exotic supergravity process. {\em
Quantum entanglement} is justified by means of the algebraic topologic
structure of nonlinear quantum propagators. Quantum Cheshire cats are
considered as examples of quantum entanglements. Existence theorem for
solutions of $\hat{(YM)}[i]$ admitting negative local temperatures ({\em
quantum thermodynamic-exotic solutions}) is obtained too and related to quantum
entanglement. Such exotic solutions are used to encode Universe at the
Planck-epoch. It is proved that the Universe's expansion at the Planck epoch is
justified by the fact that it is encoded by a nonlinear quantum propagator
having thermodynamic quantum exotic components in its boundary. This effect
produces also an increasing of energy in the Universe at the Einstein epoch:
{\em Planck-epoch-legacy} on the boundary of our Universe. This is the main
source of the Universe's expansion and solves the problem of the non-apparent
energy-matter ({\em dark-energy-matter}) in the actual Universe.
Breit-Wheeler-type processes have been proved in the framework of the

observations to image the CO and 13CO 2-1 line emission of the extreme
FIR-excess galaxy NGC 1377. We find bright, complex CO 2-1 line emission in the
inner 400 pc of the galaxy. The CO 2-1 line has wings that are tracing a
kinematical component which appears perpendicular to that of the line core.
Together with an intriguing X-shape of the integrated intensity and dispersion
maps, this suggests that the molecular emission of NGC 1377 consists of a
disk-outflow system. Lower limits to the molecular mass and outflow rate are
M_out(H2)>1e7 Msun and dM/dt>8 Msun/yr. The age of the proposed outflow is
estimated to 1.4Myrs, the extent to 200pc and the outflow speed to 140 km/s.
The total molecular mass in the SMA map is estimated to M_tot(H2)=1.5e8 Msun
(on a scale of 400 pc) while in the inner r=29 pc the molecular mass is
M_core(H2)=1.7e7 Msun with a corresponding H2 column density of N(H2)=3.4e23
cm-2 and an average CO 2-1 brightness temperature of 19K.
  Observing the molecular properties of the FIR-excess galaxy NGC 1377 allows
us to probe the early stages of nuclear activity and the onset of feedback in
active galaxies. The age of the outflow supports the notion that the current
nuclear activity is young - a few Myrs. The outflow may be powered by radiation
pressure from a compact, dust enshrouded nucleus, but other driving mechanisms
are possible. The buried source may be an AGN or an extremely young (1Myr)
compact starburst. Limitations on size and mass lead us to favour the AGN
scenario, but further studies are required to settle the issue. In either case,
the wind with its implied mass outflow rate will quench the nuclear power
source within a very short time of 5-25 Myrs. It is however possible that the
gas is unable to escape the galaxy and may eventually fall back onto NGC 1377
again.

over $X$. Our motivation is to find the analogue of the classical Simpson
correspondence for the categories of subobjects of $\V$ and $(E,\theta)$. Our
main discovery in this paper is the notion of periodic Higgs subbundles, both
in positive characteristic and in mixed characteristic. In char $p$, it relies
on the inverse Cartier transform constructed by Ogus and Vologodsky in their
work on the char $p$ nonabelian Hodge theory. A lifting of the inverse Cartier
transform to mixed characteristic is constructed, which is used for the notion
of periodicity in mixed characteristic. We show a one to one correspondence
between the set of periodic Higgs subbundles of $(E,\theta)$ and the set of
\'{e}tale sub local systems of $\V\otimes_{\Z_{p}}\Z_{p^r}$, where $r$ is a
natural number. The notion turns out to be useful in applications. We have
proven, among other results, that the reduction $(E,\theta)_0$ of $(E,\theta)$

$\V$ is absolutely irreducible over $k$.

component of a compact binary system (separation < 50 astronomical units), the

in-situ formation of these planets has been unsuccessful, in part because of
the strong gravitational perturbations of the secondary star on any initial
planetesimal swarm. Here we test whether planetary bodies in compact binaries,
in particular gamma-Cephei, could have originated from a close encounter with a
passing star, assuming initial configurations for the stellar system suitable
for planetary formation. In other words, we analyze whether the orbital
configuration of the current binary system might have been generated after the
formation of the planet, and as a consequence of a close encounter with a third
star in hyperbolic orbit. We performed a series of time-reverse N-body
simulations of stellar scattering events in which the present-day configuration
of gamma-Cephei was used as the initial condition plus a hypothetical third
star as an impactor. We analyzed which configurations and system parameters
could have given birth to the current system. Depending on the maximum impact
velocity allowed for accretional collisions, we find that between 1% and 5% of
stellar encounters correspond to an ""original"" system in which planetary
formation around the primary star is not inhibited by the secondary, but is
acceptable within the classical core-accretion scenario. Thus, although not

charmonium core state coupling to the $D^0 \bar D^{\ast 0}$ and $D^+ D^{\ast
-}$ molecular states are studied. The strengths of the couplings between the
charmonium state and the hadronic molecular states are determined so as to
reproduce the observed mass of the the X(3872). The isospin symmetry breaking
is introduced by the mass differences of the neutral and charged $D$ mesons.
The obtained structure of the X(3872) is that about 7% is $\ccbar$ charmonium,
75% is the isoscalar $D \bar D^\ast$ molecule and 18% is the isovector $D \bar
D^\ast$ molecule, which explains observed properties of the X(3872) well. The
structure of the X(3872) we have obtained is not just a $D^0 \bar D^{ast 0}$
hadronic molecule nor the compact tetraquark state but the charmonium-hadronic
molecule hybrid state.

Conversely to the moving mirror case, we also show that the fundamental TM mode

polarization (arising due to the back reaction of pair created photons with the
plasma SCD) implies losses for TM, but not TE modes. However, we argue that
these losses can be reduced by lowering the laser power and shortening the
relaxation time. The results presented here lead support to the idea that TE

outperform time-sharing between the best-known protocols for accomplishing each

the dephasing and the universal cloning machine channels). In this letter, we
demonstrate that the associated performance gains are in fact remarkably high

significant performance gains from trade-off coding also apply when trading

the spatially averaged shear, that characterizes the anisotropy of the flow, is

completely determined by the cosmological parameters and the matter power

space-weather storms. Proxy records of flare energies based on SEPs in
principle may offer the longest time base to study infrequent large events. We
conclude that one suggested proxy, nitrate concentrations in polar ice cores,
does not map reliably to SEP events. Concentrations of select radionuclides
measured in natural archives may prove useful in extending the time interval of
direct observations up to ten millennia, but as their calibration to solar
flare fluences depends on multiple poorly known properties and processes, these
proxies cannot presently be used to help determine the flare energy frequency
distribution. Being thus limited to the use of direct flare observations, we
evaluate the probabilities of large-energy solar explosions by combining solar
flare observations with an ensemble of stellar flare observations. We conclude
that solar flare energies form a relatively smooth distribution from small
events to large flares, while flares on magnetically-active, young Sun-like
stars have energies and frequencies markedly in excess of strong solar flares,
even after an empirical scaling with the mean activity level of these stars. In
order to empirically quantify the frequency of uncommonly large solar flares
extensive surveys of stars of near-solar age need to be obtained, such as is
feasible with the Kepler satellite. Because the likelihood of flares larger
than approximately X30 remains empirically unconstrained, we present indirect
arguments, based on records of sunspots and on statistical arguments, that
solar flares in the past four centuries have likely not substantially exceeded
the level of the largest flares observed in the space era, and that there is at
most about a 10% chance of a flare larger than about X30 in the next 30 years.

galaxies has been a long standing problem in galaxy formation theories based on
the standard cold dark matter paradigm. Recent cosmological simulations, based
on Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics and rather strong feedback recipes have shown
that it was indeed possible to form extended dark matter cores using baryonic
processes related to a more realistic treatment of the interstellar medium.
Using adaptive mesh refinement, together with a new, stronger supernovae
feedback scheme that we have recently implemented in the RAMSES code, we show
that it is also possible to form a prominent dark matter core within the
well-controlled framework of an isolated, initially cuspy, 10 billion solar
masses dark matter halo. Although our numerical experiment is idealized, it
allows a clean and unambiguous identification of the dark matter core formation
process. Our dark matter inner profile is well fitted by a pseudo-isothermal
profile with a core radius of 800 pc. The core formation mechanism is
consistent with the one proposed recently by Pontzen & Governato. We highlight
two key observational predictions of all simulations that find cusp-core
transformations: (i) a bursty star formation history with peak to trough ratio
of 5 to 10 and a duty cycle comparable to the local dynamical time; and (ii) a
stellar distribution that is hot with v/sigma=1. We compare the observational
properties of our model galaxy with recent measurements of the isolated dwarf
WLM. We show that the spatial and kinematical distribution of stars and HI gas
are in striking agreement with observations, supporting the fundamental role
played by stellar feedback in shaping both the stellar and dark matter
distribution.

system operation state. Under the nonlinear AC power flow model, the state
estimation (SE) problem is inherently nonconvex giving rise to many local
optima. In addition to nonconvexity, SE is challenged by data integrity and
cyber-security issues. Unfortunately, existing robust (R-) SE schemes employed
routinely in practice rely on iterative solvers, which are sensitive to
initialization and cannot ensure global optimality. A novel R-SE approach is
formulated here by capitalizing on the sparsity of an overcomplete outlier
vector model. Observability and identifiability issues of this model are
investigated, and neat links are established between R-SE and error control
coding. The \emph{convex} semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique is further
pursued to render the nonconvex R-SE problem efficiently solvable. The
resultant algorithm markedly outperforms existing iterative alternatives, as
corroborated through numerical tests on the standard IEEE 30-bus system.

Lagrangian method we are able to select gas that lies within giant molecular
clouds (GMCs) at a particular timeframe, and to then study the properties of
this gas at earlier and later times. We find that gas which forms GMCs is not
typical of the interstellar medium at least 50 Myr before the clouds form and
reaches mean densities within an order of magnitude of mean cloud densities by
around 10 Myr before. The gas in GMCs takes at least 50 Myr to return to
typical ISM gas after dispersal by stellar feedback, and in some cases the gas
is never fully recycled. We also present a study of the two-dimensional,
vertically-averaged velocity fields within the ISM. We show that the velocity
fields corresponding to the shortest timescales (that is, those timescales
closest to the immediate formation and dissipation of the clouds) can be
readily understood in terms of the various cloud formation and dissipation
mechanisms. Properties of the flow patterns can be used to distinguish the
processes which drive converging flows (e.g.\ spiral shocks, supernovae) and
thus molecular cloud formation, and we note that such properties may be

approximately five orders of magnitude less than that of hydrogen. As a
homonuclear diatomic molecule, N2 is difficult to detect spectroscopically
through infrared or millimetre-wavelength transitions so its abundance is often
inferred indirectly through its reaction product N2H+. Two main formation
mechanisms each involving two radical-radical reactions are the source of N2 in
such environments. Here we report measurements of the low temperature rate
constants for one of these processes, the N + CN reaction down to 56 K. The
effect of the measured rate constants for this reaction and those recently
determined for two other reactions implicated in N2 formation are tested using
a gas-grain model employing a critically evaluated chemical network. We show
that the amount of interstellar nitrogen present as N2 depends on the
competition between its gas-phase formation and the depletion of atomic
nitrogen onto grains. As the reactions controlling N2 formation are
inefficient, we argue that N2 does not represent the main reservoir species for
interstellar nitrogen. Instead, elevated abundances of more labile forms of
nitrogen such as NH3 should be present on interstellar ices, promoting the
eventual formation of nitrogen-bearing organic molecules.

that testing for an induced complete subgraph has no polynomial kernel unless
NP is in coNP/poly, we show that the problem of testing if a graph contains a
complete graph on t vertices as a minor admits a polynomial kernel. On the

temperature by ~15% while a dilution level of 19.4% is sufficient to destroy
ferromagnetic long-range order in this material down to a temperature of at

simple flux criteria. Motivated by that development, this work considers the
statistical properties of strong gravitational lens systems which have been,

are tested with the current best estimates for the various model ingredients.
These include the cosmological parameters, the mass function and the lens
density profile, for which we consider the singular isothermal sphere (SIS) and
the Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) approximations. The five lenses identified in
the Herschel-ATLAS Science Demonstration Phase suggest a SIS density profile is
preferred, but cannot yet constrain \Omega_\Lambda to an accuracy comparable
with other methods. The complete Herschel-ATLAS data set should be sufficient
to yield competitive constraints on \Omega_\Lambda. Whilst this huge number of
lenses has great potential for constraining cosmological parameters, they will

support of the Turkish State Planning Organization by the collaboration of 10
Turkish universities. The complex is planned to have four main facilities,
namely: SASE FEL Facility Based on 1 GeV Electron Linac, Third Generation
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SR) Based on 3.56 GeV Positron Synchrotron,
Super-Charm Factory ($\sqrt{s} = 3.77$ GeV) by colliding the electron beam
coming from the linac with an energy of 1 GeV and positron beam coming through
the positron ring with an energy of 3.56 GeV, GeV scale proton accelerator.
Later has two-fold goal: Neutron Spallation Source (NSS) and ADS. The proton
accelerator construction will have 3 MeV, 100 MeV, and 1 GeV phases. The
technical design report is planned to be finished in 2013. Since Turkey has
essential Thorium reserves the ADS becomes very attractive for our country as
emerging energy technology.

  Problem""",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The quantum state of Schroedinger's cat is usually incorrectly described as a
superposition of ""dead"" and ""alive,"" despite an argument by Rinner and Werner
that, locally, the cat should be considered to be in a mixture of
non-superposed states. Here, it is rigorously proven that the cat is not in a
superposition. This is central to the measurement problem. Nonlocal two-photon
interferometry experiments throw further light on the measurement state by
probing the effect of a variable phase factor inserted between its superposed
terms. These experiments demonstrate that both subsystems really are in locally
mixed states rather than superpositions, and they tell us what the measurement
state superposition actually superposes. They show that measurement transfers
the coherence in Schroedinger's nuclear superposition neither to the cat nor to
the nucleus, but only to the correlations between them. This explains the
collapse process--but not its subsequent irreversible dissipation--within the
context of unitary dynamics with no need for external entities such as the
environment, a human mind, other worlds, or collapse mechanisms.

properties of the excited mesons can be extracted with this model. The model
maintains the three-body unitarity that has been missed in previous data
analyses based on the conventional isobar models. We study an importance of the
three-body unitarity in extracting hadron properties from data. For this
purpose, we use the unitary and isobar models to analyze the same pseudo data
of gamma p -> pi+pi+pi-n, and extract the properties of excited mesons. We find
a significant difference between the unitary and isobar models in the extracted
properties of excited mesons, such as the mass, width and coupling strength to
decay channels.

Relativity (GR). The first one is related with its incompatibility with quantum
mechanics, in the absence of a widely accepted consistent theory that combines
the two theories. The second problem is related with the requirement of the
dark sectors - inflaton, dark matter and dark energy by the energy-stress
tensor, which are needed to explain a variety of astronomical and cosmological
observations. While, these dark sectors themselves do not have any
non-gravitational or laboratory evidence, the dark energy poses, in addition, a
serious confrontation between fundamental physics and cosmology.
  Guided by the theoretical and the observational evidences, we are led to a
slight modification in the notion of the existence of the source of gravitation
and its manifestation in GR, which is in striking agreement with not only the
theory, but also the observations without requiring the dark sectors of the
standard approach. Additionally, it provides natural explanations to some
unexplained puzzles.
