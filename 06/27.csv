account using the proximity force approximation which, in essence, treats the
sphere as a plane. In this paper we present the exact solution for the
electrostatic patch interaction energy in the sphere- plane geometry, and
derive exact analytical formulas for the electrostatic patch force and
minimizing potential. We perform numerical simulations to analyze the distance
dependence of the minimizing potential as a function of patch size, and
quantify the sphere-plane patch force for a particular patch layout. Once the

inter-event times, meaning that intervals of high activity are followed by
periods of inactivity. Combined with birth and death of individuals, these
temporal constraints affect the spread of infections in a non-trivial way and
are dependent on the particular contact dynamics. We propose a stochastic model
to generate temporal networks where vertices make instantaneous contacts
following heterogeneous inter-event times, and leave and enter the system at
fixed rates. We study how these temporal properties affect the prevalence of an
infection and estimate R0, the number of secondary infections, by modeling
simulated infections (SIR, SI and SIS) co-evolving with the network structure.
We find that heterogeneous contact patterns cause earlier and larger epidemics
on the SIR model in comparison to homogeneous scenarios. In case of SI and SIS,
the epidemics is faster in the early stages (up to 90% of prevalence) followed
by a slowdown in the asymptotic limit in case of heterogeneous patterns. In the
presence of birth and death, heterogeneous patterns always cause higher
prevalence in comparison to homogeneous scenarios with same average inter-event
times. Our results suggest that R0 may be underestimated if temporal
heterogeneities are not taken into account in the modeling of epidemics.

region. Cloud material becomes incorporated into the flow. This ""mass-loading""
reduces the Mach number of the shock, and leads to the formation of a dense
shell. In cases in which the mass-loading is sufficient the flow slows enough
that the shock degenerates into a wave. The interaction evolves through up to
four stages: initially the shock decelerates; then its speed is nearly
constant; next the shock accelerates as it leaves the clumpy region; finally it
moves at a constant speed close to its initial speed. Turbulence is generated
in the post-shock flow as the shock sweeps through the clumpy region. Clouds
exposed to turbulence can be destroyed more rapidly than a similar cloud in an

increasing cloud-to-intercloud mass ratio. We briefly discuss the significance

terms of Kawaguchi geometry (areal metric space). On the extended configuration
space M for classical field theory composed of spacetime and field
configuration space, one can define a geometrical structure called Kawaguchi
areal metric K from the field Lagrangian and (M,K) can be regarded as Kawaguchi
manifold. The geometrical action functional is given by K and the dynamics of
field is determined by covariant Euler-Lagrange equation derived from the
variational principle of the action. The solution to the equation becomes a
minimal hypersurface on (M,K) which has the same dimension as spacetime. We
propose that this hypersurface is what we should regard as our real spacetime
manifold, while the usual way to understand spacetime is to consider it as the
parameter spacetime (base manifold) of a fibre bundle. In this way, the
dynamics of field and spacetime structure is unified by Kawaguchi geometry. The
theory has the property of strong covariance, which means that it allows one to
choose arbitrary parameter spacetime from the total extended configuration
space. In other words, we can take more wider class of coordinate
transformations such that mix spacetime and field variables which are forbidden
to be exchanged in conventional formalism. In this aspect, we call our
formalism fibration-free. This aspect also simplifies the discussion on
symmetries such as Noether's theorem.

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, with a strong 1/x^3 repulsive

the many-body wave function on the separation x_{jl} of two particles reduces
to a two-body wave function \Psi_{rel}(x_{jl}). Immediately after a sudden
rotation of the dipoles so that they are parallel to the longitudinal axis,
this wave function will still be that of the repulsive potential, but since the
potential is now that of the attractive potential, it will not be stationary.
It is shown that as nd^2 -> 0 the rate of change of this wave function
approaches zero. It follows that for small values of nd^2, this state is
metastable and is an analog of the super Tonks-Girardeau state of bosons with a
strong zero-range attraction. The dipolar system is equivalent to a spinor
Fermi gas with spin $z$ components \sigma_{\uparrow}=\perp (perpendicular to
the longitudinal axis) and \sigma_{\downarrow}=|| (parallel to the longitudinal

that supremum finite-sample rejection probability over null-restricted data
distributions tends asymptotically to nominal significance level. This applies
under weak assumptions allowing for estimator covariance singularity. The test
is unbiased for a wide class of local alternatives. A new theorem establishes
directions in which the test is locally most powerful. The proposed procedure
is compared with predominant existing tests in structure, theory and

short period low-mass eclipsing binary, SDSS J001641-000925. With an orbital
period of 0.19856 days, this system has one of the shortest known periods for
an M dwarf binary system. Medium-resolution spectroscopy and multi-band
photometry for the system are presented. Markov chain Monte Carlo modeling of
the light curves and radial velocities yields estimated masses for the stars of
M1 = 0.54 +/- 0.07 Msun and M2 = 0.34 +/- 0.04 Msun, and radii of R1 = 0.68 +/-
0.03 Rsun and R2 = 0.58 +/- 0.03 Rsun respectively. This solution places both
components above the critical Roche overfill limit, providing strong evidence
that SDSS J001641-000925 is the first verified M-dwarf contact binary system.
Within the follow-up spectroscopy we find signatures of non-solid body rotation
velocities, which we interpret as evidence for mass transfer or loss within the
system. In addition, our photometry samples the system over 9 years, and we
find strong evidence for period decay at the rate of dP/dt ~8 s/yr. Both of
these signatures raise the intriguing possibility that the system is in
over-contact, and actively losing angular momentum, likely through mass loss.
This places SDSS J001641-000925 as not just the first M-dwarf over-contact
binary, but one of the few systems of any spectral type known to be actively
undergoing coalescence. Further study SDSS J001641-000925 is on-going to verify
the nature of the system, which may prove to be a unique astrophysical

is a dilaton with couplings weaker than the Higgs boson (except to
$\gamma\gamma$ and $gg$), and explore dynamical symmetry breaking (DSB) by
strong Yukawa coupling of a yet unseen heavy chiral quark doublet $Q$. Assuming
the actual Higgs boson to be heavy, the Goldstone boson $G$ of electroweak
symmetry breaking still couples to $Q$ with Yukawa coupling $\lambda_Q$. A
``bootstrap"" gap equation without a Higgs particle is constructed. Electroweak
symmetry breaking via strong $\lambda_Q$ generates both heavy mass for $Q$,
while self-consistently justifying $G$ as a massless Goldstone particle in the
loop. The spontaneous breaking of scale invariance in principle \emph{allows}
for a dilaton. We numerically solve such a gap equation and find the mass of
the heavy quark to be a couple of TeV. We offer a short critique on the results
of the scale-invariant model of Hung and Xiong, where a similar gap equation is
built with a massless scalar doublet. Through this we show that a light SM
Higgs at 126 GeV cannot be viable within our approach to DSB, while a dilaton
with weaker couplings is consistent with our main result.

obtained using a parton shower matched to leading-order matrix elements
(ME+PS). This study extends our previous work [arXiv:1106.1423 [hep-ph]] on the
Z + 2-jet to gamma + 2-jet ratio. We find excellent agreement with the ratio
determined from the earlier NLO results involving two instead of three jets,
and agreement to within 10% between the NLO and ME+PS results for the ratios.
We also examine the possibility of large QCD logarithms in these processes.
Ratios of Z + n-jet to gamma + n-jet cross sections are plausibly less
sensitive to such corrections than the cross sections themselves. Their effect
on estimates of Z + 3-jet to gamma + 3-jet ratios can be assessed
experimentally by measuring the gamma + 3-jet to gamma + 2-jet production ratio
in search regions. We partially address the question of potentially large
electroweak logarithms by computing the real-emission part of the electroweak
corrections to the ratio using ME+PS, and find that it is 1% or less. Our
estimate of the remaining theoretical uncertainties in the Z to gamma ratio is
in agreement with our earlier study.

remodelling, in which less bone is reformed than resorbed. Yet, this
dysregulation of bone remodelling does not occur equally in all bone regions.
Loss of bone is more pronounced near and at the endocortex, leading to cortical
wall thinning and medullary cavity expansion, a process sometimes referred to
as ""trabecularisation"" or ""cancellisation"". Cortical wall thinning is of
primary concern in osteoporosis due to the strong deterioration of bone
mechanical properties that it is associated with. In this paper, we examine the
possibility that the non-uniformity of microscopic bone surface availability
could explain the non-uniformity of bone loss in osteoporosis. We use a
computational model of bone remodelling in which microscopic bone surface
availability influences bone turnover rate and simulate the evolution of the
bone volume fraction profile across the midshaft of a long bone. We find that
bone loss is accelerated near the endocortical wall where the specific surface
is highest. Over time, this leads to a substantial reduction of cortical wall
thickness from the endosteum. The associated expansion of the medullary cavity
can be made to match experimentally observed cross-sectional data from the
Melbourne Femur Collection. Finally, we calculate the redistribution of the
mechanical stresses in this evolving bone structure and show that mechanical
load becomes critically transferred to the periosteal cortical bone.

dramatically increase the range of interpolation. For the test case of Mg+NH,
the resulting optimized Y matrix may be interpolated smoothly over an energy

starting with and taking into account the general classification of homogeneous
connections not restricted to be Abelian. As a first consequence, it is seen
that the usual approach of quantizing Abelian models using spaces of functions
on the Bohr compactification of the real line does not capture all properties
of homogeneous connections. A new, more general quantization is introduced
which applies to non-Abelian models and, in the Abelian case, can be mapped by
an isometric, but not unitary, algebra morphism onto common representations
making use of the Bohr compactification. Physically, the Bohr compactification
of spaces of Abelian connections leads to a degeneracy of edge lengths and
representations of holonomies. Lifting this degeneracy, the new quantization
gives rise to several dynamical properties, including lattice refinement seen
as a direct consequence of state-dependent regularizations of the Hamiltonian
constraint of loop quantum gravity. The representation of basic operators -
holonomies and fluxes - can be derived from the full theory specialized to
lattices. With the new methods of this article, loop quantum cosmology comes
closer to the full theory and is in a better position to produce reliable
predictions when all quantum effects of the theory are taken into account.

(LS) and H. Shen et al. (SHEN) in core-collapse supernova simulations, we
explore possible impacts of these EOS on the post-bounce dynamics prior to the
onset of neutrino-driven explosions. Our spherically symmetric (1D) and axially
symmetric (2D) models are based on neutrino radiation hydrodynamics including
spectral transport, which is solved by the isotropic diffusion source
approximation. We confirm that in 1D simulations neutrino-driven explosions
cannot be obtained for any of the employed EOS. Impacts of the EOS on the
post-bounce hydrodynamics are more clearly visible in 2D simulations. In 2D
models of a 15 M_sun progenitor using the LS EOS, the stalled bounce shock
expands to increasingly larger radii, which is not the case using the SHEN EOS.
Keeping in mind that the omission of the energy drain by heavy-lepton neutrinos
in the present scheme could facilitate explosions, we find that 2D models of an
11.2 M_sun progenitor produce neutrino-driven explosions for all the EOS under
investigation. Models using the LS EOS are slightly more energetic compared to
those with the SHEN EOS. The more efficient neutrino heating in the LS models
coincides with a higher electron antineutrino luminosity and a larger mass that
is enclosed within the gain region. The models based on the LS EOS also show a
more vigorous and aspherical downflow of accreting matter to the surface of the
protoneutron star (PNS). The accretion pattern is essential for the production
and strength of outgoing pressure waves, that can push in turn the shock to
larger radii and provide more favorable conditions for the explosion.

MACSJ1149.5+2223 and MACSJ1752.1+4440, we discovered two double-relic systems
with a radio halo, and in MACSJ0553.4-3342 we found a radio halo. Archival Very
Large Array observations and Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope observations
have been used to study the polarization and spectral index properties. The
radio halo in MACSJ1149.5+2223 has the steepest spectrum ever found so far in
these objects (alpha > 2). The double relics in MACSJ1149.5+2223 are peculiar
in their position that is misaligned with the main merger axis. The relics are
polarized up to 30% and 40% in MACSJ1149.5+2223 and MACSJ1752.040+44,
respectively. In both cases, the magnetic field is roughly aligned with the
relics' main axes. The spectra in the relics in MACSJ1752.040+44 steepen
towards the cluster centre, in agreement with model expectations. X-ray data on
MACSJ0553.4-3342 suggests that this cluster is undergoing a major merger, with
the merger axis close to the plane of the sky. The cores of the disrupted
clusters have just passed each other, but no radio relic is detected in this
system. If turbulence is responsible for the radio emission, we argue that it
must develop before the core passage. A comparison of double relic plus halo
system with cosmological simulations allows a simultaneous estimate of the
acceleration efficiencies at shocks (to produce relics) and of turbulence (to
produce the halo).

expected in the future. The statistical characterization of exoplanets through
their mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagram is thus becoming possible. This
is for planet formation and evolution theory of similar importance as the
mass-distance diagram. Our aim in this and a companion paper is to extend our
formation model into a coupled formation and evolution model. We want to
calculate in a self-consistent way all basic characteristics (M,a,R,L) of a
planet and use the model for population synthesis calculations. Here we show
how we solve the structure equations describing the gaseous envelope not only
during the early formation phase, but also during gas runaway accretion, and
during the evolutionary phase at constant mass on Gyr timescales. We then study
the in situ formation and evolution of Jupiter, the mass-radius relationship of
giants, the influence of the core mass on the radius and the luminosity both in
the ""hot start"" and the ""cold start"" scenario. We put special emphasis on the
comparison with other models. We find that our results agree very well with
those of more complex models, despite a number of simplifications. The upgraded
model yields the most important characteristics of a planet from its beginning
as a seed embryo to a Gyr old planet. This is the case for all planets in a
synthetic planetary population. Therefore, we can now use self-consistently the
statistical constraints coming from all major observational techniques. This is
important in a time where different techniques yield constraints on very
diverse sub-populations of planets, and where its is challenging to put all
these constraints together in one coherent picture.

observations will foster the construction of a sample of Galactic star clusters
with reliable and homogeneously derived physical parameters (e.g., age,
distance, and mass, etc.). In this first paper in a series, the methodology
employed to establish cluster parameters for the envisioned database are
elaborated upon by analyzing a subsample of 4 known young open clusters: Danks
1, Danks 2, RCW 79, and DBS 132. The analysis offers a first glimpse of the
information that can be gleaned for the final cluster database from the VVV
observations. Methods: Wide-field, deep JHKs VVV observations, combined with
new infrared spectroscopy, are employed to constrain fundamental parameters for
a subset of clusters. Results: Results inferred from the deep near-infrared
photometry which features mitigated uncertainties (e.g. the accuracy of the
photometry is better than 0.1mag for Ks<18mag), the wide field-of-view of the
VVV survey, and numerous high quality low resolution spectra (typically more
than 10 per cluster), are used to establish independent cluster parameters
which enable existing determinations to be assessed. An anomalous reddening law
in the direction toward the Danks' clusters is found, i.e.
E(J-H)/E(H-Ks)=2.20+/-0.06, which exceeds published values for the inner
Galaxy. The G305 star forming complex, which includes the Danks' clusters, lies
beyond the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm and occupies the Centaurus arm.
Finally, the first deep infrared color-magnitude diagram of RCW 79 is presented

based on 14 new measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (for the systems

the high-obliquity (misaligned and retrograde) systems are those for which the
expected timescale is long. At face value, this finding indicates that the
origin of hot Jupiters involves dynamical interactions like planet-planet
interactions or the Kozai effect that tilt their orbits, rather than
inspiraling due to interaction with a protoplanetary disk. We discuss the
status of this hypothesis and the observations that are needed for a more
definitive conclusion.

groups of the Zurich Environmental Study, aimed at establishing how galaxy
properties depend on four environmental parameters: group halo mass M_GROUP,
group-centric distance R/R_200, ranking into central or satellite, and
large-scale structure density delta_LSS. Global galaxy structure is quantified
both parametrically and non-parametrically. We correct all these measurements
for observational biases due to PSF blurring and surface brightness effects as
a function of galaxy size, magnitude, steepness of light profile and
ellipticity. Structural parameters are derived also for bulges, disks and bars.
We use the galaxy bulge-to-total ratios (B/T), together with the calibrated
non-parametric structural estimators, to implement a quantitative morphological
classification that maximizes purity in the resulting morphological samples. We
investigate how the concentration C of satellite galaxies depends on galaxy
mass for each Hubble type, and on M_GROUP, R/R_200 and delta_LSS. At galaxy
masses M>10^10 M_sun, the concentration of disk satellites increases with
increasing stellar mass, separately within each morphological bin of B/T. The
known increase in concentration with stellar mass for disk satellites is thus
due, at least in part, to an increase in galaxy central stellar density at
constant B/T. The correlation between concentration and galaxy stellar mass
becomes progressively steeper for later morphological types. The concentration
of disk satellites shows a barely significant dependence on delta_LSS or
R/R_200. The strongest environmental effect is found with group mass for
M>10^10 M_sun disk-dominated satellites, which are ~10% more concentrated in
high mass groups than in lower mass groups.

brightest known and most nearby planets with an orbital period of just a few
days. Over the course of more than a decade, measurements of its orbital
inclination have been announced and refuted, and have subsequently remained
elusive until now. Here we report on the detection of carbon monoxide
absorption in the thermal day-side spectrum of tau Bootis b. At a spectral
resolution of R~100,000, we trace the change in the radial velocity of the
planet over a large range in phase, determining an orbital inclination of
i=44.5+-1.5 degrees and a true planet mass of 5.95+-0.28 MJup. This result
extends atmospheric characterisation to non-transiting planets. The strong
absorption signal points to an atmosphere with a temperature that is decreasing
towards higher altitudes. This is a stark contrast to the temperature inversion
invoked for other highly irradiated planets, and supports models in which the
absorbing compounds believed to cause such atmospheric inversions are destroyed
by the ultraviolet emission from the active host star.

growth: the number densities of luminous AGN peak at higher redshifts than
those of faint AGN. This would seem to imply that massive black holes formed
before low mass black holes, in apparent contradiction to hierarchical
clustering scenarios. We investigate whether this observed ""downsizing"" in BH
growth is reproduced in a semi-analytic model for the formation and evolution
of galaxies and black holes, set within the hierarchical paradigm for structure
formation (Somerville et al. 2008; S08). In this model, black holes evolve from
light seeds (\sim100M\odot) and their growth is merger-driven. The original S08
model (baseline model) reproduces the number density of AGN at intermediate
redshifts and luminosities, but underproduces luminous AGN at very high
redshift (z > 3) and overproduces them at low redshift (z < 1). In addition,
the baseline model underproduces low-luminosity AGN at low redshift (z < 1). To
solve these problems we consider several modifications to the physical
processes in the model: (1) a 'heavy' black hole seeding scenario (2) a
sub-Eddington accretion rate ceiling that depends on the cold gas fraction, and
(3) an additional black hole accretion mode due to disk instabilities. With
these three modifications, the models can explain the observed downsizing,
successfully reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity function and
simultaneously reproduce galaxy and black hole properties in the local
Universe. We also perform a comparison with the observed soft and hard X-ray
luminosity functions of AGN, including an empirical correction for torus-level
obscuration, and reach similar conclusions. Our best-fit model suggests a
scenario in which disk instabilities are the main driver for moderately
luminous Seyfert galaxies at low redshift, while major mergers are the main
trigger for luminous AGN.

the (alpha,gamma) to lower energy than previously possible. The combination of
(alpha,gamma) and (alpha,n) data made it possible to study the energy
dependence of the alpha width. While absolute value and energy dependence are
perfectly reproduced by theory at energies above 14 MeV, the observed change in
energy dependence at energies below 14 MeV requires a modification of the
predicted alpha width. Using an effective, energy-dependent, local optical
alpha+nucleus potential it is possible to reproduce the data but the
astrophysical rate is still not well constrained at gamma-process temperatures.
The additional uncertainty stemming from a possible modification of the
compound formation cross section is discussed. Including the remaining
uncertainties, the recommended range of astrophysical reaction rate values at 2

criteria similar to high redshift LBGs. The deep multi-band photometry in this
field is used to identify best-fit SED models, from which we infer the
following results: (1) the photometric redshift estimate of these dropout
selected LBGs is accurate to within few percent; (2) the UV spectral slope
(beta) is redder than at high redshift (z>3), where LBGs are less dusty; (3) on
average, LBGs at z=1-3 are massive, dustier and more highly star-forming,
compared to LBGs at higher redshifts with similar luminosities
(0.1L*<~L<~2.5L*), though their median values are similar within 1-sigma
uncertainties. This could imply that identical dropout selection technique, at
all redshifts, find physically similar galaxies; and (4) stellar masses of
these LBGs are directly proportional to their UV luminosities with a
logarithmic slope of ~0.46, and star-formation rates are proportional to their
stellar masses with a logarithmic slope of ~0.90. These relations hold true ---
within luminosities probed in this study --- for LBGs from z~1.5 to 5. The
star-forming galaxies selected using other color-based techniques show similar
correlations at z~2, but to avoid any selection biases, and for direct
comparison with LBGs at z>3, a true Lyman break selection at z~2 is essential.
The future HST UV surveys, both wider and deeper, covering a large luminosity
range are important to better understand LBG properties, and their evolution.

source observable gravity waves on scales relevant for Cosmic Microwave
Background experiments. A crucial constraint on such scenarios arises because
particle production can also source inflaton perturbations, and might ruin the
usual predictions for a nearly scale invariant spectrum of nearly Gaussian
curvature fluctuations. To minimize this effect, we consider two models of
particle production in a sector that is only gravitationally coupled to the
inflaton. For a single instantaneous burst of massive particle production, we
find that localized features in the scalar spectrum and bispectrum might be
observable, but gravitational wave signatures are unlikely to be detectable
(due to the suppressed quadrupole moment of non-relativistic quanta) without
invoking some additional effects. We also consider a model with a rolling
pseudoscalar that leads to a continuous production of relativistic gauge field
fluctuations during inflation. Here we find that gravitational waves from
particle production can actually exceed the usual inflationary vacuum
fluctuations in a regime where non-Gaussianity is consistent with observational
limits. In this model observable B-mode polarization can be obtained for any
choice of inflaton potential, and the amplitude of the signal is not
necessarily correlated with the scale of inflation.

bound to be traversed is itself a fluctuating function of time include widely
studied settings in neural coding, such as neuronal integrators with irregular
inputs and internal noise. We show that the probability p(t) that a
Gauss-Markov process will first exceed the boundary at time t suffers a phase
transition as a function of the roughness of the boundary, as measured by its
H\""older exponent H, with critical value Hc = 1/2. For smoother boundaries, H >
1/2, the probability density is a continuous func- tion of time. For rougher
boundaries, H < 1/2, the probability is concentrated on a Cantor-like set of
zero measure: the probability density becomes divergent, almost everywhere
either zero or infin- ity. The critical point Hc = 1/2 corresponds to a
widely-studied case in the theory of neural coding, where the external input
integrated by a model neuron is a white-noise process, such as uncorrelated but
precisely balanced excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We argue this transition
corresponds to a sharp boundary between rate codes, in which the neural firing
probability varies smoothly, and temporal codes, in which the neuron fires at
sharply-defined times regardless of the intensity of internal noise.

the shape of a cycle in this class of dynamo models. In order to simultaneously
predict the shape, amplitude and timing of a solar cycle by implementing an
Ensemble Kalman Filter in the framework of Data Assimilation Research Testbed
(DART), it is important to know the model's sensitivity to flow variation.
Guided by observations we consider a smooth increase or decrease in meridional
flow speed for a specified time (a few months to a few years), after which the
flow speed comes back to the steady speed, and implement that time-varying
meridional flow at different phases of solar cycle. We find that the model's
response time to change in flow speed peaks at four to six months if the flow
change lasts for one year. The longer the changed flow lasts, the longer the
model takes to respond. Magnetic diffusivity has no influence in model's
response to flow variation as long as the dynamo operates in the
advection-dominated regime. Experiments with more complex flow variations
indicate that the shape and amplitude of flow-perturbation have no influence in
the estimate of model's response time.

visualise the evolution of molecular sequences. As with any graph, a
quasi-median graph can contain cut vertices, that is, vertices whose removal
disconnect the graph. These vertices induce a decomposition of the graph into
blocks, that is, maximal subgraphs which do not contain any cut vertices. Here
we show that the special structure of quasi-median graphs can be used to

we present an algorithm that, for a collection of $n$ aligned sequences of
length $m$, can compute the blocks of the associated quasi-median graph
together with the information required to correctly connect these blocks
together in run time $\mathcal O(n^2m^2)$, independent of the size of the

the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory satellites, Ahead and Behind, and
the Solar Dynamics Observatory, thanks to the wide angular separation between
them. We study the propagation of a coronal wave, also known as ""EIT"" wave, and
its interaction with a coronal hole resulting in secondary waves and/or
reflection and transmission. We explore the possibility of the wave obeying the
law of reflection of waves. In a detailed example we find that a loop arcade at
the coronal hole boundary cascades and oscillates as a result of the EUV wave
passage and triggers a wave directed eastwards that appears to have reflected.
We find that the speed of this wave decelerates to an asymptotic value, which
is less than half of the primary EUV wave speed. Thanks to the full Sun
coverage we are able to determine that part of the primary wave is transmitted
through the coronal hole. This is the first observation of its kind. The
kinematic measurements of the reflected and transmitted wave tracks are
consistent with a fast-mode MHD wave interpretation. Eventually, all wave
tracks decelerate and disappear at a distance. A possible scenario of the whole
process is that the wave is initially driven by the expanding coronal mass
ejection and subsequently decouples from the driver and then propagates at the
local fast-mode speed.

This allows for ""adaptation"" at or ""interaction"" between the nodes - a node's
channel inputs may be functions of its message(s) and previously received
signals. How to best adapt is key to two-way communication, rendering it
challenging. However, examples exist of point-to-point channels where
adaptation is not beneficial from a capacity perspective. We ask whether
analogous examples exist for multi-user two-way networks.
  We first consider deterministic two-way channel models: the binary modulo-2
addition channel and a generalization thereof, and the linear deterministic
channel. For these deterministic models we obtain the capacity region for the
two-way multiple access/broadcast channel, the two-way Z channel and the
two-way interference channel (IC). In all cases we permit all nodes to adapt
channel inputs to past outputs (except for portions of the linear deterministic
two-way IC where we only permit 2 of the 4 nodes to fully adapt). However, we
show that this adaptation is useless from a capacity region perspective and
capacity is achieved by strategies where the channel inputs at each use do not
adapt to previous inputs. Finally, we consider the Gaussian two-way IC, and
show that partial adaptation is useless when the interference is very strong.
In the strong and weak interference regimes, we show that the non-adaptive Han
and Kobayashi scheme utilized in parallel in both directions achieves to within
a constant gap for the symmetric rate of the fully (some regimes) or partially
(remaining regimes) adaptive models.
  The central technical contribution is the derivation of new, computable outer
bounds which allow for adaptation. Inner bounds follow from non-adaptive
achievability schemes of the corresponding one-way channel models.

multi-party setting, it allows two parties using only public authenticated
communication to establish a secret session key which can be used to encrypt
messages. But if the session key is compromised, the confidentiality of
encrypted messages is typically compromised as well. Without quantum mechanics,
key establishment can only be done under the assumption that some computational
problem is hard. Since digital communication can be easily eavesdropped and
recorded, it is important to consider the secrecy of information anticipating
future algorithmic and computational discoveries which could break the secrecy
of past keys, violating the secrecy of the confidential channel.
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) can be used generate secret keys that are
secure against any future algorithmic or computational improvements. QKD
protocols still require authentication of classical communication, however,
which is most easily achieved using computationally secure digital signature
schemes. It is generally considered folklore that QKD when used with
computationally secure authentication is still secure against an unbounded
adversary, provided the adversary did not break the authentication during the
run of the protocol.
  We describe a security model for quantum key distribution based on
traditional classical authenticated key exchange (AKE) security models. Using
our model, we characterize the long-term security of the BB84 QKD protocol with
computationally secure authentication against an eventually unbounded
adversary. By basing our model on traditional AKE models, we can more readily
compare the relative merits of various forms of QKD and existing classical AKE
protocols. This comparison illustrates in which types of adversarial
environments different quantum and classical key agreement protocols can be
secure.

frame size, the longer sensing time will reduce the allowable data transmission
time of the secondary user (SU). In this paper, we try to address the tradeoff
between sensing the primary channel for $\tau$ seconds of the time slot
proceeded by randomly accessing it and randomly accessing primary channel
without sensing to avoid wasting $\tau$ seconds in sensing. The SU senses
primary channel to exploit the periods of silence, if the primary user (PU) is
declared to be idle the SU randomly accesses the channel with some access
probability $a_s$. In addition to randomly accesses the channel if the PU is
sensed to be idle, it possibly accesses it if the channel is declared to be
busy with some access probability $b_s$. This is because the probability of
false alarm and misdetection cause significant secondary throughput degradation
and affect the PU QoS. We propose variable sensing duration schemes where the
SU optimizes over the optimal sensing time to achieve the maximum stable
throughput for both primary and secondary queues. The results reveal the
performance gains of the proposed schemes over the conventional sensing scheme,
i.e., the SU senses the primary channel for $\tau$ seconds and accesses with
probability 1 if the PU is declared to be idle. Also, the proposed schemes
overcome random access without sensing scheme.
  The theoretical and numerical results show that pairs of misdetection and
false alarm probabilities may exist such that sensing the primary channel for
very small duration overcomes sensing it for large portion of the time slot. In
addition, for certain average arrival rate to the primary queue pairs of
misdetection and false alarm probabilities may exist such that the random
access without sensing overcomes the random access with long sensing duration.

the beginning of burst-pulse sequences just after null. The intensity usually
rises to a maximum for the first few pulses, then declines exponentially
afterwards, and becomes stable after few tens of pulse periods. The peak phase
appears at later longitudes for the first pulse, then drifts to earlier
longitudes rapidly, and then systematic drifting gradually vanishes while the
intensity becomes stable. In this pulsar, the intensity variation and phase
modulation of pulses are correlated in a short duration after the emission

with an arbitrary finite CW complex, and their relationships to group
invariants including the critical group of a complex. Our results extend to
higher dimension the theory of cuts and flows in graphs, most notably the work
of Bacher, de la Harpe and Nagnibeda. We construct explicit bases for the cut
and flow spaces, interpret their coefficients topologically, and give
sufficient conditions for them to be integral bases of the cut and flow
lattices. Second, we determine the precise relationships between the
discriminant groups of the cut and flow lattices and the higher critical and
cocritical groups with error terms corresponding to torsion (co)homology. As an
application, we generalize a result of Kotani and Sunada to give bounds for the
complexity, girth, and connectivity of a complex in terms of Hermite's
constant.

frontier orbitals, arising in the dissociation limit of some molecules. We
introduce the Linear EXX (""LEXX"") theory whose pair distribution and energy are
explicitly \emph{piecewise linear} in the occupations $f^{\sigma}_{i}$. {\hi}We
provide explicit expressions for these functions for frontier $s$ and $p$
shells. Used in an optimised effective potential (OEP) approach it yields
energies bounded by the piecewise linear 'ensemble EXX' (EEXX) energy and
standard fractional optimised EXX energy: $E^{EEXX}\leq E^{LEXX} \leq E^{EXX}$.
Analysis of the LEXX explains the success of standard OEP methods for diatoms
at large spacing, and why they can fail when both spins are allowed to be
non-integer so that ""ghost"" Hartree interactions appear between \emph{opposite}
spin electrons in the usual formula. The energy $E^{LEXX}$ contains a
cancellation term for the spin ghost case. It is evaluated for H, Li and Na
fractional ions with clear derivative discontinuities for all cases. The
$p$-shell form reproduces accurate correlation-free energies of B-F and Al-Cl.
We further test LEXX plus correlation energy calculations on fractional ions of
C and F and again shows both derivative discontinuities and good agreement with
exact results.

impose is that energy removed must either be conserved or dissipated, such that
the scheme is guaranteed to decrease the overall magnetic energy. This is shown
to require use of conjugate numerical operators for evaluating \nabla\dot B and
\nabla{\psi} in the SPMHD cleaning equations. The resulting scheme is shown to
be stable at density jumps and free boundaries, in contrast to an earlier
implementation by Price & Monaghan (2005). Optimal values of the damping
parameter are found to be {\sigma} = 0.2-0.3 in 2D and {\sigma} = 0.8-1.2 in
3D. With these parameters, our constrained Hamiltonian formulation is found to
provide an effective means of enforcing the divergence constraint in SPMHD,
typically maintaining average values of h |\nabla\dot B| / |B| to 0.1-1%, up to
an order of magnitude better than artificial resistivity without the associated
dissipation in the physical field. Furthermore, when applied to realistic, 3D
simulations we find an improvement of up to two orders of magnitude in momentum
conservation with a corresponding improvement in numerical stability at
essentially zero additional computational expense.

with high velocity dispersion. The case is not as clear for lower-dispersion
systems such as low-mass galaxies and globular clusters. Here we suggest that
above a critical velocity dispersion of roughly 40 km/s, massive central black
holes will form in relaxed stellar systems at any cosmic epoch. This is because
above this dispersion primordial binaries cannot support the system against
deep core collapse. If, as previous simulations show, the black holes formed in
the cluster settle to produce a dense subcluster, then given the extremely high
densities reached during core collapse the holes will merge with each other.
For low velocity dispersions and hence low cluster escape speeds, mergers will
typically kick out all or all but one of the holes due to three-body kicks or
the asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation. If one hole remains, it
will tidally disrupt stars at a high rate. If none remain, one is formed after
runaway collisions between stars, then it tidally disrupts stars at a high
rate. The accretion rate after disruption is many orders of magnitude above
Eddington. If, as several studies suggest, the hole can accept matter at that
rate because the generated radiation is trapped and advected, then it will grow
quickly and form a massive central black hole.

First, closed-form expressions for the outage probability in MIMO interference
channels are derived under the assumption of Gaussian-distributed channel state
information (CSI) error, and the asymptotic behavior of the outage probability
as a function of several system parameters is examined by using the Chernoff
bound. It is shown that the outage probability decreases exponentially with
respect to the quality of CSI measured by the inverse of the mean square error
of CSI. Second, based on the derived outage probability expressions, an
iterative beam design algorithm for maximizing the sum outage rate is proposed.
Numerical results show that the proposed beam design algorithm yields better
sum outage rate performance than conventional algorithms such as interference
alignment developed under the assumption of perfect CSI.

method and by employing the peak-count rates and spectral lags as well. The
standard parametric (model-based clustering) and non-parametric (K-means

Anderson-Darling tests are used. Two new results are obtained: A. The
intermediate-duration group has similar properties to the group of short

the Xe-136 isotope using a TPC filled with a 100 kg of high-pressure gaseous
xenon, with 90% isotopic enrichment. The experiment will take place at the
Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc (LSC), Spain. NEXT-100 uses
electroluminescence (EL) technology for energy measurement with a resolution
better than 1% FWHM. The gaseous xenon in the TPC additionally allows the
tracks of the two beta particles to be recorded, which are expected to have a
length of up to 30 cm at 10 bar pressure. The ability to record the topological
signature of the neutrinoless double-beta events provides a powerful background
rejection factor for the double-beta experiment.
  In this paper, we present a novel 3D imaging concept using SiPMs coated with
tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) for the EL read out and its first implementation in
NEXT-DEMO, a large-scale prototype of the NEXT-100 experiment. The design and
the first characterization measurements of the NEXT-DEMO SiPM tracking system
are presented. The SiPM response uniformity over the tracking plane drawn from
its gain map is shown to be better than 4%. An automated active control system
for the stabilization of the SiPMs gain was developed, based on the voltage
supply compensation of the gain drifts. The gain is shown to be stabilized
within 0.2% relative variation around its nominal value, provided by Hamamatsu,
in a temperature range of 10 degree C. The noise level from the electronics and
the SiPM dark noise is shown to lay typically below the level of 10
photoelectrons (pe) in the ADC. Hence, a detection threshold at 10 pe is set
for the acquisition of the tracking signals. The ADC full dynamic range (4096
channels) is shown to be adequate for signal levels of up to 200
pe/microsecond, which enables recording most of the tracking signals.

computational complexities of the variants of the flooding games on several

many merits, this approach is limited because the resultant adjacency matrices
are not really fit for network-analytic calculations. We therefore propose a
fresh analytical approach using a primary linkage algorithm that produces a
one-mode directed graph based on Taylor's two-mode city/firm network data. The
procedure has the advantage of creating less dense networks when compared to
the interlocking network model, while nonetheless retaining the network
structure apparent in the initial dataset. We randomize the empirical network
with a bootstrapping simulation approach, and compare the simulated parameters
of this null-model with our empirical network parameter (i.e. betweenness
centrality). We find that our approach produces results that are comparable to
those of the standard interlocking network model. However, because our approach
is based on an actual graph representation and network analysis, we are able to
assess cities' position in the network at large. For instance, we find that
cities such as Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, Almaty and Karachi hold more strategic
and valuable positions than suggested in the interlocking networks as they play
a bridging role in connecting cities across regions. In general, we argue that
our graph representation allows for further and deeper analysis of the original

algorithms, such as the zero-forcing with selection (ZFS), have `redundant
user' and `local optimum' flaws that compromise the achieved sum rate, GUSS
adds `delete' and `swap' operations to the user selection procedure of ZFS to
improve the performance by eliminating `redundant user' and escaping from
`local optimum', respectively. In addition, an effective channel vector based
effective-channel-gain updating scheme is presented to reduce the complexity of
GUSS. With the help of this updating scheme, GUSS has the same order of
complexity of ZFS with only a linear increment. Simulation results indicate
that on average GUSS achieves 99.3 percent of the sum rate upper bound that is
achieved by exhaustive search, over the range of transmit signal-to-noise
ratios considered with only three to six times the complexity of ZFS.

offloading is a dominant approach to enhance Smart Mobile Devices (SMDs). A
challenging aspect of VM deployment is the additional computing resources usage
in the deployment and management of VM which obliges computing resources for VM
creation and configuration. The management of VM comprises computing resources
exploitation in the monitoring of VM in entire lifecycle and physical resources
management for VM on SMDs. Therefore, VM migration based application offloading
requires additional computing resource. Consequently computing resources demand
and execution time of the application increases respectively. In this paper, we
empirically review the impact of VM deployment and management on the execution
time of application in diverse scenarios. We investigate VM deployment and
management for application processing in simulation environment by employing
CloudSim: a simulation toolkit that provides an extensible simulation framework
to model VM deployment and management for application processing in cloud
infrastructure. The significance of this work is to ensure that VM deployment
and management necessitates additional computing resources on SMD for
application offloading. We evaluate VM deployment and management in application
processing by analyzing Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) in different
scenarios; such as VM deployment, the execution time of applications, and total
execution time of the simulation. We use KPPs to assess deviations in the
results of diverse experimental scenarios. The empirical analysis concludes
that VM deployment and management oblige additional resources on computing host
which make it a heavyweight approach for process offloading on smart mobile
device.

cosmic structures only if most of the matter in the Universe is dark, namely it
does not emit any electromagnetic radiation. Intriguingly, on the scale of
galaxies, there is strong observational evidence that the presence of dark
matter appears to be necessary only when the gravitational field inferred from
the distribution of the luminous matter falls below an acceleration of the
order of 10^(-10) m/s^2. In the standard model, which combines Newtonian
gravity with dark matter, the origin of this acceleration scale is challenging
and remains unsolved. On the contrary, the full set of observations can be
neatly described, and were partly predicted, by a modification of Newtonian
dynamics, dubbed MOND, that does not resort to the existence of dark matter. On
the scale of galaxy clusters and beyond, however, MOND is not as successful as
on the scale of galaxies, and the existence of some dark matter appears
unavoidable. A model combining MOND with hot dark matter made of sterile
neutrinos seems to be able to describe most of the astrophysical phenomenology,
from the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies to the
dynamics of dwarf galaxies. Whether there exists a yet unknown covariant theory
that contains General Relativity and Newtonian gravity in the weak field limit,
and MOND as the ultra-weak field limit is still an open question.

function coherently and collectively. They are typically composed of multiple
feedback loops, and period mismatch is unavoidable in biological
implementations. We investigated the advantageous effect of this period
mismatch in terms of a synchronization response to external stimuli.
Specifically, we considered two fundamental models of genetic circuits: smooth-
and relaxation oscillators. Using phase reduction and Floquet multipliers, we
numerically analyzed their entrainability under different coupling strengths
and period ratios. We found that a period mismatch induces better entrainment
in both types of oscillator; the enhancement occurs in the vicinity of the
bifurcation on their limit cycles. In the smooth oscillator, the optimal period
ratio for the enhancement coincides with the experimentally observed ratio,
which suggests biological exploitation of the period mismatch. Although the
origin of multiple feedback loops is often explained as a passive mechanism to
ensure robustness against perturbation, we study the active benefits of the
period mismatch, which include increasing the efficiency of the genetic
oscillators. Our findings show a qualitatively different perspective for both
the inherent advantages of multiple loops and their essentiality.

released in the formation of undesirable cracks. The capacity of a gel network
to crack during drying depends on the existence and significance of a pressure
gradient in the pore liquid; in addition it depends on the way the gel relaxes
the resulting drying stresses. In this paper the effect of a binary mixture of
solvents saturating the gel network on the crack patterns formation is
investigated. Indeed, incorporation of a small quantity of non-volatile
cosolvent, i.e. glycerol, inhibits drying-induced cracks; moreover addition of
a concentration greater than 10% to a colloidal dispersion leads to a crack
free coating in room conditions. Mass variation with time reveals that both
evaporation rate and cracking time are not affected by glycerol, in the range
of added glycerol contents studied. In addition measurements of mechanical
properties show that the elastic modulus is reduced with glycerol content. The
decrease of the number of cracks with the glycerol content is related to the
flattening of the pressure gradient in the pore liquid. The mechanism is shown
to be due to the combination of two processes: flow driven by the pressure
gradient and diffusion mechanisms in accordance with Scherer work (1989).

semi-major axis of ~1.7 AU. Our previous observations using the VLTI and AMBER
in the medium resolution K-band mode spatially resolved the environment of HD
327083. The continuum visibilities obtained indicate the presence of a
circumbinary disc. CO bandhead emission was also observed. However, due to the
limited spectral resolution of the previous observations, the kinematic
structure of the emitting material was not constrained. In this paper, we
address this and probe the source of the CO emission with high spectral
resolution and spatial precision. We have observed HD 327083 with high spectral
resolution (25 & 6 km/s) using AMBER and CRIRES. The observations are compared
to kinematical models to constrain the source of the emission. It is shown that
the CO bandhead emission can be reproduced using a model of a Keplerian disc
with an inclination and size consistent with our previous VLTI observations.
The model is compared to AMBER differential phase measurements, which have a
precision as high as 30-micro-arcseconds. A differential phase signal
corresponding to 0.15 milli-arcseconds (~5 sigma) is seen over the bandhead
emission, which is in excellent agreement with the model that fits the CRIRES
observations. In comparison, a model of an equatorial outflow, as envisaged in
the standard sgB[e] scenario, does not reproduce the observations well. The
excellent agreement between the disc model and observations in the spatial and
spectral domains is compelling evidence that the CO bandhead emission of HD
327083 originates in a circumbinary Keplerian disc. In contrast, the model of
an equatorial outflow cannot reproduce the observations well. This suggests
that the standard sgB[e] scenario is not applicable to HD 327083, which
supports the hypothesis that the B[e] behaviour of HD 327083 is due to binarity

extensive use of reinforcement learning algorithms. We build on our prior work
with general value functions (GVFs) and the Horde architecture. GVFs have been
shown able to represent a wide variety of facts about the world's dynamics that
may be useful to a long-lived agent (Sutton et al. 2011). We have also
previously shown scaling - that thousands of on-policy GVFs can be learned
accurately in real-time on a mobile robot (Modayil, White & Sutton 2011). That
work was limited in that it learned about only one policy at a time, whereas
the greatest potential benefits of life-long learning come from learning about
many policies in parallel, as we explore in this paper. Many new challenges
arise in this off-policy learning setting. To deal with convergence and
efficiency challenges, we utilize the recently introduced GTD({\lambda})
algorithm. We show that GTD({\lambda}) with tile coding can simultaneously
learn hundreds of predictions for five simple target policies while following a
single random behavior policy, assessing accuracy with interspersed on-policy
tests. To escape the need for the tests, which preclude further scaling, we
introduce and empirically vali- date two online estimators of the off-policy
objective (MSPBE). Finally, we use the more efficient of the two estimators to
demonstrate off-policy learning at scale - the learning of value functions for
one thousand policies in real time on a physical robot. This ability
constitutes a significant step towards scaling life-long off-policy learning.

phenomena, from stock pricing to phenotypic variability. Frequently, the
system's state influences the driving noise intensity, as, for example, the
actual value of a commodity may alter its volatility or the concentration of
gene products may regulate their expression. All these phenomena are often
modeled using stochastic differential equations (SDEs). However, an SDE is not
sufficient to fully describe a noisy system with a multiplicative feedback,
because it can be interpreted according to various conventions -- in
particular, It\^{o} calculus and Stratonovitch calculus --, each of which leads
to a qualitatively different solution. Which convention to adopt must be
determined case by case on the basis of the available experimental data; for
example, the SDE describing electrical circuits driven by a noise are known to
obey Stratonovich calculus. Once such an SDE-convention pair is determined, it
c an be employed to predict the system's behavior under new conditions. Here,
we experimentally demonstrate that the convention for a given physical system
may actually vary under varying operational conditions. We show that, under
certain conditions, a noisy electric circuit shifts to obey It\^o calculus,
which may dramatically alter the system's long term stability. We track such
Stratonovich-to-It\^o transition to the underlying dynamics of the system and,
in particular, to the ratio between the driving noise correlation time and the
feedback delay time. We briefly discuss ramifications of our conclusions for
biology and economics: the possibility of similar transitions and their
dramatic consequences should be recognized and accounted for where SDEs are
employed to predict the evolution of complex phenomena.

detected in the first epoch observations, it is observed at the second epoch,
producing a transit absorption depth of 14.4+/-3.6% between velocities of -230

radiation pressure alone and require an additional acceleration mechanism, such

explained by an atmospheric escape rate of neutral hydrogen atoms of about 10^9
g/s, a stellar wind with a velocity of 190 km/s and a temperature of ~10^5K.
  An X-ray flare from the active star seen with Swift/XRT 8 hours before the

upper atmosphere of the planet can be caused by variations in the stellar wind
properties, or by variations in the stellar energy input to the planetary
escaping gas (or a mix of the two effects). These observations provide the

tracks fitting. The stellar radii were calculated from either estimated masses

This leads to a novel signature of same-sign tetra-leptons resulting from a
pair production of same-sign doubly charged Higgs bosons caused by the nearly
degenerate neutral scalar mixing which can be sizable for an appropriate choice

components that are different from the radio cores, among which 95% move with
apparent projected superluminal velocities with respect to the core, and 45%
have projected velocities larger than 10c (with a maximum velocity 60c).
Doppler boosting effects are analyzed to determine the statistics of the
superluminal motions. We integrate over all possible values of the Lorentz
factor the values of the kinetic energy corresponding to each component. The
calculation of the mass in the ejection is carried out by assuming the minimum
energy state. This kinetic energy is multiplied by the frequency at which the
portions of the jet fluid identified as ""blobs"" are produced. Hence, we
estimate the average total power released by the quasars in the form of kinetic
energy in the long term on pc-scales.
  RESULTS. A selection effect in which both the core and the blobs of the
quasar are affected by huge Doppler-boosting enhancement increases the
probability of finding a jet ejected within 10 degrees of the line of sight
>~40 times above what one would expect for a random distribution of ejection,
which explains the ratios of the very high projected velocities given above.
The average total kinetic power of each MOJAVE quasar should be very high to
obtain this distribution: ~7E47 erg/s. This amount is much higher than previous
estimates of kinetic power on kpc-scales based on the analysis of cavities in
X-ray gas or radio lobes in samples of objects of much lower radio luminosity
but similar black hole masses. The kinetic power is a significant portion of
the Eddington luminosity, on the order of the bolometric luminosity, and
proportional on average to square root of the radio luminosity, although this
correlation might be induced by Malmquist-like bias.

notable success story in cosmology. These standard candles offer us an
unparalleled opportunity of studying the cosmological expansion out to a
redshift of ~1.5. The consensus today appears to be that LCDM offers the best
explanation for the luminosity-distance relationship seen in these events.
However, a significant incompatibility is now emerging between the standard
model and other equally important observations, such as those of the cosmic
microwave background. LCDM does not provide an accurate representation of the
cosmological expansion at high redshifts (z>>2). It is therefore essential to
re-analyze the Type Ia supernova data in light of the cosmology (the R_h=ct
Universe) that best represents the Universe's dynamical evolution at early
times. In this paper, we directly compare the distance-relationship in LCDM
with that predicted by R_h=ct, and each with the Union2.1 sample, and show that
the two theories produce virtually indistinguishable profiles, though the fit
with R_h=ct has not yet been optimized. This is because the data cannot be
determined independently of the assumed cosmology---the supernova luminosities
must be evaluated by optimizing 4 parameters simultaneously with those in the
adopted model. This renders the data compliant to the underlying theory, so the
m odel-dependent data reduction should not be ignored in any comparative
analysis between competing cosmologies. In this paper, we use R_h=ct to fit the
data reduced with LCDM, and though quite promising, the match is not perfect.
An even better fit would result with an optimization of the data using R_h=ct
from the beginning.

that the molecular composition in these objects differs from that found in
interstellar clouds or in circumstellar envelopes. The success of the models,
which are mostly devoted to explain molecular densities in specific planetary
nebulae, is still partial, however. The present study aims at identifying the
influence of stellar and nebular properties on the molecular composition of
planetary nebulae by means of chemical models. A comparison of theoretical
results with those derived from the observations may provide clues to the
conditions that favor the presence of a particular molecule. A self-consistent
photoionization numerical code was adapted to simulate cold molecular regions
beyond the ionized zone. The code was used to obtain a grid of models and the
resulting column densities are compared with those inferred from observations.
Our models show that the inclusion of an incident flux of X-rays is required to
explain the molecular composition derived for planetary nebulae. We also obtain
a more accurate relation for the N(CO)/N(H2) ratio in these objects. Molecular
masses obtained by previous works in the literature were then recalculated,
showing that these masses can be underestimated by up to three orders of
magnitude. We conclude that the problem of the missing mass in planetary

transmitter-receiver pair and a primary transmitter (PT) on the maximum stable
throughput of the primary-secondary network. Each transmitter, primary or
secondary, has a buffer for storing its own traffic. In addition to its own
buffer, the secondary transmitter (ST) has a buffer for storing a fraction of
the undelivered primary packets due to channel impairments. Moreover, the
secondary destination has a relaying queue for storing a fraction of the
undelivered primary packets. In the proposed cooperative system, the ST and the
secondary destination increase the spectrum availability for the secondary
packets by relaying the unsuccessfully transmitted packets of the PT. We
consider two multiple access strategies to be used by the ST and the secondary
destination to utilize the silence sessions of the PT. Numerical results
demonstrate the gains of the proposed cooperative system over the
non-cooperation case.

the equilibrium properties of a finite temperature Bose gas and the

focused on the null geodesic paths that we call the ""quasi-Minkowskian light

in the generic case where these points are both located at a finite distance

highly ordered structures. Less obvious to the eye, but perhaps more profound a
signature of self-organization, is the presence of long-range spatial
correlations. Experimental data on starling flocks in 3d show that the exponent
ruling the decay of the velocity correlation function, C(r) ~ 1/r^\gamma, is
extremely small, \gamma << 1. This result can neither be explained by
equilibrium field theory, nor by off-equilibrium theories and simulations of
active systems. Here, by means of numerical simulations and theoretical
calculations, we show that a dynamical field applied to the boundary of a set
of Heisemberg spins on a 3d lattice, gives rise to a vanishing exponent \gamma,
as in starling flocks. The effect of the dynamical field is to create an
information inflow from border to bulk that triggers long range spin wave
modes, thus giving rise to an anomalously long-ranged correlation. The
biological origin of this phenomenon can be either exogenous - information
produced by environmental perturbations is transferred from boundary to bulk of
the flock - or endogenous - the flock keeps itself in a constant state of
dynamical excitation that is beneficial to correlation and collective response.

can be generally divided into two types: The first is linear classifiers, such
as support vector machines, which are well studied and provide state-of-the-art
results. One shortcoming of these models is that their output (known as the
'margin') is not calibrated, and cannot be translated naturally into a
distribution over the labels. Thus, it is difficult to incorporate such models
as components of larger systems, unlike probabilistic based approaches. The
second type of approach constructs class conditional distributions using a
nonlinearity (e.g. log-linear models), but is occasionally worse in terms of
classification error. We propose a supervised learning method which combines
the best of both approaches. Specifically, our method provides a distribution
over the labels, which is a linear function of the model parameters. As a
consequence, differences between probabilities are linear functions, a property
which most probabilistic models (e.g. log-linear) do not have.
  Our model assumes that classes correspond to linear subspaces (rather than to
half spaces). Using a relaxed projection operator, we construct a measure which
evaluates the degree to which a given vector 'belongs' to a subspace, resulting
in a distribution over labels. Interestingly, this view is closely related to
similar concepts in quantum detection theory. The resulting models can be

the model of every agent's MDP and wants to implement the optimal joint policy,

incentive-compatible mechanism for eliciting state information that achieves
the optimal joint plan in a Markov perfect equilibrium of the induced

likelihood weighting (LW) on a subset of nodes in Bayesian networks. The
proposed scheme requires fewer samples to converge due to reduction in sampling
variance. The method exploits the structure of the network to bound the
complexity of exact inference used to compute sampling distributions, similar
to Gibbs cutset sampling. Yet, the extension of the previosly proposed cutset
sampling principles to likelihood weighting is non-trivial due to differences
in the sampling processes of Gibbs sampler and LW. We demonstrate empirically
that likelihood weighting on a cutset (LWLC) is effective time-wise and has a
lower rejection rate than LW when applied to networks with many deterministic
probabilities. Finally, we show that the performance of likelihood weighting on
a cutset can be improved further by caching computed sampling distributions
and, consequently, learning 'zeros' of the target distribution.

that learning algorithms in multi-agent systems should themselves be in
equilibrium rather than only lead to equilibrium. That is, learning equilibrium
is immune to strategic deviations: Every agent is better off using its
prescribed learning algorithm, if all other agents follow their algorithms,
regardless of the unknown state of the environment. However, a learning
equilibrium may not be immune to non strategic mistakes. For example, if for a
certain period of time there is a failure in the monitoring devices (e.g., the
correct input does not reach the agents), then it may not be in equilibrium to
follow the algorithm after the devices are corrected. A robust learning
equilibrium is immune also to such non-strategic mistakes. The existence of
(robust) learning equilibrium is especially challenging when the monitoring
devices are 'weak'. That is, the information available to each agent at each
stage is limited. We initiate a study of robust learning equilibrium with
general monitoring structure and apply it to the context of auctions. We prove

transformations, the MCPM, has been proposed. The theory features a unique
fermion mass spectrum which, although not describing nature precisely, provides
a good approximation. It also predicts the existence of five Higgs bosons with
a particular signature.
  In this thesis I implemented the MCPM into the Monte-Carlo event generation
package MadGraph, allowing the simulation of any MCPM tree-level process. The
generated events are in a standardised format and can be used for further
analysis with tools such as PYTHIA or GEANT, eventually leading to the
comparison with experimental data and the exclusion or discovery of the theory.
The implementation was successfully validated in different ways. It was then
used for a first comparison of the MCPM signal events with the SM background
and previous searches for new physics, hinting that the data expected at the
LHC in the next years might provide exclusion limits or show signatures of this
model.
