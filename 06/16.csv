addressing the cloud-in-cloud problem for peaks and/or modifying the excursion
set approach so that it averages over a special subset, rather than all
possible walks. In this respect, it seeks to account for correlations between
steps in the walk as well as correlations between walks. We first show how the
excursion set and peaks models can be written in the same formalism, and then
use this correspondence to write our combined excursion set peaks model. We
then give simple expressions for the mass function and bias, showing that even
the linear halo bias factor is predicted to be k-dependent as a consequence of
the nonlocality associated with the peak constraint. At large masses, our model
has little or no need to rescale the variable delta_c from the value associated
with spherical collapse, and suggests a simple explanation for why the linear
halo bias factor appears to lie above that based on the peak-background split
at high masses when such a rescaling is assumed. Although we have concentrated
on peaks, our analysis is more generally applicable to other traditionally
single-scale analyses of large-scale structure.

where genetic material is transferred between two more or less distantly
related organisms. It is particularly common in bacteria where it contributes
to adaptive evolution with important medical implications. In evolutionary
studies, LGT has been shown to create widespread discordance between gene trees
as genomes become mosaics of gene histories. In particular, the Tree of Life
has been questioned as an appropriate representation of bacterial evolutionary
history. Nevertheless a common hypothesis is that prokaryotic evolution is
primarily tree-like, but that the underlying trend is obscured by LGT.
Extensive empirical work has sought to extract a common tree-like signal from
conflicting gene trees. Here we give a probabilistic perspective on the problem
of recovering the tree-like trend despite LGT. Under a model of randomly
distributed LGT, we show that the species phylogeny can be reconstructed even
in the presence of surprisingly many (almost linear number of) LGT events per
gene tree. Our results, which are optimal up to logarithmic factors, are based
on the analysis of a robust, computationally efficient reconstruction method
and provides insight into the design of such methods. Finally we show that our
results have implications for the discovery of highways of gene sharing.

in this work. The dynamics of a classical particle of mass $m$, confined to
bounce elastically between two rigid walls where one is described by a
non-linear van der Pol type oscillator while the other one is fixed, working as
a re-injection mechanism of the particle for a next collision, is carefully
made by the use of a two-dimensional non-linear mapping. Two cases are
considered: (i) the situation where the particle has mass negligible as
compared to the mass of the moving wall and does not affect the motion of it;
(ii) the case where collisions of the particle does affect the movement of the
moving wall. For case (i) the phase space is of mixed type leading us to
observe a scaling of the average velocity as a function of the parameter
($\c{hi}$) controlling the non-linearity of the moving wall. For large
$\c{hi}$, a diffusion on the velocity is observed leading us to conclude that
Fermi acceleration is taking place. On the other hand for case (ii), the motion
of the moving wall is affected by collisions with the particle. However due to
the properties of the van der Pol oscillation, the moving wall relaxes again to
a limit cycle. Such kind of motion absorbs part of the energy of the particle
leading to a suppression of the unlimited energy gain as observed in case (i).
The phase space shows a set of attractors of different periods whose basin of
attraction has a complicate organization.

forming galaxies has yet to be definitively determined. The favored
interpretation, the ""calorimeter model,"" requires that supernova generated
cosmic ray (CR) electrons cool rapidly via synchrotron radiation. However, this
cooling should steepen their radio spectra beyond what is observed, and so
enhanced ionization losses at low energies from high gas densities are also
required. Further, evaluating the minimum energy magnetic field strength with
the traditional scaling of the synchrotron flux may underestimate the true
value in massive starbursts if their magnetic energy density is comparable to
the hydrostatic pressure of their disks. Gamma-ray spectra of starburst
galaxies, combined with radio data, provide a less ambiguous estimate of these
physical properties in starburst nuclei. While the radio flux is most sensitive
to the magnetic field, the GeV gamma-ray spectrum normalization depends
primarily on gas density. To this end, spectra above 100 MeV were constructed
for two nearby starburst galaxies, NGC 253 and M82, using Fermi data. Their
nuclear radio and far-infrared spectra from the literature are compared to new
models of the steady-state CR distributions expected from starburst galaxies.
Models with high magnetic fields, favoring galaxy calorimetry, are overall
better fits to the observations. These solutions also imply relatively high

  We apply our approach to the 3d and 4d early transition metal oxides SrMO3
(M=V, Cr, Mn) and (M=Nb, Mo, Tc) in their paramagnetic phases. For these
systems, we explicitly assess the differences between two physically motivated
low-energy Hamiltonians: The first is the three-orbital model comprising the
t2g states only, that is often used for early transition metal oxides. The
second choice is a model where both, metal d- and oxygen p-states are retained
in the construction of Wannier functions, but the Hubbard interactions are
applied to the d-states only (""d-dp Hamiltonian""). Interestingly, since -- for
a given compound -- both U and J depend on the choice of the model, so do their
trends within a family of these compounds. In the 3d perovskite series SrMO3
the effective Coulomb interactions in the t2g Hamiltonian decrease along the
series, due to the more efficient screening. The inverse -- generally expected
-- trend, increasing interactions with increasing atomic number, is however
recovered within the more localized ""d-dp Hamiltonian"". Similar conclusions are
established in the layered 4d perovskites series Sr2MO4 (M=Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh).
Compared to their isoelectronic and isostructural 3d analogues, the 4d 113

biology, information theory, statistical physics and computer science. We
consider the k-colouring model, i.e. the root of T is assigned an arbitrary
colour and, conditional on this assignment, we take a random colouring of T. A
basic question here is whether the information of the assignment at the root
affects the distribution of the colourings at the leaves. This is the so-called
reconstruction/non-reconstruction problem. It is well known that d/ln d is a
threshold function for this problem, i.e.
  * if k \geq (1+\eps)d/ln d, then the colouring of the root has a vanishing
effect on the distribution of the colourings at the leaves, as the height of
the tree grows
  * if $k\leq (1-\eps)d/ln d, then the colouring of the root biases the
distribution of the colouring of the leaves regardless of the height of the
tree.
  There is no apparent combinatorial reason why such a result should be true.
  When k\geq (1+\eps)d/ ln d, the threshold implies the following: We can
couple two broadcasting processes that assign the root different colours such
that the probability of having disagreement at the leaves reduces with their
distance from the root. It is natural to perceive such coupling as a mapping
from the colouring of the first broadcasting process to the colouring of the
second one. Here, we study how can we have such a mapping ""combinatorially"".
Devising a mapping where the disagreements vanish as we move away from the root
turns out to be a non-trivial task to accomplish for any k \leq d.
  In this work we obtain a coupling which has the aforementioned property for
any k>3d/ln d, i.e. much smaller than d. Interestingly enough, the decisions
that we make in the coupling are local. We relate our result to sampling
k-colourings of sparse random graphs, with expected degree d and k<d.

guiding principle in microeconomics. In the classical auction theory for agents
with linear utility and single-dimensional preferences, Bulow and Roberts
(1989) show that the optimal auction of Myerson (1981) is in fact optimizing
marginal revenue. In particular Myerson's virtual values are exactly the
derivative of an appropriate revenue curve.
  This paper considers mechanism design in environments where the agents have
multi-dimensional and non-linear preferences. Understanding good auctions for
these environments is considered to be the main challenge in Bayesian optimal
mechanism design. In these environments maximizing marginal revenue may not be
optimal and there is sometimes no direct way to implement the marginal revenue
maximization. Our contributions are three fold: we characterize the settings
for which marginal revenue maximization is optimal (by identifying an important
condition that we call revenue linearity), we give simple procedures for
implementing marginal revenue maximization in general, and we show that
marginal revenue maximization is approximately optimal. Our approximation
factor smoothly degrades in a term that quantifies how far the environment is
from ideal (where marginal revenue maximization is optimal). Because the
marginal revenue mechanism is optimal for single-dimensional agents, our
generalization immediately approximately extends many results for
single-dimensional agents.
  One of the biggest open questions in Bayesian algorithmic mechanism design is
developing methodologies that are not brute-force in the size of the agent type
space. Our methods identify a subproblem that, e.g., for unit-demand agents
with values drawn from product distributions, enables approximation mechanisms
that are polynomial in the dimension.

sequentially continuous map defined on a compact convex set with no approximate

successful applications of quantum information processing, highlighting the

protect the security of shared encryption keys. Here we present a new and
fundamentally different approach to high-capacity, high-efficiency QKD by
exploiting interplay between cross-disciplinary ideas from quantum information
and light scattering of aperiodic photonic media. The novelty of the proposed
approach relies on a unique type of entangled-photon source and a new physical
mechanism for efficiently sharing keys. The new source produces entangled
photons with orbital angular momenta (OAM) randomly distributed among Fibonacci
numbers. Combining entanglement with the mathematical properties of Fibonacci
sequences leads to a new QKD protocol. This Fibonacci protocol is immune to
photon-number-splitting attacks and allows secure generation of long keys from
few photons. Unlike other protocols, reference frame alignment and active
modulation of production and detection bases are unnecessary, since security
does not require use of non-orthogonal polarization measurements.

boundaries (GBs) can couple to applied shear stresses and be moved by them,
producing shear deformation of the lattice traversed by their motion. While
this coupling effect has been well confirmed for symmetrical tilt GBs, little
is known about the coupling ability of asymmetrical boundaries. In this work we
apply a combination of molecular dynamics and phase field crystal simulations
to investigate stress-driven motion of asymmetrical GBs between cubic crystals
over the entire range of inclination angles. Our main findings are that the
coupling effect exists for most of the asymmetrical GBs and that the coupling
factor exhibits a non-trivial dependence on both the misorientation and
inclination angles. This dependence is characterized by a discontinuous change
of sign of the coupling factor, which reflects a transition between two
different coupling modes over a narrow range of angles. Importantly, the
magnitude of the coupling factor becomes large or divergent within this
transition region, thereby giving rise to a sliding-like behavior. Our results
are interpreted in terms of a diagram presenting the domains of existence of
the two coupling modes and the transition region between them in the plane of
misorientation and inclination angles. The simulations reveal some of the
dislocation mechanisms responsible for the motion of asymmetrical tilt GBs. The
results of this study compare favorably with existing experimental measurements
and provide a theoretical ground for the design of future experiments.

Since network representation can be very complex and can contain different

focuses on some of these properties and establishes, explicitly or implicitly,
its own definition of community. According to this definition it then extracts
the communities that are able to reflect only some of the features of real

CCF, w_p(r_p), and the real-space CCF, xi(r). The VDP is then extracted from
the redshift distortion in xi(r_p, pi), by comparing xi(r_p, pi) with xi(r). We
find that the velocity dispersion (VD) within virial radius (R_200) shows a
roughly flat profile, with a slight increase at radii below ~0.3 R_200 for high
mass systems. The average VD within the virial radius, sigma_v, is a strongly
increasing function of central galaxy mass. We apply the same methodology to
N-body simulations with the concordance Lambda cold dark matter cosmology but
different values of the density fluctuation parameter sigma_8, and we compare
the results to the SDSS results. We show that the sigma_v-M_* relation from the
data provides stringent constraints on both sigma_8 and sigma_ms, the
dispersion in log M_* of central galaxies at fixed halo mass. Our best-fitting
model suggests sigma_8 = 0.86 +/- 0.03 and sigma_ms = 0.16 +/- 0.03. The
slightly higher value of sigma_8 compared to the WMAP7 result might be due to a
smaller matter density parameter assumed in our simulations. Our VD
measurements also provide a direct measure of the dark matter halo mass for
central galaxies of different luminosities and masses, in good agreement with
the results obtained by Mandelbaum et al. (2006) from stacking the

using full radiation transfer, but differ considerably from preceding
multi-dimensional studies with the barotropic approximation. The protostellar
cores evolve virtually spherically symmetric in the ideal MHD models because of
efficient angular momentum transport by magnetic fields, but Ohmic dissipation
enables the formation of the circumstellar disks in the vicinity of the
protostellar cores as in previous MHD studies with the barotropic

symmetron models of modified gravity using a generic parameterisation which
describes a large class of scenarios using only a few parameters, such as the
coupling between the scalar field and the matter, and the range of the scalar
force on very large scales. For this we have modified the N-body simulation
code ECOSMOG, which is a variant of RAMSES working in modified gravity
scenarios, to perform a set of 110 simulations for different models and
parameter values, including the default LCDM. These simulations enable us to
explore a large portion of the parameter space. We have studied the effects of
modified gravity on the matter power spectrum and mass function, and found a
rich and interesting phenomenology where the difference with the LCDM template
cannot be reproduced by a linear analysis even on scales as large as k~0.05
h/Mpc. Our results show the full effect of screening on nonlinear structure
formation and the associated deviation from LCDM. We also investigate how
differences in the force mediated by the scalar field in modified gravity
models lead to qualitatively different features for the nonlinear power
spectrum and the halo mass function, and how varying the individual model
parameters changes these observables. The differences are particularly large in
the nonlinear power spectra whose shapes for f(R), dilaton and symmetron models
vary greatly, and where the characteristic bump around 1 h/Mpc of f(R) models
is preserved for symmetrons, whereas an increase on much smaller scales is
particular to symmetrons. No bump is present for dilatons where a flattening of
the power spectrum takes place on small scales. These deviations from LCDM and
the differences between modified gravity models, such as dilatons and
symmetrons, could be tested with future surveys.

commissioning beginning in 2009, the telescope, instruments, software systems
and operations are nearly ready to begin the main science survey. Through a
spectral survey of millions of objects in much of the northern sky, LAMOST will
enable research in a number of contemporary cutting edge topics in
astrophysics, such as: discovery of the first generation stars in the Galaxy,
pinning down the formation and evolution history of galaxies especially
theMilky Way and its central massive black hole, looking for signatures of dark
matter distribution and possible sub-structures in the Milky Way halo. To
maximize the scientific potential of the facility, wide national participation
and international collaboration has been emphasized. The survey has two major
components: the LAMOST ExtraGAlactic Survey (LEGAS), and the LAMOST Experiment
for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (LEGUE). Until LAMOST reaches its
full capability, the LEGUE portion of the survey will use the available
observing time, starting in 2012. An overview of the LAMOST project and the
survey that will be carried out in next five to six years is presented in this
paper. The science plan for the whole LEGUE survey, instrumental

formation rates (SFR) and lie on the red-sequence than central (field)
galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from SDSS DR7, together with a
cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star
formation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of M_star > 5 x 10^9
M_sun at z=0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing
and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly
accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z~0.5, or ~5 Gyr
ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their
time of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the
evolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we
constrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of
satellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant
process for building up all quiescent galaxies at M_star < 10^10 M_sun. We then
constrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid'
quenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall,
after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of < 0.8
Gyr. These quenching timescales are shorter for more massive satellites but do
not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescent
fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a
lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible
for up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long
time delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar
mass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact
provides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.

forming dwarf galaxies, defining quenched galaxies as having no Halpha emission
(EW_Halpha < 2 AA) and a strong 4000AA-break. The fraction of quenched dwarf
galaxies decreases rapidly with increasing distance from a massive host,
leveling off for distances beyond 1.5 Mpc. We define galaxies beyond 1.5 Mpc of
a massive host galaxy to be in the field. We demonstrate that there is a
stellar mass threshold of M_stellar < 1.0x10^9 Msun below which quenched

evidence for recent star formation. Correcting for volume effects, this
corresponds to a 1-sigma upper limit on the quenched fraction of 0.06%. In more
dense environments, quenched galaxies account for 23% of the dwarf population
over the same stellar mass range. The majority of quenched dwarf galaxies
(often classified as dwarf elliptical galaxies) are within 2 virial radii of a
massive galaxy, and only a few percent of quenched dwarf galaxies exist beyond

extracted from Lamb shift measurements of muonic and electronic hydrogen
invites speculation that new physics may be to blame. Several proposals have
been made for new particles that account for both the Lamb shift and the muon
anomalous moment discrepancies. Purpose: We explore the possibility that new
particles' couplings to the muon can be fine-tuned to account for all
experimental constraints. Method: We consider two fine-tuned models, the first
involving new particles with scalar and pseudoscalar couplings, and the second
involving new particles with vector and axial couplings. The couplings are
constrained by the Lamb shift and muon magnetic moments measurements while mass
constraints are obtained by kaon decay rate data. Results: For the
scalar-pseudoscalar model, masses between 100 to 200 MeV are not allowed. For
the vector model, masses below about 200 MeV are not allowed. The strength of
the couplings for both models approach that of electrodynamics for particle
masses of about 2 GeV. Conclusions: New physics with fine tuned couplings may
be entertained as a possible explanation for the Lamb shift discrepancy.

number} $S(G,k)$ is the number of partitions of the vertex set of $G$ into $k$
non-empty independent sets. Equivalently it is the number of proper colorings
of $G$ that use exactly $k$ colors, with two colorings identified if they
differ only on the names of the colors. If $G$ is the empty graph on $n$
vertices then $S(G,k)$ reduces to $S(n,k)$, the familiar Stirling number of the
second kind.
  In this note we first consider Stirling numbers of forests. We show that if
$(F^{c(n)}_n)_{n\geq 0}$ is any sequence of forests with $F^{c(n)}_n$ having
$n$ vertices and $c(n)=o(\sqrt{n/\log n})$ components, and if $X^{c(n)}_n$ is a
random variable that takes value $k$ with probability proportional to
$S(F^{c(n)}_n,k)$ (that is, $X^{c(n)}_n$ is the number of classes in a
uniformly chosen partition of $F^{c(n)}_n$ into non-empty independent sets),
then $X^{c(n)}_n$ is asymptotically normal, meaning that suitably normalized it
tends in distribution to the standard normal. This generalizes a seminal result
of Harper on the ordinary Stirling numbers. Along the way we give recurrences
for calculating the generating functions of the sequences $(S(F^c_n,k))_{k \geq
0}$, show that these functions have all real zeroes, and exhibit three
different interlacing patterns between the zeroes of pairs of consecutive
generating functions.
  We next consider Stirling numbers of cycles. We establish asymptotic
normality for the number of classes in a uniformly chosen partition of $C_n$
(the cycle on $n$ vertices) into non-empty independent sets. We give a
recurrence for calculating the generating function of the sequence
$(S(C_n,k))_{k \geq 0}$, and use this to give a direct proof of a log-concavity
result that had previously only been arrived at in a very indirect way.

  Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Observations of the thermal X-ray emission from old radio pulsars implicate
that the size of hot spots is much smaller then the size of the polar cap that
follows from the purely dipolar geometry of pulsar magnetic field. Plausible
explanation of this phenomena is an assumption that the magnetic field at the
stellar surface differs essentially from the purely dipolar field. Using the
conservation of the magnetic flux through the area bounded by open magnetic
field lines we can estimate the surface magnetic field as of the order of
$10^{14}$G. Based on observations that the hot spot temperature is about a few
million Kelvins the Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model was proposed which
assumes that the temperature of the actual polar cap equals to the so called
critical temperature. We discuss correlation between the temperature and
corresponding area of the thermal X-ray emission for a number of pulsars.
  We have found that depending on the conditions in a polar cap region the gap
breakdown can be caused either by the Curvature Radiation (CR) or by the
Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS). When the gap is dominated by ICS the density
of secondary plasma with Lorentz factors $10^{2}-10^{3}$ is at least an order
of magnitude higher then in a CR scenario. We believe that two different gap
breakdown scenarios can explain the mode-changing phenomenon and in particular
the pulse nulling. Measurements of the characteristic spacing between
sub-pulses ($P_{2}$) and the period at which a pattern of pulses crosses the
pulse window ($P_{3}$) allowed us to determine more strict conditions for
avalanche pair production in the PSG.

access network where multiple multi-antenna base stations (BSs) are connected
to a central unit, also referred to as cloud decoder, via capacity-constrained
backhaul links. Since the signals received at different BSs are correlated,
distributed source coding strategies are potentially beneficial, and can be
implemented via sequential source coding with side information. For the problem
of compression with side information, available compression strategies based on
the criteria of maximizing the achievable rate or minimizing the mean square
error are reviewed first. It is observed that, in either case, each BS requires
information about a specific covariance matrix in order to realize the
advantage of distributed source coding. Since this covariance matrix depends on
the channel realizations corresponding to other BSs, a robust compression
method is proposed for a practical scenario in which the information about the
covariance available at each BS is imperfect. The problem is formulated using a
deterministic worst-case approach, and an algorithm is proposed that achieves a
stationary point for the problem. Then, BS selection is addressed with the aim
of reducing the number of active BSs, thus enhancing the energy efficiency of
the network. An optimization problem is formulated in which compression and BS
selection are performed jointly by introducing a sparsity-inducing term into
the objective function. An iterative algorithm is proposed that is shown to
converge to a locally optimal point. From numerical results, it is observed
that the proposed robust compression scheme compensates for a large fraction of
the performance loss induced by the imperfect statistical information.
Moreover, the proposed BS selection algorithm is seen to perform close to the
more complex exhaustive search solution.

be optimally combined in the setting of fault tolerant quantum computing. To
this end we identify the optimal generator set of DD sequences designed to
protect quantum information encoded into stabilizer subspace or subsystem
codes. This generator set, comprising the stabilizers and logical operators of
the code, minimizes a natural cost function associated with the length of DD
sequences. We prove that with the optimal generator set the restrictive
local-bath assumption used in earlier work on hybrid DD-QEC schemes, can be
significantly relaxed, thus bringing hybrid DD-QEC schemes, and their
potentially considerable advantages, closer to realization.

elementary particles. Here we propose a new search for T-odd, P-even (TOPE)
interactions in atoms. We consider open-shell atoms, such as the rare-earth
atoms, which have dense, chaotic excitation spectra with strong level
repulsion. The strength of the level repulsion depends on the underlying
symmetries of the atomic Hamiltonian. TOPE interactions lead to enhanced level
repulsion. We demonstrate how a statistical analysis of many chaotic spectra
can determine the strength of level repulsion; in particular, the variance of
the number of levels in an energy range has been shown to be a useful measure.
We estimate that, using frequency comb spectroscopy, a sufficient number of
chaotic levels could be measured to match or exceed the current experimental
bounds on TOPE interactions.

Under relevant sparsity assumptions on the true covariance matrix, we show that
commonly-used point mass mixture priors on the factor loadings lead to
consistent estimation in the operator norm even when $p\gg n$. One of our major
contributions is to develop a new class of continuous shrinkage priors and
provide insights into their concentration around sparse vectors. Using such
priors for the factor loadings, we obtain similar rate of convergence as
obtained with point mass mixture priors. To obtain the convergence rates, we
construct test functions to separate points in the space of high-dimensional

developed may be of independent interest. We also derive minimax rates and show

based on a cancellation property which is valid under the monotonicity

extraction becomes a popular one in the field of image processing. The
objective of image segmentation is the domain-independent partition of the
image into a set of regions, which are visually distinct and uniform with
respect to some property, such as grey level, texture or colour. Segmentation
and subsequent extraction can be considered the first step and key issue in
object recognition, scene understanding and image analysis. Its application

finding an optimal assignment of the online producer requests to consumers (via
weighted edges) in a complete bipartite graph while ensuring that the total
size of request assigned on a consumer is limited by its capacity. The metric
used to measure the performance in this model is the (minimization of) weighted
sum of the requests assigned on the edges (loads) and their corresponding
weights. We first explore the optimal offline algorithms followed by
competitive analysis of different online techniques. Using oblivious adversary.
LP and Primal-Dual algorithms are used for calculating the optimal offline
solution in O(r*n) time (where r and n are the number of requests and consumers
respectively) while randomized algorithms are used for the online case.
  For the simplified model with equal consumer capacities an average-case
competitive ratio of AVG(d) / MIN(d) (where d is the edge weight / distance) is
achieved using an algorithm that has equal probability for selecting any of the
available edges with a running time of $O(r)$. In the extending the model to

feedback control studied in [35,50] is re-investigated in depth. Firstly, the
optimization methods in [35,50] are extended to a multi-step optimization
algorithm which utilizes ideal squeezers. Secondly, a two-stage optimization
approach is proposed on the basis of controller parametrization. Numerical
studies show that closed-loop systems designed via the second approach may
offer LQG control performance even better than that when the closed-loop
systems are in the vacuum state. When ideal squeezers in a close-loop system
are replaced by (more realistic) degenerate parametric amplifiers, a sufficient
condition is derived for the asymptotic stability of the resultant new
closed-loop system; the issue of performance convergence is also discussed in
the LQG control setting.

in the interpretation of Dirac equation. We revisit it to understand the
correspondence between Maxwell-Dirac and Maxwell-Lorentz theories. Arguments
are presented to show that classical charge current corresponds to Gordon
current. Consistency with Maxwell-Dirac theory leads to a new result:
antisymmetric spin tensor in spin magnetization current of Dirac electron must
be hidden as internal part of classical Maxwell tensor. It becomes natural to
extend our previous interpretation in which electromagnetic field tensor
represents angular momentum of photon or spacetime fluid (aether!) in the
presence of sources such that the duality between field and source disappears.
Both Gordon current and spin current are proposed to have 'spinning origin'.
Formal expression of Gordon current makes it possible to apply the idea of
optical vortex in this case, and quantized vortex and quantized orbital angular
momentum could be related with the conjecture of mechanical interpretation of
electric charge. Separate mass and charge centers for spinning point charge are
well known in the literature; we discuss them in the context of two-vortex
model of electron and Gordon decomposition.

together with a left Quillen monoidal map $\V\to Sp^{\Sigma}(\V,X)$ sending $X$
to an invertible object. In this paper we use the recent developments in the
subject of Higher Algebra to understand the nature of this construction. Every
symmetric monoidal model category has an underlying symmetric monoidal
$(\infty,1)$-category and the first notion should be understood as a mere
""presentation"" of the second. Our main result is the characterization of the
underlying symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category of $Sp^{\Sigma}(\V,X)$, by
means of a universal property inside the world of symmetric monoidal
$(\infty,1)$-categories. In the process we also describe the link between the
construction of ordinary spectra and the one of symmetric spectra. As a
corollary, we obtain a precise universal characterization for the motivic
stable homotopy theory of schemes with its symmetric monoidal structure. This
characterization trivializes the problem of finding motivic monoidal
realizations and opens the way to compare the motivic theory of schemes with
other motivic theories.
  As an application we provide a new approach to the theory of noncommutative
motives by constructing a stable motivic homotopy theory for the noncommutative
spaces of Kontsevich. For that we introduce an analogue for the Nisnevich
topology in the noncommutative setting. Our universal property for the
classical theory for schemes provides a canonical monoidal map towards these
new noncommutative motives and allows us to compare the two theories.

for three sightlines, we managed to constrain the radius and expansion velocity
of the shell (~ 50-100 pc, 130 km/s), concluding that the shell is truly a
supernova remnant (SNR) rather than other types of shell objects, such as a
giant HII region. We also detected strong FeII absorption lines for this

We suggest that this FeII absorption line originates in a localized FeII-rich
gas cloud that is not completely mixed with plowed ambient interstellar gas
clouds showing other \alpha-element low-ion absorption lines. Along with the Fe
richness, we conclude that the SNR is produced by an SNIa explosion.

strongly depopulated by KI line-absorbing clouds. This fact is supported by the
behavior of the interstellar extinction. We find four high-velocity CaII
components with velocities of >100km/s towards three stars and identify them
with shocked clouds of Vela SNR. We reveal and measure acceleration of two
shocked clouds at the approaching and receding sides of Vela SNR along the same
sight line. The clouds acceleration, velocity, and CaII column density are used
to probe cloud parameters. The total hydrogen column density of both
accelerating clouds is found to be similar (~6*10^{17} cm$^{-2}$) which
indicates that possibly there is a significant amount of small-size clouds in
the vicinity of Vela SNR.

nonstationarities in the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior.
In this case, brain-machine interfaces (BMI) require adaptation of their
decoders to maintain high performance across time. One way to achieve this is
by use of periodical calibration phases, during which the BMI system (or an
external human demonstrator) instructs the user to perform certain movements or
behaviors. This approach has two disadvantages: (i) calibration phases
interrupt the autonomous operation of the BMI and (ii) between two calibration
phases the BMI performance might not be stable but continuously decrease. A
better alternative would be that the BMI decoder is able to continuously adapt
in an unsupervised manner during autonomous BMI operation, i.e. without knowing
the movement intentions of the user.
  In the present article, we present an efficient method for such unsupervised
training of BMI systems for continuous movement control. The proposed method
utilizes a cost function derived from neuronal recordings, which guides a
learning algorithm to evaluate the decoding parameters. We verify the
performance of our adaptive method by simulating a BMI user with an optimal
feedback control model and its interaction with our adaptive BMI decoder. The
simulation results show that the cost function and the algorithm yield fast and
precise trajectories towards targets at random orientations on a 2-dimensional
computer screen. For initially unknown and non-stationary tuning parameters,
our unsupervised method is still able to generate precise trajectories and to
keep its performance stable in the long term. The algorithm can optionally work
also with neuronal error signals instead or in conjunction with the proposed
unsupervised adaptation.

The model
is a two mode truncation of the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation subject to
compressive stress. We consider parameter regimes where the first mode is
unstable and the second mode can be either stable or unstable, and the
remaining modes (neglected) are always stable. Material parameters used
correspond to silicon. The two mode model Hamiltonian is the sum of a
(diagonal) kinetic energy term and a potential energy term. The form of the
potential energy function suggests an analogy with isomerisation reactions in
chemistry. We therefore study the dynamics of the buckled beam using the
conceptual framework established for the theory of isomerisation reactions.
When the second mode is stable the potential energy surface has an index one
saddle and when the second mode is unstable the potential energy surface has an
index two saddle and two index one saddles. Symmetry of the system allows us to
construct a phase space dividing surface between the two ""isomers"" (buckled
states). The energy range is sufficiently wide that we can treat the effects of
the index one and index two saddles in a unified fashion. We have computed
reactive fluxes, mean gap times and reactant phase space volumes for three
stress values at several different energies. In all cases the phase space
volume swept out by isomerizing trajectories is considerably less than the
reactant density of states, proving that the dynamics is highly nonergodic. The
associated gap time distributions consist of one or more `pulses' of
trajectories. Computation of the reactive flux correlation function shows no
sign of a plateau region; rather, the flux exhibits oscillatory decay,
indicating that, for the 2-mode model in the physical regime considered, a rate
constant for isomerization does not exist.

  Monopole",,,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  At classical level, dynamical derivation of the properties and conservation
laws for topologically non-trivial systems from Noether theorem versus the
derivation of the system's properties on topological grounds are considered as
distinct. We do celebrate any agreements in results derived from these two
distinct approaches: i.e. the dynamical versus the topological approach. Here
we consider the Corrigan-Olive-Fairlie-Nuyts solution based on which we study
the stability of the 't Hooft- Polyakov outer field, known as its Higgs vacuum,
and derive its stability, dynamically, from the equations of motion rather than
from the familiar topological approach. Then we use our derived result of the
preservation of the Higgs vacuum asymptotically to derive the stability of the
't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, even if inner core is perturbed, where we base that
on observing that the magnetic charge must be conserved if the Higgs vacuum is
preserved asymptotically. We also, alternatively, note stability of 't
Hooft-Polyakov monopole and the conservation of its magnetic charge by again
using the result of the Higgs vacuum asymptotic preservation to use Eq.(5) to
show that no non-Abelian radiation allowed out of the core as long as the Higgs
vacuum is preserved and restored, by the equations of motion, if perturbed. We
start by deriving the asymptotic equations of motion that are valid for the
monopole's field outside its core; next we derive certain constraints from the
asymptotic equations of motion of the Corrigan-Olive-Fairlie-Nuyts solution to
the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole using the Lagrangian formalism of singular
theories, in particular that of Gitman and Tyutin. The derived constraints will
show clearly the stability of the monopole's Higgs vacuum its restoration by
the equations of motion of the Higgs vacuum, if disturbed.

cheap. The company is then locked up in the storage contract and exposed to
upward market prices, which reduce the company's profit and may even bring it
below zero. We propose a protection means based on an insurance contract, by
which the cloud purchaser is indemnified when the current storage price exceeds
a pre-defined threshold. By applying the financial options theory, we provide a
formula for the insurance price (the premium). By using historical data on
market prices for disks, we apply the formula in realistic scenarios. We show
that the premium grows nearly quadratically with the length of the coverage
period as long as this is below one year, but grows more slowly, though faster
than linearly, over longer coverage periods.
