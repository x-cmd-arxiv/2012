simulations of the accretion flow around the supermassive black hole in the

time radiative cooling processes (synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and inverse
Compton) self-consistently in the dynamics, allowing us to test the common
simplification of ignoring all cooling losses in the modeling of Sgr A*. We
confirm that for Sgr A*, neglecting the cooling losses is a reasonable
approximation if the Galactic centre is accreting below ~10^{-8} Msun/yr i.e.
Mdot < 10^{-7} Mdot_Edd. But above this limit, we show that radiative losses
should be taken into account as significant differences appear in the dynamics
and the resulting spectra when comparing simulations with and without cooling.
This limit implies that most nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei are
in the regime where cooling should be taken into account.
  We further make a parameter study of axisymmetric gas accretion around the
supermassive black hole at the Galactic centre. This approach allows us to
investigate the physics of gas accretion in general, while confronting our
results with the well studied and observed source, Sgr A*, as a test case. We
confirm that the nature of the accretion flow and outflow is strongly dependent
on the initial geometry of the magnetic field. For example, we find it
difficult, even with very high spins, to generate powerful outflows from discs
threaded with multiple, separate poloidal field loops.

the detector. Restricting the analysis to a homogeneous subset of observations,
with the source at the same detector position, we place strong limits on
possible spectral or flux variations from March 2005 to present-day. A slightly
higher temperature (kT~61.5 eV, compared to the average value kT~61 eV) was
instead measured in April 2002. If this difference is not of instrumental
origin, it implies a rate of variation of about 0.15 eV/yr between April 2002

well fit by the sum of two blackbody models, which extrapolate to an optical
flux level in agreement with the observed value.

and corresponding to the Lyapunov spectrum. These subspaces are the analog of
linearized invariant manifolds for non-periodic points, so the angles between
them can be used to quantify the degree of hyperbolicity of generic orbits;
however, being such splitting non invariant under smooth transformations of
phase space, it is interesting to investigate the properties of transversality
when coordinates change, e.g. to study it in distinct dynamical systems. To
illustrate this issue on the Chirikov-Taylor standard map we compare the
probability densities of transversality for two different coordinate systems;
these are connected by a linear transformation that deforms splitting angles
through phase space, changing also the probability density of almost-zero
angles although complete tangencies are in fact invariant. This is completely
due to the PDF transformation law and strongly suggests that any statistical
inference from such distributions must be generally taken with care.

  Theorem",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let H be a k-uniform hypergraph whose vertices are the integers 1,...,N. We
say that H contains a monotone path of length n if there are x_1 < x_2 < ... <
x_{n+k-1} so that H contains all n edges of the form
{x_i,x_{i+1},...,x_{i+k-1}}. Let N_k(q,n) be the smallest integer N so that
every q-coloring of the edges of the complete k-uniform hypergraph on N
vertices contains a monochromatic monotone path of length n. While the study of
N_k(q,n) for specific values of k and q goes back (implicitly) to the seminal
1935 paper of Erdos and Szekeres, the problem of bounding N_k(q,n) for
arbitrary k and q was studied by Fox, Pach, Sudakov and Suk.
  Our main contribution here is a novel approach for bounding the Ramsey-type
numbers N_k(q,n), based on establishing a surprisingly tight connection between
them and the enumerative problem of counting high-dimensional integer
partitions. Some of the concrete results we obtain using this approach are the
following:
  1. We show that for every fixed q we have N_3(q,n)=2^{\Theta(n^{q-1})}, thus
resolving an open problem raised by Fox et al.
  2. We show that for every k >= 3, N_k(2,n)=2^{\cdot^{\cdot^{2^{(2-o(1))n}}}}
where the height of the tower is k-2, thus resolving an open problem raised by
Elias and Matousek.
  3. We give a new pigeonhole proof of the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres Theorem on
cups-vs-caps, similar to Seidenberg's proof of the Erdos-Szekeres Lemma on
increasing/decreasing subsequences.

analytical description of the accretion disk, its toroidal surface, the

from the source of the inner surface of the torus increases with increasing
fluid angular momentum but decreases with increasing energy function defined as
the value of the effective potential for that momentum. The location of torus
maximum thickness moves towards the external regions of the surface with
increasing angular momentum, until it reaches a maximum an then decreases.

cosmological model with a massless free scalar field. We compare the consistent
histories approach with the de Broglie-Bohm theory when applied to this simple
model under two different quantization schemes: the Schr\""odinger-like
quantization, which essentially takes the square-root of the resulting
Klein-Gordon equation through the restriction to positive frequencies and their
associated Newton-Wigner states, or the induced Klein-Gordon quantization, that
allows both positive and negative frequencies together. We show that the
consistent histories approach can give a precise answer to the question
concerning the existence of a quantum bounce if and only if one takes the
single frequency approach and within a single family of histories, namely, a
family containing histories concerning properties of the quantum system at only
two specific moments of time: the infinity past and the infinity future. In
that case, as shown by Craig and Singh \cite{CS}, there is no quantum bounce.
In any other situation, the question concerning the existence of a quantum
bounce has no meaning in the consistent histories approach. On the contrary, we
show that if one considers the de Broglie-Bohm theory, there are always states
where quantum bounces occur in both quantization schemes. Hence the assertion
that the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization does not solve the singularity problem in
cosmology is not precise. To address this question, one must specify not only
the quantum interpretation adopted but also the quantization scheme chosen.

reduce the dimensionality of the estimation problem. In this paper we propose
model selection as a general principle for finding the simplest, or most
parsimonious explanation of the data, by fitting different models and choosing
the estimator with the best trade-off between likelihood fit and model
complexity. We apply two well established model selection methods -- the Akaike
information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) -- to
models consising of states of fixed rank and datasets such as are currently
produced in multiple ions experiments. We test the performance of AIC and BIC
on randomly chosen low rank states of 4 ions, and study the dependence of the
selected rank with the number of measurement repetitions for one ion states. We
then apply the methods to real data from a 4 ions experiment aimed at creating
a Smolin state of rank 4. The two methods indicate that the optimal model for
describing the data lies between ranks 6 and 9, and the Pearson $\chi^{2}$ test
is applied to validate this conclusion. Additionally we find that the mean
square error of the maximum likelihood estimator for pure states is close to
that of the optimal over all possible measurements.

has the blastwave interacting with the progenitor's circumstellar matter to
produce a hot region bounded by a forward and a reverse shock. This region is
thought to be responsible for most of the X-ray and radio emission from these
objects. Yet the origin of X-rays from these supernovae is not well understood
quantitatively. The relative contributions of particle acceleration and
magnetic field amplification in generating the X-ray and radio emission need to
be determined. In this work we analyze archival Chandra observations of SN

optical information. We determine the pre-explosion mass loss rate, blastwave
velocity, electron acceleration and magnetic field amplification efficiencies.
We find that a greater fraction of the thermal energy goes into accelerating
electrons than into amplifying magnetic fields. We conclude that the X-ray
emission arises out of a combination of inverse Compton scattering by
non-thermal electrons accelerated in the forward shock and thermal emission
from supernova ejecta heated by the reverse shock.

observatory for proton decay, neutrino, and astroparticle physics. The
megaton-scale detector would be an ideal target for a CERN-based neutrino beam
with baselines ranging from 130 km to 2300 km. We perform a detailed study to
assess the physics reach of the three detector options - a 440 kton water
\v{C}erenkov, a 100 kton liquid argon and a 50 kton liquid scintillator
detector - at each of the possible locations, taking into account the recent
measurement of $\theta_{13}$. We study the impact of the beam properties and
detector performances on the sensitivity to CP-violation and the mass
hierarchy. We find that a liquid argon or water \v{C}erenkov detector can make
a $3\sigma$ discovery of CP violation for $60%-70%$ of the parameter space for
any of the baselines under consideration, although the results for the liquid
argon detector placed at 130 km are slightly worse and only $40%-50%$ is
achieved in this case. The performance of the liquid scintillator detector is
affected by its level of neutral-current background at all baselines. A
$3\sigma$ determination of the mass hierarchy is possible for all values of
$\delta$, for the values of $\theta_{13}$ favoured at $3\sigma$ by Daya Bay and
RENO, for almost all setups with $L\gtrsim 650$ km.

dependence of close kinematic galaxy pair fractions in the redshift range 0.2 <
z < 1. The fraction of close pairs is three times higher in the top density
quartile than in the lowest one. This environmental variation in pair fractions
will translate into merger fractions since merger timescales are shown, based
on Millennium simulation catalogs, to be largely independent of environment.
While galactic properties of close kinematic pairs (morphologies and star
formation rates) may seem to be non-representative of an underlying galaxy
population, they can be explained by taking into account well-known effects of
environment, and changes caused by interactions. The latter is responsible for
an increase of irregular galaxies in pairs by a factor of 50-75%, with a
disproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs (4-8
times), due to disturbance of about 15% of the disk galaxies in pairs. Another
sign of interaction is an observed boost in specific star formation rate
(factor 2-4) for the closest pairs. While significant for paired galaxies, this
triggered star-formation due to interactions represents only about 5% of the
integrated star-formation activity in our volume-limited sample. Although
majority of close kinematic pairs are in dense environments, the effects of
interactions appear to be strongest in the lower density environments. This may
introduce strong biases into observational studies of mergers, especially those
based on morphological criteria. Relative excess of post-starburst galaxies
observed in paired galaxies (factor \sim2) as well as excess of AGNs (factor of
over 2), linked with environmental dependence of the pair fractions could
indicate that early phases of interactions and merging are plausible candidates
for environmental quenching, observed in the global galaxy populations.

that Y-J color drops precipitously between the very latest T dwarfs and the Y
dwarfs. The fact that this is seen in (coeval, mono-metallicity) binaries
demonstrates that the color drop arises from a change in temperature, not
surface gravity or metallicity variations among the field population. Thus, the
T/Y transition established by near-IR spectra coincides with a significant
change in the ~1 micron fluxes of ultracool photospheres. One explanation is
the depletion of potassium, whose broad absorption wings dominate the far-red
optical spectra of T dwarfs. This large color change suggests that far-red data
may be valuable for classifying objects of <~500 K.

WFC3/UVIS filters F275W and F336W. From these data we have assembled a sample
of \sim4000 UV-bright, old stars, vastly larger than previously available. We
use updated Padova stellar evolutionary tracks to classify these hot stars into
three classes: Post-AGB stars (P-AGB), Post-Early AGB (PE-AGB) stars and
AGB-manqu\'e stars. P-AGB stars are the end result of the asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) phase and are expected in a wide range of stellar populations,
whereas PE-AGB and AGB-manqu\'e (together referred to as the hot
post-horizontal branch; HP-HB) stars are the result of insufficient envelope
masses to allow a full AGB phase, and are expected to be particularly prominent
at high helium or {\alpha} abundances when the mass loss on the RGB is high.
Our data support previous claims that most UV-bright sources in the bulge are
likely hot (extreme) horizontal branch stars (EHB) and their progeny. We
construct the first radial profiles of these stellar populations, and show that
they are highly centrally concentrated, even more so than the integrated UV or
optical light. However, we find that this UV-bright population does not
dominate the total UV luminosity at any radius, as we are detecting only the
progeny of the EHB stars that are the likely source of the UVX. We calculate
that only a few percent of MS stars in the central bulge can have gone through
the HP-HB phase and that this percentage decreases strongly with distance from
the center. We also find that the surface density of hot UV-bright stars has
the same radial variation as that of low-mass X-ray binaries. We discuss age,
metallicity, and abundance variations as possible explanations for the observed
radial variation in the UV-bright population.

the signpost AGN, but it is not detected in CO despite ~20,000 km/s of velocity
coverage. Also in the 6C1909+72 field, a large, red dust feature spanning ~500
kpc is aligned with the radio jet. We suggest several processes by which
metal-rich material may have been transported, favouring a collimated outflow
reminiscent of the jet-oriented metal enrichment seen in local cluster
environments. Our interferometric imaging reveals a gas-rich companion to
B3J2330+3927; indeed, all bar one of the eight z >~ 2 radio galaxies (or
companions) detected in CO provide some evidence that starburst activity in
radio-loud AGN at high redshift is driven by the interaction of two or more
gas-rich systems in which a significant mass of stars has already formed,
rather than via steady accretion of cold gas from the cosmic web. We find that
the CO Tb ratios in radio-loud AGN host galaxies are significantly higher than
those seen in similarly intense starbursts where AGN activity is less
pronounced. Our most extreme example, where L'(CO4-3)/L'(CO1-0) > 2.7, provides
evidence that significant energy is being deposited rapidly into the molecular
gas via X-rays and/or mechanical (`quasar-mode') feedback from the AGN, leading
to a high degree of turbulence globally and a low optical depth in 12CO -
feedback that may lead to the cessation of star formation on a timescale
commensurate with that of the jet activity, <~10 Myr.

was selected to represent pure, actively star-forming systems, absent of active
galactic nuclei. The large lensing magnifications result in high
signal-to-noise spectra that can probe faint IR recombination lines, including
Pa-alpha and Br-alpha at high redshifts. The sample was augmented by three
lensed galaxies with similar suites of unpublished data and observations from
the literature, resulting in the final sample of seven galaxies. We use the IR
recombination lines in conjunction with H-alpha observations to probe the
extinction, Av, of these systems, as well as testing star formation rate (SFR)
indicators against the SFR measured by fitting spectral energy distributions to
far-IR photometry. Our galaxies occupy a range of Av from ~0 to 5.9 mag, larger
than previously known for a similar range of IR luminosities at these
redshifts. Thus, estimates of SFR even at z ~ 2 must take careful count of
extinction in the most IR luminous galaxies. We also measure extinction by
comparing SFR estimates from optical emission lines with those from far-IR
measurements. The comparison of results from these two independent methods
indicates a large variety of dust distribution scenarios at 1 < z < 3. Without
correcting for dust extinction, the H-alpha SFR indicator underestimates the
SFR; the size of the necessary correction depends on the IR luminosity and dust
distribution scenario. Individual SFR estimates based on the 6.2 micron PAH
emission line luminosity do not show a systematic discrepancy with extinction,
although a considerable, ~0.2 dex scatter is observed.

confirm the existence of massive planets at relatively large separations, but
dedicated surveys are required to estimate the frequency of similar planetary
systems. To measure the first estimation of the giant exoplanetary systems
frequency at large orbital separation around A-stars, we have conducted a
deep-imaging survey of young (8-400 Myr), nearby (19-84 pc) A- and F-stars to
search for substellar companions in the 10-300 AU range. The sample of 42 stars
combines all A-stars observed in previous AO planet search surveys reported in
the literature with new AO observations from VLT/NaCo and Gemini/NIRI. It
represents an initial subset of the International Deep Planet Survey (IDPS)
sample of stars covering M- to B-stars. The data were obtained with
diffraction-limited observations in H- and Ks-band combined with angular
differential imaging to suppress the speckle noise of the central stars,
resulting in typical 5-sigma detection limits in magnitude difference of 12 mag
at 1"", 14 mag at 2"" and 16 mag at 5"" which is sufficient to detect massive
planets. A detailed statistical analysis of the survey results is performed
using Monte Carlo simulations. Considering the planet detections, we estimate
the fraction of A-stars having at least one massive planet (3-14 MJup) in the
range 5-320 AU to be inside 5.9-18.8% at 68% confidence, assuming a flat
distribution for the mass of the planets. By comparison, the brown dwarf (15-75
MJup) frequency for the sample is 2.0-8.9% at 68% confidence in the range 5-320
AU. Assuming power law distributions for the mass and semimajor axis of the
planet population, the AO data are consistent with a declining number of
massive planets with increasing orbital radius which is distinct from the
rising slope inferred from radial velocity (RV) surveys around evolved A-stars.

incorporate the evolution of galaxy properties with cosmic time. We determine
the position between the snapshot outputs at which a galaxy enters the
observer's lightcone by interpolation. As an application, we consider the
effectiveness of the BzK colour selection technique, which was designed to
isolate galaxies in the redshift interval 1.4<z<2.5. The mock catalogue is in
reasonable agreement with the observed number counts of all BzK galaxies, as
well as with the observed counts of the subsample of BzKs that are star-forming
galaxies. We predict that over 75 per cent of the model galaxies with
K_{AB}<=23, and 1.4<z<2.5, are selected by the BzK technique. Interloper
galaxies, outside the intended redshift range, are predicted to dominate bright
samples of BzK galaxies (i.e. with K_{AB}<=21). Fainter K-band cuts are
necessary to reduce the predicted interloper fraction. We also show that
shallow B-band photometry can lead to confusion in classifying BzK galaxies as
being star-forming or passively evolving. Overall, we conclude that the BzK

one of the highest redshift spectroscopically-confirmed SNe known to date. The
spectrum is characterized by broad absorption features typical of previous
ULSNe (e.g., CII, SiIII), and by strong and narrow MgII and FeII absorption
lines from the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy, confirmed by an
[OII]3727 emission line at the same redshift. The equivalent widths of the
FeII2600 and MgII2803 lines are in the top quartile of the quasar intervening
absorption system distribution, but are weaker than those of gamma-ray burst
intrinsic absorbers (i.e., GRB host galaxies). We also detect the host galaxy
in pre-explosion Pan-STARRS1 data and find that its UV spectral energy
distribution is best fit with a young stellar population age of tau~15-45 Myr

emitters (HAEs) at z=2.23. The HAEs are detected in the Hi-Z Emission Line
Survey (HiZELS), a large-area blank field 2.121um narrowband survey using the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Wide Field Camera (WFCAM). Averaging
the two-point correlation function of HAEs in two ~1 degree scale fields
(United Kingdom Infrared Deep Sky Survey/Ultra Deep Survey [UDS] and
Cosmological Evolution Survey [COSMOS] fields) we find a clustering amplitude
equivalent to a correlation length of r_0=3.7+/-0.3 Mpc/h for galaxies with
star formation rates of >7 M_sun/yr. The data are well-fitted by the expected
correlation function of Cold Dark Matter, scaled by a bias factor:
omega_HAE=b^2 omega_DM where b=2.4^{+0.1}_{-0.2}. The corresponding
'characteristic' mass for the halos hosting HAEs is
log(M_h/[M_sun/h])=11.7+/-0.1. Comparing to the latest semi-analytic GALFORM
predictions for the evolution of HAEs in a LCDM cosmology, we find broad
agreement with the observations, with GALFORM predicting a HAE correlation
length of ~4 Mpc/h. Motivated by this agreement, we exploit the simulations to
construct a parametric model of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) of HAEs,
and use this to fit the observed clustering. Our best-fitting HOD can
adequately reproduce the observed angular clustering of HAEs, yielding an
effective halo mass and bias in agreement with that derived from the scaled
omega_DM fit, but with the relatively small sample size the current data
provide a poor constraint on the HOD. Our results support the broad picture
that 'typical' (~L*) star-forming galaxies have been hosted by dark matter
haloes with M_h<10^12 M_sun/h since z~2, but with a broad occupation
distribution and clustering that is likely to be a strong function of
luminosity.

custodial symmetry, and a good precision electroweak fit requires tuning of

spectrum of hadrons at the TeV scale that can be observed by looking for a peak

relativistic shock, is known to have serious problems to explain the observed
gamma-ray spectrum below the peak for most Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs); the
synchrotron spectrum below the peak is much softer than observed spectra.
Recently, the possibility that electrons responsible for the radiation cool via
Inverse Compton, but in the Klein-Nishina regime, has been proposed as a
solution to this problem. We provide an analytical study of this effect and
show that it leads to a hardening of the low energy spectrum but not by enough
to make it consistent with the observed spectra for most GRBs (this is assuming
that electrons are injected continuously over a time scale comparable to the
dynamical time scale, as is expected for internal shocks of GRBs). In
particular, we find that it is not possible to obtain a spectrum with
\alpha>-0.1 (f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha}) whereas the typical observed value
is \alpha\sim0. Moreover, extreme values for a number of parameters are
required in order that \alpha\sim-0.1: the energy fraction in magnetic field
needs to be less than about 10^{-4}, the thermal Lorentz factor of electrons
should be larger than 10^6, and the radius where gamma-rays are produced should
be not too far away from the deceleration radius. These difficulties suggest
that the synchrotron radiation mechanism in internal shocks does not provide a
self-consistent solution when \alpha>-0.2.

physical model (extended topological quintessence) which naturally predicts a
spherical inhomogeneous distribution for both dark energy density and fine
structure constant values. The model is based on the existence of a recently
formed giant global monopole with Hubble scale core which also couples
non-minimally to electromagnetism. Aligned dipole anisotropies would naturally
emerge for an off-centre observer for both the fine structure constant and for
dark energy density. This model smoothly reduces to \lcdm for proper limits of
its parameters. Two predictions of this model are (a) a correlation between the
existence of strong cosmic electromagnetic fields and the value of $\alpha$ and
(b) the existence of a dark flow on Hubble scales due to the repulsive gravity
of the global defect core (`Great Repulser') aligned with the dark energy and
$\alpha$ dipoles. The direction of the dark flow is predicted to be towards the
spatial region of lower accelerating expansion. Existing data about the dark
flow are consistent with this prediction.

areas, from physics (e.g. wave phenomena, fluid dynamics) to engineering (e.g.
signal processing, filter design). Even though the significance of PSWFs was
realized at least half a century ago, and they frequently occur in
applications, their analytical properties have not been investigated as much as
those of many other special functions. In particular, despite some recent
progress, the gap between asymptotic expansions and numerical experience, on
the one hand, and rigorously proven explicit bounds and estimates, on the other
hand, is still rather wide.
  This paper attempts to improve the current situation. We analyze the
differential operator associated with PSWFs, to derive fairly tight estimates
on its eigenvalues. By combining these inequalities with a number of standard
techniques, we also obtain several other properties of the PSFWs. The results
are illustrated via numerical experiments.

well beyond the Bondi radius down to the vicinity of the black hole. We produce

Standard Model to be at the deca-TeV (10 TeV) scale or higher. This raises the
question of whether there are interesting deca-TeV models for which the LHC may
find direct clues. A possible scenario for such physics is a 5D warped model of
fermion masses and mixing, with Kaluza-Klein masses m_KK ~ 10 TeV, allowing it
to avoid tension with stringent constraints, especially from flavor data.
Discovery of a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson, for which there are some hints
at ~125 GeV at the LHC, would also require the KK masses to be at or above 10
TeV. These warped models generically predict the appearance of a much lighter
radion scalar. We find that, in viable warped models of flavor, a radion with a
mass of a few hundred GeV and an inverse coupling of order m_KK ~ 10 TeV could
typically be accessible to the LHC experiments -- with sqrt(s) = 14 TeV and 100
fb^-1 of data. The above statements can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to 4D
dual models, where conformal dynamics and a dilaton replace warping and the
radion, respectively. Detection of such a light and narrow scalar could thus
herald the proximity of a new physical threshold and motivate experiments that
would directly probe the deca-TeV mass scale.

underlying host galaxy. The sample of heavily obscured quasars represents a
significant fraction of the cosmic mass accretion on supermassive black holes

quasar luminosity function. We find that only a small fraction (4%, at most
11-25%) of the quasar host galaxies are major mergers. Fits to their surface

dominated, or have a significant disk. This disk-like host morphology, and the
corresponding weakness of bulges, is evidence against major mergers and

collective fluctuations, treating both pairing and density fluctuations for
interaction strengths ranging from weak to strong coupling. We find evidence
for a sharp sound mode, together with a well-defined Leggett mode over a wide

flow-induced softening of these collective modes leads to dynamical

written as a sum of cross-power spectra between number weighted velocity
moments. We investigate the properties of these power spectra for simulated
galaxies and dark matter halos and compare them to the dark matter power
spectra, generalizing the concept of the bias. Because all of the quantities
are number weighted this approach is well defined even for sparse systems such
as massive halos, in contrasts to the previous approaches to RSD where velocity
correlations have been explored. We find that the number density weighting
leads to a strong scale dependence of the bias terms for momentum density
auto-correlation and cross-correlation with density. This trend becomes more
significant for the more biased halos and leads to an enhancement of RSD power
relative to the linear theory. Fingers-of-god effects, which in this formalism
come from the correlations of the higher order moments beyond the momentum
density, lead to smoothing of the power spectrum and can reduce this
enhancement of power, but are relatively small for halos with no small-scale
velocity dispersion. In comparison, for a more realistic galaxy sample with
satellites the velocity dispersion generated by satellite motions inside the
halos leads to a larger power suppression on small scales, but this depends on
the satellite fraction. We investigate several statistics such as the
two-dimensional power spectrum, its multipole moments, its powers of mu^2, and
configuration space statistics. Overall we find that the nonlinear effects in
realistic galaxy samples such as luminous red galaxies affect the redshift
space clustering on very large scales: for example, the quadrupole moment is
affected by 10% for k<0.1h/mpc, which means that these effects need to be
understood if we want to extract cosmological information from the redshift
space distortions.

For all considered selections, the efficiency to reconstruct and identify a

non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences identified in a wide variety of organisms.
Systematic characterization of these transcripts will be a tremendous
challenge. Homology detection is critical to making maximal use of functional
information gathered about ncRNAs: identifying homologous sequence allows us to
transfer information gathered in one organism to another quickly and with a
high degree of confidence. ncRNA presents a challenge for homology detection,
as the primary sequence is often poorly conserved and de novo secondary
structure prediction and search remains difficult. This protocol introduces
methods developed by the Rfam database for identifying ""families"" of homologous
ncRNAs starting from single ""seed"" sequences using manually curated sequence
alignments to build powerful statistical models of sequence and structure
conservation known as covariance models (CMs), implemented in the Infernal
software package. We provide a step-by-step iterative protocol for identifying
ncRNA homologs, then constructing an alignment and corresponding CM. We also
work through an example for the bacterial small RNA MicA, discovering a
previously unreported family of divergent MicA homologs in genus Xenorhabdus in
the process.

present a three-step IM construction, and prove a frequency-calibration

the magnetic excitation spectrum of iron-based superconductors above the
magnetic ordering temperature. Because $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals are
strongly connected with the Fermi surface topology, the nature of magnetic
excitations can be modified significantly due to the presence of either static
or fluctuating orbital correlations. Within a five-orbital itinerant model, we
show that static orbital order generally leads to an enhancement of
commensurate magnetic excitations even when the original Fermi surface lacks
nesting at $(\pi,0)$ or $(0,\pi)$. When long-range orbital order is absent,
Gaussian fluctuations beyond the standard random-phase approximation (RPA)
capture the effects of fluctuating orbital correlations on the magnetic
excitations. We find that commensurate magnetic excitations can also be
enhanced if the orbital correlations are strong. Our results offer a natural
explanation for the incommensurate-to-commensurate transformation observed in a
recent neutron scattering measurement (Z. Xu, et. al., arXiv:1201.4404), and we
propose that this unusual transformation is an important signature to
distinguish orbital from spin physics in the normal state of the pnictides.
Implications for the magnetic and superconducting states are discussed.

SiO/CH3OH and SiO/HNCO ratios argue that shock properties are uniform across
the nucleus. HCN/HCO+, HCN/HNC, HCN/CS and HCN/CO ratios are explained
primarily by variations in density. High HCO+/N2H+ ratios are correlated with
the C2H line, suggesting that this ratio may be a powerful new dense

For decays $B^- \to \bar K_0^{*-} (1430)\rho^0 (\omega)$, the new $Z^\prime$

its contribution might be clouded by large uncertainties from annihilations.
Unfortunately, neither the standard model nor $Z^\prime$ model can reproduce
all experimental data under one certain scenario. We also noted that the CP

Lagrangian we include scalar, vector and 't Hooft interactions. The vector
coupling constant $g_v$ is treated as a free parameter. We also consider that
there is a split between the deconfinement and the chiral phase transitions
which is controlled by changing the conventional value of the vacuum pressure
$- \Omega_0$ in the NJL thermodynamic potential by $- (\Omega_0 + \delta
\Omega_0)$, being $\delta \Omega_0$ a free parameter. We find that, as we
increase the value of $\delta \Omega_0$, hybrid stars have a larger maximum
mass but are less stable, i.e. hybrid configurations are stable within a
smaller range of central densities. For large enough $\delta \Omega_0$, stable
hybrid configurations are not possible at all. The effect of increasing the
coupling constant $g_v$ is very similar. We show that stable hybrid
configurations with a maximum mass larger than the observed mass of the pulsar

only. When the baryon octet is included in the hadronic phase, only a very
small region of the parameter space allows to explain the mass of PSR

bounded interval is by using a Fourier series on a larger domain. When
constructed appropriately, this so-called Fourier extension is known to
converge geometrically fast in the truncation parameter. Unfortunately,
computing a Fourier extension requires solving an ill-conditioned linear
system, and hence one might expect such rapid convergence to be destroyed when
carrying out computations in finite precision. The purpose of this paper is to
show that this is not the case. Specifically, we show that Fourier extensions
are actually numerically stable when implemented in finite arithmetic, and
achieve a convergence rate that is at least superalgebraic. Thus, in this
instance, ill-conditioning of the linear system does not prohibit a good
approximation.
  In the second part of this paper we consider the issue of computing Fourier
extensions from equispaced data. A result of Platte, Trefethen & Kuijlaars
states that no method for this problem can be both numerically stable and
exponentially convergent. We explain how Fourier extensions relate to this

this problem: namely, they obtain at least superalgebraic convergence in a
numerically stable manner.

that the original file $F$ can be reconstructed from any $m$ pieces. The core
of an IDA is the adopted non-systematic $m$-of-$n$ erasure code. This paper
makes a systematic study on the \emph{confidentiality} of an IDA and its
connection with the adopted erasure code. Two levels of confidentiality are
defined: \emph{weak confidentiality} (in the case where some parts of the
original file $F$ can be reconstructed explicitly from fewer than $m$ pieces)
and \emph{strong confidentiality} (in the case where nothing of the original
file $F$ can be reconstructed explicitly from fewer than $m$ pieces). For an
IDA that adopts an arbitrary non-systematic erasure code, its confidentiality
may fall into weak confidentiality. To achieve strong confidentiality, this
paper explores a sufficient and feasible condition on the adopted erasure code.
Then, this paper shows that Rabin's IDA has strong confidentiality. At the same
time, this paper presents an effective way to construct an IDA with strong
confidentiality from an arbitrary $m$-of-$(m+n)$ erasure code. Then, as an
example, this paper constructs an IDA with strong confidentiality from a
Reed-Solomon code, the computation complexity of which is comparable to or

information must be done in a secure way especially in case of a private
message. Mathematicians and Engineers have historically relied on different
algorithmic techniques to secure messages and signals. Cryptography, to most
people, is concerned with keeping communications private. Indeed, the
protection of sensitive communications has been the emphasis of cryptography
throughout much of its history. Sometimes it is safer to send a message using
an image and thus cryptography can also be done using images during an
emergency. The need to extract information from images and interpret their
contents has been one of the driving factors in the development of image
processing and cryptography during the past decades. In this paper, a simple
cryptographic method was used to decode a message which was in an image and it
was done using a popular computational software.

not originate from a pulsar, but is consistent with radio-emitting magnetar
spectra. The non-detection of subsequent bursts constrains any possible pulsar
period to $\gtrsim1$ s, and the pulse energy distribution to being much flatter
than typical giant pulse emitting pulsars. The burst is also consistent with
the radio signal theorised from an annihilating mini black hole. Extrapolating

studies revealed an antiferrodistortive phase transition in EuTiO3 ceramics.
Near 300K the perovskite structure changes from cubic Pm-3m to tetragonal
I4/mcm due to antiphase tilting of oxygen octahedra along the c axis (a0a0c- in
Glazer notation). The phase transition is analogous to SrTiO3. However, some
ceramics as well as single crystals of EuTiO3 show different infrared
reflectivity spectra bringing evidence of a different crystal structure. In
such samples electron diffraction revealed an incommensurate tetragonal
structure with modulation wavevector q ~ 0.38 a*. Extra phonons in samples with
modulated structure are activated in the IR spectra due to folding of the
Brillouin zone. We propose that defects like Eu3+ and oxygen vacancies strongly
influence the temperature of the phase transition to antiferrodistortive phase
as well as the tendency to incommensurate modulation in EuTiO3.

harmonic cavities working at 3.9 GHz have been installed in FLASH to linearize

wakefields generated in the 3.9 GHz cavities are significantly larger, their
impact on the beam should be carefully minimized. Therefore our target is to
monitor HOMs and minimize them by aligning the beam on the cavity axis. The
difficulty is that, in comparison to the 1.3 GHz cavities, the HOM-spectrum is
dense, making it difficult to identify individual modes. Also, most modes
propagate through the whole cryo-module containing several cavities, making it
difficult to measure local beam properties. In this paper the options for the
HOM-based beam position monitors are discussed.

monotonically increase their surface nitrogen abundance with time. We use this
effect to design a method for constraining the age and the inclination angle of
massive main sequence stars, given their observed luminosity, effective
temperature, projected rotational velocity and surface nitrogen abundance. This
method relies on stellar evolution models for different metallicities, masses
and rotation rates. We use the population synthesis code STARMAKER to show the
range of applicability of our method. We apply this method to 79 early B-type
main sequence stars near the LMC clusters NGC 2004 and N 11 and the SMC
clusters NGC 330 and NGC 346. From all stars within the sample, 17 were found
to be suitable for an age analysis. For ten of them, which are rapidly rotating
stars without a strong nitrogen enhancement, it has been previously concluded
that they did not evolve as rotationally mixed single stars. This is confirmed
by our analysis, which flags the age of these objects as highly discrepant with
their isochrone ages. For the other seven stars, their nitrogen and isochrone
ages are found to agree within error bars, what validates our method.
Constraints on the inclination angle have been derived for the other 62
stars,with the implication that the nitrogen abundances of the SMC stars, for
which mostly only upper limits are known, fall on average significantly below
those limits. Nitrogen chronology is found to be a new useful tool for testing
stellar evolution and to constrain fundamental properties of massive main

star-triangle relations for the basic building blocks S_1, S_2 and S_3 which
produce all other relations for the general R-operators. In the case of the

for the scalar (spin part is equal to zero) representations and prove that the
star-triangle relation is a well known star-triangle relation for propagators

can differentiate between GRB populations detected by both the BATSE and

redshift--observation-time relation (log\,$Z$\,--\,log\,$T$) is consistent with
both a peak-flux\,--\,observation time relation (log\,$P$\,--\,log\,$T$) and a
standard log\,$N$\,--\,log\,$P$ brightness distribution. As the method depends
only on rarer small-$z$ events, it is invariant to high-$z$ selection effects.
We use the log\,$Z$\,--\,log\,$T$ relation to show that sub-luminous GRBs are a
distinct population occurring at a higher rate of order $150^{+180}_{-90}

accretion rate decreases with decreasing radius; consequently the density
profile of accretion flow becomes flatter compared to the case of a constant
accretion rate. This result has important theoretical and observational
implications. However, because of technical difficulties, the radial dynamic
range in almost all previous simulations usually spans at most two orders of
magnitude. This small dynamical range, combined with the effects of boundary
conditions, makes the simulation results suspectable. Especially, the radial
profiles of density and accretion rate may not be precise enough to be used to
compare with observations. In this paper we present a ""two-zone"" approach to
expand the radial dynamical range from two to four orders of magnitude. We
confirm previous results and find that from $r_s$ to $ 10^4r_s$ the radial
profiles of accretion rate and density can be well described by
$\dot{M}(r)\propto r^s$ and $\rho\propto r^{-p}$. The values of (s, p) are
(0.48, 0.65) and (0.4, 0.85), for viscous parameter $\alpha=0.001$ and 0.01,
respectively. We have looked up numerical simulation works in the literature
and found that the values of $s$ and $p$ are all similar, no matter a magnetic
field is included or not and what kind of initial conditions are adopted. The
density profile we obtain is in good quantitative agreement with that obtained
from the detailed observations and modeling to Sgr A* and NGC 3115. The origin
of such a accretion rate profile will be investigated in a subsequent paper.

examining the energetics of isolated dislocations and interstitials on
capillary bridges with free boundaries. The boundary provides an essential
contribution to the problem, akin to a background charge that ""neutralizes"" the
unbalanced integrated curvature of the surface. This makes it favorable for
topologically neutral dislocations and groups of dislocations - rather than
topologically charged disclinations and scars - to relieve the stress caused by
the unbalanced gaussian curvature of the surface. This effect applies to any
crystal on a surface with non-vanishing integrated Gaussian curvature and

sensitive optical methods such as Faraday rotation. Recent studies have
demonstrated that the frequency, linewidth, and lineshape of this spin noise
directly reveals dynamical spin properties such as dephasing times, relaxation
mechanisms and g-factors without perturbing the spins away from equilibrium.
Here we demonstrate that spin noise measurements using wavelength-tunable probe
light forms the basis of a powerful and novel spectroscopic tool to provide
unique information that is fundamentally inaccessible via conventional linear
optics. In particular, the wavelength dependence of the detected spin noise
power can reveal homogeneous linewidths buried within inhomogeneously-broadened
optical spectra, and can resolve overlapping optical transitions belonging to
different spin systems. These new possibilities are explored both theoretically
and via experiments on spin systems in opposite limits of inhomogeneous
broadening (alkali atom vapors and semiconductor quantum dots).

simulations of hot accretion flows have shown that the mass accretion rate
decreases with decreasing radius. Two models have been proposed to explain this
result. In the ADIOS model, the inward decrease of accretion rate is because of
the loss of gas in the outflow. In the CDAF model, the gas is assumed to be
locked in convective eddies, which results in the inward decrease of the
accretion rate. We investigate the nature of inward decrease of accretion rate
using HD and MHD simulations. We calculate various properties of inflow and
outflow, including the mass flux, radial and rotational velocities,
temperature, and the Bernoulli parameter ($Be$). Systematic and significant
differences between inflow and outflow are found. These results suggest that
the inflow and outflow are not dominated by convective turbulence, but are
systematic inward and outward motion. We have also analyzed the convective
stability of MHD accretion flow and found that they are convectively stable.
These results indicate that the ADIOS scenario is favored. The different
properties of inflow and outflow also suggest that the mechanisms of producing
outflow in HD and MHD flows are buoyancy and centrifugal force associated with
the magnetic field, respectively. The latter mechanism is similar to the
Blandford & Payne mechanism. We also study the effect of initial conditions in
the simulations. We find that the value of $Be$ is mainly determined by the
value of $Be$ of the initial condition. We discuss some possible observational
applications of our outflow model. These observations include the Fermi bubble
observed in the Galaxy center, and winds widely observed in AGNs and black hole
X-ray binaries.

determine the growth rate of the players' strategy shares. In this paper, we
investigate what happens beyond first order by viewing payoffs as higher order

instead of its velocity (a viewpoint which emerges naturally when it comes to
aggregating empirical data of past instances of play). To that end, we derive a
wide class of higher order game dynamics, generalizing first order imitative

dominated strategies become extinct in n-th order payoff-monotonic dynamics n
orders as fast as in the corresponding first order dynamics; furthermore, in
stark contrast to first order, weakly dominated strategies also become extinct
for n>1. All in all, higher order payoff-monotonic dynamics lead to the
elimination of weakly dominated strategies, followed by the iterated deletion
of strictly dominated strategies, thus providing a dynamic justification of the
well-known epistemic rationalizability process of Dekel and Fudenberg (1990).

model in the description of ultra-relativistic beams. The method that we have
used is the following. Firstly, the necessary notions of kinetic theory and
differential geometry of second order differential equations are explained.
Then an averaging procedure is applied to a connection associated with the
Lorentz force equation. The result of this averaging is an affine connection on
the space-time manifold. The corresponding geodesic equation defines the
averaged Lorentz force equation. We prove that for ultra-relativistic beams
described by narrow distribution functions, the solutions of both equations are
similar. This fact justifies the replacement of the Lorentz force equation by
the simpler {\it averaged Lorentz force equation}. After this, for each of
these models we associate the corresponding kinetic model, which are based on
the Vlasov equation and {\it averaged Vlasov equation} respectively. The
averaged Vlasov equation is simpler than the original Vlasov equation. This
fact allows us to prove that the differential operation defining the averaged
charged cold fluid equation is controlled by the {\it diameter of the
distribution function}, by powers of the {\it energy of the beam} and by the
time of evolution $t$. We show that the Vlasov equation and the averaged Vlasov
equation have similar solutions, when the initial conditions are the same.
Finally, as an application of the {\it averaged Lorentz force equation} we
re-derive the beam dynamics formalism used in accelerator physics from the
Jacobi equation of the averaged Lorentz force equation.

global information such as the domain map, their own position (either absolute

Despite the robots' simplicity, we show that they are able, by running a very

domains, including non-planar and multidimensional ones. The novelty of our
algorithm lies in the fact that, unlike previously proposed methods, our
algorithm works on continuous domains without relying on some ""induced""
underlying graph, that effectively reduces the problem to a discrete case of
graph covering. The algorithm guarantees complete coverage of any connected

provides a bounded constant time between two successive visits of the robot,

collapse of large density fluctuations. Tight observational limits on their
abundance constrain the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations on very small
scales which can not otherwise be constrained, with PBH's only forming from the
extremely rare large fluctuations. The number of PBH's formed is therefore
sensitive to small changes in the shape of the tail of the fluctuation
distribution, which itself depends on the amount of non-Gaussianity present. We
study, for the first time, how quadratic and cubic local non-Gaussianity of
arbitrary size (parameterised by f_nl and g_nl respectively) affects the PBH
abundance and the resulting constraints on the amplitude of the fluctuations on
very small scales. Intriguingly we find that even non-linearity parameters of
order unity have a significant impact on the PBH abundance. The sign of the
non-Gaussianity is particularly important, with the constraint on the allowed
fluctuation amplitude tightening by an order of magnitude as f_nl changes from
just -0.5 to 0.5. We find that if PBH's are observed in the future, then
regardless of the amplitude of the fluctuations, non-negligible negative f_nl
would be ruled out. Finally we show that g_nl can have an even larger effect on

Accepted in MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21546.x",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the evolution of debris created in the giant impacts expected during
the final stages of terrestrial planet formation. The starting point is the
debris created in a simulation of the Moon-forming impact. The dynamical
evolution is followed for 10 Myr including the effects of Earth, Venus, Mars
and Jupiter. The spatial distribution evolves from a clump in the first few
months to an asymmetric ring for the first 10 kyr and finally becoming an
axisymmetric ring by about 1 Myr after the impact. By 10 Myr after the impact
20% of the particles have been accreted onto Earth and 17% onto Venus, with 8%
ejected by Jupiter and other bodies playing minor roles. However, the fate of
the debris also depends strongly on how fast it is collisionally depleted,
which depends on the poorly constrained size distribution of the impact debris.
Assuming that the debris is made up of 30% by mass mm-cm-sized vapour
condensates and 70% boulders up to 500 km, we find that the condensates deplete
rapidly on ~1000 yr timescales, whereas the boulders deplete predominantly
dynamically. By considering the luminosity of dust produced in collisions
within the boulder-debris distribution we find that the Moon-forming impact
would have been readily detectable around other stars in Spitzer 24 micron
surveys for around 25 Myr after the impact, with levels of emission comparable
to many known hot dust systems. The vapour condensates meanwhile produce a
short-lived, optically thick, spike of emission. We use these surveys to make
an estimate of the fraction of stars that form terrestrial planets, F_TPF.
Since current terrestrial planet formation models invoke multiple giant
impacts, the low fraction of 10-100 Myr stars found to have warm (~150 K) dust
implies that F_TPF ~<10%.

  Much of differential geometry extends very nicely to d-manifolds and
d-orbifolds -- immersions, submersions, submanifolds, transverse fibre
products, orientations, etc. Compact oriented d-manifolds and d-orbifolds have
virtual classes.
  There are truncation functors to d-manifolds and d-orbifolds from essentially
every geometric structures on moduli spaces used in enumerative invariant
problems in differential geometry or complex algebraic geometry, including
Fredholm sections of Banach vector bundles over Banach manifolds, the
""Kuranishi spaces"" of Fukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono and the ""polyfolds"" of Hofer,
Wysocki and Zehnder in symplectic geometry, and C-schemes with perfect
obstruction theories in algebraic geometry. Thus, results in the literature
imply that many important classes of moduli spaces are d-manifolds or
d-orbifolds, including moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves in symplectic
geometry.
  D-manifolds and d-orbifolds will have applications in symplectic geometry,

mutagenized E. coli lac promoter region, where each sequence is associated with
its phenotype, the induced transcriptional activity measured by a fluorescent
reporter. We find that the additive (non-epistatic) contributions of individual
mutations account for about two-thirds of the explainable phenotype variance,
while pairwise epistasis explains about 7% of the variance for the full
mutagenized sequence and about 15% for the subsequence associated with protein
binding sites. Surprisingly, there is no evidence for third order epistatic
contributions, and our inferred fitness landscape is essentially single peaked,

pressure on the wild type, which we deduce to be multi-objective optimal for
gene expression in environments with different nutrient sources. We identify
transcription factor (CRP) and RNA polymerase binding sites in the promotor

particular, we observe evidence for previously unexplored genetic regulatory
mechanisms, possibly kinetic in nature. We conclude with a cautionary note that

  16-20, 2012, Palaiseau, France",,,,"hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Within conventional constituent-quark models hadrons come out as stable bound
states of the valence (anti)quarks. Thereby the resonance character of hadronic
excitations is completely ignored. A more realistic description of hadron
spectra can be achieved by including explicit mesonic degrees of freedom, which
couple directly to the constituent quarks. We will present a coupled-channel
formalism that describes such hybrid systems in a relativistically invariant
way and allows for the decay of excited hadrons. The formalism is based on the
point-form of relativistic quantum mechanics. If the confining forces between
the (anti)quarks are described by instantaneous interactions it can be formally
shown that the mass-eigenvalue problem for a system that consists of dynamical
(anti)quarks and mesons reduces to a hadronic eigenvalue problem in which the
eigenstates of the pure confinement problem (bare hadrons) are coupled via
meson loops. The only point where the quark substructure enters are form
factors at the meson-(bare) hadron vertices. The physical picture that emerges
resembles the kind of hadronic resonance model that has been developed by Sato
and Lee and is now heavily used at the Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC) to
fix $N^\ast$ properties. Our approach, however, is in a certain sense inverse
to the one of Sato and Lee. Whereas they want to undress physical resonances to
end up with bare quantities, we rather want to dress the bound-states resulting
from a pure constituent quark model to end up with quantities that can be
directly compared with experiment. The way how our approach works will be
exemplified by means of a simple quark-antiquark-meson system.

considering two different variants of the problem, we investigate the field
dependence of these quantities by means of an exact treatment in the exactly
solvable variant and complementary perturbation theories around the limits of
zero and infinite fields in both variants. We find strong evidence that the
phase transition point between topological order and disorder is marked by a
discontinuity in the topological Renyi entropy and that the two phases around
the phase transition point are characterized by its different constant values.
Our results therefore indicate that the topological Renyi entropy is a proper
topological invariant: its allowed values are discrete and can be used to
distinguish between different phases of matter.

weaker than the Fe XVIII 974.86 AA line, allows us to probe the plasma around

numerical schemes for the simulation of physical and other fields without
assuming a particular sub-grid structure as many schemes do. IFD constructs an
ensemble of non-parametric sub-grid field configurations from the combination
of the data in computer memory, representing constraints on possible field
configurations, and prior assumptions on the sub-grid field statistics. Each of
these field configurations can formally be evolved to a later moment since any
differential operator of the dynamics can act on fields living in continuous
space. However, these virtually evolved fields need again a representation by
data in computer memory. The maximum entropy principle of information theory
guides the construction of updated datasets via entropic matching, optimally
representing these field configurations at the later time. The field dynamics
thereby become represented by a finite set of evolution equations for the data
that can be solved numerically. The sub-grid dynamics is treated within an
auxiliary analytic consideration and the resulting scheme acts solely on the
data space. It should provide a more accurate description of the physical field
dynamics than simulation schemes constructed ad-hoc, due to the more rigorous
accounting of sub-grid physics and the space discretization process.
Assimilation of measurement data into an IFD simulation is conceptually
straightforward since measurement and simulation data can just be merged. The
IFD approach is illustrated using the example of a coarsely discretized
representation of a thermally excited classical Klein-Gordon field. This should
pave the way towards the construction of schemes for more complex systems like
turbulent hydrodynamics.

paths inside loops, at the expense of possibly exponential complexity.
SMT-solving techniques and sparse representations of paths and sets of paths
avoid this pitfall. We improve previously proposed techniques for guided static
analysis and the generation of disjunctive invariants by combining them with
techniques for succinct representations of paths and symbolic representations
for transitions based on static single assignment. Because of the
non-monotonicity of the results of abstract interpretation with widening
operators, it is difficult to conclude that some abstraction is more precise
than another based on theoretical local precision results. We thus conducted
extensive comparisons between our new techniques and previous ones, on a
variety of open-source packages.

is a widely used tool for studying electronic and local structure in materials.
The precise interpretation of these spectra with the help of calculations is
hence of prime importance, especially for the study of correlated materials
which have a complicated electronic structure per se. The single particle
approach, for example, has generally limited itself to the dominant dipolar
cross-section. It has long been known however that effects beyond this approach
should be taken into account, both due to the inadequacy of such calculations
when compared to experiment and the presence of shake-up many-body satellites
in core-level photoemission spectra of correlated materials. This effect should
manifest itself in XANES spectra and the question is firstly how to account for
it theoretically and secondly how to verify it experimentally. By using
state-of-the-art first principles electronic structure calculations and 1s
photoemission measurements we demonstrate that shake-up many-body effects are
present in K-edge XAS dipolar spectra of NiO, CoO and CuO at all energy scales.
We show that shake-up effects can be included in K-edge XAS spectra in a simple
way by convoluting the single-particle first-principles calculations including
core-hole effects with the 1s photoemission spectra. We thus describe all
features appearing in the XAS dipolar cross-section of NiO and CoO and obtain a
dramatic improvement with respect to the single-particle calculation in CuO.
These materials being prototype correlated magnetic oxides, our work points to
the presence of shake-up effects in K-edge XANES of most correlated transition
metal compounds and shows how to account for them, paving the way to a precise
understanding of their electronic structure.

there are minor differences among the exponents, at a level close to the true

the overwhelming impression is the similarity of the mass functions and age
distributions of clusters in these different galaxies, including giant and
dwarf, quiescent and interacting galaxies. This is an important empirical
result, justifying terms such as ""universal"" or ""quasi-universal."" We provide a
partial theoretical explanation for these observations in terms of physical

for any fixed r > 0, the measure of G \cap (x + rK) is constant when x varies
on the boundary of G (here, x + rK denotes a translation of a dilation of K).
We first prove that G must always be strictly convex and at least C1,1-regular;
also, if K is centrally symmetric, K must be strictly convex, C1,1-regular and
such that K = G - G up to homotheties; this implies in turn that G must be
C2,1- regular. Then for N = 2, we prove that G is uniformly K-dense if and only
if K and G are homothetic to the same ellipse. This result was already proven
by Amar, Berrone and Gianni in [3]. However, our proof removes their regularity
assumptions on K and G and, more importantly, it is susceptible to be
generalized to higher dimension since, by the use of Minkowski's inequality and
an affine inequality, avoids the delicate computations of the higher-order
terms in the Taylor expansion near r = 0 for the measure of G\cap(x+rK) (needed

the effective angular resolution of Galileo's observations. Until now,
historians of science have mainly obtained these indirectly and they are often
not correctly estimated. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of Galileo's
experimental errors shows an asymmetrical distribution with prevailing positive
errors. This behaviour may help to better understand the method Galileo used to
measure angular elongation, since the method described in the Sidereus Nuncius
is clearly wrong.

compression of (two) data streams with symbol-by-symbol correlation between the
outputs of (two) distributed sources. However, this paper considers a different
scenario which does not fit in the Slepian-Wolf framework. We consider two
identical but spatially separated sources. We wish to study the universal
compression of a sequence of length $n$ from one of the sources provided that
the decoder has access to (i.e., memorized) a sequence of length $m$ from the
other source. Such a scenario occurs, for example, in the universal compression
of data from multiple mirrors of the same server. In this setup, the
correlation does not arise from symbol-by-symbol dependency of two outputs from
the two sources. Instead, the sequences are correlated through the information
that they contain about the unknown source parameter. We show that the
finite-length nature of the compression problem at hand requires considering a
notion of almost lossless source coding, where coding incurs an error
probability $p_e(n)$ that vanishes with sequence length $n$. We obtain a lower
bound on the average minimax redundancy of almost lossless codes as a function
of the sequence length $n$ and the permissible error probability $p_e$ when the
decoder has a memory of length $m$ and the encoders do not communicate. Our
results demonstrate that a strict performance loss is incurred when the two
encoders do not communicate even when the decoder knows the unknown parameter
vector (i.e., $m \to \infty$).
