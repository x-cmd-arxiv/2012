impurity atoms and a Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) superfluid in a two dimensional
optical lattice. We find that the impurity atoms get localized and can form
pairs when the interaction between the impurity atoms and the LO superfluid is
strong enough. These features are due to the phenomena of self-localization
whose underlying mechanism is revealed by an effective model. The impurity
atoms with finite concentrations can drive the transition from a
two-dimensional-checkerboard-like LO state to a
quasi-one-dimensional-stripe-like one. Experimental preparations to observe
these features are also discussed.

numerical, and experimental results we systematically investigate factors
leading to the degradation of magic echoes, as observed in reduced revival of

mean magnetization we use a phase encoding technique to measure the growth of
spin correlations in the density matrix at different points in time following
magic echoes of varied durations and compare the results to those obtained
during a free induction decay (FID). While considerable differences are
documented at short times, the long-time behavior of the density matrix appears
to be remarkably universal among the types of initial states considered -
simple low order multispin correlations are observed to decay exponentially at
the same rate, seeding the onset of increasingly complex high order
correlations. This manifestly athermal process is constrained by conservation
of the second moment of the spectrum of the density matrix and proceeds
indefinitely, assuming unitary dynamics.

sample with high-quality gri light curves obtained with robotic telescopes to
measure photometric parameters, such as stretch, optical colour, and
brightness. By comparing our data to a comparable sample of SNe Ia at
intermediate-z (0.4<z<0.9), we detect modest spectral evolution (3-sigma), in
the sense that our mean low-z NUV spectrum has a depressed flux compared to its
intermediate-z counterpart. We also see a strongly increased dispersion about
the mean with decreasing wavelength, confirming the results of earlier surveys.
These trends are consistent with changes in metallicity as predicted by
contemporary SN Ia spectral models. We also examine the properties of various
NUV spectral diagnostics in the individual spectra. We find a general
correlation between stretch and the velocity (or position) of many NUV spectral
features. In particular, we observe that higher stretch SNe have larger Ca II
H&K velocities, that also correlate with host galaxy stellar mass. This latter
trend is probably driven by the well-established correlation between stretch
and stellar mass. We find no trends between UV spectral features and optical
colour. Mean spectra constructed according to whether the SN has a positive or
negative Hubble residual show very little difference at NUV wavelengths,
indicating that the NUV evolution and variation we identify do not directly
correlate with Hubble residuals. Our work confirms and strengthens earlier
conclusions regarding the complex behaviour of SNe Ia in the NUV spectral
region, but suggests the correlations we find are more useful in constraining
progenitor models than improving the use of SNe Ia as cosmological probes.

The gauge-theoretic Lagrangian for gravitons is simpler than the metric one.
Moreover, all components of the connection field have the same sign in front of
their kinetic term, unlike what happens in the metric formalism. The
gauge-theoretic description is also more economic than the standard one because
the Lagrangian only depends on 8 components of the field per spacetime point as
compared to 10 in the Einstein-Hilbert case. Particular care is paid to the
treatment of the reality conditions that guarantee that one is dealing with a
system with a hermitian Hamiltonian. We give general arguments explaining why
the connection cannot be taken to be real, and then describe a reality
condition that relates the hermitian conjugate of the connection to its
(second) derivative. This is quite analogous to the treatment of fermions where
one describes them by a second-order in derivatives Klein-Gordon Lagrangian,
with an additional first-order reality condition (Dirac equation) imposed. We
find many other parallels with fermions, e.g. the fact that the action of
parity on the connection is related to the hermitian conjugation. Our main
result is the mode decomposition of the connection field, which is to be used
in forthcoming works for computations of graviton scattering amplitudes.

Maxwell's equations with dissipative boundary conditions whose energy decays

(ADS) and they play an importarnt role in inverse back-scatering problems. The
existence of ADS is a difficult mathematical problem. For the exterior of a
sphere, such solutions have been constructed analytically by Colombini, Petkov
and Rauch [7] by specifying appropriate initial conditions. However, for
general domains of practical interest (such as Lipschitz polyhedra), the
existence of such solutions is not evident.
  This paper considers a finite-element approximation of Maxwell's equations in
the exterior of a polyhedron, whose boundary approximates the sphere. Standard
Nedelec-Raviart-Thomas elements are used with a Crank-Nicholson scheme to
approximate the electric and magnetic fields. Discrete initial conditions
interpolating the ones chosen in [7] are modified so that they are (weakly)
divergence-free. We prove that with such initial conditions, the approximation
to the electric field is weakly divergence-free for all time. Finally, we show
numerically that the finite-element approximations of the ADS also decay
exponentially with time when the mesh size and the time step become small.

forms over the field Q. In a second step, we use these forms to extend
Sullivan's presentation of rational homotopy type to intersection cohomology.
  For that, we construct a functor from the category of filtered face sets to a
category of perverse commutative differential graded Q-algebras (cdga's) due to
Hovey. We establish also the existence and unicity of a positively graded,
minimal model of some perverse cdga's, including the perverse forms over a
filtered face set and their intersection cohomology. Finally, we prove the
topological invariance of the minimal model of a PL-pseudomanifold whose
regular part is connected, and this theory creates new topological invariants.
This point of view brings a definition of formality in the intersection setting

consistent with those obtained from previously reported outbursts from these

can be well fitted either with a two-blackbody model, or with a single
unsaturated Comptonization model. In the latter case, the model can be either a
classical static Comptonization model, such as COMPTT, or the recently

cylindrical accretion onto a magnetized neutron star. We discuss the possible
accretion scenarios derived by the different models, and we also emphasize the
fact that the electron density derived from the Comptonization models, in the

field oscillates sinusoidally between the two levels at frequency $\Omega$
which is proportional to the field amplitude [1]. This phenomenon, known as the
Rabi oscillation, has been at the heart of atomic, molecular and optical
physics since the seminal work of its namesake and coauthors [2]. Notably, Rabi
oscillations in isolated single atoms or dilute gases form the basis for
metrological applications such as atomic clocks and precision measurements of
physical constants [3]. Both inhomogeneous distribution of coupling strength to
the field and interactions between individual atoms reduce the visibility of
the oscillation and may even suppress it completely. A remarkable
transformation takes place in the limit where only a single excitation can be
present in the sample due to either initial conditions or atomic interactions:
there arises a collective, many-body Rabi oscillation at a frequency
$N^0.5\Omega$ involving all N >> 1 atoms in the sample [4]. This is true even
for inhomogeneous atom-field coupling distributions, where single-atom Rabi
oscillations may be invisible. When one of the two levels is a strongly
interacting Rydberg level, many-body Rabi oscillations emerge as a consequence
of the Rydberg excitation blockade. Lukin and coauthors outlined an approach to
quantum information processing based on this effect [5]. Here we report initial
observations of coherent many-body Rabi oscillations between the ground level
and a Rydberg level using several hundred cold rubidium atoms. The strongly
pronounced oscillations indicate a nearly complete excitation blockade of the
entire mesoscopic ensemble by a single excited atom. The results pave the way
towards quantum computation and simulation using ensembles of atoms.

The main benefit due to the gauge invariance is that it can permit the
comprehension of difficult systems in physics with an arbitrary choice of a
reference frame at every instant of time. It is the objective of this work to
show a path of obtaining gauge invariant theories from non-invariant ones. Both
are named also as first- and second-class theories respectively, obeying
Dirac's formalism. Namely, it is very important to understand why it is always
desirable to have a bridge between gauge invariant and non-invariant theories.
Once established, this kind of mapping between first-class (gauge invariant)
and second-class systems, in Dirac's formalism can be considered as a sort of
equivalence. This work describe this kind of equivalence obtaining a gauge
invariant theory starting with a non-invariant one using the symplectic
embedding formalism developed by some of us some years back. To illustrate the
procedure it was analyzed both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. It was
demonstrated that this method is more convenient than others. For example, it
was shown exactly that this embedding method used here does not require any
special modification to handle with non-Abelian systems.

provide population estimates and, for some resonances, constrain the complex

because phase relationships with Neptune make object discovery more likely at

10aH, with a=0.8-0.9) are favoured in the range Hg=8-9, and confirm that this

that, to within the uncertainties, the population is equal to that of the 3:2

of 3-4 compared to the other two resonances. We also measure significant
populations inhabiting the 4:3, 5:3, 7:3, 5:4, 7:4, 3:1, and 5:1 resonances,

boundary conditions immersed in a supersonic flow. A perturbed wave equation
describes the flow potential. The plate's out-of-plane displacement can be
modeled by various nonlinear plate equations (including von Karman and Berger).
We show that the linearized model is well-posed on the state space (as given by
finite energy considerations) and generates a strongly continuous semigroup. We
make use of these results to conclude global-in-time well-posedness for the
fully nonlinear model.
  The proof of generation has two novel features, namely: (1) we introduce a
new flow potential velocity-type variable which makes it possible to cover both
subsonic and supersonic cases, and to split the dynamics generating operator
into a skew-adjoint component and a perturbation acting outside of the state
space. Performing semigroup analysis also requires a nontrivial approximation
of the domain of the generator. And (2) we make critical use of hidden
regularity for the flow component of the model (in the abstract setup for the
semigroup problem) which allows us run a fixed point argument and eventually
conclude well-posedness. This well-posedness result for supersonic flows (in
the absence of rotational inertia) has been hereto open. The use of semigroup
methods to obtain well-posedness opens this model to long-time behavior
considerations.

(h50=1) selected from the LoCuS survey (0.142<z<0.295) and of A1758b, in the
FoV of A1758a. We detect 17 clusters with 5-23sigma peak surface brightnesses.
Cluster parameters are obtained using a Bayesian cluster analysis. We fit
isothermal beta-models to our data and assume the clusters are virialized (with
all the kinetic energy in gas internal energy). Our gas temperature, T_AMI, is
derived from AMI SZ data, not from X-ray spectroscopy. Cluster parameters
internal to r500 are derived assuming HSE. We find: (i) Different gNFW
parameterizations yield significantly different parameter degeneracies. (ii)
For h70 = 1, we find the virial radius r200 to be typically 1.6+/-0.1 Mpc and
the total mass M_T(r200) typically to be 2.0-2.5xM_T(r500).(iii) Where we have
found M_T X-ray (X) and weak-lensing (WL) values in the literature, there is
good agreement between WL and AMI estimates (with M_{T,AMI}/M_{T,WL}
=1.2^{+0.2}_{-0.3} and =1.0+/-0.1 for r500 and r200, respectively). In
comparison, most Suzaku/Chandra estimates are higher than for AMI (with
M_{T,X}/M_{T,AMI}=1.7+/-0.2 within r500), particularly for the stronger
mergers.(iv) Comparison of T_AMI to T_X sheds light on high X-ray masses: even
at large r, T_X can substantially exceed T_AMI in mergers. The use of these
higher T_X values will give higher X-ray masses. We stress that large-r T_SZ
and T_X data are scarce and must be increased. (v) Despite the paucity of data,
there is an indication of a relation between merger activity and SZ
ellipticity. (vi) At small radius (but away from any cooling flow) the SZ
signal (and T_AMI) is less sensitive to ICM disturbance than the X-ray signal
(and T_X) and, even at high r, mergers affect n^2-weighted X-ray data more than
n-weighted SZ, implying significant shocking or clumping or both occur even in
the outer parts of mergers.

indication that a significant fraction of white dwarfs switch their atmospheric
compositions back and forth between hydrogen-rich and helium-rich as they cool.
In this paper, we present a Monte Carlo model of the Galactic disk white dwarf

that the non-DA gap emerges naturally, even though our model only allows white
dwarf atmospheres to evolve monotonically from hydrogen-rich to helium-rich
through convective mixing. We conclude by discussing the effects of convective

0.55 d and F_nu(5.8 GHz) < 18 \muJy at \deltat \approx 0.50 d, respectively.
However, using a Chandra observation at t~3.0 d we locate the absolute position
of the X-ray afterglow to an accuracy of 0.22"" (1 sigma), a factor of about 6
times better than the Swift-XRT position. This allows us to robustly identify
the host galaxy and to locate the burst at a projected offset of 1.25 +/- 0.20""
from the host centroid. Using optical and near-IR observations of the host
galaxy we determine a photometric redshift of z=1.3 (+0.3,-0.2), one of the
highest for any short GRB, and leading to a projected physical offset for the
burst of 10.5 +/- 1.7 kpc, typical of previous short GRBs. At this redshift,
the isotropic gamma-ray energy is E_{gamma,iso} \approx 3\times10^51 erg
(rest-frame 23-2300 keV) with a peak energy of E_{pk} \approx 850-2300 keV
(rest-frame). In conjunction with the isotropic X-ray energy, GRB111117A
appears to follow our recently-reported E_x,iso-E_gamma,iso-E_pk universal
scaling. Using the X-ray data along with the optical and radio non-detections
we find that for a blastwave kinetic energy of E_{K,iso} \approx E_{gamma,iso},
the circumburst density is n_0 \sim 3x10^(-4)-1 cm^-3 (for a range of
epsilon_B=0.001-0.1). Similarly, from the non-detection of a break in the X-ray
light curve at t<3 d, we infer a minimum opening angle for the outflow of
theta_j> 3-10 degrees (depending on the circumburst density). We conclude that
Chandra observations of short GRBs are effective at determining precise
positions and robust host galaxy associations in the absence of optical and
radio detections.

this role. In this paper, we discuss new successful simulations of supernova
explosions that shed light on the relative importance of these two
instabilities. While convection has so far been observed to grow first in
self-consistent hydrodynamical models with multi-group neutrino transport, we
here present the first such simulation in which the SASI grows faster while the
development of convection is initially inhibited. We illustrate the features of
this SASI-dominated regime using an explosion model of a 27 solar mass
progenitor, which is contrasted with a convectively-dominated model of an 8.1
solar mass progenitor with subsolar metallicity, whose early post-bounce
behavior is more in line with previous 11.2 and 15 solar mass explosion models.
We analyze the conditions discriminating between the two different regimes,
showing that a high mass-accretion rate and a short advection time-scale are
conducive for strong SASI activity. We also briefly discuss some important
factors for capturing the SASI-driven regime, such as general relativity, the
progenitor structure, a nuclear equation of state leading to a compact
proto-neutron star, and the neutrino treatment. Finally, we evaluate possible
implications of our findings for 2D and 3D supernova simulations. Our results

lifetime of synaptic strength. Can a neural network store long-lasting memories
in unstable synapses? Here, we study the effects of random noise on the
stability of memory stored in synapses of an attractor neural network. The
model includes ongoing spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We show that
certain classes of STDP rules can lead to the stabilization of memory patterns
stored in the network. The stabilization results from rehearsals induced by
noise. We show that unstructured neural noise, after passing through the
recurrent network weights, carries the imprint of all memory patterns in
temporal correlations. Under certain conditions, STDP combined with these
correlations, can lead to reinforcement of all existing patterns, even those
that are never explicitly visited. Thus, unstructured neural noise can
stabilize the existing structure of synaptic connectivity. Our findings may
provide the functional reason for highly irregular spiking displayed by
cortical neurons and provide justification for models of system memory
consolidation. Therefore, we propose that irregular neural activity is the
feature that helps cortical networks maintain stable connections.

of the absorption can in general not be constrained from current X-ray
observations, it has been assumed that the absorption is due to metals in the
host galaxy of the GRB. The large sample of X-ray afterglows and redshifts now
available allows the construction of statistically meaningful distributions of
the metal column densities. We construct such a sample and show, as found in
previous studies, that the typical absorbing column density (N_HX) increases
substantially with redshift, with few high column density objects found at low
to moderate redshifts. We show, however, that when highly extinguished bursts
are included in the sample, using redshifts from their host galaxies, high
column density sources are also found at low to moderate redshift. We infer
from individual objects in the sample and from observations of blazars, that
the increase in column density with redshift is unlikely to be related to
metals in the intergalactic medium or intervening absorbers. Instead we show
that the origin of the apparent increase with redshift is primarily due to dust
extinction bias: GRBs with high X-ray absorption column densities found at
$z\lesssim4$ typically have very high dust extinction column densities, while
those found at the highest redshifts do not. It is unclear how such a strongly

them from the Hubble sequence. Major mergers, i.e., fusions between galaxies of
similar mass, are found to be the likeliest driver for such strong
peculiarities. However, thin disks are fragile and easily destroyed by such
violent collisions, which creates a critical tension between the observed

show that the observed high occurrence of mergers amongst their progenitors is

in that the nature of bound states depends on their momentum. At low enough
momentum |p|<E the bound states transform in the anti-symmetric representation
of the super-algebra symmetry and become the solitons of the Pohlmeyer reduced
theory in the relativistic limit. At a critical momentum |p|=E they become
marginally unstable, and at higher momenta the stable bound states are in the
symmetric representation and become the familiar magnons in the string limit as
q->1. This subtlety fixes a problem involving the consistency of crossing
symmetry with the relativistic limit found in earlier work. With mirror
kinematics, obtained after a double Wick rotation, the bound state structure is
simpler and there are no marginally unstable bound states.

mergers. These high resolution (1 pc) simulations follow formation and
destruction of individual GMCs and star clusters. The final starburst is
dominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to
global torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.
The gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and
subsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast
to some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the
central bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of
the galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several
percent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus
does so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a
consequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the
small-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this
relation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from IR
photons, extend over seven decades in SFR to regulate star formation in the
most extreme starbursts (densities >10^4 M_sun/pc^2). Feedback also drives
super-winds with large mass loss rates; but a significant fraction of the wind
material falls back onto the disks at later times, leading to higher
post-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. Strong AGN feedback is
required to explain sharp cutoffs in star formation rate. We compare the
predicted relic structure, mass profile, morphology, and efficiency of disk
survival to simulations which do not explicitly resolve GMCs or feedback.
Global galaxy properties are similar, but sub-galactic properties and star
formation rates can differ significantly.

scale molecular torus (MT) environment. Within the BLR the scattering takes
place at the onset of the Klein-Nishina regime, causing the electron cooling
time to become almost energy independent and as a result, the variation of
high-energy emission is expected to be achromatic. Contrarily, if the emission
site is located outside the BLR, the expected GeV variability is
energy-dependent and with amplitude increasing with energy. We demonstrate this
using time-dependent numerical simulations of blazar variability and discuss
the applicability of our method.

analysis to various experimentally relevant imperfections, including quenched
disorder, dynamical decoherence, and uncompensated long range coupling. In
finite-length chains, the interplay between disorder-induced localization and
decoherence yields a natural optimal channel fidelity, which we calculate.
Long-range dipolar couplings induce a finite intrinsic lifetime for the
mediating eigenmode; extensive numerical simulations of dipolar chains of
lengths up to L=12 show remarkably high fidelity despite these decay processes.
We further consider the extension of the protocol to bosonic systems of coupled
oscillators. Second, we introduce a quantum mirror based architecture for
universal quantum computing which exploits all of the spins in the system as
potential qubits. While this dramatically increases the number of qubits
available, the composite operations required to manipulate ""dark"" spin qubits
significantly raise the error threshold for robust operation. Finally, as an
example, we demonstrate that eigenmode-mediated state transfer can enable
robust long-range logic between spatially separated Nitrogen-Vacancy registers
in diamond; numerical simulations confirm that high fidelity gates are
achievable even in the presence of moderate disorder.

observationally. Ram-pressure stripping of hot gas from the satellites leaves a
clear imprint of the environment on the characteristics of a dwarf galaxy. We
find that the fraction of satellites dominated by old populations of stars
matches observations well. However, the internal metallicity distributions of
the model satellites appear to be narrower than observed. This may indicate
limitations in our treatment of chemical enrichment, which is based on the
instantaneous recycling approximation. Our model works best if the dark matter
halo of the Milky Way has a mass of ~8 x 10^11 Msun, in agreement with the
lower estimates from observations. The galaxy that resembles the Milky Way the
most also has the best matching satellite luminosity function, although it does
not contain an object as bright as the SMC or LMC. Compared to other
semi-analytic models and abundance matching relations we find that central
galaxies reside in less massive haloes, but the halo mass-stellar mass relation

clinical productivity system that leverages Electronic Health Record (EHR) data
to provide productivity decision support functionality in a real-world clinical
setting. The system was implemented for a large behavioral health care provider
seeing over 75,000 distinct clients a year. Design/methodology/approach: The
key metric in this system is a ""VPU"", which simultaneously optimizes multiple
aspects of clinical care. The resulting mathematical value of clinical
productivity was hypothesized to tightly link the organization's performance to
its expectations and, through transparency and decision support tools at the
clinician level, affect significant changes in productivity, quality, and
consistency relative to traditional models of clinical productivity. Findings:
In only 3 months, every single variable integrated into the VPU system showed
significant improvement, including a 30% rise in revenue, 10% rise in clinical
percentage, a 25% rise in treatment plan completion, a 20% rise in case rate
eligibility, along with similar improvements in compliance/audit issues,
outcomes collection, access, etc. Practical implications: A data-driven
clinical productivity system employing decision support functionality is
effective because of the impact on clinician behavior relative to traditional
clinical productivity systems. Critically, the model is also extensible to
integration with outcomes-based productivity. Originality/Value: EHR's are only
a first step - the problem is turning that data into useful information.
Technology can leverage the data in order to produce actionable information
that can inform clinical practice and decision-making. Without additional
technology, EHR's are essentially just copies of paper-based records stored in
electronic form.

dimensional reduction of the Dirac equation for the Eisenhart-Duval metric in
general gives rise to the non-relativistic Levy-Leblond equation in lower
dimension. We study in detail in which specific cases the lower dimensional
limit is given by the Dirac equation, with scalar and vector flux, and the
relation between lift, reduction and the hidden symmetries of the Dirac
equation. While there is a precise correspondence in the case of the lower
dimensional massive Dirac equation with no flux, we find that for generic
fluxes it is not possible to lift or reduce all solutions and hidden
symmetries. As a by-product of this analysis we construct new Lorentzian
metrics with special tensors by lifting Killing-Yano and Closed Conformal

we show how dimensionally reducing the higher dimensional operators of the

acceleration of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the present cosmic epoch, a
systematic, all-sky inventory of radio galaxies in the local universe is
needed. Here we present the first catalog of radio-emitting galaxies that meets
this requirement. Our catalog allows the selection of volume-limited subsamples
containing all low-power radio galaxies, similar to the prototypical low-power
radio galaxies Cen A or M87, within some hundred Mpc. It is constructed by
matching radio emission from the NVSS and SUMSS surveys to galaxies of the
2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) using an image-level algorithm that properly
treats the extended structure of radio sources. The sample contains 575
radio-emitting galaxies with a flux greater than 213 mJy at 1.4 GHz. Over 30%
of the galaxies in our catalog are not contained in existing large-area
extra-galactic radio samples. We compute the optical and radio luminosity
functions and the fraction of radio galaxies as a function of galaxy
luminosity. We find that the galaxy density around radio galaxies is
significantly higher than around non-radio galaxies of the same luminosity and
morphology. This enhanced clustering suggests a causal relation between
external galaxy properties, such as environment or merger history, and the
formation of powerful jets in the present universe. Since the enhancement is
observed with respect to galaxies of the same luminosity and Hubble type, it is
not primarily driven by black hole mass. Our automated matching procedure is
found to select radio-emitting galaxies with high efficiency (99%) and purity
(91%), which is key for future processing of deeper, larger samples.

model predictive control (MPC) laws for discrete-time linear systems affected

based on the iterated solution, at each step, of a finite-horizon optimal
control problem (FHOCP) that takes into account a suitable number of randomly
extracted scenarios of uncertainty and disturbances, followed by a specific
command selection rule implemented in a receding horizon fashion. The scenario
FHOCP is always convex, also when the uncertain parameters and disturbance
belong to non-convex sets, and irrespective of how the model uncertainty
influences the system's matrices. Moreover, the computational complexity of the
proposed approach does not depend on the uncertainty/disturbance dimensions,
and scales quadratically with the control horizon. The main result in this
paper is related to the analysis of the closed loop system under
receding-horizon implementation of the scenario FHOCP, and essentially states
that the devised control law guarantees constraint satisfaction at each step
with some a-priori assigned probability p, while the system's state reaches the
target set either asymptotically, or in finite time with probability at least
p. The proposed method may be a valid alternative when other existing
techniques, either deterministic or stochastic, are not directly usable due to
excessive conservatism or to numerical intractability caused by lack of
convexity of the robust or chance-constrained optimization problem.

employs a commercial low noise mixing block coupled to a 0.7 m off-axis
satellite dish which receives a broadband, white noise-like signal from a
geostationary satellite. The signals are processed by an analog correlator to
produce the phase delays between all pairs of stations with projected baselines
ranging from 33 to 261 m. Each baseline's amplitude and phase is measured
continuously at a rate of 8 kHz, processed, averaged and output at 10 Hz.
Further signal processing and data reduction is accomplished with a Linux
computer, including the removal of the diurnal motion of the target satellite.
The placement of the stations below ground level with an environmental shield
combined with the use of low temperature coefficient, buried fiber optic cables
provides excellent system stability. The sensitivity in terms of rms path
length is 1.3 microns which corresponds to phase deviations of about 1 degree
of phase at the highest operating frequency of the SMA. The two primary data
products are: (1) standard deviations of observed phase over various time
scales, and (2) phase structure functions. These real-time statistical data
measured by the API in the direction of the satellite provide an estimate of
the phase front distortion experienced by the concurrent SMA astronomical
observations. The API data also play an important role, along with the local
opacity measurements and weather predictions, in helping to plan the scheduling
of science observations on the telescope.

well described by a phenomenological model with purely diffusive spin dynamics.
At low energies, the spectrum around the magnetic ordering vector Q_AFM
consists of a single peak with elliptical shape in momentum space. At high
energies, this inelastic peak is split into two peaks across the direction
perpendicular to Q_AFM. We use our fittings to argue that such a splitting is
not due to incommensurability or propagating spin-wave excitations, but is
rather a consequence of the anisotropies in the Landau damping and in the
magnetic correlation length, both of which are allowed by the tetragonal
symmetry of the system. We also measure the magnetic spectrum deep inside the
magnetically-ordered phase, and find that it is remarkably similar to the
spectrum of the paramagnetic phase, revealing the strongly overdamped character
of the magnetic excitations.

geodesics could still be complete in a possible non-globally hyperbolic

of normal geodesics is constrained, we have found it necessary in our proofs to
impose also a weak convergence condition on the ingoing family of normal

particular, a Hawking-Penrose-type singularity theorem is proven in

considered concurrently at each decoding stage. Then, a single codeword is
selected from the list as output. If the most likely codeword is selected,
simulation results show that the resulting performance is very close to that of
a maximum-likelihood decoder, even for moderate values of $L$. Alternatively,
if a ""genie"" is allowed to pick the codeword from the list, the results are
comparable to the current state of the art LDPC codes. Luckily, implementing
such a helpful genie is easy.
  Our list decoder doubles the number of decoding paths at each decoding step,
and then uses a pruning procedure to discard all but the $L$ ""best"" paths. %In
order to implement this algorithm, we introduce a natural pruning criterion
that can be easily evaluated. Nevertheless, a straightforward implementation
still requires $\Omega(L \cdot n^2)$ time, which is in stark contrast with the
$O(n \log n)$ complexity of the original successive-cancellation decoder. We
utilize the structure of polar codes to overcome this problem. Specifically, we
devise an efficient, numerically stable, implementation taking only $O(L \cdot
n \log n)$ time and $O(L \cdot n)$ space.

Millennium-II simulations of structure growth in a LCDM universe from the
cosmological parameters with which they were carried out (based on first-year
results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, WMAP1) to parameters
consistent with the seven-year WMAP data (WMAP7). We implement semi-analytic
galaxy formation modelling on both simulations in both cosmologies to
investigate how the formation, evolution and clustering of galaxies are
predicted to vary with cosmological parameters. The increased matter density
Omega_m and decreased linear fluctuation amplitude sigma8 in WMAP7 have
compensating effects, so that the abundance and clustering of dark halos are
predicted to be very similar to those in WMAP1 for z <= 3. As a result, local
galaxy properties can be reproduced equally well in the two cosmologies by
slightly altering galaxy formation parameters. The evolution of the galaxy
populations is then also similar. In WMAP7, structure forms slightly later.
This shifts the peak in cosmic star formation rate to lower redshift, resulting
in slightly bluer galaxies at z=0. Nevertheless, the model still predicts more
passive low-mass galaxies than are observed. For rp< 1Mpc, the z=0 clustering
of low-mass galaxies is weaker for WMAP7 than for WMAP1 and closer to that
observed, but the two cosmologies give very similar results for more massive
galaxies and on large scales. At z>1 galaxies are predicted to be more strongly
clustered for WMAP7. Differences in galaxy properties, including, clustering,
in these two cosmologies are rather small up to redshift 3. Given that there
are still considerable residual uncertainties in galaxy formation models, it is
very difficult to distinguish WMAP1 from WMAP7 through observations of galaxy
properties or their evolution.

and examine the origin of their linearity. We find that the relative
orientation of large force segments are random and that the tendency for force
chains to be linear is not due to correlations in the direction of neighboring
large forces, but instead occurs because the directions are biased towards
being linear to balance the forces on each droplet.

  Using our concept of universal Peano space we show connections between the

results for other, nearby light dynamical quark masses. We study two gauge
field ensembles generated with 2+1 flavors of dynamical domain wall fermions
with light quark masses m_l=0.02 (m_\pi=620 MeV) and m_l=0.01 (m_\pi=420 MeV).
We reweight each ensemble to determine results which could be computed directly
from the other and check the consistency of the reweighted results with the
direct results. The large difference between the 0.02 and 0.01 light quark
masses suggests that this is an aggressive application of reweighting as can be
seen from fluctuations in the magnitude of the reweighting factor by four
orders of magnitude. Never-the-less, a comparison of the reweighed topological
charge, average plaquette, residual mass, pion mass, pion decay constant, and
scalar correlator between these two ensembles shows agreement well described by
the statistical errors. The issues of the effective number of configurations
and finite sample size bias are discussed. An examination of the topological
charge distribution implies that it is more favorable to reweight from heavier
mass to lighter quark mass.

view A as acting on $\cx^{V(X)}$ and take the standard basis of this space to
be the vectors $e_u$ for $u$ in $V(X)$. Physicists say that we have perfect
state transfer from vertex $u$ to $v$ at time $\tau$ if there is a scalar
$\gamma$ such that $U(\tau)e_u = \gamma e_v$. (Since $U(t)$ is unitary,
$\norm\gamma=1$.) For example, if $X$ is the $d$-cube and $u$ and $v$ are at
distance $d$ then we have perfect state transfer from $u$ to $v$ at time
$\pi/2$. Despite the existence of this nice family, it has become clear that
perfect state transfer is rare. Hence we consider a relaxation: we say that we
have pretty good state transfer from $u$ to $v$ if there is a complex number
$\gamma$ and, for each positive real $\epsilon$ there is a time $t$ such that
$\norm{U(t)e_u - \gamma e_v} < \epsilon$. Again we necessarily have
$|\gamma|=1$.
  Godsil, Kirkland, Severini and Smith showed that we have have pretty good
state transfer between the end vertices of the path $P_n$ if and only $n+1$ is
a power of two, a prime, or twice a prime. (There is perfect state transfer
between the end vertices only for $P_2$ and $P_3$.) It is something of a
surprise that the occurrence of pretty good state transfer is characterized by
a number-theoretic condition. In this paper we study double-star graphs, which
are trees with two vertices of degree $k+1$ and all other vertices with degree
one. We prove that there is never perfect state transfer between the two
vertices of degree $k+1$, and that there is pretty good state transfer between
them if and only if $4k+1$ is a perfect square.

4.8 GHz. The source has shown prominent IDV as well as long-term flux
variations. The IDV time scale does show evidence in favor of an annual
modulation, suggesting that the IDV of 0716+714 is dominated by interstellar
scintillation. The source underwent a strong outburst phase between mid-2008
and mid-2009; a second intense flare was observed in late 2009, but no
correlation between the total flux density and the IDV time scale is found,
implying that the flaring state of the source does not have serious
implications for the general characteristics of its intra-day variability.
However, we find that the inner-jet position angle is changing throughout the
years, which could result in an annual modulation noise in the anisotropic ISS
model fit. There is also an indication that the lowest IDV amplitudes (rms flux
density) correspond to the slowest time scales of IDV, which would be
consistent with an ISS origin of the IDV of 0716+714.

method. As nodes are allowed to collect information during several consecutive
rounds, moving gives them the opportunity to gather more values. We propose a
novel sufficient and necessary condition to guarantee the final convergence of
the consensus protocol. The requirement expressed by our condition is not
""universal"": in each phase it affects only a single correct node. More
precisely, at least one correct node among those that propose either the
minimum or the maximum value which is present in the network, has to receive
enough messages (quantity constraint) with either higher or lower values

review the role of molecular chaperones in short-term adaptation of cellular
networks in response to stress, and in long-term adaptation discussing their
putative functions in the regulation of evolvability. We provide a general
overview of possible network mechanisms of adaptation, learning and memory
formation. We propose that changes of network rigidity play a key role in
learning and memory formation processes. Flexible network topology provides
""learning competent"" state. Here, networks may have much less modular
boundaries than locally rigid, highly modular networks, where the learnt
information has already been consolidated in a memory formation process. Since
modular boundaries are efficient filters of information, in the ""learning
competent"" state information filtering may be much smaller, than after memory
formation. This mechanism restricts high information transfer to the ""learning
competent"" state. After memory formation, modular boundary-induced segregation
and information filtering protect the stored information. The flexible networks
of young organisms are generally in a ""learning competent"" state. On the
contrary, locally rigid networks of old organisms have lost their ""learning
competent"" state, but store and protect their learnt information efficiently.
We anticipate that the above mechanism may operate at the level of both
protein-protein interaction and neuronal networks.

that transverse wall oscillations with properly selected amplitude and
frequency can reduce turbulent drag by as much as 40%. In this paper, we
develop a model-based approach for designing oscillations that suppress
turbulence in a channel flow. We utilize eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearization
of the turbulent flow with control in conjunction with turbulence modeling to
determine skin-friction drag in a simulation-free manner. The Boussinesq eddy
viscosity hypothesis is used to quantify the effect of fluctuations on the mean
velocity in the flow subject to control. In contrast to the traditional
approach that relies on numerical simulations, we determine the turbulent
viscosity from the second order statistics of the linearized model driven by
white-in-time stochastic forcing. The spatial power spectrum of the forcing is
selected to ensure that the linearized model for the uncontrolled flow
reproduces the turbulent energy spectrum. The resulting correction to the
turbulent mean velocity induced by small amplitude wall movements is then used
to identify the optimal frequency of drag reducing oscillations. In addition,
the control net efficiency and the turbulent flow structures that we obtain
agree well with the results of numerical simulations and experiments. This
demonstrates the predictive power of our model-based approach to controlling
turbulent flows and is expected to pave the way for successful flow control at
higher Reynolds numbers than currently possible.

utilizing chemical energy, molecular motors transport the cell's crucial
components, such as neurotransmitters and organelles. They generate force and
pull cargo, as they literally walk along the polymeric tracts, e.g.
microtubules. However, using experimental data one may derive that the energy
needed for this pulling would take the most part of the 22 kT that ATP
hydrolysis makes available. In such a case there would not be sufficient energy
left to drive the conformational changes in the catalytic cycle of the protein.
Furthermore, the medium inside living cell is viscoelastic. Pulling cargo in
such an environment takes more energy than in aqueous buffer solution. Here we
propose a mechanism for the motor to more efficiently utilize chemical energy.
In our model the energy is used to ratchet the cargo forward. The motor no
longer pulls, but only holds a bead or a vesicle, allowing for Brownian motion
in a range limited by the elasticity of the motor-cargo-track system. The
consequence of such a mechanism is the dependency of motion not only on the
motor, but also on the cargo (especially it's size) and on the environment
(i.e. it's viscosity and structure). However, current experimental works rarely
provide this type of information for in vivo studies. We suggest that even
small differences between assays can impact the outcome. Our results agree with
those obtained in wet laboratories and provide novel insight in the mechanism
of a molecular motor's functioning.

strain due to elastic deformations will give rise to so-called `pseudomagnetic

(SGB) device to detect the pseudo-magnetoexcitons (PME) in the absence of

strong PMFs due to strain engineering, which give rise to Landau quantization.
The pseudo-Landau levels (PLLs) of electron-hole pair under inhomogeneous PMFs
in SGB are analytically obtained in the absence of Coulomb interactions. Based
on the general analytical optical absorption selection rule for PME, we show
that the optical absorption spectrums can interpret the corresponding formation
of Dirac-type PME. We also predict that in the presence of inhomogeneous PMFs,
the superfluidity-normal phase transition temperature of PME is greater than
that under homogeneous PMFs.}

CTRW and FFPE description which is featured by finite mean residence times
(MRTs) in any spatial domain of finite size. Transient subdiffusive transport
can occur on a very large time scale $\tau_c$ which can greatly exceed mean
residence time in any trap, $\tau_c\gg <\tau>$, and even not being related to

However, mesoscopic transport is anomalous. Differently from viscoelastic
subdiffusion no long-range anti-correlations among position increments are
required. Moreover, our study makes it obvious that the transient subdiffusion

a macroscale. This observation has profound implications for anomalous

hole corresponds to a specific velocity distribution in the aftermath of a
peripheral collision, and this distribution is not realistic at all points of

demonstrate that, on the contrary, a Quark-Gluon Plasma with any physically
reasonable internal velocity distribution corresponds to a black hole which is

\Delta=-1 (ferromagnetic point) the model is equivalent to the Heisenberg
ferromagnet and its degenerate ground state manifold is the SU(2) multiplet
with maximal total spin. Any state in this so-called ""symmetric sector"" is an
equal weight superposition of all possible spin configurations. In the gapless
phase at \Delta>-1 this property is progressively lost as one moves away from
the \Delta=-1 point. We investigate how the ES obtained from the states in this
manifold reflects this change, using exact diagonalization and Bethe ansatz
calculations. We find that in the limit \Delta ->-1^+ most of the ES levels
show divergent behavior. Moreover, while at \Delta=-1 the ES contains no
information about the boundaries, for \Delta>-1 it depends dramatically on the
choice of boundary conditions. For both open and periodic boundary conditions
the ES exhibits an elegant multiplicity structure for which we conjecture a
combinatorial formula. We also study the entanglement eigenfunctions, i.e. the
eigenfunctions of the reduced density matrix. We find that the eigenfunctions
corresponding to the non diverging levels mimic the behavior of the state
wavefunction, whereas the others show intriguing polynomial structures. Finally
we analyze the distribution of the ES levels as the system is detuned away from

is represented by a quantum Boltzmann equation, which additionally includes
collisional processes which transfer atoms between these two subsystems. In the
mean-field-dominated regime collisions are treated perturbatively and the full

best known upper bounds are the same as those concerning the largest possible
difference of Goldbach numbers (that is, numbers which can be written as the
sum of two primes). Thus, we know that any interval of the form [X, X+X^c]
contains numbers which are the difference (or sum, respectively) of two primes,
where c=21/800. It is announced in our work that there is a constant C such
that for sufficiently large X all intervals of the form [X, X+(logX)^C] contain
an even integer which can be written as the difference of two primes. The work
contains, as an illustration of the method, the proof of the weaker result that
given an arbitrarily small c>0, the interval [X, X+X^c] contains the difference
of two primes if X is large enough. Some conditional results are announced too,
which are valid under the deep unproved hypothesis that primes have an
admissible level of distribution larger than 1/2. The above hypothesis implies,
for example, the existence of a large constant C (depending on the admissible
distribution level of the primes) such that for sufficiently large values of X

the difference of two consecutive primes in infinitely many ways.

extremely harsh broadcast model that relies only on carrier sensing. The model
consists of an anonymous broadcast network in which nodes have no knowledge
about the topology of the network or even an upper bound on its size.
Furthermore, it is assumed that an adversary chooses at which time slot each
node wakes up. At each time slot a node can either beep, that is, emit a
signal, or be silent. At a particular time slot, beeping nodes receive no
feedback, while silent nodes can only differentiate between none of its
neighbors beeping, or at least one of its neighbors beeping.
  We start by proving a lower bound that shows that in this model, it is not
possible to locally converge to an MIS in sub-polynomial time. We then study
four different relaxations of the model which allow us to circumvent the lower
bound and find an MIS in polylogarithmic time. First, we show that if a
polynomial upper bound on the network size is known, it is possible to find an
MIS in O(log^3 n) time. Second, if we assume sleeping nodes are awoken by
neighboring beeps, then we can also find an MIS in O(log^3 n) time. Third, if
in addition to this wakeup assumption we allow sender-side collision detection,
that is, beeping nodes can distinguish whether at least one neighboring node is
beeping concurrently or not, we can find an MIS in O(log^2 n) time. Finally, if
instead we endow nodes with synchronous clocks, it is also possible to find an
MIS in O(log^2 n) time.

formally subleading in $1/m_t$ are calculated, and their influence on the

We find that, for the differential K-factor, the heavy-top limit is valid at

and it has been a long standing question what possible mechanism could achieve
this task. Mechanisms from the field of statistical physics have long been
suggesting that this homeostasis of brain activity could occur even without a
central regulator, via self-organization on the level of neurons and their
interactions, alone. Such physical mechanisms from the class of self-organized
criticality exhibit characteristic dynamical signatures, similar to seismic
activity related to earthquakes. Measurements of cortex rest activity showed
first signs of dynamical signatures potentially pointing to self-organized
critical dynamics in the brain. Indeed, recent more accurate measurements
allowed for a detailed comparison with scaling theory of non-equilibrium
critical phenomena, proving the existence of criticality in cortex dynamics. We
here compare this new evaluation of cortex activity data to the predictions of
the earliest physics spin model of self-organized critical neural networks. We
find that the model matches with the recent experimental data and its
interpretation in terms of dynamical signatures for criticality in the brain.
The combination of signatures for criticality, power law distributions of
avalanche sizes and durations, as well as a specific scaling relationship
between anomalous exponents, defines a universality class characteristic of the
particular critical phenomenon observed in the neural experiments. The spin
model is a candidate for a minimal model of a self-organized critical adaptive
network for the universality class of neural criticality. As a prototype model,
it provides the background for models that include more biological details, yet
share the same universality class characteristic of the homeostasis of activity
in the brain.

through hydrogen bonds for temperatures ranging from 210 K to 350 K by the
introduction of a set of order parameters taking into account the configuration

models overlap onto a master curve. Interestingly, increased stabilization of
fully coordinated structures extending to at least two solvation shells is
found for models that are able to reproduce the correct position of the density

comprehensive involutive system. This notion plays the same role in theory of
involutive bases as the notion of comprehensive Groebner system in theory of
Groebner bases. Given a parametric ideal, the space of parameters is decomposed
into a finite set of cells. Each cell yields the corresponding involutive basis
of the ideal for the values of parameters in that cell. Using the Gerdt-Blinkov
algorithm for computing involutive bases and also the Montes algorithm for
computing comprehensive Groebner systems, we present an algorithm for
construction of comprehensive involutive systems. The proposed algorithm has
been implemented in Maple, and we provide an illustrative example showing the
step-by-step construction of comprehensive involutive system by our algorithm.

measured, for the first time, the rate at which the QPO frequency changes as a
function of QPO frequency. For this we used the spread of the QPO frequency
over groups of 10 consecutive measurements, sampling timescales between 320 and
1600 s, and the time derivative of the QPO frequency over timescales of 32 to
160 s. We found that: (i) Both the QPO-frequency spread and the QPO time
derivative decrease by a factor ~ 3 as the QPO frequency increases. (ii) The
average value of the QPO time derivative decreases by a factor of ~ 2 as the
timescale over which the derivative is measured increases from less than 64 s
to 160 s. (iii) The relation between the absolute value of the QPO time
derivative and the QPO frequency is consistent with being the same both for the
positive and negative QPO-frequency derivative. We show that, if either the
lower or the upper kHz QPO reflects the Keplerian frequency at the inner edge
of the accretion disc, these results support a scenario in which the inner part
of the accretion disc is truncated at a radius that is set by the combined

predicted failure times to covariates and are a useful alternative to models
that work on the hazard function or the survival function. For case-cohort
data, much less development has been done with AFT models. In addition to the
missing covariates outside of the sub-cohort in controls, challenges from AFT
model inferences with full cohort are retained. The regression parameter
estimator is hard to compute because the most widely used rank-based estimating
equations are not smooth. Further, its variance depends on the unspecified
error distribution, and most methods rely on computationally intensive
bootstrap to estimate it. We propose fast rank-based inference procedures for
AFT models, applying recent methodological advances to the context of
case-cohort data. Parameters are estimated with an induced smoothing approach
that smooths the estimating functions and facilitates the numerical solution.
Variance estimators are obtained through efficient resampling methods for
nonsmooth estimating functions that avoids full blown bootstrap. Simulation
studies suggest that the recommended procedure provides fast and valid
inferences among several competing procedures. Application to a tumor study
demonstrates the utility of the proposed method in routine data analysis.

In this paper, the radically different dynamical role played by the top quark
is elaborated. It does not reproduce Standard Model ""$ t\bar{t} $"" events but,
instead, these events are reproduced by the multiple vector boson decays of the
$\eta_6$ - the remnant pseudoscalar resonance left by color sextet electroweak
symmetry breaking. Evidence that the $\eta_6$ appears in LHC and Tevatron Z
pair cross-sections is discussed. A second pseudoscalar resonance, the
$\eta_3$, contains a $t\bar{t}$ pair and mixes with the $\eta_6$ via the
pomeron. The mixing should give the $\eta_3$ a mass between the triplet and
sextet scales. It could also have a decay mode pattern that is more consistent
with LHC and Tevatron results than the (mass spectrum determined) pattern of
the Standard Model Higgs boson that many hope has been discovered.
Unfortunately, at present, there is no possibility to calculate explicit

part due to the challenges associated with alignment on the signal scale using

alignment, based on the compute-and-forward approach. Within this framework,
each receiver decodes by first recovering two or more linear combinations of
the transmitted codewords with integer-valued coefficients and then solving
these equations for its desired codeword. For the special case of symmetric
channel gains, this framework is used to derive the approximate sum capacity of
the Gaussian interference channel, up to an explicitly defined outage set of
the channel gains. The key contributions are the capacity lower bounds for the
weak through strong interference regimes, where each receiver should jointly
decode its own codeword along with part of the interfering codewords. As part
of the analysis, it is shown that decoding K linear combinations of the
codewords can approach the sum capacity of the K-user Gaussian multiple-access

discrete scatterers, supporting a single mode of current oscillation
represented by a single dynamic variable. We derive a Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian formalism for the coupled electromagnetic fields and oscillating
currents in the length gauge, obtained by the Power-Zienau-Woolley

described by polarization and magnetization densities that, to the lowest order
in a multipole expansion, generate electric and magnetic dipole excitations. We
derive a closed set of equations for the coherently scattered field and normal
mode amplitudes of current oscillations of each resonator both within the
rotating wave approximation, in which case the radiative decay rate is much
smaller than the resonance frequency, and without such an assumption. The set
of equations includes the radiative couplings between a discrete set of
resonators mediated by the electromagnetic field, fully incorporating recurrent
scattering processes to all orders. By considering an example of a
two-dimensional split ring resonator metamaterial array, we show that the

eigenmodes, resonance frequencies, and radiative linewidths that result from
strong radiative interactions between closely-spaced resonators.

gravity and KPZ"" By B.Duplantier and S.Sheffield.
  The study of statistical physics models in two dimensions (d=2) at their
critical point is in general a significantly hard problem (not to mention the
d=3 case). In the eighties, three physicists, Knizhnik, Polyakov et
Zamolodchikov (KPZ) came up in \cite{\KPZ} with a novel and far-reaching
approach in order to understand the critical behavior of these models. Among
these, one finds for example random walks, percolation as well as the Ising
model. The main underlying idea of their approach is to study these models
along a two-step procedure as follows: a/ First of all, instead of considering
the model on some regular lattice of the plane (such as $\Z^2$ for example),
one defines it instead on a well-chosen ""random planar lattice"". Doing so
corresponds to studying the model in its {\it quantum gravity} form. In the
case of percolation, the appropriate choice of random lattice matches with the
so-called planar maps. b/ Then it remains to get back to the actual {\it
Euclidean} setup. This is done thanks to the celebrated {\bf KPZ formula} which
gives a very precise correspondence between the geometric properties of models
in their quantum gravity formulation and their analogs in the Euclidean case.
  The nature and the origin of such a powerful correspondence remained rather
mysterious for a long time. In fact, the KPZ formula is still not rigorously
established and remains a conjectural correspondence. The purpose of this
survey is to explain how the recent work of Duplantier and Sheffield enables to
explain some of the mystery hidden behind this KPZ formula. To summarize their
contribution in one sentence, their work implies a beautiful interpretation of
the KPZ correpondence through a uniformization of the random lattice, seen as a
Riemann surface.

Fransson (1992). We applied the non-thermal calculations to the blue supergiant
explosion model whose early evolution was studied in Dessart & Hillier (2010).
Non-thermal processes generally increase excitation and ionization and decrease
the temperature of the ejecta. We confirm that non-thermal processes are
crucial for modeling the nebular spectra. Both optical HI and HeI lines are
significantly strengthened. While optical HeI lines are not easily discerned in
observational spectra due to severe blending with other lines, HeI 2.058 \mu m
provides an excellent opportunity to infer the influence of non-thermal
processes. We also discuss the processes controlling the formation of the HeI
lines during the nebular epoch. Most lines of other species are only slightly
affected. We also show that the inclusion of FeI has substantial
line-blanketing effects on the optical spectra. Our model spectra and synthetic
light curves are compared to the observations of SN 1987A. The spectral
evolution shows broad agreement with the observations, especially H\alpha. The
uncertainties of the non-thermal solver are studied, and are expected to be
small. With this new addition of non-thermal effects in CMFGEN, we now treat
all known important processes controlling the radiative transfer of a supernova

several advantages. The algorithm does not require many input parameters. It
requires only three parameters, the number of the points in the data space, the

the grid reflects the accuracy that should be achieved by the algorithm. The
algorithm is capable of discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes. The
computational complexity of the algorithm is comparable to the complexity of
the most efficient clustering algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented and
tested against different ranges of database sizes. The performance results show
that the running time of the algorithm is superior to the most well known

a succession of transitions between two phases A and B, like A-B-A-B, when just

the 1D Bose Hubbard model between its Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid phase
as the hopping amplitude is increased from zero. Here we analyse this
counter-intuitive phenomenon directly in the thermodynamic limit by utilizing
the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm to variationally minimize
an infinite matrix product state (MPS) parameterized by a matrix size chi.
Exploiting the direct restriction on the half-chain entanglement imposed by
fixing chi, we determined that re-entrance in the MI lobes only emerges in this
approximate when chi >= 8. This entanglement threshold is found to be
coincident with the ability an infinite MPS to be simultaneously
particle-number symmetric and capture the kinetic energy carried by
particle-hole excitations above the MI. Focussing on the tip of the MI lobe we
then applied, for the first time, a general finite-entanglement scaling
analysis of the infinite order Kosterlitz-Thouless critical point located
there. By analysing chi's up to a very moderate chi = 70 we obtained an
estimate of the KT transition as t_KT = 0.30 +/- 0.01, demonstrating the how a

first-order transition. For $r<r_{\rm max}$, the critical threshold increases

stars observed in the LMC and in NGC 6200. Tentative identifications of
pulsation modes have been made, and a number of new B pulsators have been
noted. Interesting features have also been discovered in the light curves of
some of these stars.

formula that relates the regularized analytic torsion associated to the even
symmetric powers of the standard representation of SL_2(C) to the corresponding
Reidemeister torsion. Our proof rests on an expression of the analytic torsion
in terms of special values of Ruelle zeta functions as well as on recent work
of Pere Menal-Ferrer and Joan Porti.

dimensions through the scaling of the hysteresis area, for a maximum magnetic
field that is equal to the saturation field. We perform a systematic analysis
for the whole range of the bond randomness as a function of the sweep rate, by
means of frustration-preserving hard-spin mean field theory. Data collapse
within the entirety of the spin-glass phase driven adiabatically (i.e.,
infinitely-slow field variation) is found, revealing a power-law scaling of the
hysteresis area as a function of the antiferromagnetic bond fraction and the
temperature. Two dynamic regimes separated by a threshold frequency $\omega_c$
characterize the dependence on the sweep rate of the oscillating field. For
$\omega < \omega_c$, the hysteresis area is equal to its value in the adiabatic
limit $\omega = 0$, while for $\omega > \omega_c$ it increases with the
frequency through another randomness-dependent power law.

reactor neutrino flux anomaly give tantalizing hints of new physics. Models
beyond the neutrino-SM have been developed to explain these results and involve
one or more additional neutrinos that are non-interacting or ""sterile.""
Neutrino beams produced from the decay of muons in a racetrack-like decay ring
provide a powerful way to study this potential new physics. In this Letter of
Intent, we describe a facility, nuSTORM, ""Neutrinos from STORed Muons,"" and an
appropriate far detector for neutrino oscillation searches at short baseline.
We present sensitivity plots that indicated that this experimental approach can
provide over 10 sigma confirmation or rejection of the LSND/MinBooNE results.
In addition we indicate how the facility can be used to make precision neutrino
interaction cross section measurements important to the next generation of
long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.

interactive as well as it links universally to all particles including zero

gravitational field of a mass point, we would demonstrate how are these
features incorporated? We would also show, unlike the Newtonian gravity, why
the gravitational potential in the Schwarzshild solution can have its zero only
at infinity and nowhere else;i.e. it is determined absolutely. We also consider
particle orbits to expose certain insightful and subtle points of concept and

perspective of a geometrical analysis of transcription. It is suggested that
for transcription to be possible, the pitch angle of B-DNA must be smaller than
the angle of zero-twist. At the zero-twist angle the double helix is maximally
rotated and its strain-twist coupling vanishes. A numerical estimate of the
pitch angle for B-DNA based on differential geometry is compared with numbers
obtained from existing empirical data. The crystallographic studies shows that
the pitch angle is approximately 38 deg., less than the corresponding
zero-twist angle of 41.8 deg., which is consistent with the suggested principle
for transcription.
