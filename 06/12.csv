in bipartite graphs in the streaming model. First, we consider the question of
how well maximum matching can be approximated in a single pass over the input
using $\tilde O(n)$ space, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input
graph. Two natural variants of this problem have been considered in the
literature: (1) the edge arrival setting, where edges arrive in the stream and
(2) the vertex arrival setting, where vertices on one side of the graph arrive
in the stream together with all their incident edges. The latter setting has
also been studied extensively in the context of online algorithms, where each
arriving vertex has to either be matched irrevocably or discarded upon arrival.
In the online setting, the celebrated algorithm of Karp-Vazirani-Vazirani
achieves a $1-1/e$ approximation. Despite the fact that the streaming model is
less restrictive in that the algorithm is not constrained to match vertices
irrevocably upon arrival, the best known approximation in the streaming model
with vertex arrivals and $\tilde O(n)$ space is the same factor of $1-1/e$.
  We show that no single pass streaming algorithm that uses $\tilde O(n)$ space
can achieve a better than $1-1/e$ approximation to maximum matching, even in
the vertex arrival setting. This leads to the striking conclusion that no
single pass streaming algorithm can do better than online algorithms unless it
uses significantly more than $\tilde O(n)$ space. Additionally, our bound
yields the best known impossibility result for approximating matchings in the
edge arrival model.
  We also give a simple algorithm that achieves approximation ratio
$1-e^{-k}k^{k-1}/(k-1)!=1-\frac1{\sqrt{2\pi k}}+o(1/k)$ in $k$ passes in the
vertex arrival model using linear space, improving upon previously best known
convergence.

elucidate in detail the starburst interaction processes. Some open issues
regarding the 2D structure of the main properties of the ionized gas remain to
be addressed. Using IFS data obtained with FLAMES, we derived 2D maps for
different tracers of electron density (n_e), electron temperature (T_e) and
ionization degree. The maps for n_e as traced by several line ratios are
compatible with a 3D stratified view of the nebula with the highest n_e in the
innermost layers and a decrease of n_e outwards. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that a T_e map based on [SII] lines for an extragalactic object is
presented. The joint interpretation of our two T_e maps is consistent with a
T_e structure in 3D with higher temperatures close to the main ionizing source
surrounded by a colder and more diffuse component. The highest ionization
degree is found at the peak of emission for the gas with relatively high
ionization in the main GHIIR and lower ionization degree delineating the more
extended diffuse component. Abundances for O, Ne and Ar are constant over the
mapped area within <0.1 dex. The mean 12+log(O/H) is 8.26 while the relative
abundances of log(N/O), log(Ne/O) and log(Ar/O) were \sim-1.32, -0.65 and
-2.33, respectively. There are two locations with enhanced N/O. The first
(log(N/O)\sim-0.95) is associated to two super star clusters. The second
(log(N/O)\sim-1.17), reported here for the first time, is associated to two
moderately massive (2-4x10^4 M_sun) and relatively old (\sim10 Myr) clusters. A
comparison of the N/O map with those produced by strong line methods supports
the use of N2O2 over N2S2 in the search for chemical inhomogeneities within a
galaxy. The results on the localized nitrogen enhancement were used to compile
and discuss the factors that affect the complex relationship between Wolf-Rayet
stars and N/O excess.

provided that the constant \beta, measuring the coupling, is strong enough. The
density parameters of both components are then constant, as they expand as
a^{-4}. If the field energy is then prevalently kinetic, as is expected, its
energy is exactly half of the pressureless component; the dual component as a
whole, then, has a density parameter \Omega_{cd} = 3/4\beta^2 (e.g., for
\beta~2.5, \Omega_{cd}~0.1, in accordance with Dark Radiation expectations).
The stationary evolution can only be broken by the rising of other

z~3-5x10^3. When such extra component(s) become(s) dominant, the densities of

easily tuned to fit Dark Energy data, while the coupled DM density parameter

DM components exist. The one responsible for the break of the stationary regime
could be made, e.g., by thermally distributed particles with mass even >>1$-2

orders of magnitude stronger compared to the force created in conventional

extreme optical energy compression within the air slot region. Both numerical
simulation and analytical treatment are carried out to study the dependence of
the optical forces on the waveguide geometries and the metamaterial
permittivity tensors, including the attractive optical forces for the symmetric
modes and the repulsive optical forces for the anti-symmetric modes. The
significantly enhanced transverse optical forces result from the strong optical
mode coupling strength between two metamaterial waveguides, which can be
explained with an explicit relation derived from the coupled mode theory.
Moreover, the calculation on realistic metal-dielectric multilayer structures
indicates that the predicted giant optical forces are achievable in
experiments, which will open the door for various optomechanical applications

captures relevant features of the irreversible adsorption of spherical

square cells, where adsorption can take place, centered at the vertices of a

control the geometry of the pattern, namely, the cell size and cell-cell
distance, measured in terms of the average particle diameter. However, to
describe the phase diagram, two additional dimensionless parameters, the
minimum and maximum particle radii are also required. We find that the
transition between any two adjacent regions of the phase diagram solely depends
on the largest and smallest particle sizes, but not on the shape of the
distribution function of the radii. We consider size dispersions up-to 20% of
the average radius using a physically motivated truncated Gaussian-size
distribution, and focus on the regime where adsorbing particles do not interact
with those previously adsorbed on neighboring cells to characterize the jammed
state structure. The study generalizes previous exact relations on monodisperse
particles to account for size dispersion. Due to the presence of the pattern,
the coverage shows a non-monotonic dependence on the cell size. The pattern
also affects the radius of adsorbed particles, where one observes preferential
adsorption of smaller radii particularly at high polydispersity.

communication require photodetection efficiencies beyond a threshold eta_{crit}
that depends on the Bell inequality and the noise affecting the entangled state
received by the distant parties. Most calculations of eta_{crit} assume that
the noise is random and can be modeled as white noise. However, most sources
suffer from colored noise. Indeed, since entangled states are usually created
as a superposition of two possible deexcitation paths, a partial
distinguishability between the two processes leads to the appearance of colored
noise in the generated state. Recently, there was a proposal for a
loophole-free Bell test [A. Cabello and F. Sciarrino, Phys. Rev. X 2, 021010
(2012)], where a specific colored noise appears as a consequence of the
precertification of the photon's presence through single-photon spontaneous
parametric down-conversion. Here we obtain eta_{crit}, the optimal quantum
states, and the local settings for a loophole-free Bell test as a function of
the amount of colored noise. We consider three bipartite Bell inequalities with
n dichotomic settings: Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (n=2), I_{3322} (n=3), and
A_5 (n=4), both for the case of symmetric efficiencies, corresponding to
photon-photon Bell tests, and for the totally asymmetric case, corresponding to
atom-photon Bell tests. Remarkably, in all these cases, eta_{crit} is robust
against the colored noise. The present analysis can find application in any
test of Bell inequalities in which the dominant noise is of the colored type.

proposed framework assists in quantifying the impact of various fading channel

Firstly, we derive a semi-analytical expression for the distribution of the
location of the scheduled user in a given cell considering a wide range of
scheduling schemes. Based on this, we derive the distribution and moment
generating function (MGF) of the ICI considering a single interfering cell.
Consequently, we determine the MGF of the cumulative ICI observed from all
interfering cells and derive explicit MGF expressions for three typical fading
models. Finally, we utilize the obtained expressions to evaluate important
network performance metrics such as the outage probability, ergodic capacity
and average fairness numerically. Monte-Carlo simulation results are provided

the statistical modeling of uplink inter-cell interference (ICI) considering

scheduling with power adaptation reduces the ICI, average power consumption of

(WSRT) observations we find that the cluster hosts a double radio relic system
as well as a 1.65 Mpc radio halo covering the region between the two relics.
The relics are diametrically located on opposite sides of the cluster center.
The NE and SW relics have sizes of 1.3 and 0.9 Mpc, respectively. In case of an
isolated binary merger event, the relative sizes of the relics suggest a mass
ratio about 2:1. We measure integrated spectra of -1.16 \pm 0.03 for the NE and
-1.10 \pm 0.05 for the SW relic. We conclude that this cluster has undergone a
violent binary merger event and the relics are best explained by particles
(re)accelerated in outwards traveling shock waves. The spectral indices suggest
the relics trace shock waves with Mach numbers (M) of around 3.5 to 4.5. These
relatively high Mach numbers derived from the radio spectral index are
comparable to those derived for a few other recently discovered relics. This
implies that merger shocks with M > 3 are relatively common in cluster
outskirts if our understanding of diffusive shock acceleration is correct.

objects and binaries can migrate, accrete and merge within disks around
supermassive black holes. While dynamical heating by cusp stars excites the
velocity dispersion of nuclear cluster objects (NCOs) in the disk, gas in the
disk damps NCO orbits. If gas damping dominates, NCOs remain in the disk with
circularized orbits and large collision cross-sections. IMBH seeds can grow
extremely rapidly by collisions with disk NCOs at low relative velocities,
allowing for super-Eddington growth rates. Once an IMBH seed has cleared out
its feeding zone of disk NCOs, growth of IMBH seeds can become dominated by gas
accretion from the AGN disk. However, the IMBH can migrate in the disk and
expand its feeding zone, permitting a super-Eddington accretion rate to
continue. Growth of IMBH seeds via NCO collisions is enhanced by a pile-up of
migrators.
  We highlight the remarkable parallel between the growth of IMBH in AGN disks
with models of giant planet growth in protoplanetary disks. If an IMBH becomes
massive enough it can open a gap in the AGN disk. IMBH migration in AGN disks
may stall, allowing them to survive the end of the AGN phase and remain in
galactic nuclei. Our proposed mechanisms should be more efficient at growing
IMBH in AGN disks than the standard model of IMBH growth in stellar clusters.
Dynamical heating of disk NCOs by cusp stars is transferred to the gas in a AGN
disk helping to maintain the outer disk against gravitational instability.
Model predictions, observational constraints and implications are discussed in
a companion paper (Paper II).

place in a multi-stable system in which each attractor state represents a cell
type and attractor transitions correspond to cell differentiation paths. This
new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first
proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development one is interested
in the ""relative stabilities"" of N attractors (N>2). Existing theories of state
transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit
in the transition between a pair attractor but do not offer the notion of a
global potential function that relate more than two attractors to each other.
Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape
in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an
overview of the currently available methods, discuss their limitations and
propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permit the computation of a
quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin-Wentzell potential
but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are
given and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.

Delta_v_abs = -179 +/- 73 km s^{-1}, comparable to that of LBGs. These positive

and then compactify it on $\mathbb{R}^{3}\times S^{1}$. The gauge symmetry of
the theory is broken by a vacuum expectation value of the scalar field, which
parametrises the moduli space. The spectrum of BPS states, carrying electric
and magnetic charges, is piece-wise constant, changing only when the vacuum
expectation value crosses the so-called walls of marginal stability. Kontsevich
and Soibelman proposed an algebraic construction relating BPS spectra on both
sides of a wall of marginal stability. These formulae are known to correctly
relate the strong- and weak-coupling spectra in theories with gauge group SU(2)
with and without fundamental flavours; we generalise this result to gauge group
SU(n) without flavours in the weak-coupling regime. In addition, we find the
walls of marginal stability in the SU(n) theory at the root of the Higgs branch
and, employing the wall-crossing formula, determine the BPS spectrum in all
regions of the moduli space. Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke (GMN) proposed an
ansatz expressing the moduli space metric of $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory on
$\mathbb{R}^{3}\times S^{1}$ in terms of a set of integral equations. Using the
GMN ansatz, we find perturbative and instanton corrections in
$\mathbb{R}^{3}\times S^{1}$ for gauge group SU(2) with or without flavours and
for gauge group SU(n) without flavours. For gauge group SU(n), we also
demonstrate that the predicted two-instanton metric is continuous across the
walls. Then, we calculate instanton corrections from first principles. We find
perfect agreement between the GMN prediction and the first-principles result.
We also take the limit of small radius of the compactified dimension finding
one- and two-instanton corrections in three dimensions, recovering some of the
previously known semiclassical results.

of 2 higher than the SFR derived from extinction corrected UV emission alone,

galaxies, we find that estimates of SFR_(IR+UV) for the stacked samples are
comparable to those derived from extinction corrected UV emission, although the
uncertainties are large. We find evidence for an increasing fraction of dust
obscured star formation with stellar mass, finding SFR_IR/SFR_UV \propto

which are individual components of almost-invariant sets [Stremler, Ross,
Grover, Kumar, Topological chaos and periodic braiding of almost-cyclic sets.
Physical Review Letters 106 (2011), 114101]. In this context, almost-cyclic
sets are periodic regions in the flow with high local residence time that act
as stirrers or `ghost rods' around which the surrounding fluid appears to be
stretched and folded. In the present work, we discuss the bifurcation of the
almost-cyclic sets as a system parameter is varied, which results in a sequence
of topologically distinct braids. We show that, for Stokes' flow in a
lid-driven cavity, these various braids give good lower bounds on the
topological entropy over the respective parameter regimes in which they exist.
We make the case that a topological analysis based on spatiotemporal braiding
of almost-cyclic sets can be used for analyzing chaos in fluid flows. Hence we
further develop a connection between set-oriented statistical methods and
topological methods, which promises to be an important analysis tool in the
study of complex systems.

geometry: magnetization oscillations are induced in a thin NiFe nanostripe by a
spin polarized current injected via square-shaped CoFe nanomagnets on the top
of this stripe. In a sufficiently large out-of-plane field, a propagating
oscillation mode appears in such a system. Due to the absence of the
geometrically caused wave decay in 1D systems, this mode is expected to enable
a long-distance synchronization between STNOs. Indeed, our simulations predict
that synchronization of two STNOs on a nanowire is possible up to the
intercontact distance 3 mkm (for the nanowire width 50 nm). However, we have
also found several qualitatively new features of the synchronization behaviour
for this system, which make the achievement of a stable synchronization in this
geometry to a highly non-trivial task. In particular, there exist a minimal
distance between the nanocontacts, below which a synchronization of STNOs can
not be achieved. Further, when the current value in the first contact is kept
constant, the amplitude of synchronized oscillations depends non-monotonously
on the current value in the second contact. Finally, for one and the same
currents values through the contacts there might exist several synchronized
states (with different frequencies), depending on the initial conditions.

together with the high luminosity, allowed us to measure the cross section for
the $\gamma^* p \to n \pi^+$ process in 140 ($Q^2$, $x_B$, $t$) bins:
$0.16<x_B<0.58$, 1.6 GeV$^2<$$Q^2$$<4.5$ GeV$^2$ and 0.1 GeV$^2<$$-t$$<5.3$

percent. Differential cross sections are compared to two theoretical models,
based either on hadronic (Regge phenomenology) or on partonic (handbag diagram)
degrees of freedom. Both can describe the gross features of the data reasonably
well, but differ strongly in their ingredients. If the handbag approach can be
validated in this kinematical region, our data contain the interesting

high latitudes. For the first time, we run a continuous 15 year simulation,
using bipolar active regions determined from US National Solar Observatory,
Kitt Peak magnetograms between 1996 and 2011. Using this simulation, we are
able to address the outstanding question of whether magnetic helicity transport
from active latitudes can overcome the effect of differential rotation at
higher latitudes. Acting alone, differential rotation would produce high
latitude filaments with opposite chirality to the majority type in each
hemisphere. We find that differential rotation can indeed lead to opposite
chirality at high latitudes, but only for around 5 years of the solar cycle
following the polar field reversal. At other times, including the rising phase,
transport of magnetic helicity from lower latitudes overcomes the effect of in
situ differential rotation, producing the majority chirality even on the polar
crowns at polar field reversal. These simulation predictions will allow for
future testing of the non-potential coronal model. The results indicate the
importance of long-term memory and helicity transport from active latitudes
when modeling the structure and topology of the coronal magnetic field at
higher latitudes.

and thermal properties of solids, and its influence on superconductivity,
colossal magnetoresistance, and other many-body phenomena in
correlated-electron materials is currently the subject of intense research.
However, the non-local nature of the interactions between valence electrons and
lattice ions, often compounded by a plethora of vibrational modes, present
formidable challenges for attempts to experimentally control and theoretically
describe the physical properties of complex materials. Here we report a Raman
scattering study of the lattice dynamics in superlattices of the
high-temperature superconductor $\bf YBa_2 Cu_3 O_7$ and the
colossal-magnetoresistance compound $\bf La_{2/3}Ca_{1/3}MnO_{3}$ that suggests
a new approach to this problem. We find that a rotational mode of the MnO$_6$
octahedra in $\bf La_{2/3}Ca_{1/3}MnO_{3}$ experiences pronounced
superconductivity-induced lineshape anomalies, which scale linearly with the
thickness of the $\bf YBa_2 Cu_3 O_7$ layers over a remarkably long range of
several tens of nanometers. The transfer of the electron-phonon coupling
between superlattice layers can be understood as a consequence of long-range
Coulomb forces in conjunction with an orbital reconstruction at the interface.
The superlattice geometry thus provides new opportunities for controlled
modification of the electron-phonon interaction in complex materials.

in [10] with the purpose of unifying different settings of the index theorem.
This paper is one of the research topics announced in [10], {\S}10. The
definition of these new objects inserts the Alexander-Spanier idea for defining
the co-homology [8] into the corresponding constructions. This is done by
allowing only chains which have smal l support about the diagonal. This
definition, applicable at least in the case of the Banach sub-algebras of the
algebra of bounded operators on the Hilbert space of L2-sections in vector
bundles, differs from various constructions due to A. Connes [1], A. Connes,
H.Moscovici [2], M. Puschnigg [7], J. Cuntz [4]. In this paper we prove that
the local Hochschild homology of the Banach algebra of Hilbert-Schmidt
operators on any countable, locally finite homogeneous simplicial complex X is
naturally isomorphic the Alexander-Spanier homology of the space X, Theorem 1.
This result may be used to compute the local periodic cyclic homology of the
algebra of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on such spaces X. The same result should
hold in the case of the algebra of trace class operators L1 as well as in the
case of smoothing operators s \subset L 1. In addition, the tools we introduce
in this paper should apply also for computing the local Hochschild and periodic
cyclic homology of the Schatten class ideals Lp, at least for the other values

model for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in multiple
populations. In this model, the sampled populations in a species are related to
their common ancestor through a graph of ancestral populations. Using
genome-wide allele frequency data and a Gaussian approximation to genetic
drift, we infer the structure of this graph. We applied this method to a set of
55 human populations and a set of 82 dog breeds and wild canids. In both
species, we show that a simple bifurcating tree does not fully describe the
data; in contrast, we infer many migration events. While some of the migration
events that we find have been detected previously, many have not. For example,
in the human data we infer that Cambodians trace approximately 16% of their
ancestry to a population ancestral to other extant East Asian populations. In
the dog data, we infer that both the boxer and basenji trace a considerable
fraction of their ancestry (9% and 25%, respectively) to wolves subsequent to
domestication, and that East Asian toy breeds (the Shih Tzu and the Pekingese)
result from admixture between modern toy breeds and ""ancient"" Asian breeds.

dimensionality in magnetic exchange interactions, which may explain the

Ly {\alpha} (DLA) systems in the sightlines of quasars (QSOs) due to the Ly
{\alpha} forest blanketing and the low number of high-redshift quasars
detected. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with their higher luminosity are well suited
to study galaxies out to the formation of the first stars at z > 10. Its large
wavelength coverage makes the X-shooter spectrograph an excellent tool to study
the interstellar medium (ISM) of high redshift galaxies, in particular if the
redshift is not known beforehand. Here we determine the properties of a GRB
host at z = 4.66723 from a number of resonant low- and high ionization and
fine-structure absorption lines. This is one of the highest redshifts where a
detailed analysis with medium-resolution data has been possible. We detect one
intervening system at z = 2.18. The velocity components of the absorption lines
are fitted with Voigt-profiles and we determine a metallicity of [M/H] = -1.0
\pm 0.1 using S. The absorption lines show a complicated kinematic structure
which could point to a merger in progress. Si II* together with the restframe
UV energy release determined from GROND data gives us the distance of 0.3 to 1
kpc of the absorbing material from the GRB. We measure a low extinction of AV =
0.24 \pm 0.06 mag using X-ray spectral information and the flux calibrated
X-shooter spectrum. GRB-DLAs have a shallower evolution of metallicity with
redshift than QSO absorbers and no evolution in HI column density or ionization
fraction. GRB hosts at high redshift might continue the trend towards lower
metallicities in the LZ-relation with redshift, but the sample is still too
small to draw a definite conclusion. While the detection of GRBs at z > 4 with
current satellites is still difficult, they are very important for our
understanding of the early epochs of star- and galaxy-formation.

scalar field playing the role of the cosmic dark energy (DE) might provide
long-range dark interactions without conflicting with solar system bounds.
Although presently available observations allow to constrain such interactions
to a few percent of the gravitational strength, some recent studies have shown
that if CDM is composed by two different particle species having opposite
couplings to the DE field, such tight constraints can be considerably relaxed,
allowing for long-range scalar forces of order gravity without significantly
affecting observations both at the background and at the linear perturbations
level. In the present work, we extend the investigation of such Multiple Dark
Matter scenarios to the nonlinear regime of structure formation, by presenting
the first N-body simulations ever performed for these cosmologies. Our results
highlight some characteristic footprints of long-range scalar forces that arise
only in the nonlinear regime for specific models that would be otherwise
practically indistinguishable from the standard LCDM scenario both in the
background and in the growth of linear density perturbations. Among these
effects, the formation of ""mirror"" cosmic structures in the two CDM species,
the suppression of the nonlinear matter power spectrum at k > 1 h/Mpc, and the
fragmentation of collapsed halos, represent peculiar features that might
provide a direct way to constrain this class of cosmological models.

than a dozen flares in the cores of galaxies out to redshift $z \sim 0.4$.
Modeling these flares properly requires a prediction of the rate of mass return
to the black hole after a disruption. Through hydrodynamical simulation, we
show that aside from the full disruption of a solar mass star at the exact
limit where the star is destroyed, the common assumptions used to estimate
$\dot{M}(t)$, the rate of mass return to the black hole, are largely invalid.
While the analytical approximation to tidal disruption predicts that the
least-centrally concentrated stars and the deepest encounters should have more
quickly-peaked flares, we find that the most-centrally concentrated stars have
the quickest-peaking flares, and the trend between the time of peak and the
impact parameter for deeply-penetrating encounters reverses beyond the critical
distance at which the star is completely destroyed. We also show that the
most-centrally concentrated stars produced a characteristic drop in
$\dot{M}(t)$ shortly after peak when a star is only partially disrupted, with
the power law index $n$ being as extreme as -4 in the months immediately
following the peak of a flare. Additionally, we find that $n$ asymptotes to
$\simeq -2.2$ for both low- and high-mass stars for approximately half of all
stellar disruptions. Both of these results are significantly steeper than the
typically assumed $n = -5/3$. As these precipitous decay rates are only seen
for events in which a stellar core survives the disruption, they can be used to
determine if an observed tidal disruption flare produced a surviving remnant.
These results should be taken into consideration when flares arising from tidal
disruptions are modeled.

interestingly, the cold fronts are highly distorted in both groups, exhibiting
'wings' along the fronts. These features resemble the structures predicted from
non-viscous hydrodynamic simulations of gas sloshing, where Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities (KHIs) distort the cold fronts. This is in contrast to the
structure seen in many other sloshing and merger cold fronts, which are smooth
and featureless at the current observational resolution. Both magnetic fields

sub-sample of bright Swift long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) nearly complete in
redshift (~90%). Being free of selection effects (except flux limit), this
sample provides the possibility to compare the rest frame physical properties
of GRB prompt and afterglow emission in an unbiased way. The afterglow X-ray
luminosities are computed at four different rest frame times (5 min, 1 hr, 11
hr and 24 hr after trigger) and compared with the prompt emission isotropic
energy E_iso, the isotropic peak luminosity L_iso and the rest frame peak
energy E_peak. We find that the rest frame afterglow X-ray luminosity do
correlate with these prompt emission quantities, but the significance of each
correlation decreases over time. This result is in agreement with the idea that
the GRB X-ray light curve can be described as the result of a combination of
different components whose relative contribution and weight change with time,
with the prompt and afterglow emission dominating at early and late time,
respectively. In particular, we found evidence that the plateau and the shallow
decay phase often observed in GRB X-ray light curves are powered by activity
from the central engine. The existence of the L_X-E_iso correlation at late
times (t_rf > 11 hr) suggests a similar radiative efficiency among different
bursts with on average about 6% of the total kinetic energy powering the prompt
emission.

much more frequently on the dwarf scale than for L_*-galaxies. As an example,
we present a numerical simulation of a 20% (virial) mass ratio merger between a
dark satellite and a disky dwarf (akin to the Fornax dwarf galaxy in
luminosity) that shows that the merger remnant has a spheroidal morphology. We
conclude that perturbations by dark satellites provide a plausible path for the
formation of dSph systems and also could trigger starbursts in gas rich dwarf
galaxies. Therefore the transition from disky to the often amorphous,
irregular, or spheroidal morphologies of dwarfs could be a natural consequence
of the dynamical heating of hitherto unobservable dark satellites.

their counterparts with M* < 10^10.5 MSun. Nevertheless, a smooth downsizing
trend with galaxy mass is not observed, and the large scatter in starburst ages
indicate that SGs are not a particularly coeval population. Around half of the

that have experienced a recent major merger, show only modest enhancements
(~40%) in their specific star formation rates. Our empirical study indicates
that processes other than major mergers (e.g. violent disk instability driven
by cold streams and/or minor mergers) likely play a dominant role in building
SGs, and creating a significant fraction of the old stellar populations that

Quantum N-Portrait, it was shown that continuous global symmetries are
compatible with quantum black hole physics. In the present paper we revise
within the same framework the semi-classical black hole bound on the number of
particle species N_{species}. We show that unlike the bound on global charge,
the bound on species survives in the quantum picture and gives rise to a new
fundamental length-scale, L_{species} = sqrt{N_{species}} L_P$, beyond which
the resolution of species identities is impossible. This finding nullifies the
so-called species problem. This scale sets the size of the lightest quantum
black hole in the theory, Planckion.
  A crucial difference between the gravitational and non-gravitational species
emerges. For gravitational species, the lightest black holes are exactly at the
scale of perturbative unitarity violation, which is a strong indication for

and X-ray radiation. We calculate evaporation rates by solving the
hydrodynamical problem for planetary evaporation including heating from both
X-ray and EUV radiation. We show that most close-in planets (a<0.1 AU) are
evaporating hydrodynamically, with the evaporation occurring in two distinct
regimes: X-ray driven, in which the X-ray heated flow contains a sonic point,
and EUV driven, in which the X-ray region is entirely sub-sonic. The mass-loss
rates scale as L_X/a^2 for X-ray driven evaporation, and as Phi_*^{1/2}/a for
EUV driven evaporation at early times, with mass-loss rates of order
10e10-10e14 g/s. No exact scaling exists for the mass-loss rate with planet
mass and planet radius, however, in general evaporation proceeds more rapidly
for planets with lower densities and higher masses. Furthermore, we find that
in general the transition from X-ray driven to EUV driven evaporation occurs at
lower X-ray luminosities for planets closer to their parent stars and for
planets with lower densities.
  Coupling our evaporation models to the evolution of the high energy radiation
- which falls with time - we are able to follow the evolution of evaporating
planets. We find that most planets start off evaporating in the X-ray driven
regime, but switch to EUV driven once the X-ray luminosity falls below a
critical value. The evolution models suggest that while `hot Jupiters' are
evaporating, they are not evaporating at a rate sufficient to remove the entire
gaseous envelope on Gyr time-scales. However, we do find that close in Neptune
mass planets are more susceptible to complete evaporation of their envelopes.
Thus we conclude that planetary evaporation is more important for lower mass
planets, particularly those in the `hot Neptune'/`super Earth' regime.

multi-exoplanet host star 61 Vir at 70-500micron carried out by the DEBRIS
survey. These reveal emission that is extended out to >15arcsec with a
morphology that can be fitted by a nearly edge-on (77deg inclination) radially
broad (from 30AU to >100AU) debris disk of fractional luminosity 2.7x10^-5,
with two unrelated sources nearby that are more prominent at longer
wavelengths. Chance alignment with a background object seen at 1.4GHz provides
potential for confusion, but the star's 1.4""/yr proper motion allows Spitzer
70micron images to confirm that what we are interpreting as disk emission
really is circumstellar. Although the exact shape of the disk's inner edge is
not well constrained, the region inside 30AU must be significantly depleted in
planetesimals. This is readily explained if there are additional planets in the
0.5-30AU region, but is also consistent with collisional erosion. We also find
tentative evidence that the presence of detectable debris around nearby stars
correlates with the presence of the lowest mass planets that are detectable in
current radial velocity surveys. Out of an unbiased sample of the nearest 60 G
stars, 11 are known to have planets, of which 6 (including 61 Vir) have planets
that are all less massive than Saturn, and 4 of these have evidence for debris.
The debris toward one of these planet-hosts (HD20794) is reported here for the
first time. This fraction (4/6) is higher than that expected for nearby field
stars (15%), and implies that systems that form low-mass planets are also able
to retain bright debris disks. We suggest that this correlation could arise
because such planetary systems are dynamically stable and include regions that
are populated with planetesimals in the formation process where the
planetesimals can remain unperturbed over Gyr timescales.

evolution can produce the observed luminosity spread in the Herzsprung-Russell
diagram (HRD) of young clusters has recently been called into question.
Observations of Fu Ori, for instance, suggest an expansion of the star during
strong accretion events whereas the luminosity spread implies a contraction of
the accreting objects, decreasing their radiating surface. In this paper, we
present a global scenario based on calculations coupling episodic accretion
histories derived from numerical simulations of collapsing cloud prestellar
cores of various masses and subsequent protostar evolution. Our calculations
show that, assuming an initial protostar mass $\mi \sim 1\,\mjup$, typical of
the second Larson's core, both the luminosity spread in the HRD and the
inferred properties of Fu Ori events (mass, radius, accretion rate) can be
explained by this scenario, providing two conditions. First, there must be some
variation within the fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the protostar
during the accretion process. Second the range of this variation should
increase with increasing accretion burst intensity, and thus with the initial
core mass and final star mass. The numerical hydrodynamics simulations of
collapsing cloud prestellar cores indeed show that the intensity of the
accretion bursts correlates with the mass and initial angular momentum of the
prestellar core. Massive prestellar cores with high initial angular momentum
are found to produce intense bursts characteristic of Fu Ori like events. Our
results thus suggest a link between the burst intensities and the fraction of
accretion energy absorbed by the protostar, with some threshold in the
accretion rate, of the order of $10^{-5}\msolyr$, delimitating the transition
from ""cold"" to ""hot"" accretion. [Abridged]

background radiation. The dominant sharp spectral feature in their spectra is
the 6.4 keV fluorescent line of iron, which may contribute to as much as ~ 5-10
% of the CXB spectral intensity at ~ 2-6 keV. Owing to cosmological redshift,
the line photons detected at the energy E carry information about objects
located at the redshift z=6.4/E-1. In particular, imprinted in their angular
fluctuations is the information about the large-scale structure at redshift z.
This opens the possibility of performing the Fe K_alpha line tomography of the
cosmic large-scale structure. We show that detection of the tomographic signal
at ~100 sigma confidence requires an all-sky survey by an instrument with an
effective area of ~10 m^2 and field of view of ~1 deg^2. The signal is
strongest for objects located at the redshift z~1 and at the angular scales
corresponding to l ~ 100-300, therefore an optimal detection can be achieved
with an instrument having a rather modest angular resolution of ~ 0.1-0.5 deg.
For such an instrument, the CCD-type energy resolution of ~ 100-200 eV FWHM is
entirely sufficient for the optimal separation of the signals coming from
different redshifts. The gain in the signal strength that could potentially be
achieved with energy resolution comparable to the line width is nullified by
the photon counting and AGN discreteness noise. Among the currently planned and
proposed missions, these requirements are best satisfied by LOFT, even though
it was proposed for an entirely different purpose. Among others, clear
detection should be achieved by WFXT (~ 20-35 sigma) and ATHENA (~ 10-20
sigma). eROSITA, in the course of its 4 years all-sky survey, will detect the
tomographic signal only marginally.

with those from two simulations of a neutron star black hole merger. The ejecta
masses vary by a factor of five for the studied systems, but all amounts are

source of cosmic r-process. The ejecta undergo a robust r-process
nucleosynthesis which produces all the elements from the second to the third
peak in close-to-solar ratios. Most strikingly, this r-process is extremely
robust, all 23 investigated binary systems yield practically identical
abundance patterns. This is mainly the result of the ejecta being extremely
neutron rich (\ye $\approx0.04$) and the r-process path meandering along the
neutron drip line so that the abundances are determined entirely by nuclear
rather than by astrophysical properties. This robustness together with the ease

a dynamical attractor solution with Ekpyrotic contraction which washes out
small amplitude anisotropies. At high energy densities the field evolves into a
ghost condensate, leading to a nonsingular bounce. Following the bounce there
is a smooth transition to standard expanding radiation and matter dominated
phases. Using linear cosmological perturbation theory we track each Fourier
mode of the curvature fluctuation throughout the entire cosmic evolution. Using
standard matching conditions for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies we verify
that the spectral index does not change during the bounce. We show there is a
controlled period of exponential growth of the fluctuation amplitude for the
perturbations (but not for gravitational waves) around the bounce point which
does not invalidate the perturbative treatment. This growth induces a natural
suppression mechanism for the tensor to scalar ratio of fluctuations. Moreover,
we study the generation of the primordial power spectrum of curvature
fluctuations for various types of initial conditions. For the pure vacuum
initial condition, on scales which exit the Hubble radius in the phase of
Ekpyrotic contraction, the spectrum is deeply blue. For thermal particle
initial condition, one possibility for generating a scale-invariant spectrum
makes use of a special value of the background equation of state during the
contracting Ekpyrotic phase. If the Ekpyrotic phase is preceded by a period of
matter-dominated contraction, the primordial power spectrum is nearly
scale-invariant on large scales (scales which exit the Hubble radius in the

  Information",,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: MicroRNAs, post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression,
play a pivotal role in gene regulatory networks. They are involved in core
cellular processes and their dysregulation is associated to a broad range of
human diseases. This paper focus on a minimal microRNA-mediated regulatory
circuit, in which a protein-coding gene (host gene) is targeted by a microRNA
located inside one of its introns. Results: Autoregulation via intronic
microRNAs is widespread in the human regulatory network, as confirmed by our
bioinformatic analysis, and can perform several regulatory tasks despite its
simple topology. Our analysis, based on analytical calculations and
simulations, indicates that this circuitry alters the dynamics of the host gene
expression, can induce complex responses implementing adaptation and Weber's
law, and efficiently filters fluctuations propagating from the upstream network
to the host gene. A fine-tuning of the circuit parameters can optimize each of
these functions. Interestingly, they are all related to gene expression
homeostasis, in agreement with the increasing evidence suggesting a role of
microRNA regulation in conferring robustness to biological processes. In
addition to model analysis, we present a list of bioinformatically predicted
candidate circuits in human for future experimental tests. Conclusions: The
results presented here suggest a potentially relevant functional role for
negative self-regulation via intronic microRNAs, in particular as a homeostatic
control mechanism of gene expression. Moreover, the map of circuit functions in
terms of experimentally measurable parameters, resulting from our analysis, can
be a useful guideline for possible applications in synthetic biology.

point out that the spin dynamics in the region of the double-peak structure

are free analogs of classical holomorphic functions in several complex
variables, and are defined in terms of noncommuting variables amongst which
there are no relations - they are free variables. Free analytic maps include
vector-valued polynomials in free (noncommuting) variables and form a canonical
class of mappings from one noncommutative domain D in say g variables to
another noncommutative domain D' in g' variables.
  Motivated by determining the possibilities for mapping a nonconvex
noncommutative domain to a convex noncommutative domain, this article focuses
on rigidity results for free analytic maps. Those obtained to date, parallel
and are often stronger than those in several complex variables. For instance, a
proper free analytic map between noncommutative domains is one-one and, if
g=g', free biholomorphic. Making its debut here is a free version of a theorem
of Braun-Kaup-Upmeier: between two freely biholomorphic bounded circular
noncommutative domains there exists a linear biholomorphism. An immediate
consequence is the following nonconvexification result: if two bounded circular
noncommutative domains are freely biholomorphic, then they are either both
convex or both not convex. Because of their roles in systems engineering,
linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and noncommutative domains defined by an LMI
(LMI domains) are of particular interest. As a refinement of above the
nonconvexification result, if a bounded circular noncommutative domain D is
freely biholomorphic to a bounded circular LMI domain, then D is itself an LMI
domain.

numerous definitions to analyze one-dimensional data. However, extensions of
these approaches to two or higher-dimensional data, such as images, are much
less common. Here, we reduce this gap by applying the ideas of the permutation
entropy combined with a relative entropic index. We build up a numerical
procedure that can be easily implemented to evaluate the complexity of two or
higher-dimensional patterns. We work out this method in different scenarios
where numerical experiments and empirical data were taken into account.
Specifically, we have applied the method to i) fractal landscapes generated
numerically where we compare our measures with the Hurst exponent; ii) liquid
crystal textures where nematic-isotropic-nematic phase transitions were
properly identified; iii) 12 characteristic textures of liquid crystals where
the different values show that the method can distinguish different phases; iv)

acting on the unit square and having sharp polynomial rates of mixing for
Holder data. The construction is geometric, relying on the graph of a single
variable ""cut function"". Each baker's map B is non-uniformly hyperbolic and
while the exact mixing rate depends on B, all polynomial rates can be attained.
The analysis of mixing rates depends on building a suitable Young tower for an
expanding factor. The mechanisms leading to a slow rate of correlation decay
are especially transparent in our examples due to the simple geometry in the
construction. For this reason we propose this class of maps as an excellent
testing ground for new techniques for the analysis of decay of correlations in
non-uniformly hyperbolic systems. Finally, some of our examples can be seen to
be extensions of certain 1-D non-uniformly expanding maps that have appeared in
the literature over the last twenty years thereby providing a unified treatment

Our previous studies suggest that coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are natural
products of coronal evolution as a consequence of magnetic helicity
accumulation and the triggering of CMEs by surface processes such as flux
emergence also have their origin in magnetic helicity accumulation. Here we use
the same mathematical approach to study the magnetic helicity of axisymmetric
power-law force-free fields, but focus on a family whose surface flux
distributions are defined by self-similar force-free fields. The
semi-analytical solutions of the axisymmetric self-similar force-free fields
enable us to discuss the properties of force-free fields possessing a huge
amount of accumulated magnetic helicity. Our study suggests that there may be
an absolute upper bound on the total magnetic helicity of all bipolar
axisymmetric force-free fields. And with the increase of accumulated magnetic
helicity, the force-free field approaches being fully opened up, with
Parker-spiral-like structures present around a current-sheet layer as evidence
of magnetic helicity in the interplanetary space. It is also found that among
the axisymmetric force-free fields having the same boundary flux distribution,
the one that is self-similar is the one possessing the maximum amount of total
magnetic helicity. This possibly gives a physical reason why self-similar
fields are often found in astrophysical bodies, where magnetic helicity
accumulation is presumably also taking place.

of the solar wind, is a topic of hot debate.While the prevailing view is that
the solar wind originates from outside coronal streamer helmets, there also
exists the suggestion that the open magnetic field spans a far wider
region.Without the definitive measurement of the coronal magnetic field, it is
difficult to resolve the conflict between the two scenarios without doubt.We
present two 2-dimensional, Alfv\'enic-turbulence-based models of the solar
corona and solar wind, one with and the other without a closed magnetic field
region in the inner corona.The purpose of the latter model is to test whether
it is possible to realize a picture suggested by polarimetric measurements of
the corona using the FeXIII 10747\AA\ line, where open magnetic field lines
seem to penetrate the streamer base.The boundary conditions at the coronal base
are able to account for important observational constraints, especially those
on the magnetic flux distribution.Interestingly, the two models provide similar
polarized brightness (pB) distributions in the field of view (FOV) of
SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3 coronagraphs.In particular, a dome-shaped feature is
present in the C2 FOV even for the model without any closed magnetic
field.Moreover, both models fit equally well the Ulysses data scaled to 1 AU.We
suggest that: 1) The pB observations cannot be safely taken as a proxy for the
magnetic field topology, as often implicitly assumed.2) The Ulysses
measurements, especially the one showing a nearly uniform distribution with
heliocentric latitude of the radial magnetic field, do not rule out the
ubiquity of open magnetic fields on the Sun.

test different probability of slow reaction ps in SR model and found the
simulation data of ps=0.3 fit the empirical data best. The RMS error of mean
velocity of SR model is smaller than that of standard LG model. In the range of
ps=0.1~0.3, our fundamental diagram between velocity and density by simulation

decentralized cooperative mechanisms which are incorporated into the

from happening when two objects standing face-to-face want to move in opposite
directions. Incorporating CM-CAR is to handle the conflict when more than one
object competes for the same point in parallel update. We investigate and
compare four models mainly from fundamental diagrams, jam patterns and the
distribution of cooperation probability. It is found that although it decreases
the average velocity a little, the CM-SA increases the critical density and the
average flow. Despite increasing the average velocity, the CM-CAR decreases the
average flow by creating substantially vacant areas inside jam clusters. We
investigate the jam patterns of four models carefully and explain this result

rheology of multiple emulsions with orderly structures up to n layers and up to
mi droplets in the i-th layer in microchannels with various geometries.
Recently, as fine templates to prepare microcapsules for targeted drug
delivery, multiple emulsions with complex structures have been generated
through microfluidics. The deformation and breakup of multiple emulsions are
critical to the transport and release of their inclusion. However, the
numerical investigation of the rheology of multiple emulsions is only limited
to a simple case, i.e., double emulsions with only one core, currently. In this
letter, two-dimensional boundary element method is employed to study the
rheology of multiple emulsions under modest outer flows. Especially, the
hydrodynamics of the engulfed droplets, which might be useful in their
controlled coalescence for chemical reactions and in their controlled release
for drug delivery, is investigated. Although the entire particle has an
equilibrium shape under modest outer flows initially, the slow movement of the
inner droplets might cause the contact of the outer and inner interface, and
eventually induces a breakup of the particle. Thus, appropriate outer flows and
internal structures of multiple emulsions might provide a possibility to
execute the control release through hydrodynamics.

the hot X-ray gas in low-mass ellipticals. In the present paper we study the
X-ray gas content of four low-mass elliptical galaxies using archival Chandra
X-ray observations. The sample galaxies, NGC821, NGC3379, NGC4278, and NGC4697,
have approximately identical K-band luminosities, and hence stellar masses, yet
their X-ray appearance is strikingly different. We conclude that the unresolved
emission in NGC821 and NGC3379 is built up from a multitude of faint compact
objects, such as coronally active binaries and cataclysmic variables. Despite
the non-detection of X-ray gas, these galaxies may host low density, and hence
low luminosity, X-ray gas components, which undergo a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)
driven outflow. We detect hot X-ray gas with a temperature of kT ~ 0.35 keV in
NGC4278, the component of which has a steeper surface brightness distribution
than the stellar light. Within the central 50 arcsec (~3.9 kpc) the estimated
gas mass is ~3 x 10^7 M_sun, implying a gas mass fraction of ~0.06%. We
demonstrate that the X-ray gas exhibits a bipolar morphology in the
northeast-southwest direction, indicating that it may be outflowing from the
galaxy. The mass and energy budget of the outflow can be maintained by evolved
stars and SNe Ia, respectively. The X-ray gas in NGC4697 has an average
temperature of kT ~ 0.3 keV, and a significantly broader distribution than the
stellar light. The total gas mass within 90 arcsec (~5.1 kpc) is ~2.1 x 10^8
M_sun, hence the gas mass fraction is ~0.4%. Based on the distribution and
physical parameters of the X-ray gas, we conclude that it is most likely in
hydrostatic equilibrium, although a subsonic outflow may be present.

test particle's energy exceeds slightly the energy of escape, the amount of the
trapped regular orbits increases, as the the value of the angular momentum
increases. Therefore, the extent of the chaotic regions observed in the phase
plane decreases as the value of the energy increases. Moreover, we calculate
the average value of the escape period of the chaotic orbits and we try to
correlate it with the value of the energy and also with the maximum value of
the z component of the orbits. In addition, we find that the value of the LCE
corresponding to each chaotic region, for different values of the energy,
increases exponentially as the value of the energy increases. Some theoretical
arguments in order to support the numerically obtained outcomes are presented.

uses information hiding technique - Steganography. A Robust Message based Image

incorporated in the form of a browser plug-in (safari) called Pixastic.
Pixastic is tested in an online banking scenario and it is compared with other
well-known anti-phishing plug-in methods in practice. Various parameters such

numerical solution of Riemann-Hilbert problems (RHPs) is known to depend very
sensitively on the particular choice of contours used as data of the RHP. By
manually performing contour deformations that proved to be successful in the
asymptotic analysis of RHPs, such as the method of nonlinear steepest descent,
the numerical method can basically be preconditioned, making it asymptotically
stable. In this paper, however, we will show that most of these preconditioning
deformations, including lensing, can be addressed in an automatic, completely
algorithmic fashion that would turn the numerical method into a black-box
solver. To this end, the preconditioning of RHPs is recast as a discrete,
graph-based optimization problem: the deformed contours are obtained as a
system of shortest paths within a planar graph weighted by the relative
strength of the jump matrices. The algorithm is illustrated for the RHP
representing the Painlev\'e II transcendents.

Starting from the full set of conservation equations for the mixed plasma
constituents, we generalize the magneto-hydrodynamical jump conditions for a
multi-component plasma, including information about the specific adiabatic
constants for the different species. The impact of deviations from the standard
model of an ideal gas is compared in theory and particle-in-cell simulations,
showing that the standard-MHD model is a good approximation. The simulations of
shocks in electron-positron-ion plasmas are for the first time
multi-dimensional, transverse effects are small in this configuration and 1D
simulations are a good representation if the initial magnetization is chosen
high. 1D runs with a mass ratio of 1836 are performed, which identify the
Larmor frequency \omega_{ci} as the dominant frequency that determines the
shock physics in mixed component plasmas. The maximum energy in the non-thermal
tail of the particle spectra evolves in time according to a power-law
proportional to t^\alpha with \alpha in the range 1/3 < \alpha < 1, depending
on the initial parameters. A connection is made with transport theoretical
models by Drury (1983) and Gargate & Spitkovsky (2011), which predict an
acceleration time proportional to \gamma and the theory for small wavelength
scattering by Kirk & Reville (2010), which predicts a behavior rather as
proportional to \gamma^2. Furthermore, we compare different magnetic field
orientations with B_0 inside and out of the plane, observing qualitatively

connected to an output magnet, using metal channels. The low resistance,
magneto-metallic neurons operate at a small terminal voltage of ~20mV, while
performing analog computation upon photo sensor inputs. The static current-flow
across the device terminals is limited to small periods, corresponding to
magnet switching time, and, is determined by a low duty-cycle system-clock.
Thus, the energy-cost of analog-mode processing, inevitable in most image
sensing applications, is reduced and made comparable to that of dynamic and
leakage power consumption in peripheral CMOS units. Performance of the proposed
architecture for some common image sensing and processing applications like,
feature extraction, halftone compression and digitization, have been obtained
through physics based device simulation framework, coupled with SPICE. Results
indicate that the proposed design scheme can achieve more than two orders of
magnitude reduction in computation energy, as compared to the state of art CMOS
designs, that are based on conventional mixed-signal image acquisition and
processing schemes. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first work
where application of nano magnets (in LSV's) in analog signal processing has
been proposed.

multiple superconducting gaps in different points of the real space and of the

OPERA set-up in a totally independent way from Time Of Flight (TOF)
measurements of CNGS neutrino events. The LVD and OPERA experiments are both
installed in the same laboratory: LNGS. The relative position of the two
detectors, separated by an average distance of ~ 160 m, allows the use of very
high energy horizontal muons to cross-calibrate the timing systems of the two
detectors, using a TOF technique which is totally independent from TOF of CNGS
neutrino events. Indeed, the OPERA-LVD direction lies along the so-called
""Teramo anomaly"", a region in the Gran Sasso massif where LVD has established,
many years ago, the existence of an anomaly in the mountain structure, which
exhibits a low m. w. e. thickness for horizontal directions. The ""abundant""
high-energy horizontal muons (nearly 100 per year) going through LVD and OPERA
exist because of this anomaly in the mountain orography. The total live time of
the data in coincidence correspond to 1200 days from mid 2007 until March 2012.
The time coincidence study of LVD and OPERA detectors is based on 306 cosmic
horizontal muon events and shows the existence of a negative time shift in the
OPERA set-up of the order of deltaT(AB) = - (73 \pm 9) ns when two calendar
periods, A and B, are compared. This result shows a systematic effect in the
OPERA timing system from August 2008 until December 2011. The size of the
effect is comparable with the neutrino velocity excess recently measured by
OPERA. It is probably interesting not to forget that with the MRPC technology
developed by the ALICE Bologna group the TOF world record accuracy of 20 ps was
reached. That technology can be implemented at LNGS for a high precision
determination of TOF with the CNGS neutrino beams of an order of magnitude
smaller than the value of the OPERA systematic effect.

different phases opens up the possibility to map the magnetic field in the
stellar surface thanks to the well-known Zeeman Doppler Imaging. When the
magnetic field is sufficiently weak, the circular and linear polarization
profiles locally in each point of the star are proportional to the first and
second derivatives of the unperturbed intensity profile, respectively. We show
that the weak-field approximation (for weak lines in the case of linear
polarization) can be generalized to the case of a rotating star including the
Doppler effect and taking into account the integration on the stellar surface.
The Stokes profiles are written as a linear combination of wavelength-dependent
terms expressed as series expansions in terms of Hermite polynomials. These
terms contain the surface integrated magnetic field and velocity components.
The direct numerical evaluation of these quantities is limited to rotation
velocities not larger than 8 times the Doppler width of the local absorption
profiles. Additionally, we demonstrate that, in a rotating star, the circular
polarization flux depends on the derivative of the intensity flux with respect
to the wavelength and also on the profile itself. Likewise, the linear
polarization depends on the profile and on its first and second derivative with
respect to the wavelength. We particularize the general expressions to a
rotating dipole.

make a high precision determination of their physical parameters, we need very
accurate theoretical waveform models or templates. In the case of a circular
equatorial orbit, the key stumbling block to the creation of these templates is
the flux function of the GW. This function can be modeled either via very
expensive numerical simulations, which then make the templates unusable for GW
astronomy, or via some analytic approximation method such as a post-Newtonian
approximation. This approximation is known to be asymptotically divergent and
is only known up to 5.5PN order for the Schwarzschild case and to 4PN order for
the Kerr case. A way to improve the convergence of the flux is to use
re-summation methods. In this work we extend previous results using the Pad\'e

the GWs by the central black hole which was neglected in previous studies, and
secondly by using the information from the Schwarzschild and absorption terms
to create a Kerr flux up to 5.5PN order. We found that these two additions both
improve the convergence. We also demonstrate that the best re-summation method
for improving the flux model is based on a flux function which we call the

subtasks solved differently over the literature and SMF enables to combine them
in straightforward manner achieving new quality and efficiency. This framework
can be used in many application domains and its components can be reused
effectively. Its strictly modular architecture and openness enables also
involvement of efficient solutions from different fields, for instance
efficient metric-based indexes. This is an extended version of a paper

constructed directly from the run-length encoding of $s$. The construction time
of our index is $O(n+\rho^2\log \rho)$, where O(n) is the time for computing
the run-length encoding of $s$ and $\rho$ is the length of this encoding---this
is no worse than previous solutions if $\rho = O(n/\log n)$ and better if $\rho
= o(n/\log n)$. Our index $L$ can be queried in $O(\log \rho)$ time. While
$|L|= O(\min(n, \rho^{2}))$ in the worst case, preliminary investigations have
indicated that $|L|$ may often be close to $\rho$. Furthermore, the algorithm
for constructing the index is conceptually simple and easy to implement. In an
attempt to shed light on the structure and size of our index, we characterize
it in terms of the prefix normal forms of $s$ introduced in [Fici and Lipt\'ak,

we set up a particular microlocal model for an image governed by edges inspired
by seismic data as well as a particular mask to model the missing data, namely
a linear singularity masked by a horizontal strip. Applying the abstract
estimate in the case of wavelets and of shearlets we prove that -- provided the

between the mass and size (Mass- Radius relation). The wealth of recently
acquired observational data essentially confirms the classical relations found
by Burstein, Bender, Faber, and Nolthenius, i.e. log(R_1/2) \propto
log(Ms)\simeq 0.54 for high mass galaxies and log(R_1/2) \propto log(Ms) \simeq
0.3 for dwarf systems (shallower slope), where R_1/2 and Ms are the half-light
radius and total mass in stars, respectively. Why do galaxies follow these
characteristic trends? What can they tell us about the process of galaxy
formation? We investigate the mechanisms which concur to shape the Mass-Radius
relation, in order to cast light on the physical origin of its slope, its
tightness, and its zero point. We perform a theoretical analysis, and couple it
with the results of numerical hydrodynamical (NB-TSPH) simulations of galaxy
formation, and with a simulation of the Mass-Radius plane itself. We propose a
novel interpretation of the Mass-Radius relation, which we claim to be the
result of two complementary mechanisms: on one hand, the result of local
physical processes, which fixes the ratio between masses and radii of
individual objects; on the other hand, the action of cosmological global,
statistical principles, which shape the distribution of objects in the plane.
We reproduce the Mass-Radius relation with a simple numerical technique based
on this view.

galaxy NGC4278, which hosts a low luminosity AGN and compact radio emission,
allowed us to detect extended emission from hot gas out to a radius of \sim 5
kpc, with a 0.5--8 keV luminosity of 2.4x10^{39} erg/s. The emission is
elongated in the NE-SW direction, misaligned with respect to the stellar body,
and aligned with the ionized gas, and with the Spitzer IRAC 8\mum non-stellar
emission. The nuclear X-ray luminosity decreased by a factor of \sim 18 since
the first Chandra observation in 2005, a dimming that enabled the detection of
hot gas even at the position of the nucleus. Both in the projected and
deprojected profiles, the gas shows a significantly larger temperature (kT=0.75
keV) in the inner \sim 300 pc than in the surrounding region, where it stays at
\sim 0.3 keV, a value lower than expected from standard gas heating
assumptions. The nuclear X-ray emission is consistent with that of a low
radiative efficiency accretion flow, accreting mass at a rate close to the
Bondi one; estimates of the power of the nuclear jets require that the
accretion rate is not largely reduced with respect to the Bondi rate. Among
possibile origins for the central large hot gas temperature, such as
gravitational heating from the central massive black hole and a recent AGN
outburst, the interaction with the nuclear jets seems more likely, especially
if the latter remain confined, and heat the nuclear region frequently. The
unusual hot gas distribution on the galactic scale could be due to the
accreting cold gas triggering the cooling of the hot phase, a process also
contributing to the observed line emission from ionize gas, and to the hot gas
temperature being lower than expected; alternatively, the latter could be due
to an efficiency of the type Ia supernova energy mixing lower than usually
adopted.

exponentially with $N$, e.g. $p=4.4\times 10^{-14}$ for N=20. Feed-forward
improves the scaling but $N$ fluctuates nondeterministically in each attempt.
Schemes based on parametric down-conversion suffer from low production
efficiency and low fidelity. A recent scheme based on atoms in a cavity
combines deterministic time evolution, local unitary operations, and projective
measurements. Here we propose a novel scheme based on the off-resonant
interaction of $N$ photons with four semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) in a
cavity to create N00N states deterministically with $p=1$ and fidelity above
90% for $N\lesssim 60$, without the need of any projective measurement or local
unitary operation. Using our measure we obtain maximum $N$-photon entanglement
$E_N=1$ for arbitrary $N$. Our method paves the way to the miniaturization of
N00N-state sources to the nanoscale regime, with the possibility to integrate
them on a computer chip based on semiconductor materials.

condition for core percolation and find that purely scale-free networks have no

percolation occurs then it is always continuous while for directed networks it
becomes discontinuous when the in- and out-degree distributions are different.
We also apply our theory to real-world directed networks and find,
surprisingly, that they often have much larger core sizes as compared to random
models. These findings would help us better understand the interesting

$n=3$. The regularity and decay assumptions for the initial data sets to which
our argument applies are weaker than those of R. Schoen and S.-T. Yau. In
recent joint work with L.-H. Huang, D. Lee, and R. Schoen we have given a

action for the b-quarks and the RBC/UKQCD Iwasaki gauge configurations with 2+1
flavors of dynamical domain-wall light quarks. We analyze configurations with
two lattice spacings: a^{-1} = 1.729 GeV (a ~ 0.11 fm) and a^{-1} = 2.281 GeV
(a ~ 0.086 fm). We use an anisotropic, clover-improved Wilson action for the
b-quark, and tune the three parameters of the action nonperturbatively such
that they reproduce the experimental values of the B_s and B_s* heavy-light
meson states. The masses and mass-splittings of the low-lying bottomonium
states (such as the eta_b and Upsilon) can then be computed with no additional
inputs, and comparison between these predictions and experiment provides a test
of the validity of our method. We obtain bottomonium masses with total
uncertainties of ~0.5-0.6% and fine-structure splittings with uncertainties of
~35-45%; for all cases we find good agreement with experiment. The parameters
of the relativistic heavy-quark action tuned for b-quarks presented in this
work can be used for precise calculations of weak matrix elements such as
B-meson decay constants and mixing parameters with lattice discretization
errors that are of the same size as in light pseudoscalar meson quantities.
This general method can also be used for charmed meson masses and matrix
elements if the parameters of the heavy-quark action are appropriately tuned.

be a very effective approach in pure and applied sciences. In fact, the number

last twenty years. Most of the applications, notwithstanding, use cellular
automata to qualitatively describe the phenomena, which is surely a consequence
of the way the automata rules have been defined. In the present paper a general
rule which describes every of Wolfram's cellular automata is derived. The new
representation is given in terms of a new function hereby defined, the
iota-delta function. The latter function is further generalized in order to
provide a general rule for not only Wolfram's but also to every CA rule which
depends on the sum and products of the values of cells in the automaton mesh.
By means of a parallel between the finite difference method and the iota-delta
function, the new representation provides a straightforward physical
interpretation of CA, which gives, for the first time, a quantitative
interpretation of the generating rule itself. By means of the new formulation,
advective-diffusive phenomena are analyzed. In particular, the relation between
CA automata and anomalous diffusion is briefly discussed.

nebula, made up of the interstellar medium (ISM) ionised by the source itself.
With the VIMOS IFU we obtained spectra over a 25\times25"" field of view,
encompassing one quarter of the nebula. Emission line maps - H I, He II, [O
III], [N II], and [S II] - are produced in order to study the morphology of the
ionised gas. We include CAL83 on diagrams of various diagnostic ion ratios to
compare it to other X-ray ionised sources. Finally we computed some simple
models of the ionised gas around CAL83 and compare the predicted to the
observed spectra. CAL83 appears to have a fairly standard ionisation nebula as
far as the morphology goes: the edges where H is recombining are strong in the
low stage ionisation lines and the central, clumpy regions are stronger in the
higher stage ionisation lines. But the He II emission is unusual in being
confined to one side of CAL83 rather than being homogeneously distributed as
with the other ions. We model the CAL83 nebula with cloudy using model
parameters for SXSs found in the literature. The He II emission does not fit in
with model predictions; in fact none of the models is able to fit the observed
spectrum very well. The spectral line images of the region surrounding CAL83
are revealing and instructive. However, more modelling of the spectrum of the
ionised gas is necessary, and especially for the high-ionisation level emission
from CAL83. In particular, we wish to know if the He II emission and the other

data-generating processes cannot be modeled by simple probability
distributions. With the ever-increasing size of data sets in cosmology, there
is increasing burden placed on adequate modeling; systematic errors in the
model will dominate where previously these were swamped by statistical errors.
For example, Gaussian distributions are an insufficient representation for
errors in quantities like photometric redshifts. Likewise, it can be difficult
to quantify analytically the distribution of errors that are introduced in
complex fitting codes. Without a simple form for these distributions, it
becomes difficult to accurately construct a likelihood function for the data as
a function of parameters of interest. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)
provides a means of probing the posterior distribution when direct calculation
of a sufficiently accurate likelihood is intractable. ABC allows one to bypass
direct calculation of the likelihood but instead relies upon the ability to
simulate the forward process that generated the data. These simulations can
naturally incorporate priors placed on nuisance parameters, and hence these can
be marginalized in a natural way. We present and discuss ABC methods in the
context of supernova cosmology using data from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey.
Assuming a flat cosmology and constant dark energy equation of state we
demonstrate that ABC can recover an accurate posterior distribution. Finally we
show that ABC can still produce an accurate posterior distribution when we
contaminate the sample with Type IIP supernovae.

electron scattering surrounding its accretion disc, and thus avoid the
contamination from its host galaxy and reveal the intrinsic emission spectrum
of the accretion disc. Ultra-violet (UV) emission from a quasar is normally
free from the contamination from its host galaxy. Polarization fraction of the
quasar's disc emission can therefore be determined by comparing total UV
emission with polarized visible to near-infrared (NIR) emission; and the
resulting continuum spectrum from UV to infrared can reveal the theoretically
expected Balmer edge absorption feature. We fit the polarized spectra in
visible and NIR bands together with the total UV spectra of two type-1 quasars
(3C 95, 4C 09.72), to an extended geometrically thin and optically thick
accretion disc model. In addition to the standard model, we include the Balmer
edge absorption due to co-rotational neutral gas on a narrow annulus of the
accretion disc. We find that the extended thin accretion disc model provides
adequate description on the continuum spectra of the two quasars from UV to NIR
wavelengths. A Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain fitting to the continuum spectra is
able to well constrain the true polarization fraction of the disk emission,
which allows the Balmer edge feature to be completely revealed from polarized
visible to UV continua. The Balmer edge feature is prominent in both quasars'
spectra, and is significantly broadened due to the orbital motion of gas in the
accretion disc. The broadening of the Balmer edge feature is therefore related
to the quasar's inclination. This work proves the concept of determining
quasar's inclination from the Balmer edge feature in their continuum spectra.

can annihilate into a pair of photons through the exchange of a CP-odd Higgs
boson in the s-channel. The CP-odd Higgs boson couples to two photons through a
loop of dominantly higgsino-like charginos. We show that the parameter space of
the NMSSM can accommodate simultaneously i) neutralino-like dark matter of a
mass of about 130 GeV giving rise to a 130 GeV photon line; ii) an annihilation
cross section of or larger than 10^{-27}cm^3s^{-1}; iii) a relic density in
agreement with WMAP constraints; iv) a direct detection cross section
compatible with bounds from XENON100, and v) a Standard Model like Higgs mass
of about 125 GeV. However, the CP-odd Higgs mass has to lie accidentally close
to 260 GeV.

that forego questions of extended-simultaneity, which because of their abstract
nature might not be addressed explicitly until a first relativity course and
even then without considering the dependence of clock-rates on position in a
gravitational field. For example we here use synchrony-free ``traveler
kinematic"" relations to construct a brief story for beginning students about:
(a) time as a local quantity like position that depends on ``which clock"", (b)
coordinate-acceleration as an approximation to the acceleration felt by a
moving traveler, and (c) the geometric origin (hence mass-independence) of
gravitational acceleration. The goal is to explicitly rule out global-time for
all from the start, so that it can be returned as a local approximation, while
tantalizing students interested in the subject with more widely-applicable
equations in range of their math background.

analyze and interpret the concealed information inside digital medium such as

inside digital medium has been used for planning criminal activities. In this
way, it is important to develop a steganalysis technique which detects the
existence of hidden messages inside digital medium. This paper focuses on
universal image steganalysis method which uses RGB to HSI colour model
conversion. Any Universal Steganalysis algorithm developed should be tested
with various stego-images to prove its efficiency. The developed Universal
Steganalysis algorithm is tested in stego-image database which is obtained by
implementing various RGB Least Significant Bit Steganographic algorithms.
Though there are many stego-image sources available on the internet it lacks in
the information such as how many rows has been infected by the steganography
algorithms, how many bits have been modified and which channel has been
affected. These parameters are important for Steganalysis algorithms and it
helps to rate its efficiency. Proposed Steganalysis using Colour Model has been
tested with our Image Database and the results were affirmative.

and transmit diversity, the proposed code provides receive diversity, array
gain, and achieve high-coding gain over a frequency selective fading channel.
As simulation results demonstrate, the code outperforms the existing
Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time-Frequency Trellis codes in terms of frame error
