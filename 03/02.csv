complex dynamics. It presents exceptional X-rays properties (high temperature
and luminosity), suggesting that it is a very massive cluster. Recent 2D
analysis of the gas distribution has revealed a complex and multiphase
structure. This paper presents a wide-field weak lensing study of the dark
matter distribution in the cluster in order to provide an alternative vision of
the merging status of the cluster. The 2D mass distribution is built and
compared to the galaxies and gas distributions. A Bayesian method, implemented
in the Im2shape software, was used to fit the shape parameters of the faint
background galaxies and to correct for PSF smearing. A careful color selection
on the background galaxies was applied to retrieve the weak lensing signal.
Shear signal was measured out to more than 2 Mpc (~12' from the center). The
radial shear profile was fit with different parametric mass profiles. The 2D
mass map is built from the shear distribution and used to identify the
different mass components. The 2D mass map agrees with the galaxy distribution,
while the total mass inferred from weak lensing shows a strong discrepancy to
the X-ray deduced mass. Regardless of the method used, the virial mass M200
falls in the range 8 to 14 10^14 Msol inside the virial radius (~ 2.0 Mpc), a
value that is two times less than the mass deduced from X-rays. The central
mass clump appears bimodal in the dark matter distribution, with a mass ratio
~3:1 between the two components. The infalling clump A2163-B is detected in
weak lensing as an independent entity. All these results are interpreted in the
context of a multiple merger seen less than 1Gyr after the main crossover.

continuum all strongly correlate with the hard X-ray emission. But the NLS1s
appear to be somewhat different. Among the various Balmer line components and
the broadband SED components, the best correlation exists between the hard
X-ray component and broad component (BC) of the Balmer lines, which supports
the view that broad line region (BLR) has the closest link with the AGN's
compact X-ray emission. The equivalent widths of Balmer line IC and BC are
found to correlate with L$_{2-10keV}$, $\kappa_{2-10keV}^{-1} =
L_{bol}/L_{2-10keV}$, Balmer line FWHM and black hole mass. There is a
non-linear dependence of the Balmer line IC and BC luminosities with
L$_{2-10keV}$ and L$_{5100}$, which suggests that a second-order factor such as
the ILR and BLR covering factors affect the Balmer line component luminosities.
The Balmer decrement is found to decrease from ~5 in the line core to ~2 in the
extended wings, with mean decrements of 2.1 in BLR and 4.8 in ILR. This
suggests different physical conditions in these regions. The [OIII] line is
composed of a narrow core together with a blue-shifted component with average
outflow velocity of $130^{+230}_{-80} km s^{-1}$. The total luminosity of
[OIII] \lambda 5007 well correlates with the hard X-ray luminosity.

Intrusion detection system is one of the major and efficient defensive methods

deprivation attack, where a malicious node forces legitimate nodes to waste
their energy by resisting the sensor nodes from going into low power sleep
mode. The goal of this attack is to maximize the power consumption of the
target node, thereby decreasing its battery life. Existing works on sleep

free right action of $G$ on $P$ defines a principal bundle $Q$ with the
structure group $H$ over $P/G.$ The Chern character of a vector bundle
associated to $Q$ defines then characteristic classes on $X.$ This observation
becomes useful in the case of infinite dimensional groups. It typically happens
that a representation of $G$ is not given by linear operators which differ from
the indentity by a trace-class operator. For this reason the Chern character of
a vector bundle associated to the principal fibration $P \to P/G$ is
ill-defined. But it may happen that the Lie algebra representations of the
group $H$ are given in terms of trace-class operators and therefore the Chern
character is well-defined; this observation is useful especially if the map
$g\mapsto \Omega(p;g)$ is a homotopy equivalence on the image for any $p\in P.$
We apply this method to the case $P= \Cal A,$ the space of gauge connections in
a finite-dimensional vector bundle, and $G= \Cal G$ is the group of (based)
gauge transformations. The method for constructing the appropriate cocycle

Hubbard type tight-binding model. The model is developed carefully from basic
principles in order to properly identify the physical observables. The
one-particle ground state may be degenerate and represent a finite flow
velocity depending on the parity of the number of lattice sites, the sign of
the tunneling matrix element, and the rotation speed of the lattice. Variation
of the rotation speed may be used to control one-atom states, and leads to
peculiar behaviors such as wildly different phase and group velocities for an
atom. Adiabatic variation of the rotation speed of the lattice may also be used
to control the state of a two-atom lattice dimer. For instance, at a suitably
chosen rotation speed both atoms are confined to the same lattice site.

relative number of yellow supergiants observed as a function of mass and those
predicted by evolutionary models, while a disagreement between the predicted
and observed locations of red supergiants on the HR diagram was only recently
resolved. Here we extend these studies by examining the yellow and red
supergiant populations of M33. Unfortunately, identifying these stars is
difficult as this portion of the color-magnitude diagram is heavily
contaminated by foreground dwarfs. We identify the red supergiants through a
combination of radial velocities and a two-color surface gravity discriminant
and, after re-characterizing the rotation curve of M33 with our newly selected
red supergiants, we identify the yellow supergiants through a combination of
radial velocities and the strength of the OI $\lambda$7774 triplet. We examine
~1300 spectra in total and identify 121 yellow supergiants (a sample which is
unbiased in luminosity above log(L/L\odot) ~ 4.8) and 189 red supergiants.
After placing these objects on the HR diagram, we find that the latest
generation of Geneva evolutionary tracks show excellent agreement with the
observed locations of our red and yellow supergiants, the observed relative
number of yellow supergiants with mass and the observed red supergiant upper
mass limit. These models therefore represent a drastic improvement over
previous generations.

dynamics. Here we show how the hierarchy of structures in the density field
inside voids is reflected by a similar hierarchy of structures in the velocity
field. Voids defined by dense filaments and clusters can de described as simple
expanding domains with coherent flows everywhere except at their boundaries. At
scales smaller that the void radius the velocity field breaks into expanding
sub-domains corresponding to sub- voids. These sub-domains break into even
smaller sub-sub domains at smaller scales resulting in a nesting hierarchy of
locally expanding domains. The ratio between the magnitude of the velocity
field responsible for the expansion of the void and the velocity field defining
the sub voids is approximately one order of magnitude. The small-scale
components of the velocity field play a minor role in the shaping of the voids
but they define the local dynamics directly affecting the processes of galaxy
formation and evolution. The super-Hubble expansion inside voids makes them
cosmic magnifiers by stretching their internal primordial density fluctuations
allowing us to probe the small scales in the primordial density field. Voids
also act like time machines by ""freezing"" the development of the medium-scale
density fluctuations responsible for the formation of the tenuous web of
structures seen connecting proto galaxies in computer simulations. As a result
of this freezing haloes in voids can remain ""connected"" to this tenuous web
until the present time. This may have an important effect in the formation and
evolution of galaxies in voids by providing an efficient gas accretion
mechanism via coherent low-velocity streams that can keep a steady inflow of
matter for extended periods of time.

freedom, which is known as decoherence, remains one of the main obstacles for
large-scale implementations of quantum computing. Accordingly, different
measures are being explored for reducing its effect. One of them is dynamical
decoupling (DD) which offers a practical solution because it only requires the
application of control pulses to the system qubits. Starting from basic DD
sequences, more sophisticated schemes were developed that eliminate
higher-order terms of the system-environment interaction and are also more
robust against experimental imperfections. A particularly successful scheme,
called concatenated DD (CDD), gives a recipe for generating higher order
sequences by inserting lower order sequences into the delays of a generating
sequence. Here, we show how this scheme can be improved further by converting
some of the pulses to virtual (and thus ideal) pulses. The resulting scheme,
called vCDD, has lower power deposition and is more robust against pulse
imperfections than the original CDD scheme.

which gaseous clumps (essentially, the first Larson cores formed via disk
fragmentation) are ejected from the disk during the early stage of evolution.
This is a universal process related to the phenomenon of ejection in multiple
systems of point masses. However, it occurs in our model entirely due to the
interaction of compact, gravitationally-bound gaseous clumps and is free from
the smoothing-length uncertainty that is characteristic of models using sink
particles. Clumps that survive ejection span a mass range of 0.08--0.35
$M_\odot$, and have ejection velocities $0.8 \pm 0.35$ km s$^{-1}$, which are
several times greater than the escape speed. We suggest that, upon contraction,
these clumps can form substellar or low-mass stellar objects with notable
disks, or even close-separation very-low-mass binaries. In this hybrid
scenario, allowing for ejection of clumps rather than finished
protostars/proto--brown-dwarfs, disk formation and the low velocity dispersion
of low-mass objects are naturally explained, while it is also consistent with
the observation of isolated low-mass clumps that are ejection products. We
conclude that clump ejection and the formation of isolated low mass stellar and
substellar objects is a common occurrence, with important implications for
understanding the initial mass function, the brown dwarf desert, and the
formation of stars in all environments and epochs.

two to three qubits performance matches the analytical protocols. In the

set-valued return function V and show that the epigraph of V is equal to the
viability kernel of a properly chosen closed set for a properly chosen
dynamics. We then introduce an approximate set-valued return function with
finite set-values as the solution of a multiobjective dynamic programming
equation. The epigraph of this approximate set-valued return function is shown
to be equal to the finite discrete viability kernel resulting from the
convergent numerical approximation of the viability kernel proposed in [4, 5].
As a result, the epigraph of the approximate set-valued return function
converges towards the epigraph of V. The approximate set-valued return function
finally provides the proposed numerical approximation of the Pareto optimal set

only dynamical variable describing the gravitational field. We construct the
simplest dynamical Lagrangian density that is entirely composed from the
connection, via its curvature and torsion, and is an algebraic function of its

which is inverse to the symmetric, contracted square of the torsion tensor,
$k_{\mu\nu}=S^\rho_{\lambda\mu}S^\lambda_{\rho\nu}$. We vary the total action
for the gravitational field and matter with respect to the affine connection,
assuming that the matter fields couple to the connection only through
$k_{\mu\nu}$. We derive the resulting field equations and show that they are
identical with the Einstein equations of general relativity with a nonzero
cosmological constant, if the tensor $k_{\mu\nu}$ is regarded as the metric
tensor. The cosmological constant is simply a constant of proportionality
between the two tensors, which together with $c$ and $G$ provides a natural
system of units in gravitational physics. This theory therefore provides a
physically valid construction of the metric as an algebraic function of the
connection, and naturally explains dark energy as an intrinsic property of
spacetime. The observed accelerating expansion of the Universe may be the
strongest evidence for torsion.

flare that recurs every ~50-100 seconds, but the profile and duration of the
flares varies significantly from observation to observation. Based on a
comprehensive, phase-resolved study of heartbeats in the RXTE archive, we
demonstrate that very different X-ray lightcurves do not require origins in
different accretion processes. Indeed, our detailed comparison of the
phase-resolved spectra of a double-peaked oscillation and a single-peaked
oscillation shows that different cycles can have basically similar X-ray
spectral evolution. We argue that all heartbeat oscillations can be understood
as the result of a combination of a thermal-viscous radiation pressure
instability, a local Eddington limit in the disk, and a sudden,
radiation-pressure-driven evaporation or ejection event in the inner accretion
disk. This ejection appears to be a universal, fundamental part of the rho
state, and is largely responsible for a hard X-ray pulse seen in the lightcurve
of all cycles. We suggest that the detailed shape of oscillations in the mass
accretion rate through the disk is responsible for the phenomenological
differences between different rho-type lightcurves, and we discuss how future
time-dependent simulations of disk instabilities may provide new insights into
the role of radiation pressure in the accretion flow.

accretion rate onto the disk is 0.2 Msun/yr. We track the histories of the 20

that most of them are losing gas, with a median mass loss rate per satellite of
3.1 x 10^{-3} Msun/yr. This stripped gas is a significant component of the HI
gas seen in the simulation. In addition, we see filamentary material coming
into the halo from the IGM at all redshifts. Most of this gas does not make it
directly to the disk, but part of the gas in these structures is able to cool

filamentary flows and satellite gas. We find that the former accounts for at
least 25-75% of the cold gas in the halo seen at any redshift analyzed here.

stripping using high-resolution adaptive mesh simulations, building on a
previous series of papers that systematically investigated stripping using a
realistic model for the interstellar medium, but without star formation. We
find that star formation does not significantly affect the rate at which
stripping occurs, and only has a slight impact on the density and temperature
distribution of the stripped gas, indicating that our previous (gas-only)
results are unaffected. For our chosen (moderate) ram pressure strength,
stripping acts to truncate star formation in the disk over a few hundred
million years, and does not lead to a burst of star formation. Star formation
in the bulge is slightly enhanced, but the resulting change in the
bulge-to-disk ratio is insignificant. We find that stars do form in the tail,
primarily from gas that is ablated from the disk and the cools and condenses in
the turbulent wake. The star formation rate in the tail is low, and any
contribution to the intracluster light is likely to be very small. We argue
that star formation in the tail depends primarily on the pressure in the
intracluster medium, rather than the ram pressure strength. Finally, we compare
to observations of star formation in stripped tails, finding that many of the
discrepancies between our simulation and observed wakes can be accounted for by
different intracluster medium pressures.

larger clumps will form as a result of higher disc velocity dispersions
driven-up by cosmological gas accretion. As a consequence of the changes in
global environment, it may be predicted that star-forming regions at high
redshift should not resemble star-forming regions locally. Yet despite the
increased sizes and dispersions, clumps and HII regions are found to follow
tight scaling relations over the range z=0-2 for size, velocity dispersion,

is modeled utilizing simple stellar population spectra including dust
attenuation and emission. For modeling the SFRD up to z=4 a broken power law
function in z+1 is assumed. A wide range of values for the different model
parameters (SFRD(z), metallicity, dust absorption) is investigated and their
impact on the resulting EBL is studied. The calculated EBL densities are
compared with the specific EBL density limits and constraints on the SFRD are
derived. For the fiducial model, adopting a Chabrier initial mass function
(IMF) and a second power law index for the SFRD of beta=0.3, the SFRD is
constrained to <~ 0.1 M_solar yr^-1 Mpc^-3 and < 0.2 M_solar yr^-1 Mpc^-3 for a
redshift of z~1 and z~2, respectively. The limits for a redshift of z~1 are in
tension with SFRD measurements derived from instantaneous star formation
tracers. While the tension for the conservative fiducial model in this study is
not yet overly strong, the tension increases when applying plausible changes to
the model parameters, e.g., using a Salpeter instead of a Chabrier IMF or a
adopting a sub-solar metallicity.

on a series of vertically stratified local simulations, computed using the
Athena code, that have fixed spatial resolution, but varying radial and
azimuthal extent (from \Delta R = 0.5H to 16H, where H is the vertical scale
height). We show that elementary local diagnostics of the turbulence, including
the Shakura-Sunyaev {\alpha} parameter, the ratio of Maxwell stress to magnetic
energy, and the ratio of magnetic to fluid stresses, converge to within the
precision of our measurements for spatial domains of radial size Lx \geq 2H. We
obtain {\alpha} = 0.02-0.03, consistent with recent results. Very small domains
(Lx = 0.5H) return anomalous results, independent of spatial resolution. The
convergence with domain size is only valid for a limited set of diagnostics:
larger spatial domains admit the emergence of dynamically important mesoscale
structures. In our largest simulations, the Maxwell stress shows a significant
large scale non-local component, while the density develops long-lived
axisymmetric perturbations (zonal flows) at the 20% level. Most strikingly, the
variability of the disc in fixed-sized patches decreases strongly as the
simulation volume increases. We find generally good agreement between our
largest local simulations and global simulations with comparable spatial
resolution. There is no direct evidence that the presence of curvature terms or
radial gradients in global calculations materially affect the turbulence,
except to perhaps introduce an outer radial scale for mesoscale structures. The
demonstrated importance of mean magnetic fields, seen in both large local and
global simulations implies that the growth and saturation of these fields is
likely of critical importance for the evolution of accretion discs. (abridged)

spherical halos in order to understand the angular momentum (AM) properties of
the galactic halos seen in cosmological simulations. The universal shape of AM
distributions seen in simulations is found to be generically produced as a
result of mergers. The universal shape is such that it has an excess of low AM
material and hence cannot explain the exponential structure of disk galaxies. A
resolution to this is suggested by the spatial distribution of low AM material
which is found to be in the centre and a conical region close to the axis of
rotation. A mechanism that preferentially discards the material in the centre
and prevents the material along the poles from falling onto the disc is
proposed as a solution. We implement a simple geometric criteria for selective
removal of low AM material and show that in order for 90% of halos to host
exponential discs one has to reject at least 40% of material. Next, we explore
the physical mechanisms responsible for distributing the AM within the halo
during a merger. For dark matter there is an inside-out transfer of AM, whereas
for gas there is an outside-in transfer, which is due to differences between
collisionless and gas dynamics. We also explain the apparent high spin of dark
matter halos undergoing mergers and show that a criteria stricter than what is
currently used, would be required to detect such unrelaxed halos. Finally, we
demonstrate that the misalignment of AM between gas and dark matter only occurs
when the intrinsic spins of the merging halos are not aligned with the orbital
AM of the system. The self-misalignment (orientation of AM when measured in
radial shells not being constant), which could be the cause of warps and
anomalous rotation in disks galaxies, also occurs under similar conditions.

the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at a wavelength of 880 um and angular resolution
of 5""; with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy

Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at a wavelength of 3.3 mm and angular resolution of
10"". Despite high sensitivity and short baselines, we do not detect the Vega
debris disk in either of the interferometric data sets (SMA and CARMA), which
should be sensitive at high significance to clumpy structure based on
previously reported observations. We obtain a marginal (3-sigma) detection of
disk emission in the GBT data; the spatial distribution of the emission is not
well constrained. We analyze the observations in the context of several
different models, demonstrating that the observations are consistent with a
smooth, broad, axisymmetric disk with inner radius 20-100 AU and width >50 AU.
The interferometric data require that at least half of the 860 um emission
detected by previous single-dish observations with the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope be distributed axisymmetrically, ruling out strong contributions from
flux concentrations on spatial scales of <100 AU. These observations support
recent results from the Plateau de Bure Interferometer indicating that previous

highly-obscured, ~15 MSun object still accreting gas while also driving a
powerful, apparently ""explosive"" outflow (Allen & Burton 1993). The unusual
behavior of BN and KL is much debated: How did BN acquire its high velocity?
How is this related to massive star formation in the KL nebula? Here we report
the results of a systematic survey using ~ 10^7 numerical experiments of
gravitational interactions of the \theta^1C and BN stars. We show that
dynamical ejection of BN from this triple system at its observed velocity
leaves behind a binary with total energy and eccentricity matching those
observed for \theta^1C. Five other observed properties of \theta^C are also
consistent with it having ejected BN and altogether we estimate there is only a
<~ 10^{-5} probability that \theta^1C has these properties by chance. We
conclude that BN was dynamically ejected from the \theta^1C system about 4,500
years ago. BN has then plowed through the KL massive-star-forming core within
the last 1,000 years causing its recently-enhanced accretion and outflow
activity.

through the QGP. Theoretical results are presented for J/psi and Upsilon and
compared to experimental data where applicable. At RHIC, a good description of
the high-pT J/psi modification observed in central Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions
can be achieved within the model uncertainties. We find that measurements of
J/psi yields in proton-nucleus reactions are needed to constrain the magnitude
of cold nuclear matter effects. At the LHC, a good description of the
experimental data can be achieved only in mid-central and peripheral Pb+Pb
collisions. The large five-fold suppression of prompt J/psi in the most central
nuclear reactions may indicate for the first time possible thermal effects at
the level of the quarkonium wavefunction at large transverse momenta.

environments will be key bottlenecks in the pipeline leading from data-taking

that allows access to the MIRIAD interferometric reduction system in the Python
programming language. The modular design of MIRIAD and the high productivity
and accessibility of Python provide an excellent foundation for rapid
development of interferometric software. Several other projects with similar
goals exist and we describe them and compare miriad-python to them in detail.
Along with an overview of the package design, we present sample code and
applications, including the detection of millisecond astrophysical transients,
determination and application of nonstandard calibration parameters,
interactive data visualization, and a reduction pipeline using a directed
acyclic graph dependency model analogous to that of the traditional Unix tool
""make"". The key aspects of the miriad-python software project are documented.
We find that miriad-python provides an extremely effective environment for
prototyping new interferometric software, though certain existing packages
provide far more infrastructure for some applications. While equivalent
software written in compiled languages can be much faster than Python, there
are many situations in which execution time is profitably exchanged for speed
of development, code readability, accessibility to nonexpert programmers, quick
interlinking with foreign software packages, and other virtues of the Python
language.

similar phenomenon in three-dimensional (3D) turbulence undergoing strong

contrast the case of 2D versus 3D forcing, as well as non-helical forcing
(i.e., with weak overall alignment between velocity and vorticity) versus the
fully helical Beltrami case, both for deterministic and random forcing. The
different scaling of the inverse energy cascade can be attributed to the
dimensionality of the forcing, with, in general, either a $k_{\perp}^{-3}$ or a
$k_{\perp}^{-5/3}$ energy spectrum of slow modes at large scales, perpendicular
referring to the direction of rotation. We finally invoke the role of shear in
the case of a strongly anisotropic deterministic forcing, using the so-called

Pichard-Landauer formula for the conductivity. The specific density wave order
considered is a period-8 $d$-density wave in which the current density is
unidirectionally modulated. The current modulation is also naturally
accompanied by a period-4 site charge modulation in the same direction, which
is consistent with recent magnetic resonance measurements. In principle Landau
theory also allows for a period-4 bond charge modulation, which is not
discussed, but should be simple to incorporate in the future. This scenario
leads to a natural, but not a unique, explanation of why only oscillations from
a single electron pocket is observed, and a hole pocket of roughly twice the
frequency as dictated by two-fold commensurate order, and the corresponding
Luttinger sum rule, is not observed. However, it is possible that even higher
magnetic fields will reveal a hole pocket of half the frequency of the electron
pocket or smaller. This may be at the borderline of achievable high field
measurements because at least a few complete oscillations have to be clearly
resolved.

describe in some detail the target problem class with discontinuous diffusion
coefficients, which includes problems containing sub-critical, critical, and
supercritical nonlinearities. We then establish basic quasi-optimal a priori
error estimate for Galerkin approximations. In the critical and subcritical
cases, we follow our recent approach to controling the nonlinearity using only
pointwise control of the continuous solution and a local Lipschitz property,
rather than through pointwise control of the discrete solution; this eliminates
the requirement that the discrete solution satisfy a discrete form of the
maximum principle, hence eliminating the need for restrictive angle conditions
in the underlying mesh. The supercritical case continues to require such mesh
conditions in order to control the nonlinearity. We then design a two-grid
algorithm consisting of a coarse grid solver for the original nonlinear
problem, and a fine grid solver for a linearized problem. We analyze the
quality of approximations generated by the algorithm, and show that the coarse
grid may be taken to have much larger elements than the fine grid, and yet one
can still obtain approximation quality that is asymptotically as good as
solving the original nonlinear problem on the fine mesh. The algorithm we

numerical modeling. Exoplanets have a combination of reflected and thermally
emitted light that cause the photocenter of the system to shift increasingly
farther away from the host star with increasing wavelength. We find that, if
observed at long enough wavelengths, the planet can dominate the astrometric
motion of the system, and thus it is possible to directly measure the orbits of
both the planet and star, and thus directly determine the physical masses of
the star and planet, using multi-wavelength astrometry. In general, this
technique works best for, though is certainly not limited to, systems that have
large, high-mass stars and large, low-mass planets, which is a unique parameter
space not covered by other exoplanet characterization techniques. Exoplanets
that happen to transit their host star present unique cases where the physical
radii of the planet and star can be directly determined via astrometry alone.
Planetary albedos and day-night contrast ratios may also be probed via this
technique due to the unique signature they impart on the observed astrometric
orbits. We develop a tool to examine the prospects for near-term detection of
this effect, and give examples of some exoplanets that appear to be good

particular, due to JSC radiation, the powerful emission above the GeV band is
the result of those jitter photons in X-ray band scattered by the relativistic

provide a simpler design, a faster operation, and a lower decoherence. For
coupled three qubits interacting with a photon field, a realizable scheme for a
single-step Toffoli gate is investigated. We find that the three qubit system
can be described by four effective modified Jaynes-Cummings models in the
states of two control qubits. Within the rotating wave approximation, the
modified Jaynes-Cummings models are shown to be reduced to the conventional
Jaynes-Cummings models with renormalized couplings between qubits and photon
fields. A single-step Toffoli gate is shown to be realizable with tuning the
four characteristic oscillation periods that satisfy a commensurate condition.
Possible values of system parameters are estimated for single-step Toffli gate.
From numerical calculation, further, our single-step Toffoli gate operation
errors are discussed due to imperfections in system parameters, which shows
that a Toffoli gate with high fidelity can be obtained by adjusting pairs of
the photon-qubit and the qubit-qubit coupling strengthes. In addition, a
decoherence effect on the Toffoli gate operation is discussed due to a thermal
reservoir.

coupled quantum dots is studied. General conditions for the cooling to the
ground state with single and two-electron dark states are obtained. The results
show that in the case of the interaction of the resonator with a
single-electron dark state, no cooling of the resonator occurs unless the
quantum dots are not identical. The steady-state cooling is possible only if
the energy state of the quantum dot coupled to the drain electrode is detuned
from the energy states of the dots coupled to the electron source electrode.
The detuning has the effect of unequal shifting of the effective dressed states
of the system that the cooling and heating processes occur at different
frequencies. For the case of two electrons injected to the quantum dot system,
the creation of a two-particle dark state is established to be possible with
spin-antiparallel electrons. The results predict that with the two-particle
dark state, an effective cooling can be achieved even with identical quantum
dots subject of an asymmetry only in the charging potential energies coupling
the injected electrons. It is found that similar to the case of the
single-electron dark state, the asymmetries result in the cooling and heating
processes to occur at different frequencies. However, an important difference
between the single and two-particle dark state cases is that the cooling
process occurs at significantly different frequencies. This indicates that the
frequency at which the resonator could be cooled to its ground state can be
changed by switching from the one-electron to the two-electron Coulomb blockade
process.

cosmic rays (UHECR) and active galactic nuclei (AGN), using 69 UHECR events
with energy $E\ge55\,{\rm EeV}$ released in 2010 by Pierre Auger observatory
and 862 AGN within the distance $d\le100\,{\rm Mpc}$ listed in the 13th edition
of V\'eron-Cetty and V\'eron AGN catalog. To make the test hypothesis definite,
we use the simple AGN source model in which UHECR are originated both from AGN,
with the fraction $f_A$, and from the isotropic background. We treat all AGN as
equal sources of UHECR, and introduce the smearing angle $\theta_s$ to
incorporate the effects of intervening magnetic fields. We compare the arrival
direction distributions observed by PAO and expected from the model by the
correlational angular distance distribution (CADD) method. CADD method rules
out the AGN dominance model with a small smearing angle ($f_A\gtrsim0.7$ and
$\theta_s\lesssim6^\circ$). Concerning the isotropy, CADD shows that the
distribution of PAO data is marginally consistent with isotropy. The best fit
model lies around the AGN fraction $f_A=0.4$ and the moderate smearing angle
$\theta_s=10^\circ$. For the fiducial value $f_A=0.7$, the best probability of
CADD was obtained at a rather large smearing angle $\theta_{\rm s}=46^\circ$.
Our results imply that for the whole AGN to be viable sources of UHECR, either
an appreciable amount of additional isotropic background or the large smearing
effect is required. Thus, we try to bin the distance range of AGN to narrow
down the UHECR sources and found that the AGN residing in the distance range
$60-80\,{\rm Mpc}$ have good correlation with the updated PAO data. It is an
indication that further study on the subclass of AGN as the UHECR source may be
quite interesting.

hysteresis'. Cosmological hysteresis is caused by the asymmetry in the equation
of state during expansion and contraction. This asymmetry results in the
formation of a hysteresis loop: $\oint pdV$, whose value can be non-vanishing
during each oscillatory cycle. For flat potentials, a negative value of the
hysteresis loop leads to the increase in amplitude of consecutive cycles and to
a universe with older and larger successive cycles. Such a universe appears to
possess an arrow of time even though entropy production is absent and all of
the equations respect time-reversal symmetry ! Cosmological hysteresis appears
to be widespread and exists for a large class of scalar field potentials and
mechanisms for making the universe bounce. For steep potentials, the value of
the hysteresis loop can be positive as well as negative. The expansion factor
in this case displays quasi-periodic behaviour in which successive cycles can
be both larger as well as smaller than previous ones. This quasi-regular
pattern resembles the phenomenon of BEATS displayed by acoustic systems.
Remarkably, the expression relating the increase/decrease in oscillatory cycles
to the quantum of hysteresis appears to be model independent. The cyclic
scenario is extended to spatially anisotropic models and it is shown that the
anisotropy density decreases during successive cycles if the hysteresis loop is
negative.

Array is whether the low frequency component (SKA1-low) should be implemented
as a single or dual-band aperture array; that is, using one or two antenna
element designs to observe the 70-450 MHz frequency band. This memo uses an
elementary parametric analysis to make a quantitative, first-order cost
comparison of representative implementations of a single and dual-band system,
chosen for comparable performance characteristics. A direct comparison of the
SKA1-low station costs reveals that those costs are similar, although the
uncertainties are high. The cost impact on the broader telescope system varies:
the deployment and site preparation costs are higher for the dual-band array,
but the digital signal processing costs are higher for the single-band array.
This parametric analysis also shows that a first stage of analogue tile
beamforming, as opposed to only station-level, all-digital beamforming, has the
potential to significantly reduce the cost of the SKA1-low stations. However,
tile beamforming can limit flexibility and performance, principally in terms of
reducing accessible field of view. We examine the cost impacts in the context
of scientific performance, for which the spacing and intra-station layout of
the antenna elements are important derived parameters. We discuss the
implications of the many possible intra-station signal transport and processing
architectures and consider areas where future work could improve the accuracy

Moreover, a mechanical isolation stage is incorporated in the device. The
results are discussed on the basis of an analysis of homogeneous and
non-homogeneous losses in the device and validated by a set of Finite-Element
models. The contributions of thermoelastic dissipation and coating losses are
separated and the measured quality factors are found in agreement with the
calculated values, while the absence of unmodeled losses confirms that the
isolation element integrated in the device efficiently uncouples the dynamics
of the mirror from the support system. Also the resonant frequencies evaluated
by Finite-Element models are in good agreement with the experimental data, and
allow the estimation of the Young modulus of the coating. The models that we

Similar features also develop readily in N-body simulations of isolated cool,

this series of papers, I present a detailed study of the origin of spiral
activity in simulations in the hope that the mechanism that causes the patterns
is also responsible for some of these features galaxies. In this first paper, I
use a suite of highly idealized simulations of a linearly stable disk that
employ increasing numbers of particles. While the amplitudes of initial
non-axisymmetric features scale as the inverse square-root of the number of
particles employed, the final amplitude of the patterns is independent of the
particle number. I find that the amplitudes of non-axisymmetric disturbances
grow in two distinct phases: slow growth occurs when the relative overdensity
is below ~2%, but above this level the amplitude rises more rapidly. I show
that all features, even of very low amplitude, scatter particles at the inner
Lindblad resonance, changing the distribution of particles in the disk in such
a way as to foster continued growth. Stronger scattering by larger amplitude
waves provokes a vigorous instability that is a true linear mode of the
modified disk.

contribution of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in intermediate-age
clusters throughout the disk of M100. For our sample of 17 AGB-dominated
clusters we extract optical-to-mid-IR SEDs and find that NIR brightness is
coupled to the mid-IR dust emission in such a way that a significant reduction
of AGB light, of up to 1 mag in K-band, follows from extinction by the dust
shell formed during this stage. Since the dust optical depth varies with AGB
chemistry (C-rich or O-rich), our results suggest that the contribution of AGB
stars to the flux from their host clusters will be closely linked to the
metallicity and the progenitor mass of the AGB star, to which dust chemistry
and mass-loss rate are sensitive. Our sample of clusters--each the analogue of
a ~1 Gyr old post-starburst galaxy--has implications within the context of mass
and age estimation via SED modelling at high z: we find that the average ~0.5
mag extinction estimated here may be sufficient to reduce the AGB contribution
in (rest-frame) K-band from ~70%, as predicted in the latest generation of
synthesis models, to ~35%. Our technique for selecting AGB-dominated clusters
in nearby galaxies promises to be effective for discriminating the
uncertainties associated with AGB stars in intermediate-age populations that
plague age and mass estimation in high-z galaxies.

large-scale vortices in protoplanetary discs. The instability operates around a
density bump in the disc, and the resulting vortices may facilitate
planetesimal formation and angular momentum transfer in the disc dead zone.
Most previous works on the RWI deal with two-dimensional (height-integrated)
discs. However, vortices may have different dynamical behaviours in 3D than in
2D. Recent numerical simulations of the RWI in 3D global discs by Meheut et al.
have revealed intriguing vertical structure of the vortices, including
appreciable vertical velocities. In this paper we present a linear analysis of
the RWI in 3D global models of isothermal discs. We calculate the growth rates
of the Rossby modes (of various azimuthal wave numbers m = 2 - 6) trapped
around the fiducial density bump and carry out 3D numerical simulations to
compare with our linear results. We show that the 3D RWI growth rates are only
slightly smaller than the 2D growth rates, and the velocity structures seen in
the numerical simulations during the linear phase are in agreement with the
velocity eigenfunctions obtained in our linear calculations. This numerical
benchmark shows that numerical simulations can accurately describe the
instability. The angular momentum transfer rate associated with Rossby vortices
is also studied.

certified, we mean that the approximation can approximate the given curve to
any given precision and preserve the geometric features of the given curve such
as the topology, singular points, etc. The approximated curve is divided into
segments called quasi-cubic B\'{e}zier curve segments which have properties
similar to a cubic rational B\'{e}zier curve. And the approximate curve is
naturally constructed as the associated cubic rational B\'{e}zier curve of the
control tetrahedron of a quasi-cubic curve. A novel optimization method is
proposed to select proper weights in the cubic rational B\'{e}zier curve to
approximate the given curve. The error of the approximation is controlled by
the size of its tetrahedron, which converges to zero by subdividing the curve
segments. As an application, approximate implicit equations of the approximated
curves can be computed. Experiments show that the method can approximate space
curves of high degrees with high precision and very few cubic B\'{e}zier curve

highly oscillatory data. Here weak stability means that exponentially growing
modes are absent, but the so-called uniform Lopatinskii condition fails at some
boundary frequency $\beta$ in the hyperbolic region. As a consequence of this
degeneracy there is an amplification phenomenon: outgoing waves of amplitude
$O(\eps^2)$ and wavelength $\eps$ give rise to reflected waves of amplitude
$O(\eps)$, so the overall solution has amplitude $O(\eps)$. Moreover, the
reflecting waves emanate from a radiating wave that propagates in the boundary
along a characteristic of the Lopatinskii determinant. An approximate solution
that displays the qualitative behavior just described is constructed by solving
suitable profile equations that exhibit a loss of derivatives, so we solve the
profile equations by a Nash-Moser iteration. The exact solution is constructed
by solving an associated singular problem involving singular derivatives of the
form $\partial_{x'}+\beta\frac{\partial_{\theta_0}}{\eps}$, $x'$ being the
tangential variables with respect to the boundary. Tame estimates for the
linearization of that problem are proved using a first-order calculus of
singular pseudodifferential operators constructed in the companion article
\cite{CGW2}. These estimates exhibit a loss of one singular derivative and
force us to construct the exact solution by a separate Nash-Moser iteration.
The same estimates are used in the error analysis, which shows that the exact
and approximate solutions are close in $L^\infty$ on a fixed time interval
independent of the (small) wavelength $\eps$. The approach using singular
systems allows us to avoid constructing high order expansions and making small
divisor assumptions.

exploit Suzaku's low particle background to probe the ICM to radii beyond those
possible with previous observations (reaching out to the virial radius), and
with better azimuthal coverage. We find significant anisotropies in the
temperature and entropy profiles, with a region of lower temperature and
entropy occurring to the south east, possibly the result of accretion activity
in this direction. Away from this cold feature, the thermodynamic properties
are consistent with an entropy profile which rises, but less steeply than the
predictions of purely gravitational hierarchical structure formation. Excess
emission in the northern direction can be explained due to the overlap of the
emission from the outskirts of Abell 2029 and nearby Abell 2033 (which is at
slightly higher redshift). These observations suggest that the assumptions of
spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium break down in the outskirts of
galaxy clusters, which poses challenges for modelling cluster masses at large
radii and presents opportunities for studying the formation and accretion
history of clusters.

Msun, M2 = 0.96 Msun, an orbital inclination angle of i = 43 degrees, and an
optimal systemic velocity of gamma = 7 km/s. These are in good agreement with
previously published values. Our Roche tomograms of the secondary star show
prominent irradiation of the inner Lagrangian point due to illumination by the
disc and/or bright spot, which may have been enhanced as RU Peg was in outburst
at the time of our observations.We find that this irradiation pattern is
axi-symmetric and confined to regions of the star which have a direct view of
the accretion regions. This is in contrast to previous attempts to map RU Peg
which suggested that the irradiation pattern was non-symmetric and extended
beyond the terminator. We also detect additional inhomogeneities in the surface
distribution of stellar atomic absorption that we ascribe to the presence of a
large star-spot. This spot is centred at a latitude of about 82 degrees and
covers approximately 4 per cent of the total surface area of the secondary. In
keeping with the high latitude spots mapped on the cataclysmic variables AE Aqr
and BV Cen, the spot on RU Peg also appears slightly shifted towards the
trailing hemisphere of the star. Finally, we speculate that early mapping
attempts which indicated non-symmetric irradiation patterns which extended
beyond the terminator of CV donors could possibly be explained by a
superposition of symmetric heating and a large spot.

  Locality-Constrained Collaborative Strategy",,,,,"cs.CV cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a simple but highly efficient ensemble for robust
texture classification, which can effectively deal with translation, scale and
changes of significant viewpoint problems. The proposed method first inherits
the spirit of spatial pyramid matching model (SPM), which is popular for
encoding spatial distribution of local features, but in a flexible way,
partitioning the original image into different levels and incorporating
different overlapping patterns of each level. This flexible setup helps capture
the informative features and produces sufficient local feature codes by some
well-chosen aggregation statistics or pooling operations within each
partitioned region, even when only a few sample images are available for
training. Then each texture image is represented by several orderless feature
codes and thereby all the training data form a reliable feature pond. Finally,
to take full advantage of this feature pond, we develop a collaborative
representation-based strategy with locality constraint (LC-CRC) for the final
classification, and experimental results on three well-known public texture
datasets demonstrate the proposed approach is very competitive and even
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, when only a few
samples of each category are available for training, our approach still
achieves very high classification performance.

optical outburst, MAGIC observed the source in January-February 2011 for 20.3
hrs. The target was monitored in the optical R-band by the KVA telescope that
also performed optical polarization measurements. We triggered target of
opportunity observations with the Swift satellite and obtained simultaneous and
quasi-simultaneous data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope and from the
Mets\""ahovi radio telescope. We also present the analysis of older MAGIC data
taken in 2010. Results. The MAGIC observations of 1ES 1215+303 carried out in
January-February 2011 resulted in the first detection of the source at VHE with
a statistical significance of 9.4 sigma. Simultaneously, the source was
observed in a high optical and X-ray state. In 2010 the source was observed in
a lower state in optical, X-ray, and VHE, while the GeV gamma-ray flux and the
radio flux were comparable in 2010 and 2011. The spectral energy distribution
obtained with the 2011 data can be modeled with a simple one zone SSC model,
but it requires extreme values for the Doppler factor or the electron energy
distribution.

model} (MADM) on $\mathbb{Z}$ introduced by Sasamoto and Wadati in 1998. The
transition probability of the MADM with $N$ particles is provided by using the
Bethe ansatz. The transition probability is expressed as the sum of
$N$-dimensional contour integrals of which contours are circles centered at the
origin with restrictions on their radii. By using the transition probability we
find $\mathbb{P}(x_m(t) =x)$, the probability that the $m$th particle from the
left is at $x$ at time $t$. The probability $\mathbb{P}(x_m(t) =x)$ is
expressed as the sum of $|S|$-dimensional contour integrals over all $S \subset
\{1,...,N\}$ with $|S| \geq m$, and is used to give the current distribution of
the system. The mapping between the MADM and the pushing asymmetric simple
exclusion process (PushASEP) is discussed.

resulting from a given initially-infected node in a network of susceptible
individuals. Our approach is based on counting the number of possible infection
walks of various lengths to each other node in the network. We analytically
study the properties of our method, in particular demonstrating different forms
for SIS and SIR disease spreading (e.g. under the SIR model our method counts
self-avoiding walks). In comparison to existing methods to infer the spreading
efficiency of different nodes in the network (based on degree, k-shell
decomposition analysis and different centrality measures), our method directly
considers the spreading process and, as such, is unique in providing estimation
of actual numbers of infections. Crucially, in simulating infections on various
real-world networks with the SIR model, we show that our walks-based method
improves the inference of effectiveness of nodes over a wide range of infection
rates compared to existing methods. We also analyse the trade-off between
estimate accuracy and computational cost, showing that the better accuracy here
can still be obtained at a comparable computational cost to other methods.

12-nm diameter crystalline gold nanoparticles exhibit a longitudinally coupled
plasmon mode cen- tered at 700 nm. We have exploited this longitudinal
absorption band to efficiently confine light fields and concentrate heat
sources in the close vicinity of these plasmonic chain net- works. The mapping
of the two phenomena on the same superstructures was performed by combining
two-photon luminescence (TPL) and fluorescence polarization anisotropy (FPA)
imaging techniques. Besides the light and heat concentration, we show
experimentally that the planar spatial distribution of optical field intensity
can be simply modulated by controlling the linear polarization of the incident
optical excitation. On the contrary, the heat production, which is obtained
here by exciting the structures within the optically transparent window of
biological tissues, is evenly spread over the entire PNN. This contrasts with
the usual case of localized heating in continuous nanowires, thus opening
opportunities for these networks in light-induced hyperthermia applications.
Furthermore, we propose a unified theoretical framework to account for both the
non-linear optical and thermal near-fields around PNN. The associated numerical
simulations, based on a Green s function formalism, are in excellent agreement
with the experimental images. This formalism therefore provides a versatile
tool for the accurate engineering of optical and thermodynamical properties of
complex plasmonic colloidal architectures.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops and evaluates the performance of an advanced multiple
access protocol for transmission of full complement of multimedia signals
consisting of various combinations of voice, video, data, text and images over
wireless networks. The protocol is called Advanced Multiple Access Protocol for
Multimedia Transmission (AMAPMT) and is to be used in the Data Link Layer of
the protocol stack. The principle of operation of the protocol is presented in
a number of logical flow charts. The protocol grants permission to transmit to
a source on the basis of a priority scheme that takes into account a
time-to-live (TTL) parameter of all the transactions, selectable priorities
assigned to all the sources and relevant channel state information (CSI) in
this order. Performance of the protocol is evaluated in terms of quality of
service parameters like packet loss ratio (PLR), mean packet transfer delay
(MPTD) and throughput. Using a simulation model based on an OPNET simulation
software package does the evaluation. Under various traffic loads with constant
distributions with various mean arrival rates and transaction sizes results
obtained show that the performance is improved when this priority scheme is
used than when it is not used. The results for AMAPMT are compared with that of
the best currently available multiple access protocol called Adaptive Request
Channel Multiple Access (ARCMA). AMAPMT protocol out performs ARCMA protocol.
