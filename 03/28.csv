Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). As proposals for interferometry and creating
nonlocal quantum superpositions have been formed, it has become necessary to
investigate effects not present in mean-field models. We investigate the effect
of harmonic confinement on the internal degrees of freedom, as the ratio of
zero-point harmonic oscillator length to classical soliton length, for
different numbers of atoms. We derive a first-order energy correction for the
addition of a harmonic potential to the many-body wave function and use this to
create a variational technique based on energy minimization of this wave
function for an arbitrary number of atoms, and include numerics based on
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a basis of harmonic oscillator Fock
states. Finally we compare agreement between a Hartree product ground state and
the Bethe ansatz solution with a Gaussian envelope localizing the center of
mass and show a region of good agreement.

Organic resists that are commonly used for shadow masks and other lift-off

mask described herein does not suffer these same shortcomings. It was
fabricated from a Ge/Nb bilayer, comprising suspended Nb bridges supported by
an undercut Ge sacrificial layer. Utilizing such a bilayer mask on C-plane
sapphire, the growth of epitaxial Al tunnel junctions was achieved using
molecular beam epitaxy. Crystalline Al2O3 was grown diffusively at 300 C in a
molecular oxygen background of 2.0 utorr, while amorphous oxide was grown at
room temperature and 25 mtorr. A variety of analysis techniques were employed
to evaluate the materials, and tunnel junction current-voltage characteristics

binary electrolyte is considered. In such a system the solute dissociates
completely into two species of ions with unlike charges. The mathematical
description consists of a diffusion equation for each species augmented by
transport due to a self consistent electrostatic field determined by the
Poisson equation. This mathematical framework also describes other important
problems in physics such as electron and hole diffusion across semi-conductor
junctions and the diffusion of ions in plasmas. If concentrations do not vary
appreciably over distances of the order of the Debye length, the Poisson
equation can be replaced by the condition of local charge neutrality first
introduced by Planck. It can then be shown that both species diffuse at the
same rate with a common diffusivity that is intermediate between that of the
slow and fast species (ambipolar diffusion). Here we derive a more general
theory by exploiting the ratio of Debye length to a characteristic length scale
as a small asymptotic parameter. It is shown that the concentration of either
species may be described by a nonlinear integro-differential equation which
replaces the classical linear equation for ambipolar diffusion but reduces to
it in the appropriate limit. Through numerical integration of the full set of
equations it is shown that this nonlinear equation provides a better
approximation to the exact solution than the linear equation it replaces.

approximately seven orders of magnitudes, four of which lie beyond the
resolving power of current telescopes. Here we have used a Hinode SOT/SP deep
mode data set for the quiet-sun disk center in combination with constraints
from the Hanle effect to derive scaling laws that describe how the magnetic
structuring varies from the resolved scales down to the magnetic diffusion
limit, where the field ceases to be frozen-in. The focus of the analysis is a
derivation of the magnetic energy spectrum, but we also discuss the scale
dependence of the probability density function (PDF) for the flux densities and
the role of the cancellation function for the average unsigned flux density.
Analysis of the Hinode data set with the line-ratio method reveals a collapsed
flux population in the form of flux tubes with a size distribution that is
peaked in the 10-100 km range. Magnetic energy is injected into this scale
range by the instability mechanism of flux tube collapse, which is driven by
the external gas pressure in the superadiabatic region at the top of the
convection zone. This elevates the magnetic energy spectrum just beyond the
telescope resolution limit. Flux tube decay feeds an inertial range that
cascades down the scale spectrum to the magnetic diffusion limit, and which
contains the tangled, ""hidden"" flux that is known to exist from observations of
the Hanle effect. The observational constraints demand that the total magnetic
energy in the hidden flux must be of the same order as the total energy in the
kG flux tubes. Both the flux tubes and the hidden flux are found to be
preferentially located in the intergranular lanes, which is to be expected
since they are physically related.

We observe occultations of WASP-24b to measure brightness temperatures
and to determine whether or not its atmosphere exhibits a thermal inversion
(stratosphere). Methods. We observed occultations of WASP-24b at 3.6 and 4.5
{\mu}m using the Spitzer Space Telescope. It has been suggested that there is a
correlation between stellar activity and the presence of inversions, so we
analysed existing HARPS spectra in order to calculate log R'HK for WASP-24 and
thus determine whether or not the star is chromospherically active. We also
observed a transit of WASP-24b in the Str\""{o}mgren u and y bands, with the
CAHA 2.2-m telescope. Results. We measure occultation depths of 0.159 \pm 0.013
per cent at 3.6 {\mu}m and 0.202 \pm 0.018 per cent at 4.5 {\mu}m. The
corresponding planetary brightness temperatures are 1974 \pm 71 K and 1944 \pm
85 K respectively. Atmosphere models with and without a thermal inversion fit
the data equally well; we are unable to constrain the presence of an inversion
without additional occultation measurements in the near-IR. We find log R'HK =
-4.98 \pm 0.12, indicating that WASP-24 is not a chromospherically active star.
Our global analysis of new and previously-published data has refined the system
parameters, and we find no evidence that the orbit of WASP-24b is non-circular.
Conclusions. These results emphasise the importance of complementing Spitzer
measurements with observations at shorter wavelengths to gain a full
understanding of hot Jupiter atmospheres.

Necessary and sufficient conditions on the success probability sequence are

double connectivity is required when the communication is independent.
Moreover, it is proven that with odd number of nodes, average preserving turns

with respect to density was performed. We observe a repolymerization of the
network manifested by a transition from a tetrahedral to an octahedral silicon
environment, the decrease of the amount of non-bridging oxygen atoms and the
appearance of three-fold coordinated oxygen atoms (triclusters). Anomalous
changes in the medium range order are observed, the first sharp diffraction
peak showing a minimum of its full-width at half maximum according to density.
The previously reported vibrational trends in densified glasses are observed,
such as the shift of the Boson peak intensity to higher frequencies and the
decrease of its intensity. Finally, we show that the thermal behavior of the
liquid can be reproduced by the Birch-Murnaghan equation of states, thus
allowing us to compute the isothermal compressibility.

the models which reproduce CG Cyg B's position in the HR diagram. We observe a
correlation between the model's initial metal and helium abundance which, in
most cases, does not agree with a helium to metal enrichment ratio
$\Delta$Y/$\Delta$Z=2. Moreover, we identify a correlation between the model's
initial helium/metal abundance and both its age and mixing-length parameter.
Additionally, every model found has a mixing-length parameter below 1.3. This
means that CG Cyg B's mixing-length parameter is clearly smaller than the solar
one. From this study we conclude that ANNs are well suited to deal with the
degeneracy of model solutions of solar type stars.

crossing NGC 2818 at five different positions to precisely determine
kinematical features in the structure of the nebula. A distance of 2.5 kpc was

modern computational tools, we find NGC 2818 is composed by: (1) a non-uniform
bipolar structure with a semi-major axis of 0.92 pc (75 arcsec), possibly
deformed by the stellar wind, (2) a 0.17 pc (14 arcsec) diameter central
region, which is potentially the remnant of an equatorial enhancement, and (3)
a great number of cometary knots. These knots are preferentially located inside
a radius of 0.24 pc (20 arcsec) around the central star. The ma jor axis of the

closer to the user and, thus, reduces latency for applications, but also
increases the availability in the event of a data center failure. Therefore, it
is not surprising that companies like Google, Yahoo, and Netflix already
replicate user data across geographically different regions.
  However, replication across data centers is expensive. Inter-data center
network delays are in the hundreds of milliseconds and vary significantly.
Synchronous wide-area replication is therefore considered to be unfeasible with
strong consistency and current solutions either settle for asynchronous
replication which implies the risk of losing data in the event of failures,
restrict consistency to small partitions, or give up consistency entirely. With
MDCC (Multi-Data Center Consistency), we describe the first optimistic commit
protocol, that does not require a master or partitioning, and is strongly
consistent at a cost similar to eventually consistent protocols. MDCC can
commit transactions in a single round-trip across data centers in the normal
operational case. We further propose a new programming model which empowers the
application developer to handle longer and unpredictable latencies caused by
inter-data center communication. Our evaluation using the TPC-W benchmark with
MDCC deployed across 5 geographically diverse data centers shows that MDCC is
able to achieve throughput and latency similar to eventually consistent quorum
protocols and that MDCC is able to sustain a data center outage without a
significant impact on response times while guaranteeing strong consistency.

probe diffuse molecular gas near the supernova remnant IC 443. Recent gamma-ray
observations have revealed the presence of shock-accelerated cosmic rays
interacting with the molecular cloud surrounding the remnant. Our results
indicate that the 7Li/6Li ratio is lower in regions more strongly affected by
these interactions, a sign of recent Li production by cosmic rays. We find that
7Li/6Li ~ 7 toward HD 254755, which is located just outside the visible edge of
IC 443, while 7Li/6Li ~ 3 along the line of sight to HD 43582, which probes the
interior region of the supernova remnant. No evidence of 7Li synthesis by
neutrino-induced spallation is found in material presumably contaminated by the
ejecta of a core-collapse supernova. The lack of a neutrino signature in the
7Li/6Li ratios near IC 443 is consistent with recent models of Galactic
chemical evolution, which suggest that the nu-process plays only a minor role
in Li production.

this can reduce the sensitivity of these searches, particularly for black
hole--neutron star binaries. In this paper we investigate the effect of
neglecting precession on the sensitivity of searches for spinning binaries
using non-spinning waveform models. We demonstrate that in the sensitive band
of Advanced LIGO, the angle between the binary's orbital angular momentum and
its total angular momentum is approximately constant. Under this \emph{constant
precession cone} approximation, we show that the gravitational-wave phasing is
modulated in two ways: a secular increase of the gravitational-wave phase due
to precession and an oscillation around this secular increase. We show that
this secular evolution occurs in precisely three ways, corresponding to
physically different apparent evolutions of the binary's precession about the
line of sight. We estimate the best possible fitting factor between \emph{any}
non-precessing template model and a single precessing signal, in the limit of a
constant precession cone. Our closed form estimate of the fitting-factor
depends only the geometry of the in-band precession cone; it does not depend
explicitly on binary parameters, detector response, or details of either signal
model. The precessing black hole--neutron star waveforms least accurately
matched by nonspinning waveforms correspond to viewing geometries where the
precession cone sweeps the orbital plane repeatedly across the line of sight,
in an unfavorable polarization alignment.

in galaxies, we outline a method for treating the radial forces on interstellar
gas due to absorption of photons by dust grains. The method gives the correct
behavior in all of the relevant limits (dominated by the central point source;
dominated by the distributed isotropic source; optically thin; optically thick
to UV/optical; optically thick to IR) and reasonably interpolates between the
limits when necessary. The method is explicitly energy conserving so that
UV/optical photons that are absorbed are not lost, but are rather redistributed
to the IR where they may scatter out of the galaxy. We implement the radiative
transfer algorithm in a two-dimensional hydrodynamical code designed to study
feedback processes in the context of early-type galaxies. We find that the
dynamics and final state of simulations are measurably but only moderately
affected by radiative forces on dust, even when assumptions about the
dust-to-gas ratio are varied from zero to a value appropriate for the Milky
Way. In simulations with high gas densities designed to mimic ULIRGs with a
star formation rate of several hundred solar masses per year, dust makes a more
substantial contribution to the dynamics and outcome of the simulation. We find
that, despite the large opacity of dust to UV radiation, the momentum input to
the flow from radiation very rarely exceeds L/c due to two factors: the low
opacity of dust to the re-radiated IR and the tendency for dust to be destroyed
by sputtering in hot gas environments. We also develop a simplification of our
radiative transfer algorithm that respects the essential physics but is much
easier to implement and requires a fraction of the computational cost.

Seyfert 2 galaxies have been discovered in the last decade. One of them, the
starburst/Seyfert composite galaxy IRAS 01072+4954 (z=0.0236), has a typical
Type~1 X-ray emission, while its optical spectrum resembles an HII galaxy and
lacks the expected broad lines. We performed near-infrared integral-field
observations of this object with the aim to determine the nature of its nuclear
emission and to find indications for the existence or absence of a broad-line
region. Several reasons have been proposed to explain such peculiar emission.
We studied the validity of such hypotheses, including the possibility for it to
be True-Seyfert~2. We found little obscuration towards the nucleus A_V = 2.5
mag, and a nuclear star-formation rate Sigma_SFR < 11.6 Msun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2},
which is below the average in Seyferts. Unresolved hot-dust emission with T ~
1150 K seems to indicate the presence of a torus with its axis close to the
line of sight. We found that IRAS 01072+4954 hosts a low mass black hole with
an estimated mass of M_BH ~ 10^5 Msun and an upper limit of 2.5x10^6 Msun. Its
bolometric luminosity is L_bol ~ 2.5x10^{42} erg/s, which yields a high
accretion rate with an Eddington ratio ~ 0.2. If the relations found in more
massive systems also apply to this case, then IRAS 01072+4954 should show broad
emission lines with FWHM_{broad} ~(400-600) km/s. Indeed, some indications for
such narrow broad-line components are seen in our data, but the evidence is not
yet conclusive. This source thus seems not to be a True-Seyfert 2, but an
extreme case of a narrow line Seyfert 1, which, due to the faintness of the
active nucleus, does not have strong FeII emission in the optical.

unbiased regarding any rotational parameters of neutron stars. We found that
the energy distribution of many pulsars is well-described by a log-normal
distribution, with few deviating from a small range in log-normal scale and
location parameters. Some pulsars exhibited multiple energy states
corresponding to mode changes, and implying that some observed ""nulling"" may
actually be a mode-change effect. PSRJ1900-2600 was found to emit weakly in its
previously-identified ""null"" state. We found evidence for another state-change
effect in two pulsars, which show bimodality in their nulling time scales; that
is, they switch between a continuous-emission state and a single-pulse-emitting
state. Large modulation occurs in many pulsars across the full integrated
profile, with increased sporadic bursts at leading and trailing sub-beam edges.
Some of these high-energy outbursts may indicate the presence of ""giant pulse""
phenomena. We found no correlation with modulation and pulsar period, age, or

of X-ray selected AGNs out to z=2.5, using far-IR data in three extragalactic
deep fields as part of the PACS Evolutionary Probe (PEP) program. Guided by
studies of intrinsic infra-red AGN SEDs, we show that the majority of the FIR
emission in AGNs is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. We uncover
characteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean FIR luminosity
(L_fir) and accretion luminosity (L_agn) of AGNs. At low AGN luminosities,
accretion and SFR are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenario
where most low-luminosity AGNs are primarily fueled by secular processes in
their host galaxies. At high AGN luminosities, a significant correlation is
observed between L_fir and L_agn, but only among AGNs at low and moderate
redshifts (z<1). We interpret this as a signature of the increasing importance
of major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes
(SMBHs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high AGN luminosities.
However, we also find that the enhancement of SFR in luminous AGNs weakens or
disappears at high redshifts (z>1). This suggests that the role of mergers in
SMBH-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. At all redshifts,
we find essentially no relationship between L_fir and nuclear obscuration
across five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting that
various different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring X-rays
in active galaxies. We explain our results within a scenario in which two
different modes of SMBH fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity AGNs. We
postulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshift
galaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity AGNs
evolves with redshift.

rapidly and accurately determine planetary system parameters. We use the
EVIL-MC model to analyze Kepler Quarter 0-2 (Q0-2) observations of the HAT-P-7

corroborates previous estimates of the planet-star mass ratio q = (1.10 +/-

temperature to 2680 +10/-20 K. We also find a large difference between the day-
and nightside planetary flux, with little nightside emission. Preliminary
dynamical+radiative modeling of the atmosphere indicates this result is
qualitatively consistent with high altitude absorption of stellar heating.
Similar analyses of Kepler and CoRoT photometry of other planets using EVIL-MC
will play a key role in providing constraints on the properties of many
extrasolar systems, especially given the limited resources for follow-up and
characterization of these systems. However, as we highlight, there are
important degeneracies between the contributions from ellipsoidal variations
and planetary emission and reflection. Consequently, for many of the hottest
and brightest Kepler and CoRoT planets, accurate estimates of the planetary
emission and reflection, diagnostic of atmospheric heat budgets, will require
accurate modeling of the photometric contribution from the stellar ellipsoidal

zero/low mutual inclination is taken into account, creating a correlation

the model's predictions with the observations made by Kepler, we find that the
correlation produced by planarity is insufficient and a higher correlation is
needed; either the formation of one planet in the system enhances the
likelihood of other planets to form, and/or that some stars are considerably
more fertile than others. Kepler's data presents evidences that both
correlations might play a part, in particular a significant dependency in the
radial distribution of planets in multi-planet systems is shown. Followup
observations on Kepler planet's hosts can help pinpoint the physical nature of
this correlation.

The Casimir-like behaviour in our system comes instead from a non-dispersive

be explicitly tested in weakly coupled deformed QCD. We comment on profound

emergent collective behaviour, complexity, randomness and interaction between

functions on their space-time dynamics and to predict behaviour of any given

mean field theory, differential equations and number conserving features. We
aim to classify CA based on their behaviour when they act in a historical mode,
i.e. as CA with memory. We demonstrate that cell-state transition rules
enriched with memory quickly transform a chaotic system converging to a complex
global behaviour from almost any initial condition. Thus just in few steps we
can select chaotic rules without exhaustive computational experiments or
recurring to additional parameters. We provide analysis of well-known chaotic
functions in one-dimensional CA, and decompose dynamics of the automata using
majority memory exploring glider dynamics and reactions.

natural justification for the flatness of the potential over a super-Planckian
distance, namely the approximate shift-symmetry of the inflaton. In addition,
most of the observational consequences are directly related to this symmetry
and hence are correlated. Large tensor modes can be accompanied by the
observable effects of a the shift-symmetric coupling $\phi F\tilde F$ to a
gauge field. During inflation this coupling leads to a copious production of
gauge quanta and consequently a very distinct modification of the primordial
curvature perturbations. In this work we compare these predictions with
observations. We find that the leading constraint on the model comes from the
CMB power spectrum when considering both WMAP 7-year and ACT data. The
bispectrum generated by the non-Gaussian inverse-decay of the gauge field leads
to a comparable but slightly weaker constraint. There is also a constraint from
mu-distortion using TRIS plus COBE/FIRAS data, but it is much weaker. Finally
we comment on a generalization of the model to massive gauge fields. When the
mass is generated by some light Higgs field, observably large local
non-Gaussianity can be produced.

that during the past ~10 Myr the SFR was 2 - 3 times higher than during the
preceding ~100 Myr. The rings of cool gas that harbor a significant fraction of
the current star-forming activity are traced by stars with ages ~100 Myr,
indicating that (1) these structures have ages of at least 100 Myr, and (2)
stars in these structures do not follow the same relation between age and
random velocity as their counterparts throughout the disks of other spiral
galaxies, probably due to the inherently narrow orbital angular momentum
distribution of the giant molecular clouds in these structures. The
distribution of evolved red stars is not azimuthally symmetric, in the sense
that their projected density along the north east segment of the major axis is
roughly twice that on the opposite side of the galaxy. The north east arm of
the major axis thus appears to be a fossil star-forming area that dates to
intermediate epochs. Such a structure may be the consequence of interactions

adopted for their execution. Consensus clustering is used in data analysis to
generate stable results out of a set of partitions delivered by stochastic
methods. Here we show that consensus clustering can be combined with any
existing method in a self-consistent way, enhancing considerably both the
stability and the accuracy of the resulting partitions. This framework is also
particularly suitable to monitor the evolution of community structure in
temporal networks. An application of consensus clustering to a large citation
network of physics papers demonstrates its capability to keep track of the
birth, death and diversification of topics.

(CR) propagation processes in the Galaxy. It is usually assumed that secondary
nuclei such as Li-Be-B are entirely generated by collisions of heavier CR
nuclei with the interstellar medium (ISM). We study the CR propagation under a
scenario where secondary nuclei can also be produced or accelerated from
galactic sources. We consider the processes of hadronic interactions inside
supernova remnants (SNRs) and re-acceleration of background CRs in strong
shocks. Thus, we investigate their impact in the propagation parameter
determination within present and future data. The spectra of Li-Be-B nuclei
emitted from SNRs are harder than those due to CR collisions with the ISM. The
secondary-to-primary ratios flatten significantly at ~TeV/n energies, both from
spallation and re-acceleration in the sources. The two mechanisms are
complementary to each other and depend on the properties of the local ISM
around the expanding remnants. The secondary production in SNRs is significant
for dense background media, n ~1 cm^-3, while the amount of re-accelerated CRs
is relevant for SNRs expanding into rarefied media, n ~0.1 cm-3. Due to these
effects, the the diffusion parameter 'delta' may be misunderstood by a factor
of ~5-15%. Our estimations indicate that an experiment of the AMS-02 caliber
can constrain the key propagation parameters while breaking the
source-transport degeneracy, for a wide class of B/C-consistent models. Given
the precision of the data expected from on-going experiments, the SNR
production/acceleration of secondary nuclei should be considered, if any, to
prevent a possible mis-determination of the CR transport parameters.

asymmetric communication links, and are affected by communication rather than
processor failures. In this paper we investigate the minimal message
survivability in a per round basis that allows for the minimal global
cooperation, i.e., allows to solve any task that is wait-free read-write
solvable. The paper completely characterizes this survivability requirement.
Message survivability is formalized by considering adversaries that have a
limited power to remove messages in a round. Removal of a message on a link in
one direction does not necessarily imply the removal of the message on that
link in the other direction. Surprisingly there exist a single strongest
adversary which solves any wait-free read/write task. Any different adversary
that solves any wait-free read/write task is weaker, and any stronger adversary
will not solve any wait-free read/write task. ABD \cite{ABD} who considered
processor failure, arrived at an adversary that is $n/2$ resilient,
consequently can solve tasks, such as $n/2$-set-consensus, which are not
read/write wait-free solvable. With message adversaries, we arrive at an
adversary which has exactly the read-write wait-free power. Furthermore, this
adversary allows for a considerably simpler (simplest that we know of) proof
that the protocol complex of any read/write wait-free task is a subdivided
simplex, finally making this proof accessible for students with no
algebraic-topology prerequisites, and alternatively dispensing with the
assumption that the Immediate Snapshot complex is a subdivided simplex.

rotation of gas in a non-axisymmetric Keplerian accretion disk, ionized by a
varying radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) located in the inner
parts of the disk. We present and model 11 new spectroscopic observations of
the double-peaked profile taken between 2010 March and 2011 March. This series
of observations was motivated by the finding that in 2010 March the flux in the
double-peaked line was again strong, becoming, in 2010 December, even stronger
than in the observations of a decade ago. We also discovered shorter timescale
variations than in the previous observations: (1) the first, of ~7 days, is
interpreted as due to ""reverberation"" of the variation of the ionizing source
luminosity, and the timescale of 7 days as the light crossing time between the
source and the accretion disk; this new timescale and its interpretation
provides a distance between the emitting gas and the supermassive black hole
and as such introduces a new constraint on its mass; (2) the second, of
approximately 5 months, was attributed to the rotation of a spiral arm in the
disk, which was found to occur on the dynamical timescale. We use two accretion
disk models to fit theoretical profiles to the new data, both having
non-axisymmetric emissivities produced by the presence of an one-armed spiral.
Our modeling constrains the rotation period for the spiral to be approximately
18 months. This work supports our previous conclusion that the broad
double-peaked Balmer emission lines in NGC 1097, and probably also in other
low-luminosity active nuclei, originate from an accretion disk ionized by a
central RIAF.

solution $u=(u_i)_{i=1}^m$ is necessarily one-dimensional whenever each one of
its components $u_i$ is monotone in one direction. Just like in the proofs of
the classical De Giorgi's conjecture in dimension 2 (Ghoussoub-Gui) and in
dimension 3 (Ambrosio-Cabr\'{e}), the key step is a Liouville theorem for
linear systems. We also give an extension of a geometric Poincar\'{e}
inequality to systems and use it to establish De Giorgi type results for stable
solutions as well as additional rigidity properties stating that the gradients
of the various components of the solutions must be parallel. We introduce and
exploit the concept of {\it an orientable system}, which seems to be key for
dealing with systems of three or more equations. For such systems, the notion
of a stable solution in a variational sense coincide with the pointwise (or
spectral) concept of stability.

archive that have dynamic tidal distortions and tidally-induced pulsations.
Each has a uniquely shaped light curve that is characterized by periodic
brightening or variability at time scales of 4-20 days, frequently accompanied
by shorter period oscillations. We can explain the dominant features of the
entire class with orbitally-varying tidal forces that occur in close, eccentric
binary systems. The large variety of light curve shapes arises from viewing
systems at different angles. This hypothesis is supported by spectroscopic
radial velocity measurements for five systems, each showing evidence of being
in an eccentric binary system. Prior to the discovery of these 17 new systems,
only four stars, where KOI-54 is the best example, were known to have evidence
of these dynamic tides and tidally-induced oscillations. We perform preliminary
fits to the light curves and radial velocity data, present the overall
properties of this class and discuss the work required to accurately model
these systems.

with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are used to calculate the
susceptibility of a single 2D periodic array of such inclusions, with the whole
3D metamaterial consisting of a stack of such arrays. To calculate the
susceptibility tensor of an isolated inclusion, we have implemented and
compared two different methods: (a) a micromagnetic method, in which we have
employed three different micromagnetic packages: the finite element package
NMAG and the two finite differences packages OOMMF and MicroMagus; and (b) the
modified dynamical matrix method. To illustrate the methodology, we have
calculated the effective permeability of a metamaterial consisting of a stack
of hexagonal arrays of magnetic nanodisks in a non-magnetic matrix. The range
of geometrical parameters for which such a metamaterial is characterized by the
negative permeability has been identified. The critical comparison of the
different micromagnetic packages and the dynamical matrix method (based on the

the same threshold function in the Erdos-Renyi model, and have the same values
in one-dimensional geometric graphs and preferential attachment networks. This
indicates that a variety of purely local diffusion dynamics will be effective
at spreading information in such networks. Although graphs generated according

turbulence (dead zones). We show that such disks can be subject to accretion
driven outbursts, analogous to outbursts previously modeled in the context of
circumstellar disks to explain FU Ori phenomena. Circumplanetary disks around a
proto-Jupiter can undergo outbursts for infall accretion rates onto the disks
in the range ~10^{-9} to 10^{-7} M_sun/yr, typical of accretion rates in the T
Tauri phase. During outbursts, the accretion rate and disk luminosity increases
by several orders of magnitude. Most of the planet mass growth during planetary
gas accretion may occur via disk outbursts involving gas that is considerably
hotter than predicted by steady state models. For low infall accretion rates
less than ~10^{-10} M_sun/yr that occur in late stages of disk accretion, disk
outbursts are unlikely to occur, even if dead zones are present. Such
conditions are favorable for the formation of icy satellites.

nonlinearity power $p$ and the dimension $d$ are such that the scaling index
$s=\frac{d}2-\frac2{p-1}$ is between 0 and 1, thus, the NLS is
mass-supercritical $(s>0)$ and energy-subcritical $(s<1).$
  For solutions with $\ME[u_0]<1$ ($\ME[u_0]$ stands for an invariant and
conserved quantity in terms of the mass and energy of $u_0$), a sharp threshold
for scattering and blowup is given. Namely, if the renormalized gradient $\g_u$
of a solution $u$ to NLS is initially less than 1, i.e., $\g_u(0)<1,$ then the
solution exists globally in time and scatters in $H^1$ (approaches some linear
Schr\""odinger evolution as $t\to\pm\infty$); if the renormalized gradient
$\g_u(0)>1,$ then the solution exhibits a blowup behavior, that is, either a
finite time blowup occurs, or there is a divergence of $H^1$ norm in infinite
time.

decreasing along the RG flow nor positive definite, especially around the
deconfinement/confinement phase transition; (ii) there is no topological

showed maximum tensile stresses were reached on the cup's surfaces near to rim.
The worst case was the cup-head mounted at 30^{\circ}. All simulations and
tests showed bulk zirconia had a greater resistance to shocks than bulk
alumina. The probability of failure could be bigger than 0.9 when a porosity
greater than 0.7% vol. is present in the material. Simulating results showed
good agreement with experimental results. The tests and simulations are

potential well formed by a massive black hole (BH), which is mostly located in
the center of a galaxy. In most existing studies, the BBH systems are treated
as isolated systems, while the effect of the background is ignored. The
validity of the approximation is based on the belief that the background
gravitational field from other sources is extremely weak compared with the
strong gravitational field produced by the BBH itself during the evolution, and
can be neglected in gravitational wave detection. However, it is still
interesting to check how valid this approximation is. In this work, instead of
simulating the three-BH problem with a fully relativistic treatment, we use a
perturbational scheme to investigate the effect of the background gravitational
potential on the evolution of a BBH, especially on the waveform of its
gravitational radiation. Four scenarios are considered including the head-on
collision and the inspiral-to-merger process of a BBH which is either
freefalling towards or circularly orbiting around a third large BH. The head-on
collision and the circular inspiral are two limits of all possible
configurations. The existence of the background gravitational potential changes
the arrival time of the gravitational wavefront of a BH, prolongs the
wavelength, and increases the gravitational radiation energy. And most
interestingly, the background gravitational potential induces the higher-order
modes of the gravitational wave of a BBH. These interesting phenomena can be
explained by the gravitational redshift effect and the change of eccentricity
of a BBH's orbit from the background gravitational potential.

differences occur in connection with the dissipation cutoff scales associated

found to be independent of whether or not there is large-scale dynamo action.
However, large-scale dynamos in homogeneous systems are shown to suffer from

as sources) probes the projected large-scale matter distribution in the
Universe. To improve quality in the 3D mass mapping using 3D-lensing, we
combine the lensing information with the spatial clustering of a population of
galaxies that trace the matter density with a known galaxy bias (defined as
tracers). For our minimum variance estimator, merely all the second-order bias
of the tracers has to be known, which can in principle be self-consistently
constrained in the data by lensing techniques. This synergy introduces a new
noise component because of the stochasticity in the matter-tracer density
relation. We give a description of the stochasticity noise in the Gaussian
regime, and we investigate the estimator characteristics analytically. We apply
the estimator to a mock survey based on the Millennium Simulation. The
estimator linearly mixes the individual lensing mass and tracer number density
maps into a combined smoothed mass map. The weighting in the mix depends on the
S/N of the individual maps and the correlation, $r$, between the matter and
galaxy density. The weight of the tracers can be reduced by hand. For moderate
mixing, the S/N in the mass map improves by a factor $\sim2-3$ for
$r\gtrsim0.4$; the systematic offset between a true and apparent mass peak
distance ($z$-shift bias) in a lensing-only map is eliminated, even for weak
correlations of $r\sim0.4$. If the second-order bias of tracer galaxies can be
determined, the synergy technique potentially provides an option to improve
redshift accuracy and completeness of the lensing 3D mass map. However,the
estimator's performance on sub-degree, non-Gaussian scales depends on all
details in the galaxy bias mechanism and, hence, its accuracy on the choice of
the tracer population.[abridged]

with Brownian dynamics (BD) requires the computation of a large system of
polymer chains coupled to one another through excluded-volume and hydrodynamic
interactions. In the presence of periodic boundary conditions, long-ranged
hydrodynamic interactions are frequently summed with the Ewald summation
technique. By performing detailed simulations that shed light on the influence
of several tuning parameters involved both in the Ewald summation method, and
in the efficient treatment of Brownian forces, we develop a BD algorithm in
which the computational cost scales as O(N^{1.8}), where N is the number of
monomers in the simulation box. We show that Beenakker's original
implementation of the Ewald sum, which is only valid for systems without bead
overlap, can be modified so that \theta-solutions can be simulated by switching
off excluded-volume interactions. A comparison of the predictions of the radius
of gyration, the end-to-end vector, and the self-diffusion coefficient by BD,
at a range of concentrations, with the hybrid Lattice Boltzmann/Molecular
Dynamics (LB/MD) method shows excellent agreement between the two methods. In
contrast to the situation for dilute solutions, the LB/MD method is shown to be
significantly more computationally efficient than the current implementation of
BD for simulating semidilute solutions. We argue however that further

$S(f) : \partial ^2 X \to \mathbb{R}$, the {\it integrated Schwarzian} of $f$,
which measures the deviation of the topological conjugacy from being
flip-equivariant, in particular vanishing if $f$ is Moebius. Conversely if
$X,Y$ are simply connected complete manifolds with pinched negative sectional
curvatures, then $f$ is Moebius on any open set $U \subset \partial X$ such

isometry. For $C^1$ conformal maps $f : \partial X \to \partial Y$ with bounded
integrated Schwarzian and with domain $X$ a simply connected negatively curved
manifold with a lower bound on sectional curvature, similar arguments show that
$f$ extends to a $(1, \log 2 + 12||S(f)||_{\infty})$ quasi-isometry. We also

nearby dwarf galaxies using a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer with the 6-m
telescope of the SAO RAS. Combining the `intensity-velocity dispersion'
diagrams (I-sigma) with two-dimensional maps of radial velocity dispersion we
found a number of common patterns pointing to the relation between the value of
chaotic ionized gas motions and processes of current star formation. In five
out of the seven analysed galaxies we identified expanding shells of ionized
gas with diameters of 80-350 pc and kinematic ages of 1-4 Myr. We also
demonstrate that the I-sigma diagrams may be useful for the search of supernova
remnants, other small expanding shells or unique stars in nearby galaxies. As
an example, a candidate luminous blue variable (LBV) was found in UGC 8508. We
propose some additions to the interpretation, previously used by Munoz-Tunon et
al. to explain the I-sigma diagrams for giant star formation regions. In the
case of dwarf galaxies, a major part of the regions with high velocity
dispersion belongs to the diffuse low surface brightness emission, surrounding
the star forming regions. We attribute this to the presence of perturbed low
density gas with high values of turbulent velocities around the giant HII
regions.

spectrum based on numerical solutions of a shell reduced-MHD model of the
turbulent dynamics inside the sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind. We assign reasonably
realistic profiles to the wind speed and the density along the radial
direction, and a radial magnetic field. Alfv\'en waves of short periodicity
(600 s) are injected at the base of the chromosphere, penetrate into the corona
and are partially reflected, thus triggering a turbulent cascade. The cascade
is strong for the reflected wave while it is weak for the outward propagating
waves. Reflection at the transition region recycles the strong turbulent
spectrum into the outward weak spectrum, which is advected beyond the
Alfv\'enic critical point without substantial evolution. There, the magnetic
field has a perpendicular power-law spectrum with slope close to the Kolmogorov
-5/3. The parallel spectrum is inherited from the frequency spectrum of large
(perpendicular) eddies. The shape is a double power-law with slopes of -1 and
-2 at low and high frequencies respectively, the position of the break
depending on the injected spectrum. We suggest that the double power-law
spectrum measured by Helios at 0.3 AU, where the average magnetic field is not
aligned with the radial (contrary to our assumptions) results from the
combination of such different spectral slopes. At low frequency the parallel
spectrum dominates with its characteristic 1/f shape, while at higher
frequencies its steep spectral slope (-2) is masked by the more energetic
perpendicular spectrum (slope -5/3).

play a major role in tuning the competition between ferrimagnetism and magnetic

YBaFe4-xMxO7, for M = Li (0.30 < x < 0.75) and for M = Zn (0.40 < x < 1.50). It
is seen that for low doping values i.e. x = 0.30 (for Li) and x = 0.40 (for

hexagonal phases, YBaFe4-xMxO7 and CaBaFe4-xMxO7 with M = Li and Zn, it is seen
that in the low doping regime (x ~ 0.3 to 0.5), the competition between
ferrimagnetism and 2 D magnetic frustration is dominated by the average valency
of iron. In contrast, in the high doping regime (x ~ 1.5), the emergence of a
spin glass is controlled by the high degree of cationic disorder, irrespective
of the iron valency.

1-8 {\AA} leads the 0.5-4 {\AA} channel by several seconds. The time lags
between the first and last channels is up to 9 s. We identified at least two
distinct time intervals during the flare impulsive phase, during which the QPPs

hemispheres (Filacchione et al. (2010)), we proceed in this paper to
investigate the radial variability of icy satellites (principal and minor) and
main rings average spectral properties. This analysis is done by using 2,264
disk-integrated observations of the satellites and a 12x700 pixels-wide rings
radial mosaic acquired with a spatial resolution of about 125 km/pixel. The
comparative analysis of these data allows us to retrieve the amount of both
water ice and red contaminant materials distributed across Saturn's system and
the typical surface regolith grain sizes. These measurements highlight very
striking differences in the population here analyzed, which vary from the
almost uncontaminated and water ice-rich surfaces of Enceladus and Calypso to
the metal/organic-rich and red surfaces of Iapetus' leading hemisphere and
Phoebe. Rings spectra appear more red than the icy satellites in the visible
range but show more intense 1.5-2.0 micron band depths. The correlations among
spectral slopes, band depths, visual albedo and phase permit us to cluster the
saturnian population in different spectral classes which are detected not only
among the principal satellites and rings but among co-orbital minor moons as
well. Finally, we have applied Hapke's theory to retrieve the best spectral
fits to Saturn's inner regular satellites using the same methodology applied

child, and NRY from father to son. Therefore, mtDNA reflects female history,
and NRY, male history. To investigate what caused the two-to-one female-male
TMRCA ratio in humans, we develop a forward-looking agent-based model (ABM)
with overlapping generations and individual life cycles. We implement two main
mating systems: polygynandry and polygyny with different degrees in between. In
each mating system, the male population can be either homogeneous or
heterogeneous. In the latter case, some males are `alphas' and others are
`betas', which reflects the extent to which they are favored by female mates. A
heterogeneous male population implies a competition among males with the
purpose of signaling as alphas. The introduction of a heterogeneous male
population is found to reduce by a factor 2 the probability of finding equal
female and male TMRCAs and shifts the distribution of the TMRCA ratio to higher
values. We find that high male-male competition is necessary to reproduce a
TMRCA ratio of 2: less than half the males can be alphas and betas can have at
most half the fitness of alphas. In addition, in the modes that maximize the
probability of having a TMRCA ratio between 1.5 and 2.5, the present generation
has 1.4 times as many female as male ancestors. We also tested the effect of
sex-biased migration and sex-specific death rates and found that these are
unlikely to explain alone the sex-biased TMRCA ratio observed in humans. Our
results support the view that we are descended from males who were successful
in a highly competitive context, while females were facing a much smaller
female-female competition.

Shotgun sequencing is the dominant technique used: many randomly located short
fragments called reads are extracted from the DNA sequence, and these reads are
assembled to reconstruct the original sequence. A basic question is: given a
sequencing technology and the statistics of the DNA sequence, what is the
minimum number of reads required for reliable reconstruction? This number
provides a fundamental limit to the performance of {\em any} assembly
algorithm. For a simple statistical model of the DNA sequence and the read
process, we show that the answer admits a critical phenomena in the asymptotic
limit of long DNA sequences: if the read length is below a threshold,
reconstruction is impossible no matter how many reads are observed, and if the
read length is above the threshold, having enough reads to cover the DNA
sequence is sufficient to reconstruct. The threshold is computed in terms of
the Renyi entropy rate of the DNA sequence. We also study the impact of noise
in the read process on the performance.

to the Erd\H os distance problem, analysing the 3D incidence problem, arising
by considering the action of the Minkowski isometry group $ISO^*(1,1)$.
  The signature of the metric creates an obstacle to applying the Guth/Katz
incidence theorem to the 3D problem at hand, since one may encounter a high
count of congruent line intervals, lying on null lines, or ""light cones"", all
these intervals having zero Minkowski length. In terms of the Guth/Katz
theorem, its condition of the non-existence of ""rich planes"" generally gets
violated. It turns out, however, that one can efficiently identify and discount
incidences, corresponding to null intervals and devise a counting strategy,
where the rich planes condition happens to be just ample enough for the
strategy to succeed.

to explain such asymmetries here we expand our previously developed
perturbative approach to electron-spin scattering to the spin- polarized case
and to the inclusion of out of equilibrium spin populations. In the case of a
magnetic STM tip we demonstrate that the asymmetries are driven by the
non-equilibrium occupation of the various atomic spin-levels, an effect that
reminds closely that electron spin-transfer. In contrast when the tip is not
spin-polarized such non-equilibrium population cannot be build up. In this
circumstance we propose that the asymmetry simply originates from the
transition metal ion density of state, which is included here as a
non-vanishing real component to the spin-scattering self-energy.

ring-shaped temperature-gradient disk models with power-law temperature
distributions. We derived a K-band ring-fit radius of 0.17 \pm 0.01 AU and an
H-band radius of 0.18 \pm 0.01 AU (for a distance of 145 pc). This measured
K-band radius of \sim0.17 AU lies in the range between the dust sublimation
radius of \sim0.13 AU (predicted for a dust sublimation temperature of 1500 K
and gray dust) and the prediction of models including backwarming (\sim0.27
AU). We found that an additional extended halo component is required in both
the geometric and temperature-gradient modeling. In the best temperature-
gradient model, the disk consists of two components. The inner part of the disk
is a thin ring with an inner radius of \sim0.21 AU, a temperature of \sim1600
K, and a ring thickness \sim0.02 AU. The outer part extends from \sim1 AU to
\sim10 AU with an inner temperature of \sim400 K. We find that the disk is
nearly face-on with an inclination angle of < 28 degree. Our
temperature-gradient modeling suggests that the NIR excess is dominated by
emission from a narrow, bright rim located at the dust sublimation radius,
while an extended halo component contributes \sim6% to the total flux at 2
{\mu}m. The MIR model emission has a two-component structure with \sim20% flux
from the inner ring and the rest from the outer part. This two-component
structure suggests a disk gap, which is possibly caused by the shadow of a
puffed-up inner rim.

the electron ground state is essentially confined at the donor. At high fields
the ground state is such that the electron is drawn to the interface, leaving
the donor practically ionized. Valley splitting at the interface occurs due to
the valley-orbit coupling, V_vo^I = |V_vo^I| e^{i theta}. At intermediate

crossings and anti-crossings as the field varies. The degree of level
repulsion, thus the width of the anti-crossing gap, depends on the relative
valley compositions, which vary with |V_vo^I|, theta and the interface-donor
distance. We focus on the valley configurations of the states involved in the
donor-interface tunneling process, given by the anti-crossing of the three

performance of self-calibration when the goal is to produce accurate
photometric catalogs from wide-field imaging surveys. This self-calibration
technique utilizes multiple measurements of sources at different focal-plane
positions to constrain instruments' large-scale response (flat-field) from
survey science data alone. We create an artificial sky of sources and
synthetically observe it under four basic survey strategies, creating an
end-to-end simulation of an imaging survey for each. These catalog-level
simulations include realistic measurement uncertainties and a complex
focal-plane dependence of the instrument response. In the self-calibration
step, we simultaneously fit for all the star fluxes and the parameters of a
position-dependent flat-field. For realism, we deliberately fit with a wrong
noise model and a flat-field functional basis that does not include the model
that generated the synthetic data. We demonstrate that with a favorable survey
strategy, a complex instrument response can be precisely self-calibrated. We
show that returning the same sources to very different focal-plane positions is
the key property of any survey strategy designed for accurate retrospective
calibration of this type. The results of this work suggest the following advice
for those considering the design of large-scale imaging surveys: Do not use a
regular, repeated tiling of the sky; instead return the same sources to very

However, some material is observed in the immediate vicinity of the star. We
investigate how the dust is distributed within and outside the gap, and
constrain the disc geometry with mid-infrared interferometric observations
using VLTI/MIDI. With baseline lengths of 40m, our long baseline observations
are sensitive to the inner few AU from the star, and we combined them with
observations at shorter, 15m baselines, to probe emission beyond the gap at up
to 20AU from the star. We modelled the mid-infrared emission using radial
temperature profiles. Our model is composed of infinitesimal concentric annuli
emitting as black bodies, and it has distinct inner and outer disc components.
We derived an upper limit of 0.7AU for the radial size of the inner disc, from
our longest baseline data. This small dusty disc is separated from the edge of
the outer disc by a large, roughly 10AU wide gap. Our short baseline data place
a bright ring of emission at 11+-1AU, consistent with prior observations of the
transition region between the gap and the outer disc, known as the disc wall.
The inclination and position angle are constrained by our data to i=53+-8deg
and PA=145+-5deg. Compared to the rim and outer disc geometry this suggests
co-planarity. Brightness asymmetry is evident in both short and long baseline
data, and it is unequivocally discernible from any atmospheric or instrumental
effects. The origin of the asymmetry is consistent with the bright disc wall,
which we find to be 1-2AU wide. The gap is cleared of micron-sized dust, but we
cannot rule out the presence of larger particles and/or perturbing bodies.

candles, support the notion that the Cosmos is filled with a mysterious form of
energy, the dark energy. The constraints on cosmological parameters derived
from data of SNe Ia and the measurements of the cosmic microwave background
anisotropies indicate that the dark energy amounts to roughly 70% of all the
energy contained in the Universe. In the hypothesis of a flat Universe, we
investigate if the dark energy is really required in order to explain the SNe
Ia experimental data, and, in this case, how much of such unknown energy is
actually deduced from the analysis of these data and must be introduced in the
LambdaCDM model of cosmology. In particular we are interested in verifying if
the Einstein-de Sitter model of the expanding Universe is really to be ruled
out. By using a fitting procedure based on the Newton method search for a
minimum, we reanalyzed the ""Union compilation"" reported by Kowalski et al.
(2008) formed by 307 SNe, obtaining a very different estimate of the dark
energy, that is roughly 60%. Furthermore, in order to balance the correction of
the apparent magnitude of SNe Ia, due to the dilation or stretching of the
corresponding light curve width, we introduce a suitable modified redsfhit.
Taking into account this correction, we refitted the Union compilation dataset
after a selection cut. The main result that emerges from our analysis is that
the values of Omega_m and Omega_Lambda strongly depend on the fitting procedure
and the selected sample. In particular, the constraint we obtain on the mass
density, normalized by the critical mass density, is Omega_m = 0.7 for a sample
of 252, and Omega_m = 1 for a sample of 242 SNe Ia respectively. The latter
case does not imply the existence of any additional form of dark energy.

statistical modeling. The problems encountered in engineering and social
sciences are commonly characterized by over-abundance of explanatory variables,
non-linearities and unknown interdependencies between the regressors. An added
difficulty is that the analysts may have little or no prior knowledge on the
relative importance of the variables. To provide a robust method for model
selection, this paper introduces the Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for
Variable Selection (MOGA-VS) that provides the user with an optimal set of
regression models for a given data-set. The algorithm considers the regression
problem as a two objective task, and explores the Pareto-optimal (best subset)
models by preferring those models over the other which have less number of
regression coefficients and better goodness of fit. The model exploration can
be performed based on in-sample or generalization error minimization. The model
selection is proposed to be performed in two steps. First, we generate the
frontier of Pareto-optimal regression models by eliminating the dominated
models without any user intervention. Second, a decision making process is
executed which allows the user to choose the most preferred model using
visualisations and simple metrics. The method has been evaluated on a recently
published real dataset on Communities and Crime within United States.

fields of computer science, such as databases, sensor networks, and software
engineering. These systems are able to automatically react to events, by
collecting information from outside and internally generating new events.
However, the collection of data is often hampered by uncertainty and vagueness
that can arise from the imprecision of the monitoring infrastructure,
unreliable data sources, and networks. The decision making mechanism used to
produce a reaction is also imprecise, and cannot be evaluated in a crisp way.
It depends on the evaluation of vague temporal constraints, which are expressed
on the collected data by humans. Despite fuzzy logic has been mainly conceived
as a mathematical abstraction to express vagueness, no attempt has been made to
fuzzify the temporal modalities. Existing fuzzy languages do not allow us to
represent temporal properties, such as ""almost always"" and ""soon"". Indeed, the
semantics of existing fuzzy temporal operators is based on the idea of
replacing classical connectives or propositions with their fuzzy counterparts.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a temporal framework, FTL (Fuzzy-time
Temporal Logic), to express vagueness on time. This framework formally defines
a set of fuzzy temporal modalities, which can be customized by choosing a
specific semantics for the connectives. The semantics of the language is sound,
and the introduced modalities respect a set of expected mutual relations. We
also prove that under the assumption that all events are crisp, FTL reduces to
LTL. Finally, for some of the possible fuzzy interpretations of the
connectives, we identify adequate sets of temporal operators, from which it is
possible to derive all the others.

adapted to the situation of small isospin-asymmetries and used to calculate in

associated with the isovector terms. The two-body interaction comprises of
long-range multi-pion exchange contributions and a set of contact terms
contributing up to fourth power in momenta. In addition, the leading order
chiral three-nucleon interaction is employed with its parameters fixed in
computations of nuclear few-body systems. With this input one finds for the
asymmetry energy of nuclear matter the value $A(\rho_0) \simeq 26.5\,$MeV,
compatible with existing semi-empirical determinations. The strength functions
of the isovector surface and spin-orbit coupling terms come out much smaller
than those of the analogous isoscalar coupling terms and in the relevant

a moving delta-barrier potential. An exact solution based on the time-dependent
Bose-Fermi mapping allows to obtain the particle current, its fluctuations and
the drag force acting on the barrier. The exact solution is analyzed
numerically as well as analytically in the perturbative regime of weak barrier
strength. In the weak barrier limit the stirring drives the system into a state
with net zero current for velocities $v$ smaller than $v_c=\pi\hbar /mL$, with
$m$ the atomic mass and $L$ the ring circumference. At $v$ approaching $v_c$
angular momentum can be transferred to the fluid and a nonzero drag force
arises. The existence of a velocity threshold for current generation indicates
superfluid-like behavior of the mesoscopic Tonks-Girardeau gas, different from
the non-superfluid behavior predicted for Tonks-Girardeau gas in an infinite
tube.

single Fe atom is found to depend strongly on its charge state. We demonstrate
that an applied tip voltage can be used to manipulate the valence and spin
state of single Fe impurities in GaAs. In particular we can induce a transition
from the Fe{3+)- 3d5 - isoelectronic state to the Fe{2+} - 3d6 - ionized
acceptor state with an associated change of the spin moment. Fe atoms sometimes
produce dark anisotropic features in topographic maps, which is consistent with
an interference between different tunneling paths.

transfer of stellar radiation through dusty media. To overcome this problem, we
have implemented an artificial neural network algorithm in the radiative
transfer code GRASIL, in order to significantly speed up the computation of the
infrared SED. The ANN we have implemented is of general use, in that its input
neurons are defined as those quantities effectively determining the shape of
the IR SED. Therefore, the training of the ANN can be performed with any model
and then applied to other models. We made a blind test to check the algorithm,
by applying a net trained with a standard chemical evolution model (i.e.
CHE_EVO) to a mock catalogue extracted from the SAM MORGANA, and compared
galaxy counts and evolution of the luminosity functions in several near-IR to
sub-mm bands, and also the spectral differences for a large subset of randomly
extracted models. The ANN is able to excellently approximate the full
computation, but with a gain in CPU time by $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude. It is
only advisable that the training covers reasonably well the range of values of
the input neurons in the application. Indeed in the sub-mm at high redshift, a
tiny fraction of models with some sensible input neurons out of the range of
the trained net cause wrong answer by the ANN. These are extreme starbursting
models with high optical depths, favorably selected by sub-mm observations, and
difficult to predict a priori.

issued quickly in order to mitigate the hazard. Additionally, there is a need
to represent the uncertainty in the predictions of tsunami characteristics
corresponding to the uncertain trigger features (e.g. either position, shape
and speed of a landslide, or sea floor deformation associated with an
earthquake). Unfortunately, computer models are expensive to run. This leads to
significant delays in predictions and makes the uncertainty quantification
impractical. Statistical emulators run almost instantaneously and may represent
well the outputs of the computer model. In this paper, we use the Outer Product
Emulator to build a fast statistical surrogate of a landslide-generated tsunami
computer model. This Bayesian framework enables us to build the emulator by
combining prior knowledge of the computer model properties with a few carefully
chosen model evaluations. The good performance of the emulator is validated
using the Leave-One-Out method.

These couplings and therefore mode-hopping are minimized near the current

efficient for Computational AeroAcoustics (CAA). In order to handle the issue
of absorbing acoustic boundary conditions for LBS, three kinds of damping terms
are proposed and added into the right hand sides of the governing equations of
LBS. From the classical theory, these terms play an important role to absorb
and minimize the acoustic wave reflections from computational boundaries.
Meanwhile, the corresponding macroscopic equations with the damping terms are
recovered for analyzing the macroscopic behaviors of the these damping terms
and determining the critical absorbing strength. Further, in order to detect
the dissipation and dispersion behaviors, the linearized LBS with the damping
terms is derived and analyzed. The dispersive and dissipative properties are
explored in the wave-number spaces via the Von Neumann analysis. The related
damping strength critical values and the optimal absorbing term are addressed.
Finally, some benchmark problems are implemented to assess the theoretical
results.
