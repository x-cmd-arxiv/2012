XBs observationally appear able to deposit a high fraction of their power
output into their local interstellar medium, which may make them a
non-negligible source of energy input. The formation rate of the most luminous
XBs rises with decreasing metallicity, which should increase their significance
during galaxy formation in the early universe. We also argue that stochastic
effects are important to XB feedback (XBF) and may dominate the systematic
changes due to metallicity in many cases. Large stochastic variation in the
magnitude of XBF at low absolute star formation rates provides a natural reason
for diversity in the evolution of dwarf galaxies which were initially almost
identical, with several percent of such halos experiencing energy input from
XBs roughly two orders of magnitude above the most likely value. These
probability distributions suggest that the effect of XBF is most commonly
significant for total stellar masses between ~10^7 and 10^8 Msun, which might
resolve a current problem with modelling populations of such galaxies. We
explain how XBs might inject energy before luminous supernovae (SNe) contribute
significantly to feedback and how XBs can assist in keeping gas hot long after
the last core-collapse SN has exploded. [...] XBF could be especially important
to some dwarf galaxies, potentially heating gas without expelling it; the
properties of XBF also match those previously derived as allowing episodic star
formation. We also argue that the efficiency of SN feedback (SNF) might be
reduced when XBF has had the opportunity to act first. In addition, we note
that the effect of SNF is unlikely to be scale-free; galaxies smaller than ~100
pc might well experience less effective SNF. (Slightly abbreviated to fit arXiv

that after correction for differential extinction and actively accreting stars,

continuous spread in the ages of pre-main sequence stars in the range ~ 2 to ~
30 Myr within the temporal resolution available. Existing differences among
presently available theoretical models account for the largest possible
variation in shape of the measured age histograms within these limits. We also
find that this isochronal age spread in the near infrared and visible
Colour-Magnitude Diagrams cannot be reproduced by any other presently known
source of astrophysical or instrumental scatter that could mimic the luminosity
spread seen in our observations except, possibly, episodic accretion. The
measured age spread and the stellar spatial distribution in the cluster are
consistent with the hypothesis that star formation started at least 20-30 Myrs
ago progressing slowly but continuously up to at least a few million years ago.
All the stars in the considered mass range are distributed in a flattened
oblate spheroidal pattern with the major axis oriented in an approximate
South-East - North-West direction, and with the length of the equatorial axis
decreasing with increasing age. This asymmetry is most likely due to the fact
that star formation occurred along a filament of gas and dust in the natal
molecular cloud oriented locally in this direction.

for small velocities uniform acceleration takes place, and at a later stage
fluctuations of the potential are encountered, resulting in a regime of
anomalous diffusion. This regime was studied in the framework of the
Fokker-Planck approximation. The diffusion coefficient in velocity was
expressed in terms of the average power spectral density, which is the Fourier
transform of the potential correlation function. This enabled to establish a
scaling form for the Fokker-Planck equation and to compute the large and small
velocity limits of the diffusion coefficient. A classification of the random
potentials into universality classes, characterized by the form of the
diffusion coefficient in the limit of large and small velocity, was performed.
It was shown that one dimensional systems exhibit a large variety of novel

equivalent the standard partial heaps model. In order to define a semantics

one-dimensional single molecule junctions. However, with a physisorbed top
contact, the ""ON"" state with larger conductance is associated with the cis
configuration due to a reduced effective tunneling pathway by switching from
trans to cis, which successfully explains recently experimental measurements of
azobenzene monolayer junctions. A simple model is developed to explain electron
transmission across subsystems in the molecular junction. We also discuss the
effects of monolayer packing density, molecule tilt angle, and contact geometry
on the calculated transmission functions. In particular, we find that a
tip-like contact with chemisorption significantly affects the electric current
through the cis monolayer, leading to highly asymmetric current-voltage
characteristics as well as large negative differential resistance behavior.

traffic has stimulated the deployment of several redundancy elimination
techniques within the network. These techniques are often based on either
packet-level Redundancy Elimination (RE) or Content-Centric Networking (CCN).
However, these techniques cannot exploit sub-packet redundancies. Further,
other alternative techniques such as the end-to-end universal compression
solutions would not perform well either over the Internet traffic, as such
techniques require infinite length traffic to effectively remove redundancy.
This paper proposes a memory-assisted universal compression technique that
holds a significant promise for reducing the amount of traffic in the networks.
The proposed work is based on the observation that if a source is to be
compressed and sent over a network, the associated universal code entails a
substantial overhead in transmission due to finite length traffic. However,
intermediate nodes can learn the source statistics and this can be used to
reduce the cost of describing the source statistics, reducing the transmission
overhead for such traffics. We present two algorithms (statistical and
dictionary-based) for the memory-assisted universal lossless compression of
information sources. These schemes are universal in the sense that they do not
require any prior knowledge of the traffic's statistical distribution. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of both algorithms and characterize the
memorization gain using the real Internet traces. Furthermore, we apply these
compression schemes to Internet-like power-law graphs and solve the routing
problem for compressed flows.

speed up computations. As for \tau_3, our results agree with the original

The finiteness of \tau_3 is not at all an indication of a possible blow-up. (b)
There is a strong indication that the solution of the Euler equation does not
blow up at a time close to \tau_3. In fact, the solution is likely to exist, at

understand coincidences and fine-tuning in the universe. As such, it provides
the possibility of finding another coincidence: if the amount of slow-roll
inflation was only slightly more than the anthropic threshold, then spatial
curvature might be measurable. We study this issue in detail, particularly
focusing on the question: ""If future observations reveal nonzero curvature,
what can we conclude?"" We find that whether an observable signal arises or not
depends crucially on three issues: the cosmic history just before the
observable inflation, the measure adopted to define probabilities, and the
nature of the correlation between the tunneling and slow-roll parts of the
potential. We find that if future measurements find positive curvature at
\Omega_k < -10^-4, then the framework of the eternally inflating multiverse is
excluded with high significance. If the measurements instead reveal negative
curvature at \Omega_k > 10^-4, then we can conclude (1) diffusive (new or
chaotic) eternal inflation did not occur in our immediate past; (2) our
universe was born by a bubble nucleation; (3) the probability measure does not
reward volume increase; and (4) the origin of the observed slow-roll inflation
is an accidental feature of the potential, not due to a theoretical mechanism.
Discovery of \Omega_k > 10^-4 would also give us nontrivial information about
the correlation between tunneling and slow-roll; e.g. a strong correlation
favoring large N would be excluded in certain measures. We also ask whether the
current constraint on \Omega_k is consistent with multiverse expectations,
finding that the answer is yes, except for certain cases. In the course of this
work we were led to consider vacuum decay branching ratios, and found that it
is more likely than one might guess that the decays are dominated by a single
channel.

immigration are studied. The reactant population evolves according to a
branching process whose branching rate is proportional to the total mass of the
catalyst. The bulk catalyst evolution is that of a classical continuous time
branching process; in addition there is a specific form of immigration.
Immigration takes place exactly when the catalyst population falls below a
certain threshold, in which case the population is instantaneously replenished
to the threshold. Such models are motivated by problems in chemical kinetics
where one wants to keep the level of a catalyst above a certain threshold in
order to maintain a desired level of reaction activity. A diffusion limit
theorem for the scaled processes is presented, in which the catalyst limit is
described through a reflected diffusion, while the reactant limit is a
diffusion with coefficients that are functions of both the reactant and the
catalyst. Stochastic averaging principles under fast catalyst dynamics are
established. In the case where the catalyst evolves ""much faster"" than the
reactant, a scaling limit, in which the reactant is described through a one
dimensional SDE with coefficients depending on the invariant distribution of
the reflected diffusion, is obtained. Proofs rely on constrained martingale

superior ability to handle strong correlation in two dimensional spin systems.
The CPS results reaffirm that the ground state energies adhere qualitatively to
the parabolic progression of the rotational band model (RBM), but show
important deviations near 1/3 of the saturation field. These deviations predict
anomalous behavior in the differential magnetization and heat capacity that
cannot be explained by the RBM alone. Finally, we show that these energetic
deviations originate from a qualitative change in the ground state that
resembles a finite size analogue of a phase transition.

then show how in single clock inflation a long wavelength perturbation can be
re-absorbed in the background cosmology and how in computing correlation
functions the integrals of the interaction Hamiltonian are dominated by
conformal times of order of the short wavelength modes, when the long mode is
already outside of the horizon. This allows us to generalize the consistency
condition for N-point functions to the case in which the short wavelength
fluctuations are inside the horizon and derivatives acts on them. We further
discuss the consistency condition in the soft internal squeezed limit in which
in an (N+M)-point function with (N+M) short modes the sum of the first N modes
is a very soft momentum. These results are very useful to study infrared

The antiferromagnetic order was detected from the hysteresis loops below the

in M(H), probably due to the field-induced transition from circular cycloid to
the anharmonic cycloid. At high field limit we observe the field-induced
transition to the homogeneous spin order. From the M(H) dependence we deduce
that above the field Ha the spin cycloid becomes anharmonic which causes
nonlinear magnetization, and above the field Hc the cycloid vanishes and the
system again exhibits linear magnetization M(H). The anomalies in the electric
properties, which are manifested within the 640K-680K range, coincide to the

expected to agree with the perturbative case at large timelike momenta;
however, at low timelike momenta it is not known. In the latter regime, we
parametrize the unknown behavior of the spectral function as a sum of (two)

that adaptive punishment promotes public cooperation either through the
invigoration of spatial reciprocity, the prevention of the emergence of cyclic

density gas. Water masers are found in both high- and low-mass star-forming
regions, acting as a powerful tool to compare magnetic field morphologies in
both mass regimes. In this paper, we show one of the first magnetic field
determinations in the low-mass protostellar core IRAS 16293-2422 at volume
densities as high as 10^(8-10) cm^-3. Our goal is to discern if the collapsing
regime of this source is controlled by magnetic fields or other factors like
turbulence. We used the Very Large Array (VLA) to carry out
spectro-polarimetric observations in the 22 GHz Zeeman emission of H2O masers.
From the Stokes V line profile, we can estimate the magnetic field strength in
the dense regions around the protostar. A blend of at least three maser
features can be inferred from our relatively high spatial resolution data set
(~ 0.1""), which is reproduced in a clear non-Gaussian line profile. The
emission is very stable in polarization fraction and position angle across the
channels. The maser spots are aligned with some components of the complex
outflow configuration of IRAS 16293-2422, and they are excited in zones of
compressed gas produced by shocks. The post-shock particle density is in the
range of 1-3 x 10^9 cm^-3, consistent with typical water masers pumping
densities. Zeeman emission is produced by a very strong line-of-sight magnetic
field (B ~ 113 mG). The magnetic field pressure derived from our data is
comparable to the ram pressure of the outflow dynamics. This indicates that the

masses of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxy in a dark matter only
Constrained Local UniversE Simulation (CLUES). While these mass estimators work
rather well for isolated spherical host systems, we examine here their
applicability to a simulated binary system with a unique satellite population
similar to the observed satellites of MW and M31. We confirm that the
scale-free estimators work also very well in our simulated Local Group galaxies
with the right number of satellites which follow the observed radial
distribution. In the isotropic case and under the assumption that the
satellites are tracking the total gravitating mass, the power-law index of the
radial satellite distribution $N(<r)\propto r^{3-\gamma}$ is directly related
to the host's mass profile $M(<r)\propto r^{1-\alpha}$ as $\alpha=\gamma-2$.
The use of this relation for any given $\gamma$ leads to highly accurate mass
estimations which is a crucial point for observer, since they do not know a
priori the mass profile of the MW and M31 haloes. We discuss possible bias in
the mass estimators and conclude that the scale-free mass estimators can be
satisfactorily applied to the real MW and M31 system.

surrounding elliptical galaxies, groups, and clusters are much shorter than

Cold gas and star formation are observed in central cluster galaxies but at
levels below those expected from an unimpeded cooling flow. X-ray observations
have shown that wholesale cooling is being offset by mechanical heating from
radio active galactic nuclei. Feedback is widely considered to be an important
and perhaps unavoidable consequence of the evolution of galaxies and
supermassive black holes. We show that cooling X-ray atmospheres and the
ensuing star formation and nuclear activity are probably coupled to a
self-regulated feedback loop. While the energetics are now reasonably well
understood, other aspects of feedback are not. We highlight the problems of
atmospheric heating and transport processes, accretion, and nuclear activity,
and we discuss the potential role of black hole spin. We discuss X-ray imagery
showing that the chemical elements produced by central galaxies are being
dispersed on large scales by outflows launched from the vicinity of
supermassive black holes. Finally, we comment on the growing evidence for
mechanical heating of distant cluster atmospheres by radio jets and its
potential consequences for the excess entropy in hot halos and a possible
decline in the number of distant cooling flows.

important tool for studying electroweak symmetry breaking at the quantum level,

sensitive to the Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the quarks, which can be
exchanged as virtual particles in the loop. In the context of the minimal
Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with bulk fields and a brane-localized Higgs sector,
we derive closed analytical expressions for the gluon-gluon fusion process,
finding that the effect of the infinite tower of virtual KK states can be
described in terms of a simple function of the fundamental (5D) Yukawa
matrices. Given a specific RS model, this will allow one to easily constrain
the parameter space, once a Higgs signal has been established. We explain that
discrepancies between existing calculations of Higgs production in RS models
are related to the non-commutativity of two limits: taking the number of KK
states to infinity and removing the regulator on the Higgs-boson profile, which
is required in an intermediate step to make the relevant overlap integrals well
defined. Even though the one-loop gg-->h amplitude is finite in RS scenarios
with a brane-localized Higgs sector, it is important to introduce a consistent

protostars, but spectrally resolved observations have so far been limited in
sensitivity and angular resolution. In this first systematic survey of
spectrally resolved water emission in low-mass protostellar objects, H2O was
observed in the ground-state transition at 557 GHz with HIFI on Herschel in 29
embedded Class 0 and I protostars. Complementary far-IR and sub-mm continuum
data (including PACS data from our program) are used to constrain the spectral
energy distribution of each source. H2O intensities are compared to inferred
envelope and outflow properties and CO 3-2 emission. H2O emission is detected
in all objects except one. The line profiles are complex and consist of several
kinematic components. The profiles are typically dominated by a broad Gaussian
emission feature, indicating that the bulk of the water emission arises in
outflows, not the quiescent envelope. Several sources show multiple shock
components in either emission or absorption, thus constraining the internal
geometry of the system. Furthermore, the components include inverse P-Cygni
profiles in 7 sources (6 Class 0, 1 Class I) indicative of infalling envelopes,
and regular P-Cygni profiles in 4 sources (3 Class I, 1 Class 0) indicative of
expanding envelopes. ""Bullets"" moving at >50 km/s are seen in 4 Class 0
sources; 3 of these are new detections. In the outflow, the H2O/CO abundance
ratio as a function of velocity is nearly the same for all sources, increasing
from 10^-3 at <5 km/s to >10^-1 at >10 km/s. The H2O abundance in the outer
envelope is low, ~10^-10. The different H2O profile components show a clear
evolutionary trend: in the Class 0 sources, emission is dominated by outflow
components originating inside an infalling envelope. When the infall diminishes
during the Class I phase, the outflow weakens and H2O emission disappears.

wireless systems. This paper shows that cooperation has fundamental
limitations. The main result is that even full cooperation between transmitters
cannot in general change an interference-limited network to a noise-limited
network. The key idea is that there exists a spectral efficiency upper bound
that is independent of the transmit power. First, a spectral efficiency upper
bound is established for systems that rely on pilot-assisted channel
estimation; in this framework, cooperation is shown to be possible only within
clusters of limited size, which are subject to out-of-cluster interference
whose power scales with that of the in-cluster signals. Second, an upper bound
is also shown to exist when cooperation is through noncoherent communication;
thus, the spectral efficiency limitation is not a by-product of the reliance on
pilot-assisted channel estimation. Consequently, existing literature that
routinely assumes the high-power spectral efficiency scales with the log of the
transmit power provides only a partial characterization. The complete
characterization proposed in this paper subdivides the high-power regime into a
degrees-of-freedom regime, where the scaling with the log of the transmit power
holds approximately, and a saturation regime, where the spectral efficiency
hits a ceiling that is independent of the power. Using a cellular system as an
example, it is demonstrated that the spectral efficiency saturates at power
levels of operational relevance.

the linear bias model breaks down at quasi-linear scales, the standard
perturbative approach of the nonlinear Eulerian bias model (EBM) is not
accurate enough in describing galaxy clustering. In this paper, we discuss such
a model in the context of resummed perturbation theory, and further generalize
it to incorporate the subsequent gravitational evolution by combining with a
Lagrangian description of galaxies' motion. The multipoint propagators we
constructed for such model also exhibit exponential damping similar to their
dark matter counterparts, therefore the convergence property of statistics
built upon these quantities is improved. This is achieved by applying both
Eulerian and Lagrangian resummation techniques of dark matter field developed
in recent years. As inherited from the Lagrangian description of galaxy density
evolution, our approach automatically incorporates the non-locality induced by
gravitational evolution after the formation of the tracer, and also allows us
to include a continuous galaxy formation history by temporally
weighted-averaging relevant quantities with the galaxy formation rate.

the other hand, electron channeling in crystals can counteract beam divergence
and extend the vortex beam without disrupting its topological charge.
Specifically, in this paper, we report atomic vortex beams with topological
charge \pm1 can be coupled to the 2p columnar bound states and propagate for
more 50 nm without being dispersed and losing its helical phase front. We gave
numerical solutions to the 2p columnar orbitals and tabulated the
characteristic size of the 2p states of two typical elements, Co and Dy, for
various incident beam energies and various atomic densities. The tabulated
numbers allow estimates of the optimal convergence angle for maximal coupling
to 2p columnar orbital. We also have developed analytic formulae for beam
energy, convergence-angle, and hologram dependent scaling for various
characteristic sizes. These length scales are useful for the design of
pitch-fork apertures and operations of microscopes in the vortex-beam imaging
mode.

determination of the existence of periodic orbits of a self-map and more
generally, the structure of the set of periods. Define the minimum period of a
class os self-maps of a fixed set as the minimum of the positive integers such
that each map in the class has a periodic point whose period is at most this
number.
  The problem of the determination of the minimum period of the classes of
homeomorphisms of closed surfaces was completely solved, in successive steps,
from 1910 to 1996. The aim of our work is, for each compact, connected,
orientable surface, determine the minimum period of its class of
homeomorphisms. If the genus of the considered surface is zero or on, then the
problem can be solved by simple techniques. For the case of genus at least two,
we have found two upper bounds for the minimum periods, which can be expressed
as a linear function of the genus and the number of boundary components of the
surface. We give certain sufficient conditions under which these upper bounds
are achieved. In particular, we have proved that the minimum period becomes
constant for each genus, provided that the number of boundary components is
large enough. We have also studied the minimum periods of the classes of
finite-order maps.
  This thesis has three branches which are interconnected. One has to do with
the application of the fixed-point theory. One of the upper bounds of the
minimum periods is a consequence of this theory. To obtain the other upper
bound, we have also applied the Thurston-Nielsen classification of
homeomorphisms of surfaces and some of its consequences. This is the second
branch. Finally, the third branch has to do with the theory of planar
discontinuous group which provide us with the necessary tools for the
construction of examples which prove the existence of lower bounds of the
minimum periods.

networks is key towards understanding the trade-off between complexity and
delay performance of networks that preserve the systematic structure. This
paper studies the case of a relay channel, where the source's objective is to
deliver a given number of data packets to a receiver with the aid of a relay.
The source broadcasts to both the receiver and the relay using one frequency,
while the relay uses another frequency for transmissions to the receiver,
allowing for a full-duplex operation of the relay. We analyze the decoding
complexity and delay performance of two types of relays: one that preserves the
systematic structure of the code from the source; another that does not. A
systematic relay forwards uncoded packets upon reception, but transmits coded
packets to the receiver after receiving the first coded packet from the source.
On the other hand, a non-systematic relay always transmits linear combinations
of previously received packets. We compare the performance of these two
alternatives by analytically characterizing the expected transmission
completion time as well as the number of uncoded packets forwarded by the
relay. Our numerical results show that, for a poor channel between the source
and the receiver, preserving the systematic structure at the relay (i) allows a
significant increase in the number of uncoded packets received by the receiver,
thus reducing the decoding complexity, and (ii) preserves close to optimal
delay performance.

Fermilab. Earlier results from CDF Run-0 (1988--1989), D0 and CDF Run-I
(1992--1995) and D0 results from 1/fb (2002--2006) of Run-II data are now
combined with two new, high statistics Run-II measurements: a CDF measurement
in both electron and muon channels using 2.2/fb of integrated luminosity
collected between 2002 and 2007, and a D0 measurement in the electron channel
using 4.3/fb collected between 2006 and 2009. As in previous combinations, the
results are corrected for inconsistencies in parton distribution functions and
assumptions about electroweak parameters used in the different analyses. The
resulting Tevatron average for the mass of the W boson is Mw = 80387 +- 16 MeV
and a new world average including data from LEP II is Mw = 80385+- 15 MeV.

peak of -18.3 mag (R). Spectra of SN2011hw are unusual compared to normal SN
types, most closely resembling the spectra of SNeIbn. We center our analysis on
comparing SN 2011hw to the well-studied TypeIbn SN2006jc. While the two SNe
have many important similarities, the differences are quite telling: compared
to SN2006jc, SN2011hw has weaker HeI and CaII lines and relatively stronger H
lines, its light curve has a higher luminosity and slower decline rate, and
emission lines associated with the progenitor's CSM are narrower. One can
reproduce the unusual continuum shape of SN2011hw with equal contributions of a
6000K blackbody and a spectrum of SN2006jc. We attribute this emission
component and many other differences between the two SNe to extra opacity from
a small amount of additional H in SN2011hw, analogous to the small H mass that
makes SNeIIb differ from SNeIb. Slower speeds in the CSM and elevated H content
suggest a connection between the progenitor of SN2011hw and the class of
Ofpe/WN9 stars, which have been associated with LBVs in their hot quiescent
phases between outbursts, and are H-poor - but not H-free like classical
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. We conclude that the similarities and differences
between SN2011hw and SN2006jc can be largely understood if their progenitors
exploded at different points in the transitional evolution from an LBV to a WR
star.

characterized through the structure factor, increase in size and intensity as

transition itself. The dense, metastable clusters, which present square
symmetry, also increase their local order in the vicinity of the transition.
This is characterized through the bond-orientational order parameter $Q_4$,
which in Fourier space obeys an Ornstein-Zernike behavior. Depending on filling
density and vertical height, the transition can be of first or second order
type. In the latter case, the associated correlation length $\xi_4$, relaxation

the pair correlation function of $Q_4$, and the amplitude of the order

mass outflows from AGN can reach several times L / c, corresponding to outflow
rates of hundreds of solar masses per year. Radiation pressure on lines alone
may not be sufficient to provide this momentum deposition, and the transfer of
reprocessed IR radiation in dusty nuclear gas has been postulated to provide
the extra enhancement. The efficacy of this mechanism, however, will be
sensitive to multi-dimensional effects such as the tendency for the reprocessed
radiation to preferentially escape along sight-lines of lower column density.
We use Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations to determine the radiation
force on dusty gas residing within approximately 10 parsecs from an accreting
super-massive black hole. We calculate the net rate of momentum deposition in
the surrounding gas and estimate the mass-loss rate in the resulting outflow as
a function of solid angle for different black hole luminosities,
sightline-averaged column densities, clumping parameters, and opening angles of
the dusty gas. We find that these dust-driven winds carry momentum fluxes of
1-5 times L / c and correspond to mass-loss rates of 10-100 solar masses per
year for a 10^8 solar mass black hole radiating at or near its Eddington limit.
These results help to explain the origin of high velocity molecular and atomic
outflows in local ULIRGs, and can inform numerical simulations of galaxy
evolution including AGN feedback.

numbers of observations introduces different degrees of perturbation to the
current model fitted to the data, and the magnitude of Cook's distance is
associated with the degree of the perturbation. The aim of this paper is to
address this issue in general parametric models with complex data structures.
We propose a new quantity for measuring the degree of the perturbation
introduced by deleting a subset. We use stochastic ordering to quantify the
stochastic relationship between the degree of the perturbation and the
magnitude of Cook's distance. We develop several scaled Cook's distances to
resolve the comparison of Cook's distance for different subset deletions.
Theoretical and numerical examples are examined to highlight the broad spectrum
of applications of these scaled Cook's distances in a formal influence
analysis.

the Dark Energy Survey and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, will generate
several GB of data products every few minutes during survey operations. Since
such surveys are designed to operate with minimal observer interaction,
automated real-time analysis of these large images is necessary to ensure
uninterrupted production of science-quality data. We describe a software
infrastructure suite designed to support such surveys, focusing particularly on
ImageHealth, a tool for near-real-time processing of large images. These image
manipulation and analysis algorithms were applied to simulated data from the
Dark Energy Survey, as well as observed data collected by the Y4KCam on the
CTIO 1m telescope and the Mosaic camera on the Blanco telescope. The accuracy
and speed of the ImageHealth code in particular were benchmarked against
results from SourceExtractor, a standard image analysis tool ubiquitous in the
astronomical community. ImageHealth is shown to provide comparable accuracy to
SourceExtractor, but with significantly shorter execution time. Based on the
importance of real-time analysis in reaching the Dark Energy Survey's science
goals, ImageHealth and other aspects of this analysis package were incorporated
(in modified form) into the Survey Image System Process Integration, the Dark
Energy Camera software control environment. The original ImageHealth code,
however, is completely instrument-independent, and is freely available for use
within other observational data-taking environments.

used to solve the equation $Ax=b$ for a symmetric positive definite matrix $A$

parameters (= stepsizes in gradient and conjugate gradient directions) to be
replaced by matrices, so that multiple descent and conjugate directions are
updated simultaneously. Implementation involves the use of multiple agents or
threads and is referred to as cooperative CG (cCG), in which the cooperation
between agents resides in the fact that the calculation of each entry of the
control parameter matrix now involves information that comes from the other
agents. For a sufficiently large dimension $n$, the use of an optimal number of
cores gives the result that the multithread implementation has worst case
complexity $O(n^{2+1/3})$ in exact arithmetic. Numerical experiments, that
illustrate the interest of theoretical results, are carried out on a multicore

physics, materials science and engineering, with the objective of providing
renewable sources of sufficient power to operate targeted low-power
applications. Piezoelectric transducers are often used for vibrational,
inertial and direct movement EH. One problem is that, due to the stiffness of
the most common material (PZT) and typically useful sizes, intrinsic resonant
frequencies are normally high, whereas the available power is often
concentrated at low frequencies. The aim of the plucking technique of frequency
up-conversion, also known as ""pizzicato"" excitation, is to bridge this
frequency gap. In this paper, the technique is modelled analytically. The
analytical model is developed starting from the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations
modified for piezoelectric coupling. A system of differential equations and
associated initial conditions are derived which describe the free vibration of
a piezoelectric bimorph in the last part of the plucking excitation, i.e. after
release. The system permits the calculation of the mechanical response and the
time evolution of the power generated and represents a ready-to-use modelling
tool which will be specially useful for optimisation work.

properties of bar substructures such as dust lanes and nuclear rings. We use
two-dimensional high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to
investigate the effects of magnetic fields on the formation and evolution of
such substructures as well as on the mass inflow rates to the galaxy center.
The gaseous medium is assumed to be infinitesimally-thin, isothermal,
non-self-gravitating, and threaded by initially uniform, azimuthal magnetic
fields. We find that there exists an outermost x1-orbit relative to which
gaseous responses to an imposed stellar bar potential are completely different
between inside and outside. Inside this orbit, gas is shocked into dust lanes
and infalls to form a nuclear ring. Magnetic fields are compressed in dust
lanes, reducing their peak density. Magnetic stress removes further angular
momentum of the gas at the shocks, temporarily causing the dust lanes to bend
into an 'L' shape and eventually leading to a smaller and more centrally
distributed ring than in unmagnetized models. The mass inflow rates in
magnetized models correspondingly become larger, by more than two orders of
magnitude when the initial fields have an equipartition value with thermal
energy, than in the unmagnetized counterparts. Outside the outermost x1-orbit,
on the other hand, an MHD dynamo due to the combined action of the bar
potential and background shear operates near the corotation and bar-end
regions, efficiently amplifying magnetic fields. The amplified fields shape
into trailing magnetic arms with strong fields and low density. The base of the
magnetic arms has a thin layer in which magnetic fields with opposite polarity
reconnect via a tearing-mode instability. This produces numerous magnetic
islands with large density which propagate along the arms to turn the outer
disk into a highly chaotic state.

NMSSM that admits Z_3 discrete symmetries. In the fermiophobic NMSSM, the SUSY
naturalness criteria are relaxed by a factor N_c y_t^4/g^4 \sim 25, removing
the little hierarchy problem and allowing sparticle masses to be naturally of
order 2--3 TeV. This scale motivates wino or higgsino dark matter. The SUSY
flavour and CP problems as well as the constraints on sparticle and Higgs boson
masses from b \to s\gamma, B_s \to \mu\mu\ and direct LHC searches are relaxed
in fermiophobic NMSSM. The price to pay is that a new, yet unknown, mechanism
must be introduced to generate fermion masses. We show that in the fermiophobic
NMSSM the radiative Higgs boson branchings to \gamma\gamma, \gamma Z can be
modified compared to the fermiophobic and ordinary standard model predictions,
and fit present collider data better. Suppression of dark matter scattering off

supersaturation of carbon adatoms. This suggests that graphene islands grow by
the addition of clusters of five atoms rather than by the usual mechanism of
single adatom attachment.
  We have carried out Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations in order to further
investigate the general scenario of epitaxial growth by the attachment of
mobile clusters of atoms. We did not seek to directly replicate the Gr/Ru(0001)
system but instead considered a model involving mobile tetramers of atoms on a
square lattice. Our results show that the energy barrier for tetramer break up
and the number of tetramers that must collide in order to nucleate an immobile
island are the important parameters for determining whether, as in the
Gr/Ru(0001) system, the adatom density at the onset of island nucleation is an
increasing function of temperature. A relatively large energy barrier for
adatom attachment to islands is required in order for our model to produce an
equilibrium adatom density that is a large fraction of the nucleation density.
A large energy barrier for tetramer attachment to islands is also needed for
the island density to dramatically decrease with increasing temperature. We
show that islands grow with a velocity that varies with the fourth power of the
supersaturation of adatoms when tetramer attachment is the dominant process for
island growth.

information propagation in the artificial world are of great significance,
which have activated an upsurge in the studies on networked spreading dynamics.
Lots of efforts have been made to understand the impacts of macroscopic
statistics (e.g., degree distribution and average distance) and mesoscopic
structures (e.g., communities and rich clubs) on spreading processes while the
microscopic elements are less concerned. In particular, roles of ties are not
yet clear to the academic community.
  Methodology/Principle Findings: Every edges is stamped by its strength that
is defined solely based on the local topology. According to a weighted
susceptible-infected-susceptible model, the steady-state infected density and
spreading speed are respectively optimized by adjusting the relationship
between edge's strength and spreading ability. Experiments on six real networks
show that the infected density is increased when strong ties are favored in the
spreading, while the speed is enhanced when weak ties are favored. Significance
of these findings is further demonstrated by comparing with a null model.
  Conclusions/Significance: Experimental results indicate that strong and weak
ties play distinguishable roles in spreading dynamics: the former enlarge the
infected density while the latter fasten the process. The proposed method
provides a quantitative way to reveal the qualitatively different roles of
ties, which could find applications in analyzing many networked dynamical
processes with multiple performance indices, such as synchronizability and
converging time in synchronization and throughput and delivering time in
transportation.

on an interaction (G2) in which all the parameters are obtained by fitting the
finite nuclear data and successfully applied to reproduce a variety of nuclear
properties. Our results show that the higher order couplings play a significant
role at higher densities where kaons dominate the behavior of the equation of
state. We compare our results with other interactions (NLl, NL3, G1, and
FSUGold) and show that the new couplings bring down the mass of a neutron star
(NS), which is further reduced in the presence of kaons to yield results
consistent with the present observational constraints. We show that the
composition of the NS varies with the parameter sets.

traditionally used to describe the hadron multiplicities measured in the
central nucleus-nucleus collisions. In particularly, the role of conservation
laws, the values of hard-core radii along with the effects of the Lorentz
contraction of hadron eigen volumes and the hadronic surface tension are
systematically studied. It is shown that for the adequate description of hadron
multiplicities the conservation laws should be modified, whereas for the
description of hadron yield ratios the conservation laws are not necessary at
all. Also here we analyzed the usual criteria for the chemical freeze-out and
found that none of them is robust. A new chemical freeze-out criterion of
constant entropy per hadron equals to 7.18 is suggested and a novel effect of
adiabatic chemical hadron production is discussed. Additionally, we found that
the data for the center of mass energies above 10 GeV lead to the temperature
of the nil hadronic surface tension coefficient of about $T_0 = 147 \pm 7$ MeV.
This is a very intriguing result since a very close estimate for such a
temperature was obtained recently within entirely different approach. We argue
that these two independently obtained results evidence that the (tri)critical
temperature of the QCD phase diagram is between 140 and 154 MeV. In addition,
here we suggest to consider the pion and kaon hard-core radii as new fitting
parameters. Such an approach for the first time allows us to simultaneously
describe the hadron multiplicities and the Strangeness Horn and get a very high
quality fit of the available experimental data.

which clusters of 5 carbon atoms are an intermediate species necessary for
nucleation and island growth. This model is proposed by experimentally studying
the velocity of growth of islands which is a highly nonlinear function of
adatom concentration. In our simulation we incorporate this intermediate
species and show that it can explain all other experimental observations: the
temperature dependence of the adatom nucleation density, the equilibrium adatom
density and the temperature dependence of the equilibrium island density. All
these processes are described only by the kinematics of the system.

bias-reducing adjusted score equations in \citet{firth:93} are obtained, whose
solution ensures an estimator with smaller asymptotic bias than the maximum
likelihood estimator. Their form suggests a parameter-dependent adjustment of
the multinomial counts, which, in turn suggests the solution of the adjusted
score equations through iterated maximum likelihood fits on adjusted counts,
greatly facilitating implementation. Like the maximum likelihood estimator, the
reduced-bias estimator is found to respect the invariance properties that make
cumulative link models a good choice for the analysis of categorical data. Its
additional finiteness and optimal frequentist properties, along with the
adequate behaviour of related asymptotic inferential procedures make the
reduced-bias estimator attractive as a default choice for practical
applications. Furthermore, the proposed estimator enjoys certain shrinkage
properties that are defensible from an experimental point of view relating to
the nature of ordinal data.
