and extended disks of the spiral galaxies NGC 1512 and NGC 3621, spanning the
range of galactocentric distances 0.2-2 x R25 (from 2-3 kpc to 18-25 kpc). We
find that the excitation properties of nebulae in the outer (R>R25) disks are
similar to those of the inner disks, but on average younger HII regions tend to
be selected in the bright inner disks. Reddening by dust is not negligible in
the outer disks, and subject to significant large-scale spatial variations. For
both galaxies the radial abundance gradient flattens to a constant value
outside of the isophotal radius. The outer disk O/H abundance ratio is highly
homogeneous, with a scatter of only ~0.06 dex. Based on the excitation and
chemical (N/O ratio) analysis we find no compelling evidence for variations in
the upper initial mass function of the ionizing clusters of extended disks. The
O/H abundance in the outer disks of the target galaxies corresponds to 35% of
the solar value (or higher, depending on the metallicity diagnostic). This
conflicts with the notion that metallicities in extended disks of spiral
galaxies are necessarily low. The observed metal enrichment cannot be produced
with the current level of star formation. We discuss the possibility that metal
transport mechanisms from the inner disks lead to metal pollution of the outer
disks. Gas accretion from the intergalactic medium, enriched by outflows,
offers an alternative solution.

the neoclassical tearing mode. A nonlinear drift kinetic theory is employed to
determine the full collision frequency dependence of the neoclassical
polarization current in the small island limit, comparable to the trapped ion
orbit width. Focusing on the region away from the island separatrix (where a
layer with a complex mix of physics processes exists), we evaluate for the
first time the variation of the neoclassical ion polarization current in the
transition regime between the analytically tractable collisionless and

the neoclassical polarization current and its contribution to the island

for each model are presented, with associated errors, and the percentage error
in each model as a function of frequency is derived. These spectral models are
intended as an initial reference for science from the new generation of low
frequency telescopes now coming on line, with particular emphasis on the Low
Frequency Array (LOFAR).

with unprecedentedly high signal-to-noise ratio. These relatively violent flux
variations allow us to very accurately measure the g-band and r-band time

obtain that the two time delays are inconsistent with each other at the 2sigma
level, with the r-band delay exceeding the 417-day delay in the g band by about
3 days. We also studied the long-term evolution of the delay-corrected flux
ratio B/A from our homogeneous two-band monitoring with the Liverpool Robotic

of violent activity, which seems to be correlated with the flux level in these
periods. The presence of the previously reported dense cloud within the cD
lensing galaxy, along the line of sight to the A image, could account for the
observed time delay and flux ratio anomalies.

order, we find that the pairing interaction necessarily becomes
angle-dependent, even if it was isotropic in the paramagnetic phase, which
results in an angular variation of the superconducting gap along the Fermi
surfaces. We find that the gap has no nodes for a small antiferromagnetic order
parameter M, but may develop accidental nodes for intermediate values of M,
when one pair of the reconstructed Fermi surface pockets disappear. For even
larger M, when the other pair of reconstructed Fermi pockets is gapped by
long-range magnetic order, superconductivity still exists, but the
quasiparticle spectrum becomes nodeless again. We also show that the
application of an external magnetic field facilitates the formation of nodes.
We argue that this mechanism for a nodeless-nodal-nodeless transition explains
recent thermal conductivity measurements of hole-doped Ba_{1-x}K_xFe_2As_2.

measurement errors, on the reconstruction of the underlying real-space
clustering and on the apparent degeneracy existing with the geometrical
distortions induced by the cosmology-dependent conversion of redshifts into
distances. We use a suite of mock catalogues extracted from large N-body
simulations, focusing on the analysis of intermediate, mildly non-linear scales
and apply the standard linear dispersion model to fit the anisotropy of the
observed correlation function. We verify that redshift errors up to ~0.2% have
a negligible impact on the precision with which the specific growth rate beta
can be measured. Larger redshift errors introduce a positive systematic error,
which can be alleviated by adopting a Gaussian distribution function of
pairwise velocities. This is, in any case, smaller than the systematic error of
up to 10% due to the limitations of the linear dispersion model, which is
studied in a separate paper. We then show that 50% of the statistical error
budget on beta depends on the deprojection procedure through which the
real-space correlation function is obtained. Finally, we demonstrate that the
degeneracy with geometric distortions can in fact be circumvented. This is
obtained through a modified version of the Alcock-Paczynski test in
redshift-space, which successfully recovers the correct cosmology by searching
for the solution that optimizes the description of dynamical redshift
distortions. For a flat cosmology, we obtain largely independent, robust
constraints on beta and OmegaM. In a volume of 2.4(Gpc/h)^3, the correct OmegaM
is obtained with ~12% error and negligible bias, once the real-space
correlation function is properly reconstructed.

transmission gratings observation of the Be X-ray emitting star HD110432, a
prominent member of the gamma Cas analogs. The Chandra lightcurve shows a high
variability but its analysis fails to detect any coherent periodicity up to a
frequency of 0.05 Hz. The analysis of the Chandra HETG spectrum shows that, to
correctly describe the spectrum, three model components are needed. Two of
those components are optically thin thermal plasmas of different temperatures
(kT~8-9 and 0.2-0.3 keV respectively). Two different models seem to describe
well the third component. One possibility is a third hot optically thin thermal
plasma at kT=16-21 keV with an Fe abundance Z~0.3Zo, definitely smaller than
for the other two thermal components. Alternatively, the third component can be
described by a powerlaw with a photon index Gamma=1.56. In either case, the
Chandra HETG spectrum establishes that each one of these components must be
modified by distinct absorption columns. The analysis of a non contemporaneous
25 ks Suzaku observation shows the presence of a hard tail extending up to at
least 33 keV. The Suzaku spectrum is described with the sum of two components:
an optically thin thermal plasma at kT ~ 9 keV and a very hot second plasma
with kT ~33 keV or, alternatively, a powerlaw with photon index Gamma=1.58. The
analysis of the Si XIII and S XV He like triplets present in the Chandra
spectrum point to a very dense (n_e ~ 10^13 cm^-3) plasma located either close
to the stellar surface (r<3R_*) of the Be star or, alternatively, very close (r
~1.5R_WD) to the surface of a (hypothetical) WD companion. We argue, however,
that the available data supports the first scenario.

high-dimensional data, such as images, videos, text and web documents, DNA
microarray data, and more. Often, high-dimensional data lie close to
low-dimensional structures corresponding to several classes or categories the
data belongs to. In this paper, we propose and study an algorithm, called
Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), to cluster data points that lie in a union of
low-dimensional subspaces. The key idea is that, among infinitely many possible
representations of a data point in terms of other points, a sparse
representation corresponds to selecting a few points from the same subspace.
This motivates solving a sparse optimization program whose solution is used in
a spectral clustering framework to infer the clustering of data into subspaces.
Since solving the sparse optimization program is in general NP-hard, we
consider a convex relaxation and show that, under appropriate conditions on the
arrangement of subspaces and the distribution of data, the proposed
minimization program succeeds in recovering the desired sparse representations.
The proposed algorithm can be solved efficiently and can handle data points
near the intersections of subspaces. Another key advantage of the proposed
algorithm with respect to the state of the art is that it can deal with data
nuisances, such as noise, sparse outlying entries, and missing entries,
directly by incorporating the model of the data into the sparse optimization
program. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through
experiments on synthetic data as well as the two real-world problems of motion
segmentation and face clustering.

in many-body physics. In the solid state, a well-known case is an impurity
coupled to a bosonic bath, for example lattice vibrations. Here the impurity
together with its accompanying lattice distortion form a new entity, a polaron.
This quasiparticle plays an important role in the spectral function of high-Tc
superconductors as well as in colossal-magnetoresistance in manganites. For
impurities in a fermionic bath, the attention so far has been mostly on heavy
or immobile impurities which exhibit Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe and
the Kondo effect. Only recently, mobile impurities have moved into the focus of
research and they have been found to form new quasiparticles, so called Fermi
polarons. The Fermi polaron problem constitutes the extreme, but conceptually
simple, limit of two important quantum many-body problems: the BEC-BCS
crossover with spin-imbalance for attractive interactions and Stoner's
itinerant ferromagnetism for repulsive interactions. It has been proposed that
this and other yet elusive exotic quantum phases might become realizable in
Fermi gases confined to two dimensions. Their stability and observability is
intimately related to the theoretically debated properties of the Fermi polaron
in two dimensional Fermi gas. Here we create and investigate these Fermi
polarons and measure their spectral function using momentum-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. For attractive interactions we find evidence for
the disputed pairing transition between polarons and tightly bound dimers,
which provides insight into the elementary pairing mechanism of imbalanced,
strongly-coupled two-dimensional Fermi gases. Additionally, for repulsive
interactions we study novel quasiparticles, repulsive polarons, whose lifetime
determine the possibility of stabilizing repulsively interacting Fermi systems.

gauge theories without a large number of colors: a sufficiently large charge
density alone can produce a perturbative string ('tHooft) expansion. One
example is simply the well-known NS5/F1 system dual to $AdS_3\times T^4\times
S^3$, here viewed as a 5+1 dimensional theory at finite density. This model is
completely stable, and we find that the existing string-theoretic solution of
this model yields two interesting results. First, it indicates that the shear
viscosity is not corrected by $\alpha'$ effects in this system. For flow
perpendicular to the F1 strings the viscosity to entropy ratio take the usual
value $1/4\pi$, but for flow parallel to the F1's it vanishes as $T^2$ at low
temperature. Secondly, it encodes singularities in correlation functions coming
from low-frequency modes at a finite value of the momentum along the $T^4$
directions. This may provide a strong coupling analogue of finite density
condensed matter systems for which fermionic constituents of larger operators
contribute so-called ""$2k_F$"" singularities. In the NS5/F1 example, stretched
strings on the gravity side play the role of these composite operators. We
explore the analogue for our system of the Luttinger relation between charge
density and the volume bounded by these singular surfaces. This model provides
a clean example where the string-theoretic UV completion of the gravity dual to
a finite density field theory plays a significant and calculable role.

considers differences between simulations with stratified and non-stratified
solar atmospheres, addresses the influence of the driving speed on the plasma
flow and energetics, and provides quantitative formulas for mapping electric
fields and dissipation levels obtained in numerical simulations to the
corresponding solar quantities. The simulations start out from a potential
magnetic field containing a null-point, obtained from a Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) magnetogram extrapolation approximately 8 hours before a
C-class flare was observed. The magnetic field is stressed with a boundary
motion pattern similar to - although simpler than - horizontal motions observed
by SOHO during the period preceding the flare. The general behavior is nearly
independent of the driving speed, and is also very similar in stratified and
non-stratified models, provided only that the boundary motions are slow enough.
The boundary motions cause a build-up of current sheets, mainly in the
fan-plane of the magnetic null-point, but do not result in a flare-like energy
release. The additional free energy required for the flare could have been
partly present in non-potential form in the initial state, with subsequent
additions from magnetic flux emergence or from components of the boundary
motion that were not represented by the idealized driving pattern.

those more concise equivalents. If not, perhaps one or more of the returned
Eureqa results might be a sufficiently accurate approximation that is more

Navier-Stokes equations exist, but in the majority of cases they have been
developed for structured and stationary meshes. In many applications, more
flexible mesh geometries that can dynamically adjust to the problem at hand and
move with the flow in a (quasi) Lagrangian fashion would, however, be highly
desirable, as this can allow a significant reduction of advection errors and an
accurate realization of curved and moving boundary conditions. Here we describe
a novel formulation of viscous continuum hydrodynamics that solves the
equations of motion on a Voronoi mesh created by a set of mesh-generating
points. The points can move in an arbitrary manner, but the most natural motion
is that given by the fluid velocity itself, such that the mesh dynamically
adjusts to the flow. Owing to the mathematical properties of the Voronoi
tessellation, pathological mesh-twisting effects are avoided. Our
implementation considers the full Navier-Stokes equations and has been realized
in the AREPO code both in 2D and 3D. We propose a new approach to compute
accurate viscous fluxes for a dynamic Voronoi mesh, and use this to formulate a
finite volume solver of the Navier-Stokes equations. Through a number of test
problems, including circular Couette flow and flow past a cylindrical obstacle,
we show that our new scheme combines good accuracy with geometric flexibility,
and hence promises to be competitive with other highly refined Eulerian
methods. This will in particular allow astrophysical applications of the AREPO
code where physical viscosity is important, such as in the hot plasma in galaxy
clusters, or for viscous accretion disk models.

to the Milky Way, and they sometimes carry a mass in excess of that of newly
formed stars by up to a factor of ten. Multiple driving processes of such winds
have been proposed, including thermal pressure due to supernova-heating, UV
radiation pressure on dust grains, or cosmic ray (CR) pressure. We here study
wind formation due to CR physics using a numerical model that accounts for CR
acceleration by supernovae, CR thermalization, and advective CR transport. In
addition, we introduce a novel implementation of CR streaming relative to the
rest frame of the gas. We find that CR streaming drives powerful and sustained
winds in galaxies with virial masses M_200 < 10^{11} Msun. In dwarf galaxies
(M_200 ~ 10^9 Msun) the winds reach a mass loading factor of ~5, expel ~60 per
cent of the initial baryonic mass contained inside the halo's virial radius and
suppress the star formation rate by a factor of ~5. In dwarfs, the winds are
spherically symmetric while in larger galaxies the outflows transition to
bi-conical morphologies that are aligned with the disc's angular momentum axis.
We show that damping of Alfven waves excited by streaming CRs provides a means
of heating the outflows to temperatures that scale with the square of the
escape speed. In larger haloes (M_200 > 10^{11} Msun), CR streaming is able to
drive fountain flows that excite turbulence. For halo masses M_200 > 10^{10}
Msun, we predict an observable level of H-alpha and X-ray emission from the
heated halo gas. We conclude that CR-driven winds should be crucial in
suppressing and regulating the first epoch of galaxy formation, expelling a
large fraction of baryons, and - by extension - aid in shaping the faint end of
the galaxy luminosity function. They should then also be responsible for much
of the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium.

in the inferred star formation rates (SFRs) either between data and models, or
between complementary measures of the SFR. These putative discrepancies could
all be alleviated if the stellar IMF is systematically weighted toward more
high-mass star formation in rapidly star-forming galaxies. Here, we explore how
the IMF might vary under the central assumption that the turnover mass in the
IMF, Mc, scales with the Jeans mass in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), M_J. We
employ hydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations of galaxies to predict
how the typical GMC Jeans mass, and hence the IMF, varies with galaxy property.
We then study the impact of such an IMF on the star formation law, the SFR-M*
relation, submillimetre galaxies (SMGs), and the cosmic SFR density. Our main
results are: The H2 mass-weighted Jeans mass in a galaxy scales with the SFR
when the SFR is greater a few M_sun/yr. SPS modeling shows that this results in
a nonlinear relation between SFR and Lbol, such that SFR Lbol^0.88. Using this
model relation, the inferred SFR of local ULIRGs decreases by ~2, and that of
high-z SMGs decreases by ~3-5. At z 2, this results in a lowered normalisation
of the SFR-M* relation in better agreement with models, a reduced discrepancy
between the observed cosmic SFR density and stellar mass density evolution, and
SMG SFRs that are easier to accommodate in current hierarchical structure
formation models. It further results in a Schmidt relation with slope of ~1.6
when utilising a physically motivated form for the CO-H2 conversion factor.
While each of the discrepancies considered here could be alleviated without
appealing to a varying IMF, the modest variation implied by assuming Mc M_J is
a plausible solution that simultaneously addresses numerous thorny issues
regarding the SFRs of high-z galaxies.

matter to a metric that is really a composite of other fields, with the
property that the square-root of its determinant is the integrand of a
topological invariant, and/or a total derivative. This ensures that the vacuum

The reach of an extremal n-dimensional surface anchored on a given region
depends on its dimensionality, the shape and size of the bounding region, as
well as the bulk metric. We argue that for a fixed extent or volume of the
boundary region, spherical regions give rise to the deepest reach of the
corresponding extremal surface. Moreover, for physically sensible spacetimes,
at fixed extent of the boundary region, higher-dimensional surfaces reach
deeper into the bulk. Finally, we show that in a static black hole spacetime,
no extremal surface (of any dimensionality, anchored on any region in the

evaluate the evolution of the Compton thick fraction (f_CT) with z, important
for XRB synthesis models and understanding the accretion history of the

nuclear light, f_scatt known to be dependant on covering factor of the
circumnuclear materal, and use this to aid in our understanding of its

correlated with NH, and as such the most heavily obscured AGN are in fact also
the most geometrically buried. We come to these conclusions from the result
that f_scatt decreases as NH increases and from the prevalence of the torus
model with the smallest opening angle as best fit model in the fits to the most
obscured AGN. We find that a significant fraction of sources (~ 20%) in the

help illuminate the structure, evolution, and basic physical properties of the
outflows. Here we present further results from an ongoing BAL monitoring
campaign of a sample of 24 luminous quasars at redshifts 1.2 < z < 2.9. We
directly compare the variabilities in the CIV 1549 and SiIV 1400 absorption to
try to ascertain the cause(s) of the variability. We find that SiIV BALs are
more likely to vary than CIV BALs. When looking at flow speeds >-20 000 km/s,
47 per cent of quasars exhibited SiIV variability while 31 per cent exhibited
CIV variability. Furthermore, ~50 per cent of the variable SiIV regions did not
have corresponding CIV variability at the same velocities. When both CIV and
SiIV varied, those changes always occurred in the same sense (either getting
weaker or stronger). We also include our full data set so far in this paper,
which includes up to 10 epochs of data per quasar. The multi-epoch data show
that the BAL changes were not generally monotonic across the full ~5 to ~8 yr
time span of our observations, suggesting that the characteristic time-scale
for significant line variations, and (perhaps) for structural changes in the
outflows, is less than a few years. Coordinated variabilities between
absorption regions at different velocities in individual quasars seems to favor
changing ionization of the outflowing gas as the cause of the observed BAL
variability. However, variability in limited portions of broad troughs fits
naturally in a scenario where movements of individual clouds, or substructures
in the flow, across our lines-of-sight cause the absorption to vary. The actual
situation may be a complex mixture of changing ionization and cloud movements.

fast rotators have a marginal blueshift of delta(V-I)=-0.01, corresponding to a

missions will provide spatially resolved measurements of the energy and width
for the brightest emission lines in the intracluster medium (ICM) spectrum. In
this paper we discuss various ways of using these high resolution data to
constrain velocity power spectrum in galaxy clusters. We argue that variations
of these quantities with the projected distance R in cool core clusters contain
important information on the velocity field length scales in the ICM. The
effective length $l_{\rm eff}$ along the line of sight, which provides dominant
contribution to the line flux, increases with R, allowing one to probe the
amplitude of the velocity variations at different spatial scales. In
particular, we show that the width of the line as a function of R is closely
linked to the structure function of the 3D velocity field. Yet another easily
obtainable proxy of the velocity field length scales is the ratio of the
amplitude of the projected velocity field (line energy) variations to the
dispersion of the velocity along the line of sight (line width). Finally the
projected velocity field can be easily converted into 3D velocity field,
especially for clusters like Coma with an extended flat core in the surface
brightness. Under assumption of a homogeneous isotropic Gaussian 3D velocity
field we derived simple expressions relating the power spectrum of the 3D
velocity field (or structure function) and the observables. The uncertainties
in the observables, caused by stochastic nature of the velocity field, are
estimated by making multiple realizations of the random Gaussian velocity field
and evaluating the scatter in observables. If large scale motions are present
in the ICM these uncertainties may dominate the statistical errors of line
width and shift measurements.

constrain the REST FRAME X-ray properties of GRBs from a statistical
perspective, with particular reference to intrinsic time scales and the
energetics of the different light-curve phases in a common rest-frame 0.3-30
keV energy band. Temporal variability episodes are also studied and their
properties constrained. Two fundamental questions drive this effort: i) Does
the X-ray emission retain any kind of ""memory""of the prompt gamma-ray phase?
ii) Where is the dividing line between long and short GRB X-ray properties? We
show that short GRBs decay faster, are less luminous and less energetic than
long GRBs in the X-rays, but are interestingly characterized by similar
intrinsic absorption. We furthermore reveal the existence of a number of
statistically significant relations that link the X-ray to prompt gamma-ray
parameters in long GRBs; short GRBs are outliers of the majority of these
2-parameter relations. However and more importantly, we report on the existence
of a universal 3-parameter scaling that links the X-ray and the gamma-ray
energy to the prompt spectral peak energy of BOTH long and short GRBs:
E_{X,iso}\propto E_{gamma,iso}^{1.00\pm 0.06}/E_{pk}^{0.60\pm 0.10}.

macroscopic cortical dynamics, in which each Potts unit stands for a patch of
cortex, which can be activated in one of S local attractor states. The internal
neuronal dynamics of the patch is not described by the model, rather it is
subsumed into an effective description in terms of graded Potts units, with
adaptation effects both specific to each attractor state and generic to the
patch. If each unit, or patch, receives effective (tensor) connections from C
other units, the network has been shown to be able to store a large number p of
global patterns, or network attractors, each with a fraction a of the units
active, where the critical load p_c scales roughly like p_c ~ (C S^2)/(a
ln(1/a)) (if the patterns are randomly correlated). Interestingly, after
retrieving an externally cued attractor, the network can continue jumping, or
latching, from attractor to attractor, driven by adaptation effects. The
occurrence and duration of latching dynamics is found through simulations to
depend critically on the strength of local attractor states, expressed in the
Potts model by a parameter w. Here we describe with simulations and then
analytically the boundaries between distinct phases of no latching, of
transient and sustained latching, deriving a phase diagram in the plane w-T,

communication among plants, sensors, actuators and controllers occurs in a

important research results have been obtained. These results are in the area of
stability and stabilizability. However, while important, these results must be
complemented in different areas to be able to design effective NCS. In this
paper we approach the control design of NCS using symbolic (finite) models.
Symbolic models are abstract descriptions of continuous systems where one
symbol corresponds to an ""aggregate"" of continuous states. We consider a fairly
general multiple-loop network architecture where plants communicate with
digital controllers through a shared, non-ideal, communication network
characterized by variable sampling and transmission intervals, variable
communication delays, quantization errors, packet losses and limited bandwidth.
We first derive a procedure to obtain symbolic models that are proven to
approximate NCS in the sense of alternating approximate bisimulation. We then
use these symbolic models to design symbolic controllers that realize
specifications expressed in terms of automata on infinite strings. An example
is provided where we address the control design of a pair of nonlinear control
systems sharing a common communication network. The closed-loop NCS obtained is
validated through the OMNeT++ network simulation framework.

represented in the brain by networks of neurons. The link between external
stimulus and neural response can be studied from two parallel points of view.
The first, neural encoding refers to the mapping from stimulus to response, and
primarily focuses on understanding how neurons respond to a wide variety of
stimuli, and on constructing models that accurately describe the
stimulus-response relationship. Neural decoding, on the other hand, refers to
the reverse mapping, from response to stimulus, where the challenge is to
reconstruct a stimulus from the spikes it evokes. Since neuronal response is
stochastic, a one-to-one mapping of stimuli into neural responses does not
exist, causing a mismatch between the two viewpoints of neural coding. Here, we
use these two perspectives to investigate the question of what rate coding is,
in the simple setting of a single stationary stimulus parameter and a single
stationary spike train represented by a renewal process. We show that when rate
codes are defined in terms of encoding, i.e., the stimulus parameter is mapped
onto the mean firing rate, the rate decoder given by spike counts or the sample
mean, does not always efficiently decode the rate codes, but can improve
efficiency in reading certain rate codes, when correlations within a spike
train are taken into account.

specific goal of learning enough about the simulator that a particular feature
of the simulator can be estimated. We focus on identifying the simulator's
global minimum. Utilizing the Bayesian version of the Expected Improvement

effective when the simulator is ill-behaved, exhibiting nonstationarity or
abrupt changes in the response. A number of illustrations of the approach are

  Strings","submitted to ICALP 2012, with strengthened results included",,,,"cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we investigate the problem of building a static data structure
that represents a string s using space close to its compressed size, and allows
fast access to individual characters of s. This type of structures was
investigated by the recent paper of Bille et al. Let n be the size of a
context-free grammar that derives a unique string s of length L. (Note that L
might be exponential in n.) Bille et al. showed a data structure that uses
space O(n) and allows to query for the i-th character of s using running time
O(log L). Their data structure works on a word RAM with a word size of logL
bits. Here we prove that for such data structures, if the space is poly(n),
then the query time must be at least (log L)^{1-\epsilon}/log S where S is the
space used, for any constant eps>0. As a function of n, our lower bound is
\Omega(n^{1/2-\epsilon}). Our proof holds in the cell-probe model with a word
size of log L bits, so in particular it holds in the word RAM model. We show
that no lower bound significantly better than n^{1/2-\epsilon} can be achieved
in the cell-probe model, since there is a data structure in the cell-probe
model that uses O(n) space and achieves O(\sqrt{n log n}) query time. The ""bad""
setting of parameters occurs roughly when L=2^{\sqrt{n}}. We also prove a lower
bound for the case of not-as-compressible strings, where, say,
L=n^{1+\epsilon}. For this case, we prove that if the space is n polylog(n),
then the query time must be at least \Omega(log n/loglog n).
  The proof works by reduction to communication complexity, namely to the LSD
problem, recently employed by Patrascu and others. We prove lower bounds also
for the case of LZ-compression and Burrows-Wheeler (BWT) compression. All of
our lower bounds hold even when the strings are over an alphabet of size 2 and
hold even for randomized data structures with 2-sided error.

when the SQLS is combined with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation
(BAO) measurements or results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP). We also obtain simultaneous constraints on cosmological parameters and
redshift evolution of the galaxy velocity function, finding no evidence for
redshift evolution at z<1 in any combinations of constraints. For instance,
number density evolution quantified as \nu_n=d\ln\phi_*/d\ln(1+z) and the
velocity dispersion evolution \nu_\sigma=d\ln\sigma_*/d\ln(1+z) are constrained
to \nu_n=1.06^{+1.36}_{-1.39}(stat.)^{+0.33}_{-0.64}(syst.) and
\nu_\sigma=-0.05^{+0.19}_{-0.16}(stat.)^{+0.03}_{-0.03}(syst.) respectively
when the SQLS result is combined with BAO and WMAP for flat models with a
cosmological constant. We find that a significant amount of dark energy is
preferred even after fully marginalizing over the galaxy evolution parameters.
Thus the statistics of lensed quasars robustly confirm the accelerated cosmic
expansion.

incorporates the influence of the Zeeman effect, the Rashba spin-orbit
interaction, and inclusively, the role of the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction
on the same footing. Particular attention is spent to the energy spectrum and
Landau levels. Our modeling unveil the strong influence of the Rashba coupling
$\lambda_R $ in the spin-splitting of the electron and hole bands. Graphene
bilayers with weak Rashba spin-orbit interaction show a spin-splitting linear
in momentum and proportional to $\lambda_R $, but scales inversely proportional
to the interlayer hopping energy $\gamma_1$. However, at robust spin-orbit
coupling $\lambda_R $ the energy spectrum shows a strong warping behavior near
the Dirac points. We find the bias-induced gap in bilayer graphene to be
decreasing with increasing Rashba coupling, a behavior resembling a topological
insulator transition. We further predict an unexpected assymetric
spin-splitting and crossings of the Landau levels due to the interplay between
the Rashba interaction and the external bias voltage. Our results are of
relevance for interpreting magnetotransport and infrared cyclotron resonance

for solving combinatorial problems. However, existing infrastructure for
defining search heuristics is often inadequate. Either modeling capabilities
are extremely limited or users are faced with a general-purpose programming
language whose features are not tailored towards writing search heuristics. As
a result, major improvements in performance may remain unexplored.
  This article introduces search combinators, a lightweight and
solver-independent method that bridges the gap between a conceptually simple
modeling language for search (high-level, functional and naturally
compositional) and an efficient implementation (low-level, imperative and
highly non-modular). By allowing the user to define application-tailored search
strategies from a small set of primitives, search combinators effectively
provide a rich domain-specific language (DSL) for modeling search to the user.
Remarkably, this DSL comes at a low implementation cost to the developer of a
constraint solver.
  The article discusses two modular implementation approaches and shows, by
empirical evaluation, that search combinators can be implemented without
overhead compared to a native, direct implementation in a constraint solver.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of routing packets across a multi-hop network
consisting of multiple sources of traffic and wireless links while ensuring
bounded expected delay. Each packet transmission can be overheard by a random
subset of receiver nodes among which the next relay is selected
opportunistically.
  The main challenge in the design of minimum-delay routing policies is
balancing the trade-off between routing the packets along the shortest paths to
the destination and distributing traffic according to the maximum backpressure.
Combining important aspects of shortest path and backpressure routing, this
paper provides a systematic development of a distributed opportunistic routing
policy with congestion diversity ({D-ORCD}).
  {D-ORCD} uses a measure of draining time to opportunistically identify and
route packets along the paths with an expected low overall congestion. {D-ORCD}
is proved to ensure a bounded expected delay for all networks and under any
admissible traffic. Furthermore, this paper proposes a practical implementation
which empirically optimizes critical algorithm parameters and their effects on
delay as well as protocol overhead. Realistic Qualnet simulations for
802.11-based networks demonstrate a significant improvement in the average
delay over comparative solutions in the literature. %Finally, various practical
modifications to {D-ORCD} are proposed and their performance are evaluated.

widely studied and paradigmatic weakly-interacting particle dark matter models:
the lightest neutralino of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard
Model, and the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle of Universal Extra Dimensions
(UED). We argue and show that while the scalar neutralino-nucleon cross section
correlates poorly with the kinetic decoupling temperature, the spin-dependent
cross section exhibits a strong correlation in a wide range of models. In UED
models the correlation is present for both cross sections, and is
extraordinarily tight for the spin-dependent case. A strong correlation is also
found, for both models, for the flux of neutrinos from the Sun, especially for
fluxes large enough to be at potentially detectable levels. We provide analytic
guidance and formulae that illustrate our findings.

infested universe have been applied in a toy model where there is one Lee-Wick
partner to each of the standard model particle and more over the longitudinal
degrees of freedom of the massive partners of the standard massless gauge
bosons are neglected at high temperatures. For practical purposes, the chiral
fermionic sector of Lee-wick theories requires two Lee-Wick partners per
fermion which opens up the possibility for a negative energy density of the
early universe. A toy Lee-Wick model with one fermionic partner relaxes such
oddities and hence easy to deal with. In a similar way, the longitudinal
degrees of freedom of the massive gauge boson partners also have the potential
to yield negative energy densities and thus those will be neglected in a toy
model study. In such a toy model one can analytically calculate the
time-temperature relation in the very early radiation dominated universe which
shows interesting new physics. The article also tries to point out how a
Lee-Wick particle dominated early cosmology transforms into the standard
cosmological model. Based on the results of this toy model analysis a brief
discussion on the more realistic model, which can accommodate two Lee-Wick
partners for each standard fermionic field and the longitudinal degree of
freedom of partners of the gauge fields, is presented. It has been shown that
such an universe is mostly very difficult to attain but there are certain
conditions where one can indeed think of such an universe which can evolve into

investigate static and dynamical properties of the one-dimensional

von Neumann entanglement entropy we determine the central charge and the
transition points for the first two Mott lobes. Our DMRG results for the
ground-state energy, momentum distribution function, boson correlation function
decay, Mott gap, and single particle-spectral function are reproduced very well
by the strong-coupling expansion to fifth order, and by VCA with clusters up to
12 sites as long as the ratio between the hopping amplitude and on-site
repulsion, t/U, is smaller than 0.15 and 0.25, respectively. In addition, in
the superfluid phase VCA captures well the ground-state energy and the sound
velocity of the linear phonon modes. This comparison provides an authoritative
estimate for the range of applicability of these methods. In strong-coupling
theory for the Mott phase, the dynamical structure factor is obtained from the
solution of an effective single-particle problem with an attractive potential.
The resulting resonances show up as double-peak structure close to the
Brillouin zone boundary. These high-energy features also appear in the
superfluid phase which is characterized by a pronounced phonon mode at small
momenta and energies, as predicted by Bogoliubov and field theory. In one
dimension, there are no traces of an amplitude mode in the dynamical
single-particle and two-particle correlation functions.

objective was a comprehensive discussion of the intrinsic reactivity of

removal by Fe0 and a mathematical model. It is showed that due to limitations
of the mass transfer of nano-Fe0 to contaminants, available concepts cannot
explain the success of nano-Fe0 injection for in situ groundwater remediation.
It is recommended to test the possibility of introducing nano-Fe0 to initiate
the formation of roll-fronts which propagation would induce the reductive
transformation of both dissolved and adsorbed contaminants. Within a
roll-front, FeII from nano-Fe0 is the reducing agent for contaminants. FeII is
recycled by biotic or abiotic FeIII reduction. While the roll-front concept
could explain the success of already implemented reaction zones, more research
is needed for a science-based recommendation of nano- Fe0 for subsurface

through Bogoliubov transformations is constructed.
  In Part II the so-called Pauli-Fierz model (PF model) with the dipole
approximation in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics is investigated. This
model describes a minimal interaction between a massless quantized radiation
field and a quantum mechanical particle (electron) governed by Schr\""odinger
operator. By applying the Bogoliubov transformation introduced in Part I we
investigate the spectrum of the PF model. First the translation invariant case
is considered and the dressed electron state with a fixed momentum is studied.
Secondly the absence of ground state is proven by extending the
Birman-Schwinger principle. Finally the enhanced binding of a ground state is
discussed and the transition from unbinding to binding is shown.
  In Part III the so-called $N$-body Nelson model is studied. This model
describes a linear interaction between a scalar field and $N$-body quantum
mechanical particles. First the enhanced binding is shown by checking the
so-called stability condition. Secondly the Nelson model with variable
coefficients is discussed, which model can be derived when the Minkowskian
space-time is replaced by a static Riemannian manifold, and the absence of
ground state is proven, if the variable mass decays to zero sufficiently fast.
The strategy is based on a path measure argument.

retrieve the result by the second author on the existence of the jamming limit.
The present work generalizes this result to a wide class of (almost)
subadditive functions. In particular, classical Euclidean optimization problems
as well as the discrete model for rubber previously studied by Alicandro,
Cicalese, and the first author enter this class of functions. In the case of
rubber elasticity, this yields an approximation result for the continuous
energy density associated with the discrete model at the thermodynamic limit,
as well as a generalization to stochastic networks generated on bounded sets.

blackbody radiation, whose temperature is 2.2 keV and 1.2 keV at MJD 55858.56

temperature, softening, fluence, and radius are typical of superbursts from the
low-mass X-ray binaries. The superburst was followed by an outburst 28 hours
after the superburst onset. The outburst lasted for 5 days and the fluence was
$4.3 \times 10^{42}$ erg. The instability of the accretion disk caused by the
superburst would be an explanation for the outburst, whereas the mass accretion

much higher for intermediate-mass stars than for solar-like stars. Up to now
all known planets of giant stars orbit at relatively far distances from their
host stars. It is not known whether intermediate-mass stars also had many
close-in planets when they were on the main sequence, which were then engulfed
when the star became a giant star. To understand the formation and evolution of
planets it is therefore important to find out whether main-sequence stars of
intermediate-mass have close-in planets or not. A survey for transiting planets
of intermediate-mass stars would be ideal to solve this question, because the
detection of transiting planets is not affected by the rapid rotation of these
stars. As a first step for an efficient survey we need to identify
intermediate-mass stars in the CoRoT-fields, which can then be used as an input
list. To compile the input list we derived the spectral types of essentially
all O, B and A stars down to 14.5 mag in the CoRoT fields IRa01, LRa01, LRa02
taken with the multi-object spectrograph AAOmega. We determined the spectral
types by comparing the spectra with template spectra from a library. In total
we identify 1856 A and B stars that have been observed with CoRoT. Given the
number of planets that have been detected in these fields amongst late-type
stars, we estimate that there are one to four transiting planets of
intermediate-mass stars waiting to be discovered. Our survey not only allows us
to carry out a dedicated planet search programme but is also essential for any
types of studies of the light curves of early-type stars in the CoRoT database.
We also show that it would be possible to extend the survey to all fields that
CoRoT has observed using photometrically determined spectral types.

small, and find that the correlation strength between the fermions increases as
the forth power of the spin-orbit coupling constants. At zero temperature, we
consider the cases in which there are symmetric spin-orbit couplings in two or

entrained into the flow, and the hot gas, which gets shocked in the outflow.

the extra-galactic dark matter annihilation background of at least 20% of that
originating from the Galaxy for an integration angle of 0.1 deg. The number of
clusters scales as a power law with their brightness, suggesting that stacking
may provide a significant improvement over a single target analysis. The mean
angle containing 80% of the dark-matter signal for the sample is ~0.15 deg,
indicating that instruments with this angular resolution or better would be
optimal for a cluster annihilation search based on stacking. A detailed study
based on the Fermi-LAT performance and position-dependent background, suggests
that stacking may result in a factor ~2 improvement in sensitivity, depending
on the source selection criteria. Based on the expected performance of CTA, we
find no improvement with stacking, due to the requirement for pointed
observations. We note that several potentially important targets: Opiuchius,
A2199, A3627 (Norma) and CIZAJ1324.7-5736 may be disfavoured due to a poor

homogenised MCXC meta-catalogue provides a robust ranking of the targets,
although the absolute value of their signal depends on the exact dark matter
substructure content. For conservative assumptions, we find that galaxy
clusters (with or without stacking) can probe <sigma v> down to 1e-25-1e-24

in gamma-rays, despite the large astrophysical background expected from these

Cerenkov telescopes); however, assessing the origin of this signal might be
difficult. We investigate whether the behaviour of the number of objects per
`flux' bin (logN-logF) and that of the stacked signal could be used as a
signature of the dominant process at stake.We use the CLUMPY code to integrate
the signal from decaying or annihilating dark matter and cosmic rays along the
line of sight. We assume the standard NFW profile for the dark matter density
and rely on a parametrised emissivity for the cosmic-ray component. In this
context, the consequences of stacking are explored using the MCXC
meta-catalogue of galaxy clusters. We find the value of the slope of the
logN-logF power law (or the increase of the signal with the number of stacked
objects) to be a clear diagnosis to disentangle decaying dark matter from
cosmic-ray induced gamma-rays. For dark matter annihilation, depending on the
signal boost from the substructures, it is either similar to the cosmic-ray
signal (no boost) or similar to the decay case (large boosts). The shift
between the brightest object and its followers also depends on the signal
origin. For annihilation, this shift and the stacked signal are poorly
constrained because of the large uncertainty affecting the boost. We also
underline that the angular dependence of the annihilation signal is not
universal because of the substructure contribution.

mean field analysis to further validate our scheme, which also demonstrates
that epidemic explosion follows different routes for $\alpha$ larger or less

postulates existence of km-sized solid bodies, called planetesimals, arranged
in a razor-thin disc in the earliest phases of planet formation. In the Tidal
Downsizing hypothesis, an alternative scenario for formation of planets, grain
growth, sedimentation and formation of planetary cores occur inside dense and
massive gas clumps formed in the outer cold disc by gravitational instability.
As a clump migrates inward, tidal forces of the star remove all or most of the
gas from the clump, downsizing it to a planetary mass body. Here we argue that
such a clump may form not only the planetary core but also numerous smaller
bodies. As an example, we consider the simplest case of bodies on circular
orbits around the planetary core in the centre of the gas clump. Bodies smaller
than 1 km suffer a strong enough aerodynamic drag, spiral in and accrete onto
the solid core rapidly; bodies in the planetesimal size range lose their
centrifugal support very slowly. We find that planetesimals orbiting the
protoplanetary core closely remain gravitationally bound to it; these may be
relevant to formation of satellites of giant planets. Planetesimals on more

generation of decoherence when the spin chain is driven across (along) quantum

terms of the driving rate and some of the exponents associated with the quantum
critical points. Our studies show that the scaling of logarithm of decoherence

not satisfy the standard Kibble-Zurek scaling. However, one finds an
interesting deviation when the spin chain is driven along a critical line. Our
analytical predictions are in complete agreement with numerical results. Our
study, though limited to integrable two-level systems, points to the existence
of a universality in the scaling of the decoherence factor which is not

spheres of hot gas at z=1.3 to two fully cosmological dark-matter-only halo
(re)simulations. The gas cools according to an artificial and adjustable
cooling function to form a rotationally supported galaxy. The simulations
evolve in the full cosmological context until z=0. We vary the angular momentum
and density profiles of the initial gas sphere, the cooling time and the
orientation of the angular momentum vector to study the effects on the
evolution of the disk. The final disks show realistic structural and kinematic
properties. The slower the cooling/accretion processes, the higher the
kinematic disk-to-bulge ratio D/B of the resulting system. We find that the
initial orientation of the gas angular momentum with respect to the halo has a
major effect on the resulting D/B. The most stable systems result from
orientations parallel to the halo minor axis, but the sign of the spin can have
a strong effect. Despite the spherical and coherently rotating initial gas
distribution, the orientation of the central disk and of the outer gas
components and the relative angle between the components can all change by more
than 90 degrees over several billion years. Disks can form from initial
conditions oriented parallel to the major axis, but there is often strong
misalignment between inner and outer material. The more the orientation of the
baryonic angular momentum changes during the evolution, the lower the final
D/B. The behaviour varies strongly from halo to halo. Even our simple initial
conditions can lead to strong bars, dominant bulges, massive, misaligned rings

weak magnetic field (B) may prevent the formation of disks and their
fragmentation. However, most previous studies have been limited to cases where
B and the rotation axis of the cloud are aligned. We study the transport of
angular momentum, and its effects on disk formation, for non-aligned initial
configurations and a range magnetic intensities. We perform 3D AMR MHD
simulations of magnetically supercritical collapsing dense cores using the code
Ramses. We compute the contributions of the processes transporting angular
momentum (J), in the envelope and the region of the disk. We clearly define
what could be defined as centrifugally supported disks and study their
properties. At variance with earlier analyses, we show that the transport of J
acts less efficiently in collapsing cores with non-aligned rotation axis and B.
Analytically, this result can be understood by taking into account the bending
of field lines occurring during the gravitational collapse. For the transport
of J, we conclude that magnetic braking in the mean direction of B tends to
dominate over both the gravitational and outflow transport of J. We find that
massive disks, containing at least 10% of the initial core mass, can form
during the earliest stages of star formation even for mass-to-flux ratios as
small as 3 to 5 times the critical value. At higher field intensities, the
early formation of massive disks is prevented. Given the ubiquity of Class I
disks, and because the early formation of massive disks can take place at
moderate magnetic intensities, we speculate that for stronger fields, disks
will form later, when most of the envelope will have been accreted. In
addition, we speculate that some observed early massive disks may actually be
outflow cavities, mistaken for disks by projection effects. (Abridged version

temperature, similar to observations in other transition-metal monoxides and in

variety, to a simple nonabelian gauge theory. It clearly and elegantly explains
hadrons at short distances, which has led to its universal acceptance. Since
its advent, however, many of its long-distance, emergent properties have been
believed to be true, without having been demonstrated to be true. This paper
reviews a variety of results in this regime that have been established with
lattice gauge theory, directly from the QCD Lagrangian. This body of work sheds
light on the origin of hadron masses, its interplay with dynamical symmetry
breaking, as well as on other intriguing features such as the phase structure
of QCD. In addition, nonperturbative QCD is quantitatively important to many
aspects of particle physics (especially the quark flavor sector), nuclear
physics, and astrophysics. This review also surveys some of the most
interesting connections to those subjects.

that gas compression moderates the acceleration rate and perform numerical
simulations within the problem of flame transition to detonation. It is shown
that flame acceleration undergoes three distinctive stages: 1) initial
exponential acceleration in the incompressible regime, 2) moderation of the
acceleration process due to gas compression, so that the exponential
acceleration state goes over to a much slower one, 3) eventual saturation to a
steady (or statistically-steady) high-speed deflagration velocity, which may be
correlated with the Chapman-Jouguet deflagration speed. The possibility of
deflagration-to-detonation transition is demonstrated.

systems, which harvest solar energy for heat and electricity. Typically, a main
focus of a PVT system is to cool the photovoltaic (PV) cells to improve the
electrical performance, however, this causes the thermal component to
under-perform compared to a solar thermal collector. The low temperature
coefficients of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) allow for the PV cells to be
operated at higher temperatures and are a potential candidate for a more
symbiotic PVT system. The fundamental challenge of a-Si:H PV is light-induced
degradation known as the Staebler-Wronski effect (SWE). Fortunately, SWE is
reversible and the a-Si:H PV efficiency can be returned to its initial state if
the cell is annealed. Thus an opportunity exists to deposit a-Si:H directly on
the solar thermal absorber plate where the cells could reach the high
temperatures required for annealing.
  In this study, this opportunity is explored experimentally. First a-Si:H PV
cells were annealed for 1 hour at 100\degreeC on a 12 hour cycle and for the
remaining time the cells were degraded at 50\degreeC in order to simulate
stagnation of a PVT system for 1 hour once a day. It was found that, when
comparing the cells after stabilization at normal 50\degreeC degradation, this
annealing sequence resulted in a 10.6% energy gain when compared to a cell that
was only degraded at 50\degreeC.

radiation-induced magnetoresistance spike obtained in ultraclean
two-dimensional electron systems at low temperatures. The most striking feature
of this spike is that it shows up on the second harmonic of the cyclotron
resonance and with an amplitude that can reach an order of magnitude larger
than the radiation-induced resistance oscillations. We apply the
radiation-driven electron orbits model in the ultraclean scenario. Accordingly,
we calculate the elastic scattering rate (charged impurity) which will define
the unexpected resonance spike position. We also obtain the inelastic
scattering rate (phonon damping), that will be responsible of the large spike
amplitude. We present a microscopical model to explain the dependence of the
Landau level width on the magnetic field for ultraclean samples. We find that
this dependence explains the experimental shift of the resistance oscillations
with respect to the magnetic field found in this kind of samples. We study also
recent results on the influence of an in-plane magnetic field on the spike. We
are able to reconcile the obtained different experimental response of both
spike and resistance oscillations versus an increasing in-plane field. The same
model on the variation of the LL width, allows us to explain such surprising
results based in the increasing disorder in the sample caused by the in-planed
magnetic field. Calculated results are in good agreement with experiments.
These results would be of special interest in nanophotonics; they could lead to
the design of novel ultrasensitive microwave detectors.

favoring a variable Initial Mass Function (IMF), one way or another, either in
time or space. In this chapter we add our two pennies of wisdom, illustrating
how the IMF affects various properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters. We
start by showing that even relatively small variations of the IMF slope have
large effects on the demography of stellar populations, moving the bulk of the
stellar mass from one end to the other of the distribution. We then point out
how the slope of the IMF in different mass ranges controls specific major
properties of galaxies and clusters. The slope of the IMF below ~1 solar mass
controls the M/L ratio of local ellipticals, whereas the slope between ~1 and
~1.4 solar masses controls the evolution with redshift of such ratio, hence of
the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies. Similarly, the slope between ~1
and ~40 solar masses drives the ratio of the global metal mass in clusters of
galaxies to their total luminosity. While we believe that it is perfectly
legitimate to entertain the notion that the IMF may not be universal, our
message is that when proposing IMF variations to ease a specific problem then
one should not neglect to explore the full consequences of the invoked
variations.

Release 7 (SDSS DR7), we measure the tidal environment of galaxies, which we

properties, including color, Dn4000, concentration and size correlate with e,
in addition to depending on 1 + {\delta}. We find that there exists a
transition smoothing scale at which correlations/anti-correlations with e
reverse. This transition scale is well represented by the distance to the 3rd-
nearest-neighbor of a galaxy in a volume limited sample with Mr < -20 which has
a distribution peaked at ~ 2 h-1Mpc. We further demonstrate that this scale
corresponds to that where the correlation between the color of galaxies and
environmental density 1+{\delta} is the strongest. For this optimal smoothing
R0 no additional correlations with e are observed. The apparent dependence on
tidal ellipticity e at other smoothing scales Rs can be viewed as a geometric
effect, arising from the cross correlation be- tween (1+{\delta}o) and e(Rs).
We perform the same analysis on numerical simulations with semi-analytical
modeling (SAM) of galaxy formation. The e dependence of the galaxy properties
shows similar behavior to that in the SDSS, although the color-density cor-
relation is significantly stronger in the SAM. The 'optimal adaptive smoothing
scale' in the SAM is also closely related to the distance to the
3rd-nearest-neighbor of a galaxy, and its characteristic value is consistent
with, albeit slightly smaller than for SDSS.

Packet-routing networks allowing each edge or each node to transmit or receive

  Starting from algorithms for the respective scheduling problem with static
transmission requests, we build distributed stable protocols. This is more
involved than in previous, similar approaches because the algorithms we

can guarantee a throughput that is as large as the one of the original static

asymptotic behaviour of the spectral energy density of the X-ray afterglow of
GRBs is a power-law in time and in frequency where the difference between the
temporal and spectral power-law indexes, $\alpha_X-\beta_X$, is restricted to
the values 0, 1/2 and 1. Here we report the distributions of the values
$\alpha_X$, $\beta_X$ and their difference for a sample of 315 Swift GRBs. This
sample includes all Swift GRBs that were detected before August 1, 2012, whose
X-ray afterglow extended well beyond 1 day and the estimated error in
$\alpha_X-\beta_X$ was $\leq 0.25$. The values of $\alpha_X$ were extracted
from the CB model fits to the entire light curves of their X-ray afterglow
while the spectral index was extracted by the Swift team from the time
integrated X-ray afterglow of these GRBs. We found that the distribution of the
difference $\alpha_X-\beta_X$ for these 315 Swift GRBs has three narrow peaks
around 0, 1/2 and 1 whose widths are consistent with being due to the
measurement errors, in agreement with the CB model prediction.

Moreover, as the viscosity $\varepsilon$ tends to zero, the Navier-Stokes

instability is related to the negative contribution of turbulence to the mean
magnetic pressure that causes the formation of large-scale magnetic structures.
For an isothermal layer, direct numerical simulations and mean-field
simulations of this phenomenon are shown to agree in many details in that their
onset occurs at the same depth. This depth increases with increasing field
strength, such that the maximum growth rate of this instability is independent
of the field strength, provided the magnetic structures are fully contained
within the domain. A linear stability analysis is shown to support this
finding. The instability also leads to a redistribution of turbulent intensity
and gas pressure that could provide direct observational signatures.

micro-mechanical modelling is proposed. Discrete element simulations are used
to investigate capillary induced effects on the friction properties of a
granular assembly in the pendular regime. Capillary forces are described at the
local scale through the Young-Laplace equation and are superimposed to the
standard dry particle interaction usually well simulated through an
elastic-plastic relationship. Both effects of the pressure difference between
liquid and gas phases and of the surface tension at the interface are
integrated into the interaction model. Hydraulic hysteresis is accounted for
based on the possible mechanism of formation and breakage of capillary menisci
at contacts. In order to upscale the interparticular model, triaxial loading
paths are simulated on a granular assembly and the results interpreted through
the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. The micro-mechanical approach is validated with a
capillary cohesion induced at the macroscopic scale. It is shown that
interparticular menisci contribute to the soil resistance by increasing normal
forces at contacts. In addition, more than the capillary pressure level or the
degree of saturation, our findings highlight the importance of the density
number of liquid bonds on the overall behaviour of the material.

evolution by making some changes less likely, and others more likely, depending
on their consequences on ontogeny. Here, we characterize the constraints acting
on genome evolution in vertebrates. We used gene expression data from two
vertebrates: zebrafish, using a microarray experiment spanning 14 stages of
development, and mouse, using EST counts for 26 stages of development. We show
that, in both species, genes expressed early in development (1) have a more
dramatic effect of knock-out or mutation and (2) are more likely to revert to
single copy after whole genome duplication, relative to genes expressed late.
This supports high constraints on early stages of vertebrate development,
making them less open to innovations (gene gain or gene loss). Results are
robust to different sources of data-gene expression from microarrays, ESTs, or
in situ hybridizations; and mutants from directed KO, transgenic insertions,
point mutations, or morpholinos. We determine the pattern of these constraints,
which differs from the model used to describe vertebrate morphological
conservation (""hourglass"" model). While morphological constraints reach a
maximum at mid-development (the ""phylotypic"" stage), genomic constraints appear
to decrease in a monotonous manner over developmental time.

theories that share several analogies in their mathematical apparatus and
physical foundations. In particular, classical statistical mechanics is
hallmarked by the complementarity between two descriptions that are unified in
thermodynamics: (i) the parametrization of the system macrostate in terms of
mechanical macroscopic observables $I=\{I^{i}\}$; and (ii) the dynamical
description that explains the evolution of a system towards the thermodynamic
equilibrium. As expected, such a complementarity is related to the uncertainty
relations of classical statistical mechanics $\Delta I^{i}\Delta \eta_{i}\geq
k$. Here, $k$ is the Boltzmann's constant, $\eta_{i}=\partial
\mathcal{S}(I|\theta)/\partial I^{i}$ are the restituting generalized forces
derived from the entropy $\mathcal{S}(I|\theta)$ of a closed system, which is
found in an equilibrium situation driven by certain control parameters
$\theta=\{\theta^{\alpha}\}$. These arguments constitute the central
ingredients of a reformulation of classical statistical mechanics from the
notion of complementarity. In this new framework, Einstein postulate of
classical fluctuation theory $dp(I|\theta)\sim\exp[\mathcal{S}(I|\theta)/k]dI$
appears as the correspondence principle between classical statistical mechanics
and thermodynamics in the limit $k\rightarrow0$, while the existence of
uncertainty relations can be associated with the non-commuting character of
certain operators.
