interface region between a molecular cloud and an HII-region. Impacting
Far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation creates photon dominated regions (PDRs) on
their surfaces that can be traced by typical cooling lines. With the GREAT
receiver onboard SOFIA we mapped and spectrally resolved the [CII] 158 micron
atomic fine-structure line and the highly excited 12CO J=11-10 molecular line
from three objects in Cygnus X (a pillar, a globule, and a strong IRAS source).
We focus here on the globule and compare our data with existing Spitzer data
and recent Herschel Open-Time PACS data. Extended [CII] emission and more
compact CO-emission was found in the globule. We ascribe this emission mainly
to an internal PDR, created by a possibly embedded star-cluster with at least
one early B-star. However, external PDR emission caused by the excitation by
the Cyg OB2 association cannot be fully excluded. The velocity-resolved [CII]
emission traces the emission of PDR surfaces, possible rotation of the globule,
and high-velocity outflowing gas. The globule shows a velocity shift of ~2 km/s
with respect to the expanding HII-region, which can be understood as the
residual turbulence of the molecular cloud from which the globule arose. This
scenario is compatible with recent numerical simulations that emphazise the
effect of turbulence. It is remarkable that an isolated globule shows these
strong dynamical features traced by the [CII]-line, but it demands more
observational studies to verify if there is indeed an embedded cluster of
B-stars.

of genus $g \geq 2$ has at most $84(g-1)$ conformal automorphisms. If $S$ has
exactly $84(g-1)$ conformal automorphisms, then it is called a Hurwitz curve.
The first two genera for which there are Hurwitz's curves are $g \in \{3,7\}$.
In both situations there is exactly one such curve up to conformal equivalence,
in particular, in both cases the field of moduli is ${\mathbb Q}$. As these two
curves are quasiplatonic curves, they are definable over ${\mathbb Q}$. The
Hurwitz's curve of genus $g=3$ is given by Klein's quartic $x^3y+y^3z+z^3x=0$.
The Hurwitz's curve of genus $g=7$ is known as Fricke-Macbeath's curve and
equations over ${\mathbb Q}(\rho)$, where $\rho=e^{2 \pi i/7}$, are known due
to Macbeath. Unfortunately, explicit equations over ${\mathbb Q}$ are not easy

$W$ is some algebraic curve defined over ${\mathbb Q}$. Unfortunately, the
equations for $W$ are quite long to write down, but everything is explained in

a critical role in improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors

continuous properties of more than two individual particles. Here we
experimentally demonstrate genuine tripartite continuous-variable entanglement

created directly from a single input photon; the creation process leads to
quantum correlations between the colours, or energies, and emission times of
the photons. The entanglement between our three photons is the three-party
generalization of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) [1] correlations for
continuous variables, and allows for new fundamental tests of quantum mechanics
to be carried out. Our scheme can be extended to carry out multi-particle
Franson interferometry [18,19], and opens the possibility of using additional
degrees of freedom in our photons to simultaneously engineer discrete and
continuous-variable hyper-entangled states that could serve as a valuable

Recognizing ongoing MM-attacks is an important security task; modeling
MM-interactions is an interesting task for semantics of computation. Traced
monoidal categories are a natural framework for MM-modelling, as the trace
structure provides a tool to hide what happens *in the middle*. An effective
analysis of what has been traced out seems to require an additional property of
traces, called *normality*. We describe a modest model of network computation,
based on partially ordered multisets (pomsets), where basic network
interactions arise from the monoidal trace structure, and a normal trace
structure arises from an iterative, i.e. coalgebraic structure over terms and
messages used in computation and communication. The correspondence is
established using a convenient monadic description of normally traced monoidal

rotational modulation. The hot and cold spots are located at high latitudes and
about the same phase, but the hot spot is expected to sit at the chromospheric
level, while the cold spot is at the photospheric level. Using the

medium can be represented by a suitable (2,2)-tensor on the 4-manifold N.
Moreover, in each cotangent space on N, the medium defines a Fresnel surface.
Essentially, the Fresnel surface is a tensorial analogue of the dispersion
equation that describes the response of the medium for signals in the geometric
optics limit. For example, in isotropic medium the Fresnel surface is at each
point a Lorentz light cone. In a recent paper, I. Lindell, A. Favaro and L.
Bergamin introduced a condition that constrains the polarisation for plane
waves. In this paper we show (under suitable assumptions) that a slight
strengthening of this condition gives a pointwise characterisation of all
medium tensors for which the Fresnel surface is the union of two distinct
Lorentz null cones. This is for example the behaviour of uniaxial medium like
calcite. Moreover, using the representation formulas from Lindell et al. we
obtain a closed form representation formula that pointwise parameterises all
medium tensors for which the Fresnel surface is the union of two distinct
Lorentz null cones. Both the characterisation and the representation formula
are tensorial and do not depend on local coordinates.

anti-ferromagnet (LAF) order parameter in fully gapped BLG gets projected onto
the spin easy plane, and simultaneously a ferromagnet order, which can further
be enhanced by exchange interaction, develops in the direction of the magnetic
field. The activation gap for the $\nu=0$ Hall state then displays a crossover
from quadratic to linear scaling with the magnetic field, as it gets stronger,
and I obtain excellent agreement with a number of recent experiments with
realistic strengths for the ferromagnetic interaction. A component of the LAF
order, parallel to the external magnetic field, gives birth to additional
incompressible Hall states at filling $\nu=\pm 2$, whereas the remote hopping
in BLG yields $\nu=\pm 1$ Hall states. Evolution of the LAF order in tilted

multiple star systems in the Taurus-Auriga young cluster. Combined with
previous measurements, these new data permit a comprehensive look at how
millimeter luminosity (a tracer of disk mass) relates to the separation and
mass of a stellar companion. Approximately one third (28-37%) of individual
stars in multiples have detectable millimeter emission, a rate half that for
single stars (~62%). There is a strong correlation between the luminosity and
projected separation (a_p) of a stellar pair. Wide pairs (a_p > 300 AU) have a
similar luminosity distribution as single stars, medium pairs (a_p ~ 30-300 AU)
are a factor of 5 fainter, and close pairs (a_p < 30 AU) are ~ 5 times fainter
yet (aside from a small population of bright circumbinary disks). In most
cases, the emission is dominated by a disk around the primary (or a wide
tertiary in triples), but there is no clear relationship between luminosity and
stellar mass ratio. A direct comparison of resolved disk sizes with predictions
from tidal truncation models yields mixed results; some disks are larger than
expected given their companion separations. We suggest that the presence of a
stellar companion impacts disk properties at a level comparable to the internal
evolution mechanisms operating in isolated systems, with both the multiple star
formation process itself and star-disk tidal interactions likely playing
important roles in the evolution of disk material. From the perspective of the
mass content of the disk, we expect that (giant) planet formation is inhibited
around the components of close pairs or secondaries, but should be as likely as
for single stars around the primaries (or wide tertiaries in hierarchical
triples) in more widely-separated multiple star systems.

1995 and a Spherical Shell of gas, with an apocenter distance within the
disk(s) of young stars and a radius of a few times the size of the Compact
Cloud. The former is able to explain the detected signal of G2 in the
position-velocity diagram of the Br gamma emission of the year 2008.5 and
2011.5 data. The latter can account for both, G2's signal as well as the
fainter extended tail-like structure G2t seen at larger distances from the
black hole and smaller velocities. In contrast, gas stripped from a compact
cloud by hydrodynamical interactions is not able to explain the location of the
detected G2t emission in the observed position-velocity diagrams. This favors
the Spherical Shell Scenario and might be a severe problem for the Compact
Cloud as well as the so-called Compact Source Scenario. From these first
idealized simulations we expect a roughly constant feeding of the supermassive
black hole through a nozzle-like structure over a long period, starting shortly
after the closest approach in 2013.51 for the Compact Cloud. If the matter
accretes in the hot accretion mode, we do not expect a significant boost of the
current activity of Sgr A* for the Compact Cloud model, but a boost of the
average infrared and X-ray luminosity by roughly a factor of 80 for the
Spherical Shell scenario with order of magnitude variations on a timescale of a
few months. The near-future evolution of the cloud will be a sensitive probe of

such a graph, provided that it can be constructed correctly, is in fact a
lossless representation of reads. In principle, every analysis based on
whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) data, such as SNP and insertion/deletion
(INDEL) calling, can also be achieved with unitigs.
  Results: To explore the feasibility of using de novo assembly in the context
of resequencing, we developed a de novo assembler, fermi, that assembles
Illumina short reads into unitigs while preserving most of information of the
input reads. SNPs and INDELs can be called by mapping the unitigs against a
reference genome. By applying the method on 35-fold human resequencing data, we
showed that in comparison to the standard pipeline, our approach yields similar
accuracy for SNP calling and better results for INDEL calling. It has higher
sensitivity than other de novo assembly based methods for variant calling. Our
work suggests that variant calling with de novo assembly be a beneficial
complement to the standard variant calling pipeline for whole-genome
resequencing. In the methodological aspects, we proposed FMD-index for
forward-backward extension of DNA sequences, a fast algorithm for finding all
super-maximal exact matches and one-pass construction of unitigs from an
FMD-index.

bispectrum is principally sourced by massive clusters at redshifts around

SZ power spectrum, which receives a significant contribution from less-well
understood low-mass and high-redshift groups and clusters. Therefore, the
amplitude of the bispectrum at l~3000 is less sensitive to astrophysical
uncertainties than the SZ power spectrum. We show that current high resolution
CMB experiments should be able to detect the SZ bispectrum amplitude with high
significance, in part due to the low contamination from extra-galactic

sharpen the measurements of thermal and kinetic SZ components and help

towards the Ring Nebula in Lyra (NGC 6720), one of the best-studied planetary
nebulae, in order to probe its controversial 3-dimensional structure and to
estimate the mass of circumstellar material in this object. We used the
Terahertz receiver GREAT aboard the SOFIA airborne telescope to obtain the
[CII] spectra at eight locations within and outside the bright optical ring of
NGC 6720. Emission was detected at all positions except for the most distant
position along the nebula's minor axis, and generally covers a broad velocity
range, ~50 km/s (FWZI), except at a position along the major axis located just
outside the optical ring, where it is significantly narrower (~25 km/s). The
one narrow spectrum appears to be probing circumstellar material lying outside
the main nebular shell that has not been accelerated by past fast wind episodes
from the central star, and therefore most likely comes from equatorial and/or
low-latitude regions of this bipolar nebula. Along lines-of-sight passing
within about 10 arcsec of the nebular center, the CII column density is a
factor 46 higher than the CO column density. The total mass of gas associated
with the [CII] emission inside a circular region of diameter 87.5 arcsec is at
least 0.11 solar masses. A significant amount of [CII] flux arises from a
photodissociation region immediately outside the bright optical ring, where we
find a CII to CO ratio of 6.5, lower than that seen towards the central region.
Comparing our data with lower-quality CI spectra, which indicate similarly
large CI/CO ratios in NGC 6720, we conclude that the bulk of elemental carbon
in NGC 6720 is divided roughly equally between CII and CI, and that the
emissions from these species are far more robust tracers of circumstellar
material than CO in this object and other evolved planetary nebulae.

by adjusting a single penalty parameter in the nonsmooth regularized utility

involve $b$ quarks, such as single-top, Higgs, and weak vector boson associated
production, can be described in QCD either in a 4-flavor or 5-flavor scheme. In
the former, $b$ quarks appear only in the final state and are typically
considered massive. In 5-flavor schemes, calculations include $b$ quarks in the
initial state, are simpler and allow the resummation of possibly large initial
state logarithms of the type $\log \frac{{\cal Q}^2}{m_b^2}$ into the $b$
parton distribution function (PDF), ${\cal Q}$ being the typical scale of the
hard process. In this work we critically reconsider the rationale for using
5-flavor improved schemes at the LHC. Our motivation stems from the observation
that the effects of initial state logs are rarely very large in hadron
collisions: 4-flavor computations are pertubatively well behaved and a
substantial agreement between predictions in the two schemes is found. We
identify two distinct reasons that explain this behaviour, i.e., the
resummation of the initial state logarithms into the $b$-PDF is relevant only
at large Bjorken $x$ and the possibly large ratios ${\cal Q}^2/m_b^2$'s are
always accompanied by universal phase space suppression factors. Our study
paves the way to using both schemes for the same process so to exploit their
complementary advantages for different observables, such as employing a
5-flavor scheme to accurately predict the total cross section at NNLO and the
corresponding 4-flavor computation at NLO for fully exclusive studies.

output channels with synchronization errors which also suffer from other types
of impairments such as substitutions, erasures, additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) etc. More precisely, we show that if the channel with synchronization
errors can be decomposed into a cascade of two channels where only the first
one suffers from synchronization errors and the second one is a memoryless
channel, a lower bound on the capacity of the original channel in terms of the
capacity of the synchronization error-only channel can be derived. To
accomplish this, we derive lower bounds on the mutual information rate between
the transmitted and received sequences (for the original channel) for an
arbitrary input distribution, and then relate this result to the channel
capacity. The results apply without the knowledge of the exact capacity
achieving input distributions. A primary application of our results is that we
can employ any lower bound derived on the capacity of the first channel
(synchronization error channel in the decomposition) to find lower bounds on
the capacity of the (original) noisy channel with synchronization errors. We
apply the general ideas to several specific classes of channels such as
synchronization error channels with erasures and substitutions, with symmetric
q-ary outputs and with AWGN explicitly, and obtain easy-to-compute bounds. We
illustrate that, with our approach, it is possible to derive tighter capacity
lower bounds compared to the currently available bounds in the literature for
certain classes of channels, e.g., deletion/substitution channels and
deletion/AWGN channels (for certain signal to noise ratio (SNR) ranges).

recently proposed k-means++ initialization algorithm achieves this, obtaining
an initial set of centers that is provably close to the optimum solution. A
major downside of the k-means++ is its inherent sequential nature, which limits
its applicability to massive data: one must make k passes over the data to find
a good initial set of centers. In this work we show how to drastically reduce
the number of passes needed to obtain, in parallel, a good initialization. This
is unlike prevailing efforts on parallelizing k-means that have mostly focused
on the post-initialization phases of k-means. We prove that our proposed
initialization algorithm k-means|| obtains a nearly optimal solution after a
logarithmic number of passes, and then show that in practice a constant number
of passes suffices. Experimental evaluation on real-world large-scale data
demonstrates that k-means|| outperforms k-means++ in both sequential and

effect of query processing. The goal is to achieve the benefits of indexes
while hiding or minimizing the costs of index creation. However,
index-optimizing side effects seem to turn read-only queries into update
transactions that might, for example, create lock contention. This paper
studies concurrency control in the context of adaptive indexing. We show that
the design and implementation of adaptive indexing rigorously separates index
structures from index contents; this relaxes the constraints and requirements
during adaptive indexing compared to those of traditional index updates. Our
design adapts to the fact that an adaptive index is refined continuously, and
exploits any concurrency opportunities in a dynamic way. A detailed
experimental analysis demonstrates that (a) adaptive indexing maintains its
adaptive properties even when running concurrent queries, (b) adaptive indexing
can exploit the opportunity for parallelism due to concurrent queries, (c) the
number of concurrency conflicts and any concurrency administration overheads
follow an adaptive behavior, decreasing as the workload evolves and adapting to
the workload needs.

outflows around voids found in the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS DR7). In particular, we developed a robust <|cos theta|>
statistical test to quantify the strength of redshift-space distortions (RSD)
associated with extended coherent velocity fields. We consistently find that
the vector that joins void centers with galaxies that lie in shells around them
is more likely to be perpendicular to the line-of-sight than parallel to it.
This effect is clear evidence for the existence of outflows in the vicinity of
voids. We show that the RSD exist for a wide range of void radius and shell
thickness, but they are more evident in the largest voids in our sample. For
instance, we find that the <|cos theta|> for galaxies located in shells within
2 h^-1 Mpc from the edge of voids larger than 15 h^-1 Mpc deviates 3.81sigma
from uniformity. The measurements presented in this work provide useful
information to constrain cosmological parameters, in particular Omega_m and

and extensive follow-up observations of the SQLS, which is aimed at
constructing a complete quasar lens sample, our sample of binary quasars is
also expected to be nearly complete within a specified range of angular
separations and redshifts. The measured small-scale correlation function rises
steeply toward smaller scales, which is consistent with earlier studies based
on incomplete or smaller binary quasar samples. We find that the quasar
correlation function can be fitted by a power-law reasonably well over 4 order
of magnitudes, with the best-fit slope of xi(r)\propto r^{-1.92}. We interpret
the measured correlation function within the framework of the Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD). We propose a simple model which assumes a constant fraction
of quasars that appear as satellites in dark matter haloes, and find that
measured small-scale clustering signals constrain the satellite fraction to
f_sat=0.054_{-0.016}^{+0.017} for a singular isothermal sphere number density

clustering signals at the smallest separations of r_p ~ 10 kpc/h unless we
assume very steep number density profiles (such as an NFW profile with the
concentration parameter c_vir > 30), which may be suggestive of enhanced quasar
activities by direct interactions.

that Sn acts as an acceptor and leads to a downshift of the Fermi level. For x

essentially governed by thermally-activated carriers whose activation energy is
95-125 meV, which probably signifies the formation of a Sn-related impurity
band. In addition, the surface conductance directly obtained from the

alternating operating and interruption periods. We also present results
indicating that, due to the presence of interruptions, priority queueing

the mass distribution, but with a sharp cut-off at $\alpha R_{\rm vir}$ where
$R_{\rm vir}$ is the galaxy's virial radius and $\alpha$ is a model parameter.
Our model reproduces the observed dust distribution profile very well over a

characteristic galaxy halo mass of $2\times 10^{12} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ estimated

theory of d-wave high temperature cuprate superconductors under a uniform
magnetic field. At zero temperature, the external magnetic field induces a
mixed state by generating vortices in the condensate of charged holons. The
growing magnetic field suppresses the superfluid density and thus reduces the
gauge field mass which is opened via the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. By
numerically solving the Dyson-Schwinger gap equation, we show that the massless
fermions acquires a dynamical gap through DCSB mechanism when the magnetic
field strength $H$ is above a critical value $H_{c}$ and the fermion flavors
$N$ is below a critical value $N_{c}$. Further, it is found that both $N_{c}$
and the dynamical fermion gap increase as the magnetic field $H$ grows. It is
expected that our result can be tested in phenomena in high temperature cuprate
superconductors.

equations on an infinite domain; therefore, one is interested in the solutions
to such problems for a given initial dataset. A prominent example is the binary
black hole problem within Einstein's theory of gravitation, in which one
computes the gravitational radiation emitted from the inspiral of the two black
holes, merger and ringdown. Powerful mathematical tools can be used to
establish qualitative statements about the solutions, such as their existence,
uniqueness, continuous dependence on the initial data, or their asymptotic
behavior over large time scales. However, one is often interested in computing
the solution itself, and unless the partial differential equation is very
simple, or the initial data possesses a high degree of symmetry, this
computation requires approximation by numerical discretization. When solving
such discrete problems on a machine, one is faced with a finite limit to
computational resources, which leads to the replacement of the infinite
continuum domain with a finite computer grid. This, in turn, leads to a
discrete initial-boundary value problem. The hope is to recover, with high
accuracy, the exact solution in the limit where the grid spacing converges to
zero with the boundary being pushed to infinity.
  The goal of this article is to review some of the theory necessary to
understand the continuum and discrete initial-boundary value problems arising
from hyperbolic partial differential equations and to discuss its applications
to numerical relativity; in particular, we present well-posed initial and
initial-boundary value formulations of Einstein's equations, and we discuss

production of high quality software, it is obligatory for the software
organizations to orient them towards effective defect management. Since, the
time of software evolution, testing is deemed a promising technique of defect
management in all IT industries. This paper provides an empirical investigation
of several projects through a case study comprising of four software companies
having various production capabilities. The aim of this investigation is to
analyze the efficiency of test team during software development process. The
study indicates very low-test efficiency at requirements analysis phase and
even lesser test efficiency at design phase of software development.
Subsequently, the study calls for a strong need to improve testing approaches
using techniques such as dynamic testing of design solutions in lieu of static
testing of design document. Dynamic testing techniques enhance the ability of
detection and elimination of design flaws right at the inception phase and
thereby reduce the cost and time of rework. It further improves productivity,
quality and sustainability of software industry.

after Pioneer 11 mission and gave us the opportunity to search the structure
and the dynamics of this giant magnetosphere above the magnetodisc.
Kivelson(1976) and Kennel & Coroniti(1979) reported that Pioneer 11 observed
energetic particle intensities at high latitudes at the same level with those
measured in the plasma sheet and inferred that they were not consistent with
the magnetodisc model. Ulysses observations supported the idea about a
large-scale layer of energetic ions and electrons in the outer high latitude
Jovian magnetosphere (Cowley et al.1996; Anagnostopoulos et al. 2001). This
study perform a number of further tests for the existence of the large scale
layer of energetic ions in the outer high latitude Jovian magnetosphere by
studying appropriate cross-B field anisotropies in order to monitor the ion
northward/southward intensity gradients. In particular, we examined
Ulysses/HI-SCALE observations of energetic ions with large gyro-radius
(0.5-1.6MeV protons and >2.5MeV heavy(Z>5) ions) in order to compare instant
intensity changes with remote sensing intensity gradients. Our analysis
confirms the existence of an energetic particle layer in the north hemisphere,
during the inbound trajectory of Ulysses traveling at moderate latitudes, and
in the south high-latitude duskside magnetosphere, during the outbound segment
of the spacecraft trajectory. Our Ulysses/HI-SCALE data analysis also provides
evidence for the detection of an energetic proton magnetopause boundary layer
during the outbound trajectory of the spacecraft. During Ulysses flyby of
Jupiter the almost permanent appearance of alternative northward and southward
intensity gradients suggests that the high latitude layer appeared to be a
third major area of energetic particles, which coexisted with the radiation
belts and the magnetodisc.

Swift J1822.3-1606's radio-pulsed and optical emission during outburst, with
the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC),

of P=8.43772016(2) s and a period derivative \dot{P}=8.3(2)x10^{-14} s s^{-1} ,
which entails an inferred dipolar surface magnetic field of B~2.7x10^{13} G at

the flux decreased by about an order of magnitude, with a subtle softening of
the spectrum, both typical of the outburst decay of magnetars. By modeling the
secular thermal evolution of Swift J1822.3-1606, we find that the observed

that the model reproduces different sets of experimental observations,

Taking advantage of the previous Kriging mean and variance calculations helps
avoiding a costly $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ matrix inversion when adding one

update formulae taking into account a single new observation, Emery (2009) also
proposed formulae for the batch-sequential case, i.e. when $r > 1$ new

precisely we prove that the untimed language of an ITA is regular, by building
a finite automaton as a generalized class graph. We then establish that the
reachability problem for ITA is in NEXPTIME and in PTIME when the number of
clocks is fixed. To prove the first result, we define a subclass ITA- of ITA,
and show that (1) any ITA can be reduced to a language-equivalent automaton in
ITA- and (2) the reachability problem in this subclass is in NEXPTIME (without
any class graph). In the next step, we investigate the verification of real
time properties over ITA. We prove that model checking SCL, a fragment of a
timed linear time logic, is undecidable. On the other hand, we give model
checking procedures for two fragments of timed branching time logic. We also
compare the expressive power of classical timed automata and ITA and prove that
the corresponding families of accepted languages are incomparable. The result
also holds for languages accepted by controlled real-time automata (CRTA), that
extend timed automata. We finally combine ITA with CRTA, in a model which
encompasses both classes and show that the reachability problem is still
decidable. Additionally we show that the languages of ITA are neither closed

challenging task. The reason is the following conflict: On the one hand,
computing with rounded arithmetic may question the reliability of programs
while, on the other hand, computing with exact arithmetic may be too expensive
and hence inefficient. One solution is the implementation of controlled
perturbation algorithms which combine the speed of floating-point arithmetic
with a protection mechanism that guarantees reliability, nonetheless.
  This paper is concerned with the performance analysis of controlled
perturbation algorithms in theory. We answer this question with the
presentation of a general analysis tool box. This tool box is separated into
independent components which are presented individually with their interfaces.
This way, the tool box supports alternative approaches for the derivation of
the most crucial bounds. We present three approaches for this task.
Furthermore, we have thoroughly reworked the concept of controlled perturbation
in order to include rational function based predicates into the theory;
polynomial based predicates are included anyway. Even more we introduce
object-preserving perturbations. Moreover, the tool box is designed such that
it reflects the actual behavior of the controlled perturbation algorithm at
hand without any simplifying assumptions.

closest one and therefore an excellent target to study the chemistry in these

  We carried out a 3mm and 1mm spectral survey using the IRAM 30-m telescope
towards three positions that represent different physical environments in Mon
R2: (i) the ionization front (IF) at (0"",0""); two peaks in the molecular cloud
(ii) MP1 at the offset (+15"",-15"") and (iii) MP2 at the farther offset
(0"",40""). In addition, we carried out extensive modeling to explain the
chemical differences between the three observed regions.
  We detected more than thirty different species. We detected SO+ and C4H
suggesting that UV radiation plays an important role in the molecular chemistry
of this region. We detected the typical PDR molecules CN, HCN, HCO, C2H, and
c-C3H2. While the IF and the MP1 have a chemistry similar to that found in high
UV field and dense PDRs like the Orion Bar, the MP2 is more similar to lower
UV/density PDRs like the Horsehead nebula.
  We also detected complex molecules that are not usually found in PDRs (CH3CN,
H2CO, HC3N, CH3OH and CH3C2H). Sulfur compounds CS, HCS+, C2S, H2CS, SO and SO2
and the deuterated species DCN and C2D were also identified. [DCN]/[HCN]=0.03
and [C2D]/[C2H]=0.05, are among the highest in warm regions.
  Our results show that the high UV/dense PDRs present a different chemistry
from that of the low UV case. Abundance ratios like [CO+]/[HCO+] or
[HCO]/[HCO+] are good diagnostics to differentiate between them. In Mon R2 we
have the two classes of PDRs, a high UV PDR towards the IF and the adjacent
molecular bar and a low-UV PDR which extends towards the north-west following
the border of the cloud.

including expanding ionization fronts, stellar winds, or UV-radiation, have
been proposed to trigger subsequent star formation. However, hydrodynamic
models including radiation and gravity show that UV-illumination has little or
no impact on the global dynamical evolution of the cloud. The Rosette molecular
cloud, irradiated by the NGC2244 cluster, is a template region for triggered
star-formation, and we investigated its spatial and density structure by
applying a curvelet analysis, a filament-tracing algorithm (DisPerSE), and
probability density functions (PDFs) on Herschel column density maps, obtained
within the HOBYS key program. The analysis reveals not only the filamentary
structure of the cloud but also that all known infrared clusters except one lie
at junctions of filaments, as predicted by turbulence simulations. The PDFs of
sub-regions in the cloud show systematic differences. The two UV-exposed
regions have a double-peaked PDF we interprete as caused by shock compression.
The deviations of the PDF from the log-normal shape typically associated with
low- and high-mass star-forming regions at Av~3-4m and 8-10m, respectively, are
found here within the very same cloud. This shows that there is no fundamental
difference in the density structure of low- and high-mass star-forming regions.
We conclude that star-formation in Rosette - and probably in high-mass
star-forming clouds in general - is not globally triggered by the impact of
UV-radiation. Moreover, star formation takes place in filaments that arose from
the primordial turbulent structure built up during the formation of the cloud.
Clusters form at filament mergers, but star formation can be locally induced in
the direct interaction zone between an expanding HII--region and the molecular
cloud.

Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) solutions of Einstein's equations
are able to model the large-scale behaviour of the locally inhomogeneous
observable universe. We investigate this problem by considering a range of
exact n-body solutions of Einstein's constraint equations. These solutions
contain discrete masses, and so allow arbitrarily large density contrasts to be
modelled. We restrict our study to regularly arranged distributions of masses
in topological 3-spheres. This has the benefit of allowing straightforward
comparisons to be made with FLRW solutions, as both spacetimes admit a discrete
group of symmetries. It also provides a time-symmetric hypersurface at the
moment of maximum expansion that allows the constraint equations to be solved
exactly. We find that when all the mass in the universe is condensed into a
small number of objects (<10) then the amount of backreaction in dust models
can be large, with O(1) deviations from the predictions of the corresponding
FLRW solutions. When the number of masses is large (>100), however, then our
measures of backreaction become small (<1%). This result does not rely on any
averaging procedures, which are notoriously hard to define uniquely in general
relativity, and so provides (to the best of our knowledge) the first exact and
unambiguous demonstration of backreaction in general relativistic cosmological
modelling. Discrete models such as these can therefore be used as laboratories
to test ideas about backreaction that could be applied in more complicated and
realistic settings.

far-ultraviolet external radiation are investigated. Especially, impact of
photodissociation of hydrogen molecules during collapse is investigated.
Dynamical and thermal evolution of collapsing filamentary clouds are calculated
by solving virial equation and energy equation with taking into accounts
non-equilibrium chemical reactions. It is found that thermal evolution is
hardly affected by the external radiation if the initial density is high ($n_0
> 10^2 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$). On the other hand, if line mass of the filamentary
cloud is moderate and initial density is low ($n_0 \le 10^2 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$),
thermal evolution of the filamentary cloud tends to be adiabatic owing to the
effect of the external dissociation radiation. In this case, collapse of the
filamentary cloud is suppressed and the filamentary cloud fragments into very
massive clouds ($\sim 10^{4-5} M_\odot$) in the early stage of collapse.
Analytic criterion for the filamentary clouds to fragment into such massive
clouds is discussed. We also investigate collapse and fragmentation of the
filamentary clouds with an improved model. This model can partly capture the
effect of run-away collapse. Also in this model, the filamentary clouds with
low initial density ($n_0 \le 10^2 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) fragment into massive
clouds ($\sim 10^4 M_\odot$) owing to the effect of the external radiation.

magnetic moments, which present long-range interactions and are capable of
magnetic ordering, vanish at any experimentally relevant vacancy concentration.
This holds for $\sigma$-bond passivated and un-passivated reconstructed
vacancies, although, for the un-passivated ones, the disappearance of the $\pi$
magnetic moments is accompanied by a very large magnetic susceptibility. Only
for the unlikely case of a full $\sigma$-bond passivation, preventing the
reconstruction of the vacancy, a full value of 1$\mu_B$ for the $\pi$ extended

on hold claims of vacancy-induced ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order in
graphene-based systems, while still leaving the door open to $\sigma$-type

burning corresponds to 32 M_solar. Nucleosynthesis calculations have been
performed during the stellar evolution and the jetlike supernova explosion of a
collapsar model, where the weak s-, p-, and r-processes are taken into account.
We confirm that s-elements of 60 < A < 90 are highly overproduced relative to
the solar abundances in the hydrostatic nucleosynthesis. During oxygen burning,
p-elements of A > 90 are produced via photodisintegrations of seed s-elements.
However, the produced p-elements are disintegrated in later stages except for
^{180}Ta. In the explosive nucleosynthesis, elements of 90 < A < 160 are
significantly overproduced relative to the solar values owing to the r-process.
Only heavy p-elements (N > 50) are overproduced via the p-process. Compared
with the previous study of r-process nucleosynthesis calculations in the
collapsar model of 40 M_solar by Fujimoto et al. 2007, 2008, our jet model
cannot contribute to the third peak of the solar r-elements and intermediate
p-elements. Averaging the overproduction factors over the progenitor masses

contribute to the solar weak s-elements of 60 < A < 90 and neutron-rich

interestingly, we demonstrate in this regime a significant modulation of the

The flux measured from above is f \approx (8\pm3)\times10^-7 cm^-2 s^-1, and
that from below is twice smaller. The difference may be due both to specific

shown that the daemon paradigm enables a quantitative interpretation of DAMA

unambiguously suggest that, in approximately half of cases (when there occur

criterion), the signals being recorded are successively excited by a single

write it as a pre-image of the skeleton; we thus answer a question which was
asked to us by Temkin. Moreover, we prove that the pre-image of the skeleton
'stabilizes after a finite, separable ground field extension', and that if

characterize, and mitigate the impact of sources of systematic uncertainty on
large-scale clustering measurements, both for angular moments of the
redshift-space correlation function and the spherically averaged power
spectrum, P(k), in order to ensure that robust cosmological constraints will be
obtained from these data. A correlation between the projected density of stars
and the higher redshift (0.43 < z < 0.7) galaxy sample (the `CMASS' sample) due
to imaging systematics imparts a systematic error that is larger than the
statistical error of the clustering measurements at scales s > 120h^-1Mpc or k
< 0.01hMpc^-1. We find that these errors can be ameliorated by weighting
galaxies based on their surface brightness and the local stellar density. We
use mock galaxy catalogs that simulate the CMASS selection function to
determine that randomly selecting galaxy redshifts in order to simulate the
radial selection function of a random sample imparts the least systematic error
on correlation function measurements and that this systematic error is
negligible for the spherically averaged correlation function. The methods we
recommend for the calculation of clustering measurements using the CMASS sample
are adopted in companion papers that locate the position of the baryon acoustic
oscillation feature (Anderson et al. 2012), constrain cosmological models using
the full shape of the correlation function (Sanchez et al. 2012), and measure

a universal constant multiple of r\exp(-g(x,r)), where g(x,r) > 0 is an

of mean wiggly continua leads, via the product formula for dimensions, to new
estimates of the Hausdorff dimension for Cantor sets. We prove also that
asymptotically flat sets are of Hausdorff dimension 1 and that asymptotically
non-porous continua are of the maximal dimension. Another application of the
theory is geometric Bowen's dichotomy for Topological Collet-Eckmann maps in
rational dynamics. In particular, mean wiggly continua are dynamically natural

the elementary constituents of a free market; products of a representative good

self-organized system. Based on the idea that the dynamics of an economy is
governed by slow modes, the model suggests that for short time intervals a
fixed ratio of total labour income (capital income) to net income exists
(Cobb-Douglas relation). Explicitly derived is Gibrat's law from an
evolutionary market dynamics of short term fluctuations. The total private
income distribution is shown to consist of four main parts. From capital income
of private firms the income distribution contains a lognormal distribution for
small and a Pareto tail for large incomes. Labour income contributes an
exponential distribution. Also included is the income from a social insurance
system, approximated by a Gaussian peak. The evolutionary model is able to
reproduce the stylized facts of the income distribution, shown by a comparison
with empirical data of a high resolution income distribution. The theory
suggests that in a free market competition between products is ultimately the
origin of the uneven income distribution.

minimal field content with the Standard Model fermions and gauge bosons, but
without a light Higgs particle, we construct the complete Lagrangian through
next-to-leading order, that is, including terms of order $v^2/\Lambda^2$. The
systematics behind this expansion is clarified. Although similar to chiral
perturbation theory, it is not governed by the dimension of operators alone,

15,000 K at the center of the disk. We take the radius of the disk to be 3.8 AU

much bigger than the ISM grains (grain sizes 10$\mu$ to 100$\mu$). The grain
chemistry of the disk is carbonaceous and our models show that silicate and ISM
dust chemistry do not reproduce the slope of the observed SED in the mid-IR to

transfer from the primary which is now a F0Iae post-AGB star. It is not a

larger than 85$^{o}$. We propose from our radiative transfer modeling that the

were analysed using a differential model atmosphere method. Abundances of

average value of 12^C/13^C isotope ratios of Cr 261 is equal to 18 \pm 2 in

a constant mean curvature (CMC) slice and strict positivity of the scalar
field, general relativity conformally coupled to a scalar field can be
quantised on a partially reduced phase space, meaning reduced only with respect
to the Hamiltonian constraint and a proper gauge fixing. More precisely, we
introduce, in close analogy to shape dynamics, the generator of a local
conformal transformation acting on both, the metric and the scalar field, which
coincides with the CMC gauge condition. A new metric, which is invariant under
this transformation, is constructed and used to define connection variables
which can be quantised by standard loop quantum gravity methods. While it is
hard to address dynamical problems in this framework (due to the complicated
'time' function), it seems, due to good accessibility properties of the CMC
gauge, to be well suited for problems such as the computation of black hole
entropy, where actual physical states can be counted and the dynamics is only
of indirect importance. The corresponding calculation yields the surprising
result that the usual prescription of fixing the Barbero-Immirzi parameter beta
to a constant value in order to obtain the well-known formula S = a(Phi) A/(4G)
does not work for the black holes under consideration, while a recently
proposed prescription involving an analytic continuation of beta to the case of
a self-dual space-time connection yields the correct result. Also, the
interpretation of the geometric operators gets an interesting twist, which
exemplifies the deep relationship between observables and the choice of a time
function and has consequences for loop quantum cosmology.

anti-correlation between the time lag, tau_lag, which represents the delay

luminosity, L. In this paper, we use a sample of 43 Swift bursts to investigate
whether this relation depends on redshift. Both the z-correction and the
k-correction are taken into account. Our analysis consists of binning the data
in redshift, z, then applying a fit of the form: log(L) = A +
Blog(tau_lag0/<tau_lag0>) for each bin, where tau_lag0 is the time-lag in the
burst's source frame, and <tau_lag0> is the corresponding mean value for the

evolve in a systematic way with z. Our results indicate that both the
normalization, A, and the slope, B, seem to vary in a systematic way with
redshift. We note that although good best-fits were obtained, with reasonable
values for both the linear regression coefficient, r, and the reduced

the distribution of electrical conductivity in the ground. We consider layered
earth inversion to interpret large data sets of hundreds of kilometre.
Different strategies can be used to solve this inverse problem. This consists
in managing the a priori information to avoid the mathematical instability and
provide the most plausible model of conductivity in depth. In order to obtain
fast and realistic inversion program, we tested three kinds of regularization:
two are based on standard Tikhonov procedure which consist in minimizing not
only the data misfit function but a balanced optimization function with
additional terms constraining the lateral and the vertical smoothness of the
conductivity; another kind of regularization is based on reducing the condition
number of the kernel by changing the layout of layers before minimizing the
data misfit function. Finally, in order to get a more realistic distribution of
conductivity, notably by removing negative conductivity values, we suggest an
additional recursive filter based upon the inversion of the logarithm of the
conductivity. All these methods are tested on synthetic and real data sets.
Synthetic data have been calculated by 2.5D modelling; they are used to
demonstrate that these methods provide equivalent quality in terms of data
misfit and accuracy of the resulting image; the limit essentially comes on
special targets with sharp 2D geometries. The real data case is from
Helicopter-borne TEM data acquired in the basin of Franceville (Gabon) where
borehole conductivity loggings are used to show the good accuracy of the
inverted models in most areas, and some biased depths in areas where strong
lateral changes may occur.

with ~10 min variations during half an hour of observations was found by the
MAGIC telescopes, and GeV variability was observed on sub-day timescales with
the Large Area Telescope on Fermi. We examine 4C +21.35, assuming that it is a
source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). UHECR proton acceleration in
the inner jet powers a neutral beam of neutrinos, neutrons and gamma rays from
photopion production. The radiative efficiency and production spectra of
neutrals formed through photohadronic processes with isotropic external target
photons of the broad line region and torus are calculated. Secondary radiations
made by this process have a beaming factor ~\delta^5, where \delta is the
Doppler factor. The pair-production optical depth for gamma rays and the
photopion efficiency for UHECR neutrons as they pass through external isotropic
radiation fields are calculated. If target photons come from the broad line
region and dust torus, large Doppler factors, \delta >~100 are required to
produce rapidly variable secondary radiation with isotropic luminosity >~1e47
erg/s at the pc scale. The \gamma-ray spectra from leptonic secondaries are
calculated from cascades initiated by the UHECR neutron beam at the pc-scale
region and fit to the flaring spectrum of 4C +21.35. Detection of >~100 TeV
neutrinos from 4C +21.35 or other VHE blazars with IceCube or KM3NeT would

explored. Fermi-LAT data in the high-energy (HE, 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV)
gamma-ray range collected over 34 month are used to describe the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of the source. HESS J1507-622 is detected in the
Fermi energy range and its spectrum is best described by a power law in energy
with Gamma=1.7 +/- 0.1 stat +/- 0.2_sys and integral flux between (0.3-300) GeV
of F = (2.0 +/-0.5_stat +/- 1.0_sys) x 10^-9 cm^-2 s^-1. With the available
data it is not possible to discriminate between a hadronic and a leptonic
scenario for HESS J1507-622. The location and compactness of the source
indicate a considerable physical offset from the Galactic plane for this
object. In case of a multiple-kpc distance, this challenges a pulsar wind
nebula (PWN) origin for HESS J1507-622 since the time of travel for a pulsar
born in the Galactic disk to reach such a location would exceed the inverse
Compton (IC) cooling time of electrons that are energetic enough to produce VHE
gamma-rays. However, an origin of this gamma-ray source connected to a pulsar
that was born off the Galactic plane in the explosion of a hypervelocity star
cannot be excluded. The nature of HESS J1507-622 is still unknown to date, and
a PWN scenario cannot be ruled out in general. On the contrary HESS J1507-622
could be the first discovered representative of a population of spatially
extended VHE gamma-ray emitters with HE gamma-ray counterpart that are located
at considerable offsets from the Galactic plane. Future surveys in the VHE
gamma-ray range are necessary to probe the presence or absence of such a source

is governed by a potential added on the controlling line. The strength of the

to measure the evolution of the rate of structure growth between z=0.25 and
z=0.65 by combining data from the SDSS-I/II and SDSS-III surveys. The
large-scale linear bias of a population of dynamically passive galaxies, which
we select from both surveys, is easily modeled. Knowing the bias evolution
breaks degeneracies inherent to other methodologies, and decreases the
uncertainty in measurements of the rate of structure growth and the
normalization of the galaxy power-spectrum by up to a factor of two. If we
translate our measurements into a constraint on sigma_8(z=0) assuming a
concordance cosmological model and General Relativity (GR), we find that using
a bias model improves our uncertainty by a factor of nearly 1.5. Our results
are consistent with a flat Lambda Cold Dark Matter model and with GR.

parity-check (LDPC) and systematic repeat-accumulate (RA) codes. Based on
specific classes of combinatorial designs, the improved code design focuses on
high-rate structured codes with constant column weights 3 and higher. The
proposed codes are efficiently encodable and exhibit good structural
properties. Experimental results on decoding performance with the sum-product
algorithm show that the novel codes offer substantial practical application
potential, for instance, in high-speed applications in magnetic recording and
optical communications channels.

semi-infinite 1D wire. The system displays the physics of the Fermi edge
singularity. Our results generalize known results for the Fermi-edge system to
the regime where excitations induced by the qubit can resolve the spatial
structure of the scattering region. We find resonant features in the qubit
tunneling rate as a function of the qubit level splitting. They occur at
integer multiples of h times v_F/l. Here v_F is the Fermi velocity of the
electrons in the wire, and l is the distance from the tip of the wire to the
point where it interacts with the qubit. These features are due to a single
coherent charge fluctuation in the electron gas, with a half-wavelength that
fits into l an integer number of times. As the coupling between the qubit and
the wire is increased, the resonances are washed out. This is a clear signature
of the increasingly violent Fermi-sea shake-up that accompanies strong
coupling.

correspondence, banking and financial activities; it requires prudence and high
precision. Since information security has a very important role in supporting
activities of the organization, we need a standard or benchmark which regulates
governance over information security. The main objective of this paper is to
implement a novel practical approach framework to the development of
information security management system (ISMS) assessment and monitoring
software, called by I-SolFramework. System / software is expected to assist
stakeholders in assessing the level of their ISO27001 compliance readiness, the
software could help stakeholders understood security control or called by
compliance parameters, being shorter, more structured, high precision and
measured forecasting.

in the galactic halo region as quark matter, we have found out a background
spacetime metric for the region of the galactic halo. We obtain fairly general

investigate the stability of circular orbits, along with a different role for
quark matter. Bag-model quark matter meeting these conditions therefore
provides a suitable model for dark matter.
