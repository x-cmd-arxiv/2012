the twin paradox in static spacetimes. According to a well known theorem in
Lorentzian geometry the longest timelike worldline between two given points is
the unique geodesic line without points conjugate to the initial point on the
segment joining the two points. We calculate the proper times for static twins,
for twins moving on a circular orbit (if it is a geodesic) around a centre of
symmetry and for twins travelling on outgoing and ingoing radial timelike
geodesics. We show that the twins on the radial geodesic worldlines are always

find general Jacobi vector fields on the geodesic lines under consideration. In

tiles have a complicated structure and are no longer self-affine, we are able

chains of identical beads interacting via Hertz's contact forces. Each bead
periodically undergoes a compression phase followed by a free flight, due to
special properties of Hertzian interactions (fully nonlinear under compression
and vanishing in the absence of contact). We prove the existence of such waves
close to binary oscillations, and numerically continue these solutions when
their wavelength is increased. In the long wave limit, we observe their
convergence towards shock profiles consisting of small compression regions
close to solitary waves, alternating with large domains of free flight where
bead velocities are small. We give formal arguments to justify this asymptotic
behaviour, using a matching technique and previous results concerning solitary
wave solutions. The numerical finding of such waves implies the existence of
compactons, i.e. compactly supported compression waves propagating at a
constant velocity, depending on the amplitude and width of the wave. The beads
are stationary and separated by equal gaps outside the wave, and each bead
reached by the wave is shifted by a finite distance during a finite time
interval. Below a critical wavenumber, we observe fast instabilities of the

derive the exact probability density of its coordinate. Secondly, we present a
complete probabilistic description of the emerging escape process. The survival
probabilities for the individual particles are calculated, the first and the
second moments of the exit times are discussed. Generally speaking, although
the original inter-particle interaction possesses a point-like character, it
induces entropic repulsive forces which, e.g., push the leftmost (rightmost)
particle towards (opposite) the absorbing boundary thereby accelerating
(decelerating) its escape. More importantly, as compared to the reference
problem for the non-interacting particles, the interaction changes the
dynamical exponents which characterize the long-time asymptotic dynamics.

diffusion of a single particle in a $N$-dimensional space, and b) order

work on what may be broadly termed statistical data analysis. In this article,
I will address fundamental aspects of this algorithmic-statistical disconnect,
with an eye to bridging the gap between these two very different approaches. A
concept that lies at the heart of this disconnect is that of statistical
regularization, a notion that has to do with how robust is the output of an
algorithm to the noise properties of the input data. Although it is nearly
completely absent from computer science, which historically has taken the input
data as given and modeled algorithms discretely, regularization in one form or
another is central to nearly every application domain that applies algorithms
to noisy data. By using several case studies, I will illustrate, both
theoretically and empirically, the nonobvious fact that approximate
computation, in and of itself, can implicitly lead to statistical
regularization. This and other recent work suggests that, by exploiting in a
more principled way the statistical properties implicit in worst-case
algorithms, one can in many cases satisfy the bicriteria of having algorithms
that are scalable to very large-scale databases and that also have good
inferential or predictive properties.

radio-frequency ion trap is treated as a harmonic trap, in the problem
regarding the controlled collision of a trapped atom and a single trapped ion.
This is equivalent to studying the effect of the micromotion since this motion
must be neglected for the trapped ion to be considered as a harmonic
oscillator. By applying the transformation of Cook and Shankland we find that
the micromotion can be represented by two periodically oscillating operators.
In order to investigate the effect of the micromotion on the dynamics of a
trapped atom-ion system, we calculate (i) the coupling strengths of the
micromotion operators by numerical integration and (ii) the quasienergies of
the system by applying the Floquet formalism, a useful framework for studying
periodic systems. It turns out that the micromotion is not negligible when the
distance between the atom and the ion traps is shorter than a characteristic
distance. Within this range the energy diagram of the system changes remarkably
when the micromotion is taken into account, which leads to undesirable
consequences for applications that are based on an adiabatic process of the
trapped atom-ion system. We suggest a simple scheme for bypassing the
micromotion effect in order to successfully implement a quantum controlled
phase gate proposed previously and create an atom-ion macromolecule. The
methods presented here are not restricted to trapped atom-ion systems and can
be readily applied to studying the micromotion effect in any system involving a
single trapped ion.

finite size Bose system are constructed in the limit where the ratio
\varepsilon of the average nearest-neighbor boson distance to the size of the
droplet or the wavelength of density disturbances is small. In this limit, the
lowest order wave function varies smoothly across the system, i.e., is devoid
of structure on the scale of the average nearest-neighbor distance. The
amplitude of short range structure in the wave function is shown to vanish as a
power of \varepsilon when the interatomic forces are relatively weak. However,
there is residual short range structure that increases with the strength of

an insight into the very meaning of the principle of relativity. With this
novel perspective and Bell's theorem, we argue that special relativity, instead
of quantum theory, should be radically reformulated to resolve inconsistencies
between the two theories. A new theory of relativistic quantum mechanics is
formulated upon this novel perspective. This new relativistic quantum mechanics
is free from such anomalies as the negative probability density, the
negative-energy states, Zitterbewegung, and the Klein paradox deep-rooted in
the current relativistic quantum mechanics. Moreover, a remarkable result is
found that a particle can not be confined within an infinite square well of
width less than half of the Compton wavelength. As implications in nuclear
physics, there is a lower bound on the size of atomic nucleus. Neither an
electron, nor a positron, can be confined inside the nucleus by whatever
interaction.
  Furthermore, we argue that the postulates of non-relativistic quantum
statistics fulfill the principle of relativity, as extended to the relativistic
realm. A new theory of relativistic quantum statistics is formulated such that
the probability distribution functions are the same as the three well-known
probability distribution functions in non-relativistic quantum statistics. A
relativistic speed distribution of a dilute gas is then derived by the new
relativistic quantum statistics and the new relativistic quantum mechanics.
This relativistic speed distribution reduces to Maxwell speed distribution in
the low temperature region. Yet, this relativistic speed distribution differs
remarkably from J\""uttner speed distribution in the high temperature region.
Also, thermal properties of a dilute gas are studied by the new relativistic
quantum statistics.

galactic disc in a quasi-steady state governed by cosmological inflow. We focus
on the possibility that the coupling between the in-streaming gas and the disc
is maximal, e.g., via dense clumps, and ask whether the streams could be the
driver of turbulence in an unstable disc with a Toomre parameter Q~1. Our
fiducial model assumes an efficiency of ~0.5 per dynamical time for the decay
of turbulence energy, and ~0.02 for each of the processes that deplete the disc
gas, i.e., star formation, outflow, and inflow within the disc into a central
bulge. In this case, the in-streaming drives a ratio of turbulent to rotation
velocity sigma/V~0.2-0.3, which at z~2 induces an instability with Q~1, both as
observed. However, in conflict with observations, this model predicts that
sigma/V remains constant with time, independent of the cosmological accretion
rate, because mass and turbulence have the same external source. Such strongly
coupled cosmological inflow tends to stabilize the disc at low z, with Q ~ a
few, which may be consistent with observations. The instability could instead
be maintained for longer, with a properly declining sigma/V, if it is
self-regulated to oscillations about Q~1 by a duty cycle for disc depletion.
However, the 'off' phases of this duty cycle become long at low z, which may be
hard to reconcile with observations. Alternatively, the coupling between the
in-streaming gas and the disc may weaken in time, reflecting an evolving nature
of the accretion. If, instead, that coupling is weak at all times, the likely
energy source for self-regulated stirring up of the turbulence is the inflow
within the disc down the potential gradient (studied in a companion paper).

expected value. These methods were based upon Gamma and Chi Square
approximations or tail probability bounds such as Bernstein's Inequality. We
now propose growth estimators of the Negative Binomial mean. Under high
dispersion, zero values are likely to be overrepresented in the data. A growth
estimator constructs a Normal-style confidence interval by effectively removing
a small, pre--determined number of zeros from the data. We propose growth
estimators based upon multiplicative adjustments of the sample mean and direct
removal of zeros from the sample. These methods do not require estimating the
nuisance dispersion parameter. We will demonstrate that the growth estimators'
confidence intervals provide improved coverage over a wide range of parameter

vectors. The latter problem besides being of independent interest, also forms a
building block for more complex rare event problems that arise, for instance,
in queueing and financial credit risk modelling. It has been extensively
studied in literature where state independent exponential twisting based
importance sampling has been shown to be asymptotically efficient and a more
nuanced state dependent exponential twisting has been shown to have a stronger
bounded relative error property. We exploit the saddle-point based
representations that exist for these rare quantities, which rely on inverting
the characteristic functions of the underlying random vectors. These
representations reduce the rare event estimation problem to evaluating certain
integrals, which may via importance sampling be represented as expectations.
Further, it is easy to identify and approximate the zero-variance importance
sampling distribution to estimate these integrals. We identify such importance
sampling measures and show that they possess the asymptotically vanishing
relative error property that is stronger than the bounded relative error
property. To illustrate the broader applicability of the proposed methodology,
we extend it to similarly efficiently estimate the practically important
expected overshoot of sums of iid random variables.

first perform one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of an
early SN remnant. We show that the shocked shell undergoes efficient radiative
cooling and then becomes gravitationally unstable to fragment and collapse in
about ten million years. We then follow the thermal evolution of the collapsing
fragments using a one-zone code. Our one-zone calculation treats chemistry and
radiative cooling self-consistently in low-metallicity gas. The collapsing gas
cloud evolves roughly isothermally, until it cools rapidly by dust continuum
emission at the density 10^{13}-10^{14} /cc. The cloud core then becomes
thermally and gravitationally unstable and fragments. We argue that early SNe
can trigger the formation of low-mass stars in the extremely metal-poor

origin of large scale magnetic fields in astrophysical rotators have often been
distinct topics of research. In semi-analytic work on both problems it has been
useful to presume large scale symmetries, necessarily resulting in mean field
theories. MHD turbulence makes the underlying systems locally asymmetric and
nonlinear. Synergy between theory and simulations should aim for the
development of practical mean field models that capture essential physics and
can be used for observational modeling. Mean field dynamo (MFD) theory and
alpha-viscosity accretion theory exemplify such ongoing pursuits. 21st century
MFD theory has more nonlinear predictive power compared to 20th century MFD
theory, whereas accretion theory is still in a 20th century state. In fact,
insights from MFD theory are applicable to accretion theory and the two are
artificially separated pieces of what should be a single theory. I discuss
pieces of progress that provide clues toward a unified theory. A key concept is
that large scale magnetic fields can be sustained via local or global magnetic
helicity fluxes or via relaxation of small scale magnetic fluctuations, without
the kinetic helicity driver of 20th century textbooks. These concepts may help
explain the formation of large scale fields that supply non-local angular
momentum transport via coronae and jets in a unified theory of accretion and
dynamos. In diagnosing the role of helicities and helicity fluxes in disk
simulations, each disk hemisphere should be studied separately to avoid being
misled by cancelation that occurs as a result of reflection asymmetry. The
fraction of helical field energy in disks is expected to be small compared to
the total field in each hemisphere as a result of shear, but can still be
essential for large scale dynamo action.

to the applied magnetic field H (T_{N}~0 K for H=70 kOe) is also reported.
Coupled with a ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature ({\theta}_{CW}~65 K) in
the susceptibility (from a 100 K-300 K fit), it is indicative of competing
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. These indications are
corroborated by our density functional theory based electronic structure
calculations where we find the presence of significant ferromagnetic couplings
between some copper ions whereas AF couplings were present between some others.
Our experimental data, backed by our theoretical calculations, rule out
one-dimensional magnetic behaviour suggested by the structure and the observed
long-range order is due to the presence of non-negligible magnetic interactions
between adjacent as well as next-nearest chains.

this: instead of measuring length directly in space-time we measure the
""algebraic (spectral) length"" in the space of the corresponding quantum states
of some particle (fermion) acted upon by the Dirac propagator. This approach
shares the spirit of the unanimus vote of the 24th General Conference of

the difference between the size of the optimal solution and the value of the

change in the LP value in the branching steps, we argue that combining
previously known preprocessing rules with the most straightforward branching
algorithm yields an $O^*((2.618)^k)$ algorithm for the problem. Here $k$ is the
excess of the vertex cover size over the LP optimum, and we write $O^*(f(k))$
for a time complexity of the form $O(f(k)n^{O(1)})$, where $f (k)$ grows
exponentially with $k$. We proceed to show that a more sophisticated branching
algorithm achieves a runtime of $O^*(2.3146^k)$.
  Following this, using known and new reductions, we give $O^*(2.3146^k)$
algorithms for the parameterized versions of Above Guarantee Vertex Cover, Odd
Cycle Transversal, Split Vertex Deletion and Almost 2-SAT, and an
$O^*(1.5214^k)$ algorithm for Ko\""nig Vertex Deletion, Vertex Cover Param by
OCT and Vertex Cover Param by KVD. These algorithms significantly improve the
best known bounds for these problems. The most notable improvement is the new
bound for Odd Cycle Transversal - this is the first algorithm which beats the
dependence on $k$ of the seminal $O^*(3^k)$ algorithm of Reed, Smith and Vetta.
Finally, using our algorithm, we obtain a kernel for the standard
parameterization of Vertex Cover with at most $2k - c \log k$ vertices. Our
kernel is simpler than previously known kernels achieving the same size bound.

experiments on Anderson localization, in which the transverse spreading of a
beam is suppressed by random fluctuations in the refractive index. If the
refractive index fluctuates along the direction of the paraxial propagation of
the beam, the localization is destroyed. We analyze this broken localization,
in terms of the spectral decomposition of the potential. When the potential has
a discrete spectrum, the spread is controlled by the overlap of Chirikov
resonances in phase space. As the number of Fourier components is increased,
the resonances merge into a continuum, which is described by a Fokker-Planck
equation. We express the diffusion coefficient in terms of the spectral
intensity of the potential. For a general class of potentials that are commonly
used in optics, the solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation exhibit anomalous
diffusion in phase space, implying that when Anderson localization is broken by
temporal fluctuations of the potential, the result is transport at a rate
similar to a ballistic one or even faster. For a class of potentials which
arise in some existing realizations of Anderson localization atypical behavior
is found.

These sets can be any collection of elements, for example astronomical catalogs
of celestial objects. The method does not require the contents of the sets to
be known explicitly. It combines incomplete knowledge about the relationships
between sets to infer a priori unknown relationships. Relationships between
sets are represented by sets of Boolean hypercubes. This leads to deductive
reasoning by application of logical operators to these sets of hypercubes. A
pseudocode for an efficient implementation is described.
  The method is used in the Astro-WISE information system to infer
relationships between catalogs of astronomical objects. These catalogs can be
very large and, more importantly, their contents do not have to be available at
all times. Science products are stored in Astro-WISE with references to other
science products from which they are derived, or their dependencies. This
creates full data lineage that links every science product all the way back to
the raw data. Catalogs are created in a way that maximizes knowledge about
their relationship with their dependencies. The presented algorithm is used to
determine which objects a catalog represents by leveraging this information.

learning with sparse coding, in which signals are decomposed as linear
combinations of a few atoms of a learned dictionary, is well adept to
reconstruction issues. This framework has also been used for discrimination
tasks such as image classification. To achieve better performances of
classification, experts develop several methods to learn a discriminative
dictionary in a supervised manner. However, another issue is that when the data
become extremely large in scale, these methods will be no longer effective as
they are all batch-oriented approaches. For this reason, we propose a novel
online algorithm for discriminative dictionary learning, dubbed \textbf{ODDL}
in this paper. First, we introduce a linear classifier into the conventional
dictionary learning formulation and derive a discriminative dictionary learning
problem. Then, we exploit an online algorithm to solve the derived problem.
Unlike the most existing approaches which update dictionary and classifier
alternately via iteratively solving sub-problems, our approach directly
explores them jointly. Meanwhile, it can largely shorten the runtime for
training and is also particularly suitable for large-scale classification
issues. To evaluate the performance of the proposed ODDL approach in image
recognition, we conduct some experiments on three well-known benchmarks, and
the experimental results demonstrate ODDL is fairly promising for image
classification tasks.

characteristics of the processes and is relevant for applications such as for
solving PIDEs numerically for pricing options in L\'evy models.
  The classification is done via the Fourier transform i.e. via the symbol of
the process. We define the Sobolev index of a L\'evy process by a certain
growth condition on the symbol. It follows that for L\'evy processes with
Sobolev index $\alpha$ the corresponding evolution problem has a unique weak
solution in the Sobolev-Slobodeckii space $H^{\alpha/2}$. We show that this
classification applies to a wide range of processes. Examples are the Brownian
motion with or without drift, generalised hyperbolic (GH), CGMY and (semi)
stable L\'evy processes.
  A comparison of the Sobolev index with the Blumenthal-Getoor index sheds
light on the structural implication of the classification. More precisely, we
discuss the Sobolev index as an indicator of the smoothness of the distribution
and of the variation of the paths of the process. This highlights the relation
between the $p$-variation of the paths and the degree of smoothing effect that

the redshift space distortion on the shape of voids statistically increases the
ellipticities of voids, and leaves a prominent feature on the ellipticity PDF
as a substantial reduction in the probability of having voids with small
ellipticity. The location of this characteristic cutoff of the ellipticity PDF
is an explicit function of the logarithmic growth rate, and it can be used as a
probe of cosmology once the radial density profile of voids is better
understood. However, the biggest limiting factor for the use of ellipticity PDF
as a probe of cosmology lies in the Poisson noise from a small number of
galaxies to define the shape of a given void. This Poisson noise creates a
significant contamination of the resulting ellipticity PDF so that the shape of
the original PDF is almost washed-out. Nevertheless, there is a way to overcome
the Poisson noise via the Alcock Paczynski test on the shape of stacked voids.
In redshift space, since the void is elongated toward the line of sight, the
stacked void has non-zero ellipticity, which can be a tell-tale of the
logarithmic growth rate. Although some useful information of void ellipticity
will be lost by stacking, in this way, we can see the effect of redshift space
distortion as a source of anisotropy in the stacked void ellipticity. We think
that the stacking analysis of the voids in redshift space is potentially a
powerful tool to probe the cosmology.

important role in determining gene expression patterns. Based upon experimental
data, we built a dynamical model to test whether pure diffusion could account
for the observed co-localization of genes within a defined subnuclear region. A
simple standard Brownian motion model in two and three dimensions shows that
preferential co-localization is possible for co-regulated genes without any
direct interaction, and suggests the occurrence may be due to a limitation in
the number of available transcription factors. Experimental data of chromatin
movements demonstrates that fractional rather than standard Brownian motion is
more appropriate to model gene mobilizations, and we tested our dynamical model
against recent static experimental data, using a sub-diffusion process by which
the genes tend to colocalize more easily. Moreover, in order to compare our
model with recently obtained experimental data, we studied the association
level between genes and factors, and presented data supporting the validation
of this dynamic model. As further applications of our model, we applied it to
test against more biological observations. We found that increasing
transcription factor number, rather than factory number and nucleus size, might
be the reason for decreasing gene co-localization. In the scenario of
frequency- or amplitude-modulation of transcription factors, our model
predicted that frequency-modulation may increase the co-localization between
its targeted genes.

divisible with respect to time. Given an IDT process $(X_{t},\,t\geq0)$, there
exists a unique (in law) L\'evy process $(L_{t}; t\geq0)$ which has the same
one-dimensional marginals distributions, i.e for any $t\geq0$ fixed, we have
$$X_{t}\stackrel{(law)}{=}L_{t}.$$ Such processes are said to be associated.
The main objective of this work is to exhibit numerous examples of IDT
processes and their associated L\'evy processes. To this end, we take up ideas
of the monograph \textit{Peacocks and associated martingales} from F. Hirsch,
C. Profeta, B. Roynette and M. Yor (L\'evy, Sato and Gaussian sheet methods)
and apply them in the framework of IDT processes. This gives a new interesting
outlook to the study of processes whose only one-dimensional marginals are
known. Also, we give an integrated weak It\^o type formula for IDT processes
(in the same spirit as the one for Gaussian processes) and some links between
IDT processes and selfdecomposability. The last sections are devoted to the
study of some extensions of the notion of IDT processes in the weak sense as
well as in the multiparameter sense. In particular, a new approach for
multiparameter IDT processes is introduced and studied. Main examples of this
kind of processes are the $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$-parameter L\'{e}vy process and
the L\'{e}vy's $\mathbb{R}^{M}$-parameter Brownian motion. These results give
some better understanding of IDT processes, and may be seen as some
continuation of the works of K. Es-Sebaiy and Y. Ouknine [\textit{How rich is
the class of processes which are infinitely divisible with respect to time ?}]
and R. Mansuy [\textit{On processes which are infinitely divisible with respect

this context, we have measured the spectra of deuterated isotopologues of
glycolaldehyde in the laboratory: the three monodeuterated ones (CH2OD-CHO,
CHDOH-CHO and CH2OH-CDO) and one dideuterated derivative (CHDOH-CDO) in the

better than 30 kHz to acquire new spectroscopic data between 150 and 630 GHz

enables the estimation of the camera parameters without using a calibration

absence of information about the internal camera parameters such as the focal
length and the principal point, the knowledge of the camera pixel shape is
usually the only available constraint. Given a projective reconstruction of a

theoretical minimum), thus halving the number of cameras required by previous
algorithms based on the same constraint. To this purpose, we introduce as our
basic geometric tool the six-line conic variety (SLCV), consisting in the set
of planes intersecting six given lines of 3D space in points of a conic. We
show that the set of solutions of the Euclidean upgrading problem for three
cameras with known pixel shape can be parameterized in a computationally
efficient way. This parameterization is then used to solve autocalibration from
five or more cameras, reducing the three-dimensional search space to a
two-dimensional one. We provide experiments with real images showing the good
performance of the technique.

mass terms based on the cohomological approach and the Monte Carlo method. In
the bosonic models we show the existence of an exotic first/second order
transition from a phase with a well defined background geometry (the fuzzy
sphere) to a phase with commuting matrices with no geometry in the sense of
Connes. At the transition point the sphere expands abruptly to infinite size
then it evaporates as we increase the temperature (the gauge coupling
constant). The transition looks first order due to the discontinuity in the
action whereas it looks second order due to the divergent peak in the specific
heat. The fuzzy sphere is stable for the supersymmetric models in the sense
that the bosonic phase transition is turned into a very slow crossover
transition. The transition point is found to scale to zero with N. We
conjecture that the transition from the background sphere to the phase of
commuting matrices is associated with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The
eigenvalues distribution of any of the bosonic matrices in the matrix phase is
found to be given by a non-polynomial law obtained from the fact that the joint
probability distribution of the four matrices is uniform inside a solid ball
with radius R. The eigenvalues of the gauge field on the background geometry
are also found to be distributed according to this non-polynomial law. We also
discuss the D=3 models and by using cohomological deformation, localization
techniques and the saddle-point method we give a derivation of the D=3
eigenvalues distribution starting from a particular D=4 model.

While systematic errors are generally accounted for through careful
calibration, the effect of remaining imperfections on the characterization of
quantum resources has been largely overlooked in the literature. In this paper,
we investigate the effect of systematic errors that arise from imperfect
alignment of measurement bases --- an error that can conceivably take place due
to the limited controlability of measurement devices. We show that
characterization of quantum resources using quantum state tomography or
entanglement witnesses can be undermined with an amount of such imprecision
that is not uncommon in laboratories. Curiously, for quantum state tomography,
we find that having entanglement can help to reduce the susceptibility to this
kind of error. We also briefly discuss how a given entanglement witness can be
modified to incorporate the effect of such errors.

in identification of mechanical properties of biological tissues (such as
articular cartilage) and assessing their viability. We consider frictionless
flat-ended and spherical sinusoidally-driven indentation tests utilizing
displacement-controlled loading protocol. Articular cartilage tissue is modeled
as a viscoelastic material with a time-independent Poisson's ratio. We study
the dynamic indentation stiffness with the aim of formulating criteria for
evaluation the quality of articular cartilage in order to be able to
discriminate its degenerative state. In particular, evaluating the dynamic
indentation stiffness at the turning point of the flat-ended indentation test,
we introduce the so-called incomplete storage modulus. Considering the time
difference between the time moments when the dynamic stiffness vanishes
(contact force reaches its maximum) and the dynamic stiffness becomes infinite
(indenter displacement reaches its maximum), we introduce the so-called
incomplete loss angle. Analogous quantities can be introduced in the spherical
sinusoidally-driven indentation test, however, to account for the thickness
effect, a special approach is required. We apply an asymptotic modeling
approach for analyzing and interpreting the results of the dynamic spherical
indentation test in terms of the geometrical parameter of the indenter and
viscoelastic characteristics of the material. Some implications to
non-destructive indentation diagnostics of cartilage degeneration are

certain achievable rate. Maximization has to be done over the probability mass

the optimal bit pmfs were determined via exhaustive search, which is of
exponential complexity in m. In this work, an algorithm called bit-alternating

analytical form are investigated all leading to universal Luttinger liquid
physics in equilibrium. The steady-state fermionic momentum distribution shows
universal behavior in the sense of the Luttinger liquid phenomenology. For
generic regular potentials the large time decay of the momentum distribution
function towards the steady-state value is characterized by a power law with a
universal exponent which only depends on the potential at zero momentum
transfer. A commonly employed ad hoc procedure fails to give this exponent.
Besides quenches from zero to positive interactions we also consider abrupt
changes of the interaction between two arbitrary values. Additionally, we

$I(3S|r|1P_2)=0.066$ GeV$^{-1}$, while due to large cancellation the m.e.
$I(3S|r|1P_1)=-0.020$ GeV$^{-1}$ is small and negative; at the same time the

which organizes all, including also concordant reads into a read alignment
graph where max-cliques represent maximal contradiction-free groups of
alignments. A specifically engineered algorithm then enumerates all max-cliques
and statistically evaluates them for their potential to reflect insertions or
deletions (indels). For the first time in the literature, we compare a large
range of state-of-the-art approaches using simulated Illumina reads from a
fully annotated genome and present various relevant performance statistics. We
achieve superior performance rates in particular on indels of sizes 20--100,
which have been exposed as a current major challenge in the SV discovery
literature and where prior insert size based approaches have limitations. In
that size range, we outperform even split read aligners. We achieve good
results also on real data where we make a substantial amount of correct
predictions as the only tool, which complement the predictions of split-read

and p-modes with almost similar amplitudes in two clearly distinct frequency
domains.
  Classical Fourier analysis allows the dectection of frequencies with an
amplitude as small as 0.1 mmag up to 50c/d. The frequency spectrum of CoRoT ID
105733033 clearly consists of two distinct ranges, which are typical of gamma
Doradus and delta Scuti pulsation. Focus was placed on the identification of
linear combinations and frequencies due to the coupling between gamma Doradus
and delta Scuti modes.
  We detect 198 gamma Doradus type frequencies in the range [0.25;4]c/d, of
which 180 are not combination frequencies, and 24 of them are separated by a
constant period-interval Delta P=0.03074d. According to the asymptotic theory,
these 24 frequencies correspond to a series of g-modes of the same ell-degree
and different radial orders n. We also detect 246 delta Scuti type frequencies
in the range [10.1;63.4]c/d. The dominant frequency F=12.6759c/d was identified
as the fundamental radial mode. Our most noteworthy result is that all the main
gamma Doradus frequencies f_i are also detected in the delta Scuti domain as F
+- f_i with four times smaller amplitudes. Once these frequencies were removed,
only 59 can be considered as individual delta Scuti frequencies.
  A coupling between g- and p-modes is proposed to be a tool for detecting
g-modes in the Sun, but this coupling has never yet been observed. Our present
study may be valuable input to theoretical studies, addressing the mutual
influence of g- and p-mode cavities and the deviation from classical theory.
Furthermore, we identify a sequence of g-modes belonging to the same ell but
with consecutive orders n.

growth of smartphone use, smartphone theft is also increasing. This paper
proposes a model to secure smartphones from theft as well as provides options
to access a smartphone through other smartphone or a normal mobile via Short
Message Service. This model provides option to track and secure the mobile by
locking it. It also provides facilities to receive the incoming call and sms
information to the remotely connected device and enables the remote user to
control the mobile through SMS. The proposed model is validated by the
prototype implementation in Android platform. Various tests are conducted in
the implementation and the results are discussed.
