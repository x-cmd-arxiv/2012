over others. Experiments conducted with models of different social structures

that having isolated agent groups rather than an interconnected agent is more
advantageous for the emergence of a social communication system. Distinctive
groups that are closely connected by communication yield systems less like
natural language than fully isolated groups inhabiting the same world.
Furthermore, the addition of a dominant male who is asymmetrically favoured as
a hearer, and equally likely to be a speaker has no positive influence on the

  From this reconstruction, using the multi-resolution analysis, one can obtain

signal during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Using three different
cosmological radiative transfer simulations, we investigate if quasars are
capable of substantially changing the size and morphology of the H II regions
they are born in. We choose stellar and quasar luminosities in a way that is
favourable to seeing such an effect. We find that even the most luminous of our
quasar models is not able to increase the size of its native H II region
substantially beyond those of large H II regions produced by clustered stellar
sources alone. However, the quasar H II region is found to be more spherical.
We next investigate the prospects of detecting such H II regions in the
redshifted 21cm data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) by means of a matched
filter technique. We find that H II regions with radii ~ 25 comoving Mpc or
larger should have a sufficiently high detection probability for 1200 hours of
integration time. Although the matched filter can in principle distinguish
between more and less spherical regions, we find that when including realistic
system noise this distinction can no longer be made. The strong foregrounds are
found not to pose a problem for the matched filter technique. We also
demonstrate that when the quasar position is known, the redshifted 21cm data
can still be used to set upper limits on the ionizing photon rate of the
quasar. If both the quasar position and its luminosity are known, the
redshifted 21 cm data can set new constrains on quasar lifetimes.

Nevertheless, recent observations show evidence for the presence of B-type
pulsator candidates in both galaxies. We seek an explanation for the excitation
of \beta Cep and SPB modes in those galaxies by examining basic input physics
in stellar modelling: i) the specific metal mixture of B-type stars in the
Magellanic Clouds; ii) the role of a potential underestimation of stellar
opacities. We first derive the present-day chemical mixtures of B-type stars in
the Magellanic Clouds. Then, we compute stellar models for that metal mixture
and perform a non-adiabatic analysis of these models. In a second approach, we
simulate parametric enhancements of stellar opacities due to different iron
group elements. We then study their effects in models of B stars and their
stability. We find that adopting a representative chemical mixture of B stars
in the Small Magellanic Cloud cannot explain the presence of B-type pulsators
there. An increase of the opacity in the region of the iron-group bump could
drive B-type pulsations, but only if this increase occurs at the temperature
corresponding to the maximum contribution of Ni to this opacity bump. We
recommend an accurate computation of Ni opacity to understand B-type pulsators
in the Small Magellanic Cloud, as well as the frequency domain observed in some
Galactic hybrid \beta Cep-SPB stars.

element of many bibliometric analyses. Classification usually takes place at
the level of journals, where the Web of Science subject categories are the most

they have difficulties with multidisciplinary journals. To avoid these
limitations, we introduce a new methodology for constructing classification

publications are clustered into research areas based on citation relations. The

an application in which a classification system is produced that includes

classification system, we discuss the strengths and the limitations of the

evaluation of the intensity of relations linking users and how they facilitate

relationships have been studied extensively in the social sciences under the
framework of the ""strength of weak ties"" theory proposed by Mark Granovetter.13
Some research has considered whether that theory can be extended to online
social networks like Facebook, suggesting interaction data can be used to
predict the strength of ties. The approaches being used require handling
user-generated data that is often not publicly available due to privacy
concerns. Here, we propose an alternative definition of weak and strong ties
that requires knowledge of only the topology of the social network (such as who
is a friend of whom on Facebook), relying on the fact that online social
networks, or OSNs, tend to fragment into communities. We thus suggest
classifying as weak ties those edges linking individuals belonging to different
communities and strong ties as those connecting users in the same community. We
tested this definition on a large network representing part of the Facebook
social graph and studied how weak and strong ties affect the
information-diffusion process. Our findings suggest individuals in OSNs
self-organize to create well-connected communities, while weak ties yield
cohesion and optimize the coverage of information spread.

important for the disk dynamical evolution, especially inside the solar circle.
Starting from state-of-the art initial conditions for NGC 6791, we calculate
1000 orbits back in time for about 1 Gyr turning on and off different
non-axisymmetric components of the global potential. We then compare
statistical estimates of the cluster's recent orbital parameters with the
orbital parameters of 10^4 test-particles originating close to the Galactic
Center (having initial galocentric radii in the range of 3-5 kpc) and
undergoing radial migration during 8 Gyr of forward integration. We find that a
model which incorporates a strong bar and spiral arm perturbations can indeed
be responsible for the migration of NGC 6791 from the inner disk (galocentric
radii of 3-5 kpc) to its present-day location. Such a model can provide orbital
parameters which are close enough to the observed ones. However, the
probability of this scenario as it results from our investigations is very low.

direction of modern research, the quantum properties of light were widely
neglected in this field. Quantum optics with quantum gases closes this gap and
addresses phenomena, where the quantum statistical nature of both light and
ultracold matter play equally important roles. First, light can serve as a
quantum nondemolition (QND) probe of the quantum dynamics of various ultracold
particles from ultracold atomic and molecular gases to nanoparticles and
nanomechanical systems. Second, due to dynamic light-matter entanglement,
projective measurement-based preparation of the many-body states is possible,
where the class of emerging atomic states can be designed via optical geometry.
Light scattering constitutes such a quantum measurement with controllable
measurement back-action. As in cavity-based spin squeezing, atom number
squeezed and Schroedinger cat states can be prepared. Third, trapping atoms
inside an optical cavity one creates optical potentials and forces, which are
not prescribed but quantized and dynamical variables themselves. Ultimately,
cavity QED with quantum gases requires a self-consistent solution for light and
particles, which enriches the picture of quantum many-body states of atoms
trapped in quantum potentials. This will allow quantum simulations of phenomena
related to the physics of phonons, polarons, polaritons and other quantum

obtain that the Compton cooling timescale directly leads to the observational

invariant fashion. In this paper, we extend this procedure to all BPS-saturated

(almost) holomorphic modular form of weight -k/2. We use the fact that any such

convergent Poincar\'e series, against which the fundamental domain F can be
unfolded. The resulting BPS-state sum neatly exhibits the singularities of the
amplitude at points of gauge symmetry enhancement, in a chamber-independent

heterotic string compactifications.

uncertainties associated with the observations is vital if the comparison is to
be meaningful. However, many determinations of temperatures, densities and
abundances in photoionized nebulae do not quote the associated uncertainty.
Those that do typically propagate the uncertainties using analytical techniques
which rely on assumptions that generally do not hold.
  Motivated by this issue, we have developed NEAT (Nebular Empirical Analysis
Tool), a new code for calculating chemical abundances in photoionized nebulae.
The code carries out an analysis of lists of emission lines using
long-established techniques to estimate the amount of interstellar extinction,
calculate representative temperatures and densities, compute ionic abundances
from both collisionally excited lines and recombination lines, and finally to
estimate total elemental abundances using an ionization correction scheme. NEAT
uses a Monte Carlo technique to robustly propagate uncertainties from line flux
measurements through to the derived abundances.
  We show that for typical observational data, this approach is superior to
analytic estimates of uncertainties. NEAT also accounts for the effect of
upward biasing on measurements of lines with low signal to noise, allowing us
to accurately quantify the effect of this bias on abundance determinations. We
find not only that the effect can result in significant over-estimates of heavy
element abundances derived from weak lines, but that taking it into account
reduces the uncertainty of these abundance determinations. Finally, we
investigate the effect of possible uncertainties in R, the ratio of selective
to total extinction, on abundance determinations. We find that the uncertainty
due to this parameter is negligible compared to the statistical uncertainties
due to typical line flux measurement uncertainties.

sources, and their observational features have been ascribed to a relativistic
jet closely aligned to the line of sight. They are generally divided in two
main classes: the BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) and the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars
(FSRQs). In the case of BL Lacs the double bumped spectral energy distribution
(SED) is generally described by the Synchrotron Self Compton (SSC) emission,
while for the FSRQs it is interpreted as due to External Compton (EC) emission.
Recently, we showed that in the [3.4]-[4.6]-[12] micron color- color diagram
the blazar population covers a distinct region (i.e., the WISE blazar Strip,
WBS), clearly separated from the other extragalactic sources that are dominated
by thermal emission. In this paper we investigate the relation between the
infrared and gamma-ray emission for a subset of confirmed blazars from the
literature, associated with Fermi sources, for which WISE archival observations
are available. This sample is a proper subset of the sample of sources used
previously, and the availability of Fermi data is critical to constrain the
models on the emission mechanisms for the blazars. We found that the selected
blazars also lie on the WISE blazar Strip covering a narrower region of the
infrared color-color planes than the overall blazars population. We then found
an evident correlation between the IR and gamma-ray spectral indices expected
in the SSC and EC frameworks. Finally, we determined the ratio between their
gamma-ray and infrared fluxes, a surrogate of the ratio of powers between the
inverse Compton and the synchrotron SED components, and used such parameter to
test different emitting scenarios blazars.

two-loop leading log level in supersymmetric models commonly used in SUSY
searches at the LHC. These are the constrained MSSM (CMSSM), non-universal
Higgs masses models (NUHM1, NUHM2), non-universal gaugino masses model (NUGM)
and GUT related gaugino masses models (NUGMd). Two definitions of the fine
tuning are used, the first (Delta_{max}) measures maximal fine-tuning wrt
individual parameters while the second (Delta_q) adds their contribution in
""quadrature"". As a direct result of two theoretical constraints (the EW minimum
conditions), fine tuning (Delta_q) emerges as a suppressing factor (effective
prior) of the averaged likelihood (under the priors), under the integral of the
global probability of measuring the data (Bayesian evidence p(D)). For each
model, there is little difference between Delta_q, Delta_{max} in the region
allowed by the data, with similar behaviour as functions of the Higgs, gluino,
stop mass or SUSY scale (m_{susy}=(m_{\tilde t_1} m_{\tilde t_2})^{1/2}) or
dark matter and g-2 constraints. The analysis has the advantage that by
replacing any of these mass scales or constraints by their latest bounds one
easily infers for each model the value of Delta_q, Delta_{max} or vice versa.
For all models, minimal fine tuning is achieved for M_{higgs} near 115 GeV with
a Delta_q\approx Delta_{max}\approx 10 to 100 depending on the model, and in
the CMSSM this is actually a global minimum. Due to a strong ($\approx$
exponential) dependence of Delta on M_{higgs}, for a Higgs mass near 125 GeV,
the above values of Delta_q\approx Delta_{max} increase to between 500 and
1000. Possible corrections to these values are briefly discussed.

set constraint atoms and pre-ordered preference set constraint atoms, which are
extensions of set constraint atoms. We show that the question of whether a PSC
program has a preferred stable model is CoNP-complete. We give examples of the
uses of the preference set constraint atoms and show that Answer Set
Optimization (Brewka, Niemel\""a, and Truszczynski 2003) and General Preference
(Son and Pontelli 2006) can be expressed using preference set constraint atoms.

remains one of the central problems in learning theory. We consider this
problem in the setting where the underlying distribution is uniform, or more
generally, a product distribution. Kalai, Samorodnitsky and Teng (2009) showed
that in this setting a DNF expression can be efficiently approximated from its
""heavy"" low-degree Fourier coefficients alone. This is in contrast to previous
approaches where boosting was used and thus Fourier coefficients of the target
function modified by various distributions were needed. This property is
crucial for learning of DNF expressions over smoothed product distributions, a
learning model introduced by Kalai et al. (2009) and inspired by the seminal
smoothed analysis model of Spielman and Teng (2001).
  We introduce a new approach to learning (or approximating) a polynomial
threshold functions which is based on creating a function with range [-1,1]
that approximately agrees with the unknown function on low-degree Fourier
coefficients. We then describe conditions under which this is sufficient for
learning polynomial threshold functions. Our approach yields a new, simple
algorithm for approximating any polynomial-size DNF expression from its ""heavy""
low-degree Fourier coefficients alone. Our algorithm greatly simplifies the
proof of learnability of DNF expressions over smoothed product distributions.
We also describe an application of our algorithm to learning monotone DNF
expressions over product distributions. Building on the work of Servedio
(2001), we give an algorithm that runs in time $\poly((s \cdot
\log{(s/\eps)})^{\log{(s/\eps)}}, n)$, where $s$ is the size of the target DNF
expression and $\eps$ is the accuracy. This improves on $\poly((s \cdot

ARPES studies of underdoped samples show a momentum dependence of the energy
gap below Tc which deviates from a simple d-wave form, suggesting the
coexistence of multiple energy scales in the superconducting state. Hence, two
distinct energy scales have been introduced, namely, the gap near the node
(characterized by Delta_0) and in the anti-nodal region (characterized by
Delta^*). Dichotomy between them has been demonstrated from the material,
doping, and temperature dependence of the energy gap. While Delta^* at the same
doping level is approximately material independent, Delta_0 shows a strong
material dependence tracking the magnitude of Tc,max. The anti-nodal gap does
not close at Tc in contrast to the gap near the node which follows something
closer to a BCS-like temperature dependence. An effective superconducting gap
Delta_sc defined at the end point of the Fermi arc is found to be proportional
to Tc's in various materials.

lines have been routinely applied to high-redshift quasars to estimate their BH
masses. Depending on the redshift, different line estimators (Halpha, Hbeta,
MgII, CIV) are often used with optical/near-infrared spectroscopy. Here we use
a homogeneous sample of 60 intermediate-redshift (z~1.5-2.2) SDSS quasars with
optical and near-infrared spectra covering CIV through Halpha to investigate
the consistency between different line estimators. We critically compare
restframe UV line estimators (CIV, CIII], and MgII) with optical estimators
(Hbeta and Halpha) in terms of correlations between line widths and between
continuum/line luminosities, for the high-luminosity regime (L_5100>10^45.4
erg/s) probed by our sample. The continuum luminosities of L_1350 and L_3000,
and the broad line luminosities are well correlated with L_5100. We found that
the MgII FWHM correlates well with the FWHMs of the Balmer lines, and that the
MgII line estimator can be calibrated to yield consistent virial mass estimates
with those based on the Hbeta/Halpha estimators, thus extending earlier results
on less luminous objects. The CIV FWHM is poorly correlated with the Balmer
line FWHMs, and the scatter between the CIV and Hbeta FWHMs consists of an
irreducible part (~0.12 dex), and a part that correlates with the blueshift of
the CIV centroid relative to that of Hbeta. The CIII] FWHM is found to
correlate with the CIV FWHM, and hence is also poorly correlated with the Hbeta
FWHM. While the CIV and CIII] lines can be calibrated to yield consistent
virial mass estimates as Hbeta on average, the scatter is substantially larger
than MgII, and the usage of CIV/CIII] FWHM in the mass estimators does not
improve the agreement with the Hbeta estimator. (Abridged)

this scheme the molecules are initially produced by photoassociation or
magnetoassociation in bound vibrational levels close to the first dissociation
threshold. We analyze here the first step of the two-color path as a function
of pulse intensity from the low-field to the high-field regime. We use two
different approaches, a global one, the 'Wavepacket' method, and a restricted
one, the 'Level by Level' method where the number of vibrational levels is
limited to a small subset. The comparison between the results of the two
approaches allows one to gain qualitative insights into the complex dynamics of
the high-field regime. In particular, we emphasize the non-trivial and
important role of far-from-resonance levels which are adiabatically excited
through 'vertical' transitions with a large Franck-Condon factor. We also point
out spectacular excitation blockade due to the presence of a quasi-degenerate
level in the lower electronic state. We conclude that selective transfer with
femtosecond pulses is possible in the low-field regime only. Finally, we extend

targets of the NASA/Kepler mission and provide detailed chemical composition of
each target. We find that the overall metallicity is well-represented by Fe
lines. Relative abundances of light elements (CNO) and alpha-elements are
generally higher for low-metallicity stars. Our spectroscopic analysis benefits
from the accurately measured surface gravity from the asteroseismic analysis of
the Kepler light curves. The log g parameter is known to better than 0.03 dex
and is held fixed in the analysis. We compare our Teff determination with a
recent colour calibration of V-K (TYCHO V magnitude minus 2MASS Ks magnitude)
and find very good agreement and a scatter of only 80 K, showing that for other
nearby Kepler targets this index can be used. The asteroseismic log g values
agree very well with the classical determination using Fe1-Fe2 balance,
although we find a small systematic offset of 0.08 dex (asteroseismic log g
values are lower). The abundance patterns of metals, alpha elements, and the
light elements (CNO) show that a simple scaling by [Fe/H] is adequate to
represent the metallicity of the stars, except for the stars with metallicity
below -0.3, where alpha-enhancement becomes important. However, this is only
important for a very small fraction of the Kepler sample. We therefore
recommend that a simple scaling with [Fe/H] be employed in the asteroseismic
analyses of large ensembles of solar-type stars.

by a formula over B where no variable appears more than once. A checking test
for a read-once function f over B depending on all its variables is a set of
input vectors distinguishing f from all other read-once functions of the same
variables. We show that every read-once function f over B has a checking test
containing O(n^l) vectors, where n is the number of relevant variables of f and
l is the largest arity of functions in B. For some functions, this bound cannot
be improved by more than a constant factor. The employed technique involves
reconstructing f from its l-variable projections and provides a stronger form
of Kuznetsov's classic theorem on read-once representations.

the linear system arising from the direct finite element discretization of the
fourth-order equation with different boundary conditions on unstructured grids
of size $N$ on an arbitrary polygoanl domain. Several preconditioners are
presented, and the conjugate gradient methods applied with these
preconditioners are proven to converge uniformly with respect to the size of
the preconditioned linear system. One main ingredient of the optimal
preconditioners is a mixed-form discretization of the fourth-order problem.
Such a mixed-form discretization leads to a non-desirable ---either non-optimal
or non-convergent--- approximation of the original solution, but it provides
optimal preconditioners for the direct finite element problem. It is further
shown that the implementation of the preconditioners can be reduced to the
solution of several discrete Poisson equations. Therefore, any existing optimal
or nearly optimal solver, such as geometric or algebraic multigrid methods, for
Poisson equations would lead to a nearly optimal solver for the discrete
fourth-order system. A number of nonstandard Sobolev spaces and their
discretizations defined on the boundary of polygonal domains are carefully
studied and used for the analysis of those preconditioners.

dominated by a z = 3 critical mode, which is in contrast to the naive

in ascertaining a pricing measure in incomplete markets. The abstracted problem
corresponds to finding a probability measure that minimizes the relative
entropy (also called $I$-divergence) with respect to a known measure while it
satisfies certain moment constraints on functions of underlying assets. In this
paper, we show that under $I$-divergence, the optimal solution may not exist
when the underlying assets have fat tailed distributions, ubiquitous in
financial practice. We note that this drawback may be corrected if
`polynomial-divergence' is used. This divergence can be seen to be equivalent
to the well known (relative) Tsallis or (relative) Renyi entropy. We discuss
existence and uniqueness issues related to this new optimization problem as
well as the nature of the optimal solution under different objectives. We also
identify the optimal solution structure under $I$-divergence as well as
polynomial-divergence when the associated constraints include those on marginal
distribution of functions of underlying assets. These results are applied to a
simple problem of model calibration to options prices as well as to portfolio
modeling in Markowitz framework, where we note that a reasonable view that a
particular portfolio of assets has heavy tailed losses may lead to fatter and
more reasonable tail distributions of all assets.

|S|>1, |T|>1, and |TS|< |T|+|S|< |G|-1. We show that if |S|< |G|-4|G|^{1/2}+1
then either S is a geometric progression or there exists a non-trivial subgroup
H such that either |HS|< |S|+|H| or |SH| < |S|+|H|. This extends to the
nonabelian case classical results for Abelian groups. When we remove the
hypothesis |S|<|G|-4|G|^{1/2}+1 we show the existence of counterexamples to the
above characterization whose structure is described precisely.

projective detection of a localised field mode in an arbitrary reference frame.
We apply it to extract vacuum entanglement by a pair of counter-accelerating
detectors and to estimate the Unruh temperature of a single accelerated
detector. The introduced method allows us to directly relate the observed
effects with the instantaneous proper acceleration of the detector.

order to develop a tool to share build and sustain knowledge and safety and
secondly to exploit the knowledge stored to prevent the reproduction of
accidents / incidents. This tool should ultimately lead to the proposal of
prevention and protection measures to minimize the risk level of a new
transport system and thus to improve safety. The approach to achieving this
goal largely depends on the use of artificial intelligence techniques and
rarely the use of a method of automatic learning in order to develop a
feasibility model of a software tool based on case based reasoning (CBR) to
exploit stored knowledge in order to create know-how that can help stimulate
domain experts in the task of analysis, evaluation and certification of a new
system.

vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In particular, we characterize, using
analysis and simulations, the behavior of the probability of outage (i.e. not
finding a requested data chunk at a neighbor) under freeway vehicular mobility.
First, we introduce a formal definition for the probability of outage in the
context of cooperative content caching. Second, we characterize, analytically,
the outage probability under vehicular and random mobility scenarios. Next, we
verify the analytical results using simulations and compare the performance
under a number of plausible mobility scenarios. This provides key insights into
the problem and the involved trade-offs and enable us to assess the potential
opportunity offered by the, somewhat structured, vehicular mobility that can be
exploited by cooperative content caching schemes. The presented numerical
results exhibit complete agreement between the analytical and simulation
studies. Finally, we observe that vehicular mobility creates opportunities for
enhanced outage performance under practically relevant scenarios.

Whether the symmetric and asymmetric pulse shapes would fulfill these

Combinatorial Theory B",,"10.1016/j.jctb.2013.10.006",,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a recent paper, we showed that every sufficiently large regular digraph G
on n vertices whose degree is linear in n and which is a robust outexpander has
a decomposition into edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles. The main consequence of
this theorem is that every regular tournament on n vertices can be decomposed
into (n-1)/2 edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles, whenever n is sufficiently large.
This verified a conjecture of Kelly from 1968. In this paper, we derive a
number of further consequences of our result on robust outexpanders, the main
ones are the following: (i) an undirected analogue of our result on robust
outexpanders; (ii) best possible bounds on the size of an optimal packing of
edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles in a graph of minimum degree d for a large range
of values for d. (iii) a similar result for digraphs of given minimum
semidegree; (iv) an approximate version of a conjecture of Nash-Williams on
Hamilton decompositions of dense regular graphs; (v) the observation that dense
quasi-random graphs are robust outexpanders; (vi) a verification of the `very
dense' case of a conjecture of Frieze and Krivelevich on packing edge-disjoint
Hamilton cycles in random graphs; (vii) a proof of a conjecture of Erdos on the
size of an optimal packing of edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles in a random
tournament.

data to uniformize the wavelet across all sources and receivers. The required
wavelet estimation step is generally done in the homomorphic domain since this
is a convenient way to separate the phase and the amplitude spectrum in a
linear fashion. Unfortunately all surface-consistent deconvolutions make a
minimum-phase assumption which is likely to be sub-optimal. Recent developments
in statistical wavelet estimation demonstrate that nonminimum wavelets can be
estimated directly from seismic data, thus offering promise to create a
nonminimum phase surface-consistent deconvolution approach. Unfortunately the
major impediment turns out to be phase unwrapping. In this paper we review
several existing phase unwrapping techniques and discuss their advantages and
inconveniences.
