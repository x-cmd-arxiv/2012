electromagnetic field fluctuations of fast and Alfven waves are studied for a
low-beta multi-ion plasma in the inner corona. Their probable roles in heating
and accelerating the solar wind via Landau and cyclotron resonances are
quantified. We assume that (1) low-frequency Alfven and fast waves have the
same spectral shape and the same amplitude of power spectral density; (2) these
waves eventually reach ion cyclotron frequencies due to a turbulence cascade;
(3) kinetic wave-particle interaction powers the solar wind. The existence of
alpha particles in a dominant proton/electron plasma can trigger linear mode
conversion between oblique fast-whistler and hybrid alpha-proton cyclotron
waves. The fast-cyclotron waves undergo both alpha and proton cyclotron
resonances. The alpha cyclotron resonance in fast-cyclotron waves is much
stronger than that in Alfven-cyclotron waves. For alpha cyclotron resonance, an
oblique fast-cyclotron wave has a larger left-handed electric field
fluctuation, a smaller wave number, a larger local wave amplitude, and a
greater energization capability than a corresponding Alfven-cyclotron wave at
the same wave propagation angle \theta, particularly at $80^\circ$ < \theta <
$90^\circ$. When Alfven-cyclotron or fast-cyclotron waves are present, alpha
particles are the chief energy recipient. The transition of preferential
energization from alpha particles to protons may be self-modulated by
differential speed and temperature anisotropy of alpha particles via the
self-consistently evolving wave-particle interaction. Therefore, fast-cyclotron
waves as a result of linear mode coupling is a potentially important mechanism
for preferential energization of minor ions in the main acceleration region of
the solar wind.

full, spatial model of the planetary system. Both objects are assumed to be
deformed due to their own rotations, as well as due to the mutual tidal
interactions. The general relativity corrections are considered in terms of the
post-Newtonian approximation. Besides the conservative contributions to the
perturbing forces, there are also taken into account non-conservative effects,
i.e., the dissipation of the mechanical energy. This dissipation is a result of
the tidal perturbation on the velocity field in the internal zones with
non-zero turbulent viscosity (convective zones). Our main goal is to derive the
equations of the orbital motion as well as the equations governing
time-evolution of the spin vectors (angular velocities). We derive the
Lagrangian equations of the second kind for systems which do not conserve the
mechanical energy. Next, the equations of motion are averaged out over all fast
angles with respect to time-scales characteristic for conservative
perturbations. The final equations of motion are then used to study the
dynamics of the non-conservative model over time scales of the order of the age
of the star. We analyze the final state of the system as a function of the
initial conditions. Equilibria states of the averaged system are finally
discussed.

naturally the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix and largely degenerate neutrino

global U(1) family symmetries is characterized by a single Wolfenstein
parameter $\lambda \simeq 0.22$, and the charged-lepton mixing matrix has a
similar hierarchy structure as the CKM quark mixing matrix, we arrive at a
consistent prediction for the MNSP lepton-flavor mixing with a maximal

A kalman filter is used to make the tracking algorithm computationally
efficient. Object position in an image frame is predicted using the motion
model and a search window, centered at the predicted position is generated.
Object position is updated with the measurement from object detection. The
detected position is sent to the motion controller to move the gimbal so that
the object stays at the center of the image frame. Detection and tracking is
autonomously carried out on the payload computer and the system is able to work
in two different methods. The first method starts detecting and tracking using
a stored image patch. The second method allows the operator on the ground to
select the interest object for the UAV to track. The system is capable of
re-detecting an object, in the event of tracking failure. Performance of the
tracking system was verified both in the lab and on the field by mounting the
payload on a vehicle and simulating a flight. Tests show that the system can

statistics is important for Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) systems. With
accurate estimation of the mean duty cycle, u, and the mean off- and on-times
of PUs, DSA systems can more efficiently assign PU resources to its
subscribers, thus, increasing channel utilization. This paper presents a
mathematical analysis of the accuracy of estimating u, as well as the PU mean
off- and on-times, where the estimation accuracy is expressed as the mean
squared estimation error. The analysis applies for the traffic model assuming
exponentially distributed PU off- and on-times, which is a common model in
traffic literature. The estimation accuracy is quantified as a function of the
number of samples and observation window length, hence, this work provides
guidelines on traffic parameters estimation for both energy-constrained and
delay-constrained applications. For estimating u, we consider uniform,
non-uniform, and weighted sample stream averaging, as well as maximum
likelihood estimation. The estimation accuracy of the mean PU off- and on-times
is studied when maximum likelihood estimation is employed. Furthermore, we
develop algorithms for the blind estimation of the traffic parameters based on
the derived theoretical estimation accuracy expressions. We show that the
estimation error for all traffic parameters is lower bounded for a fixed
observation window length due to the correlation between the traffic samples.
Moreover, we prove that for estimating u, maximum likelihood estimation can
yield the same estimation error as weighted sample averaging using only half
the observation window length.

level of parallelism of particle filtering. Given a decomposition of the state
space into two nested sets of variables, the DPF uses a particle filter to
sample the first set and then conditions on this sample to generate a set of
samples for the second set of variables. The DPF can be understood as a variant
of the popular Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF), where the second step
is carried out using Monte Carlo approximations instead of analytical
inference. As a result, the range of applications of the DPF is broader than
the one for the RBPF. In this paper, we improve the DPF in two ways. First, we
derive a Monte Carlo approximation of the optimal proposal distribution and,
consequently, design and implement a more efficient look-ahead DPF. Although
the decentralized filters were initially designed to capitalize on parallel
implementation, we show that the look-ahead DPF can outperform the standard
particle filter even on a single machine. Second, we propose the use of bandit
algorithms to automatically configure the state space decomposition of the DPF.

traffic changes inside ISP Domain and then characterizes flows that carry
attack traffic. Two statistical metrics namely, Volume and Flow are used as
parameters to detect DDoS attacks. Effectiveness of an anomaly based detection

settings. Inaccurate threshold values cause a large number of false positives

methods are used to identify threshold values accurately and dynamically for
various statistical metrics. NS-2 network simulator on Linux platform is used

attack scenarios are implemented by varying total number of zombie machines and

model to the observed data in the inverse problem context. A novel procedure of
goodness of fit test is proposed, based on construction of reference
distributions using the `inverse' part of the given model. This is motivated by
an example from palaeoclimatology in which it is of interest to reconstruct
past climates using information obtained from fossils deposited in lake
sediment.
  Technically, given a model $f(Y\mid X,\theta)$, where $Y$ is the observed
data and $X$ is a set of (non-random) covariates, we obtain reference
distributions based on the posterior $\pi(\tilde X\mid Y)$, where $\tilde X$
must be interpreted as the {\it unobserved} random vector corresponding to the
{\it observed} covariates $X$. Put simply, if the posterior distribution
$\pi(\tilde X\mid Y)$ gives high density to the observed covariates $X$, or
equivalently, if the posterior distribution of $T(\tilde X)$ gives high density
to $T(X)$, where $T$ is any appropriate statistic, then we say that the model
fits the data. Otherwise the model in question is not adequate. We provide
decision-theoretic justification of our proposed approach and discuss other
theoretical and computational advantages. We demonstrate our methodology with
many simulated examples and three complex, high-dimensional, realistic
palaeoclimate problems, including the motivating palaeoclimate problem.

results show that siRNA strongly binds to SWCNT surface via unzipping its
base-pairs and the propensity of unzipping increases with the increase in the
diameter of the SWCNTs. The unzipping and subsequent wrapping events are
initiated and driven by van der Waals interactions between the aromatic rings
of siRNA nucleobases and the SWCNT surface. However, MD simulations of double
strand DNA (dsDNA) of the same sequence show that the dsDNA undergoes much less
unzipping and wrapping on the SWCNT in the simulation time scale of 70 ns. This
interesting difference is due to smaller interaction energy of thymidine of
dsDNA with the SWCNT compared to that of uridine of siRNA, as calculated by
dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT) methods. After the optimal
binding of siRNA to SWCNT, the complex is very stable which serves as one of
the major mechanisms of siRNA delivery for biomedical applications. Since siRNA
has to undergo unwinding process with the effect of RNA- induced silencing
complex, our proposed delivery mechanism by SWCNT possesses potential
advantages in achieving RNA interference (RNAi).

addition to the conventional transverse-field term. We apply this method to the
infinite-range ferromagnetic p-spin model, for which the conventional quantum
annealing has been shown to have difficulties to find the ground state
efficiently due to a first-order transition. We study the phase diagram of this
system both analytically and numerically. Using the static approximation, we
find that there exists a quantum path to reach the final ground state from the
trivial initial state that avoids first-order transitions for intermediate
values of p. We also study numerically the energy gap between the ground state
and the first excited state and find evidence for intermediate values of p that
the time complexity scales polynomially with the system size at a second-order
transition point along the quantum path that avoids first-order transitions.
These results suggest that quantum annealing would be able to solve this
problem with intermediate values of p efficiently in contrast to the case with
only simple transverse-field fluctuations.

around the impurity surfaces. If they are small and attractive, homeotropic

introduced by A. Abdollahi and M. Zarrin and some remarkable properties have
been proved. The aim of this paper is to study this graph (and some related
graphs, such as the non-commuting graph) and to discover the algebraic
structure of $S$ determined by the associated graph. It is shown that if a
finite semigroup $S$ has empty upper non-nilpotent graph then $S$ is positively
Engel. On the other hand, a semigroup has a complete upper non-nilpotent graph
if and only if it is a completely simple semigroup that is a band. One of the
main results states that if all connected ${\mathcal N}_{S}$-components of a
semigroup $S$ are complete (with at least two elements) then $S$ is a band that
is a semilattice of its connected components and, moreover, $S$ is an iterated
total ideal extension of its connected components. We also show that some
graphs, such as a cycle $C_{n}$ on $n$ vertices (with $n\geq 5$), are not the

semigroup is not nilpotent induces local information, i.e. some two-generated
subsemigroups are not nilpotent. It turns out that a finite monoid (in

non-confluent constructor systems (CS's) as programs in order to define
non-strict non-determi-nistic functions. Two semantic alternatives have been
usually considered for parameter passing with this kind of functions: call-time
choice and run-time choice. While the former is the standard choice of modern
FLP languages, the latter lacks some properties---mainly
compositionality---that have prevented its use in practical FLP systems.
Traditionally it has been considered that call-time choice induces a singular
denotational semantics, while run-time choice induces a plural semantics. We
have discovered that this latter identification is wrong when pattern matching
is involved, and thus we propose two novel compositional plural semantics for
CS's that are different from run-time choice.
  We study the basic properties of our plural semantics---compositionality,
polarity, monotonicity for substitutions, and a restricted form of the bubbling
property for constructor systems---and the relation between them and to
previous proposals, concluding that these semantics form a hierarchy in the
sense of set inclusion of the set of computed values. We have also identified a
class of programs characterized by a syntactic criterion for which the proposed
plural semantics behave the same, and a program transformation that can be used
to simulate one of them by term rewriting. At the practical level, we study how
to use the expressive capabilities of these semantics for improving the
declarative flavour of programs. We also propose a language which combines
call-time choice and our plural semantics, that we have implemented in Maude.
The resulting interpreter is employed to test several significant examples
showing the capabilities of the combined semantics.

groups: early-type OB stars and late-type KM stars, well separated from each
other. By comparison with Geneva stellar evolution models we derive initial
masses exceeding 8 solar masses for the OB stars, that are located along an
isochrone corresponding to a cluster age of about 4 million years. In addition,
we derive number ratios (e. g. N_WR/N_O) and compare them with predictions of
population synthesis models. We find that an instantaneous burst of star
formation at about 3.3 to 3.6\,Myr ago is the most likely scenario to form the
Quintuplet cluster. The late-type stars in the sample are red giant branch
(RGB) stars or red supergiants (RSGs) according to their spectral signatures.
It is discussed if they could physically belong to the Quintuplet cluster.
Furthermore, we apply a mass-luminosity relation to construct the initial mass
function (IMF) of the cluster. We find indications for a slightly top-heavy
IMF.

develop, and unusual `arcs' of instability arise also. The transition curves

diversity systems with practical communication constraints. More specifically,
we investigate the interplay between diversity, coding, and multiplexing gain
when the relay nodes do not act as dedicated repeaters, which only forward data
packets transmitted by the sources, but they attempt to pursue their own
interest by forwarding packets which contain a network-coded version of
received and their own data. We provide a very accurate analysis of the Average
Bit Error Probability (ABEP) for two network topologies with three and four
nodes, when practical communication constraints, i.e., erroneous decoding at
the relays and fading over all the wireless links, are taken into account.
Furthermore, diversity and coding gain are studied, and advantages and
disadvantages of cooperation and binary Network Coding (NC) are highlighted.
Our results show that the throughput increase introduced by NC is offset by a
loss of diversity and coding gain. It is shown that there is neither a coding
nor a diversity gain for the source node when the relays forward a
network-coded version of received and their own data. Compared to other results
available in the literature, the conclusion is that binary NC seems to be more
useful when the relay nodes act only on behalf of the source nodes, and do not
mix their own packets to the received ones. Analytical derivation and findings
are substantiated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.

spectral state, using data from INTEGRAL. We compare these results with those
from CGRO, and find a good agreement. Confirming previous studies, we find the
presence of a high-energy MeV tail beyond a thermal-Comptonization spectrum;
however, the tail is much softer and weaker than that recently published by
Laurent et al. In spite of this difference, the observed high-energy tail could
still be due to the synchrotron emission of the jet of Cyg X-1, as claimed by
Laurent et al.
  To test this possibility, we study optically-thin synchrotron and
self-Compton emission from partially self-absorbed jets. We develop formalisms
for calculating both emission of the jet base (which we define here as the
region where the jet starts its emission) and emission of the entire jet. We
require the emission to match that observed at the turnover energy. The
optically thin emission is dominated by that from the jet base, and it has to
become self-absorbed within it at the turnover frequency. We find this implies
the magnetic field strength at the jet base of B_0 prop. to z_0^4, where z_0 is
the distance of the base from the black-hole centre. The value of B_0 is then
constrained from below by the condition that the self-Compton emission is below
an upper limit in the GeV range, and from above by the condition that the
Poynting flux does not exceed the jet kinetic power. This yields B_0 of the
order of ~10^4 G and the location of the jet base at ~10^3 gravitational radii.
Using our formalism, we find the MeV tail can be due to jet synchrotron
emission, but this requires the electron acceleration at a rather hard
power-law index, p~1.3-1.6. For acceleration indices of p> 2, the amplitude of
the synchrotron component is much below that of MeV tail, and its origin is
likely to be due to hybrid Comptonization in the accretion flow.

censored survival data, the unspecified error distribution function involves
the regression coefficients. Motivated by developing an efficient estimating
method for the regression parameters, we propose a general sieve M-theorem for

the sieve maximum likelihood estimation in the linear regression model for
censored survival data. The numerical implementation of the proposed estimating
method can be achieved through the conventional gradient-based search
algorithms such as the Newton--Raphson algorithm. We show that the proposed

topological insulator, also known as quantum spin Hall insulator. One of the
expected consequences is the existence of spin-filtered edge states that carry
dissipationless spin currents and undergo no back-scattering in the presence of
non-magnetic disorder, leading to quantization of conductance. Whereas, due to
the small size of spin orbit coupling in graphene, the experimental observation
of these remarkable predictions is unlikely, the theoretical understanding of
these spin-filtered states is shedding light on the electronic properties of
edge states in other two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators. Here we
review the effect of a variety of perturbations, like curvature, disorder, edge
reconstruction, edge crystallographic orientation, and Coulomb interactions on
the electronic properties of these spin filtered states.

distance function on a finite set, and idempotency of an associated matrix over
the tropical semiring. Recent research has shed new light on the structure
(algebraic, combinatorial and geometric) of tropical idempotents, and in this
paper we explore the consequences of this for the metric geometry of tropical
polytopes. We prove, for example, that every n-point metric space is realised
by the Hilbert projective metric on the vertices of a pure n-dimensional
tropical polytope in tropical n-space. More generally, every n-point asymmetric
distance function is realised by a residuation operator on the vertices of such
a polytope. In the symmetric case, we show that the maximal group of tropical
matrices containing the idempotent associated to a metric space is a direct
product of the real numbers with the isometry group of the space; it follows
that every direct product of a finite group with the real numbers arises as a
maximal subgroup of a sufficiently large finitary full tropical matrix
semigroup. In the process we also prove some new results about tropical
idempotent matrices, and note some semigroup-theoretic consequences which may
be of independent interest.

Watermark remains in the content after applying various attacks without any

the MRR. Fuzzy logic approach used in the method makes it to approximate the
best possible gain with an accurate scaling factor so that the watermark

the fuzzy perceptual mask combines all these non-linear variables to build a
simple, easy to use HVS model. Results shows that the system is robust against

tadpoles previously studied in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The young stellar
mass in the head scales linearly with restframe galaxy luminosity, ranging from
~10^5 M_solar at galaxy absolute magnitude U=-13 mag to 10^9 M_solar at U=-20
mag. The corresponding head surface density increases from several M_solar
pc^{-2} locally to 10-100 M_solar pc^{-2} at high redshift, and the star
formation rate per unit area in the head increases from ~0.01 M_solar yr^{-1}
kpc^{-2} locally to ~1 M_solar yr^{-1} kpc^{-2} at high z. These local values
are normal for star-forming regions, and the increases with redshift are
consistent with other cosmological star formation rates, most likely reflecting
an increase in gas abundance. The tails in the local sample look like
bulge-free galaxy disks. Their photometric ages decrease from several Gyr to
several hundred Myr with increasing z, and their surface densities are more
constant than the surface densities of the heads. The far outer intensity
profiles in the local sample are symmetric and exponential. We suggest that
most local tadpoles are bulge-free galaxy disks with lopsided star formation,
perhaps from environmental effects such as ram pressure or disk impacts, or
from a Jeans length comparable to half the disk size.

integrable model, which describes a system of $n$ spins coupled to a single
harmonic oscillator. We focus on the singularities of the vector-valued moment
map whose components are the $n+1$ mutually commuting conserved Hamiltonians.
The level sets of the moment map corresponding to singular values may be viewed
as degenerate and often singular Arnold-Liouville torii. A particularly
interesting example of singularity corresponds to unstable equilibrium points
where the rank of the moment map is zero, or singular lines where the rank is
one. The corresponding level sets can be described as a reunion of smooth
strata of various dimensions. Using the Lax representation, the associated
spectral curve and the separated variables, we show how to construct
explicitely these level sets. A main difficulty in this task is to select,
among possible complex solutions, the physically admissible family for which
all the spin components are real. We obtain explicit solutions to this problem
in the rank zero and one cases. Remarkably this corresponds exactly to
solutions obtained previously by Yuzbashyan and whose geometrical meaning is
therefore revealed. These solutions can be described as multi-mode solitons
which can live on strata of arbitrary large dimension. In these solitons, the
energy initially stored in some excited spins (or atoms) is transferred at
finite times to the oscillator mode (photon) and eventually comes back into the
spin subsystem. But their multi-mode character is reflected by a large
diversity in their shape, which is controlled by the choice of the initial
condition on the stratum.

a smooth domain wall with a kink configuration in the valley index. Our results

propositional logic has as its equivalent algebraic semantics the equational
class of cancellative hoops. Fixing a strong unit in a cancellative hoop
-equivalently, in the enveloping lattice-ordered abelian group- amounts to
fixing a gauge scale for falsity. In this paper we show that any strong unit in
a finitely presented cancellative hoop H induces naturally (i.e., in a
representation-independent way) an automorphism-invariant positive normalized
linear functional on H. Since H is representable as a uniformly dense set of
continuous functions on its maximal spectrum, such functionals -in this context
usually called states- amount to automorphism-invariant finite Borel measures
on the spectrum. Different choices for the unit may be algebraically unrelated
(e.g., they may lie in different orbits under the automorphism group of H), but
our second main result shows that the corresponding measures are always
absolutely continuous w.r.t. each other, and provides an explicit expression

comparisons constitute a valuable tool to constrain both the shock
characteristics and pre-shock conditions. Methods. New CO observations from the
shocked regions with the APEX and SOFIA telescopes are presented and combined.
The integrated intensities are compared to the outputs of a grid of models,
which were combined from an MHD shock code that calculates the dynamical and
chemical structure of these regions, and a radiative transfer module based on
the 'large velocity gradient' (LVG) approximation. Results. We base our
modelling method on the higher J CO transitions, which unambiguously trace the
passage of a shock wave. We provide fits for the blue- and red-lobe components

states (MPS) for the representation of the basis states. The direct use of
matrix product states combined with an ex-post reorthogonalization method
allows to avoid several shortcomings of the original approach, namely the

sandwich functionally graded material (FGM) plates are investigated using
QUAD-8 shear flexible element developed based on higher order structural
theory. This theory accounts for the realistic variation of the displacements
through the thickness. The governing equations obtained here are solved for
static analysis considering two types of sandwich FGM plates, viz., homogeneous
face sheets with FGM core and FGM face sheets with homogeneous hard core. The
in-plane and rotary inertia terms are considered for vibration studies. The
accuracy of the present formulation is tested considering the problems for
which three-dimensional elasticity solutions are available. A detailed
numerical study is carried out based on various higher-order models to examine
the influence of the gradient index and the plate aspect ratio on the
global/local response of different sandwich FGM plates.

perturbations of a Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker model with a massive
scalar field as matter content. We consider the case of compact spatial
sections (thus avoiding infrared divergences), with the topology of a
three-sphere. After expanding the perturbations in series of eigenfunctions of
the Laplace-Beltrami operator, the Hamiltonian of the system is written up to
quadratic order in them. We fix the gauge of the local degrees of freedom in
two different ways, reaching in both cases the same qualitative results. A
canonical transformation, which includes the scaling of the matter field
perturbations by the scale factor of the geometry, is performed in order to
arrive at a convenient formulation of the system. We then study the
quantization of these perturbations in the classical background determined by
the homogeneous variables. Based on previous work, we introduce a Fock
representation for the perturbations in which: (a) the complex structure is
invariant under the isometries of the spatial sections and (b) the field
dynamics is implemented as a unitary operator. These two properties select not
only a unique unitary equivalence class of representations, but also a
preferred field description, picking up a canonical pair of field variables
among all those that can be obtained by means of a time-dependent scaling of
the matter field (completed into a linear canonical transformation). Finally,
we present an equivalent quantization constructed in terms of gauge-invariant
quantities. We prove that this quantization can be attained by a mode-by-mode
time-dependent linear canonical transformation which admits a unitary
implementation, so that it is also uniquely determined.

were carried out in March 2006 in the Class II methanol maser transition at
6.668 GHz and three of the four excited OH maser hyperfine transitions at 6
GHz. Methanol maser emission is found towards both W51 Main and South. We did
not detect any emission in the excited OH maser lines at 6.030 and 6.049 GHz
down to a 3 sigma limit of ~20 mJy per beam. Excited OH maser emission at 6.035
GHz is only found towards W51 Main. This emission is highly circularly
polarised (typically 45% and up to 87%). Seven Zeeman pairs were identified in
this transition, one of which contains detectable linear polarisation. The
magnetic field strength derived from these Zeeman pairs ranges from +1.6 to
+6.8 mG, consistent with the previously published magnetic field strengths
inferred from the OH ground-state lines. The bulk of the methanol maser
emission is associated with W51 Main, sampling a total area of ~3""x2.2"" (i.e.,
~16200x11900 AU), while only two maser components, separated by ~2.5"", are
found in the W51 South region. The astrometric distributions of both 6.668-GHz
methanol and 6.035-GHz excited-OH maser emission in the W51 Main/South region
are presented here. The methanol masers in W51 Main show a clear coherent
velocity and spatial structure with the bulk of the maser components
distributed into 2 regions showing a similar conical opening angle with of a
central velocity of ~+55.5 km/s and an expansion velocity of =<5 km/s. The mass
contained in this structure is estimated to be at least 22 solar masses. The
location of maser emission in the two afore-mentioned lines is compared with
that of previously published OH ground-state emission. Association with the
UCHII regions in the W51 Main/South complex and relationship of the masers to
infall or outflow in the region are discussed.

  nuclei at energies around the Coulomb barrier","11 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.85.044614",,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to describe heavy-ion fusion reactions around the Coulomb barrier
with an actinide target nucleus, we propose a model which combines the
coupled-channels approach and a fluctuation-dissipation model for dynamical
calculations. This model takes into account couplings to the collective states
of the interacting nuclei in the penetration of the Coulomb barrier and the
subsequent dynamical evolution of a nuclear shape from the contact
configuration. In the fluctuation-dissipation model with a Langevin equation,
the effect of nuclear orientation at the initial impact on the prolately
deformed target nucleus is considered. Fusion-fission, quasi-fission and deep
quasi-fission are separated as different Langevin trajectories on the potential
energy surface. Using this model, we analyze the experimental data for the mass
distribution of fission fragments (MDFF) in the reactions of
$^{34,36}$S+$^{238}$U and $^{30}$Si+$^{238}$U at several incident energies
around the Coulomb barrier. We find that the time scale in the quasi-fission as
well as the deformation of fission fragments at the scission point are
different between the $^{30}$Si+$^{238}$U and $^{36}$S+$^{238}$U systems,
causing different mass asymmetries of the quasi-fission.

Var(A) {\subseteq} Var(B) for every atoms A and B. This condition is satisfied
by any atom ordering compatible with a lexicographic, recursive, or multiset

resolution and its main novelty is the on-the-fly construction of a finite
complexity atom ordering. In contrast with the usual redundancy, we give a new
redundancy notion and we prove that during the saturation a non-redundant
inference by a priori ordered resolution is also an inference by a posteriori
ordered resolution. We also prove that if a set S of clauses is saturated with
respect to an atom ordering as described above then the problem of whether a
clause C is entailed from S is decidable.
