conformal invariant functional, and its critical points are the harmonic maps.
Our main result is a generalization of this theorem when the starting manifold
is even dimensional. We then build a conformal invariant functional for the
maps between two Riemannian manifolds. Its critical points then called
C--harmonic are the solutions of a nonlinear elliptic PDE of order $n$, which
is conformal covariant with respect to the start manifold. For the trivial case
of real or complex functions of $M$, we find again the GJMS operator, with a
leading part power to the $n/2$ of the Laplacian. When $n$ is odd, we prove
that the constant term of the asymptotic expansion of the energy of an
asymptotically harmonic map on an AHE manifold $(M^{n+1},g_+)$ is an absolute
invariant of $g_+$.

were taken into account. The north-south asymmetry of the magnetic fluxes was
considered as well as the imbalance between positive and negative fluxes. The
north-south asymmetry displays a regular alternation of the dominant hemisphere
during the solar cycle: the northern hemisphere dominated in the ascending
phase, the southern one in the descending phase during Solar Cycles 21-23. The
sign of the imbalance did not change during the 11 years from one polar-field
reversal to the next and always coincided with the sign of the Sun's polar
magnetic field in the northern hemisphere. The dominant sign of leading
sunspots in one of the hemispheres determines the sign of the magnetic-flux
imbalance. The sign of the north-south asymmetry of the magnetic fluxes and the
sign of the imbalance of the positive and the negative fluxes are related to
the quarter of the 22-year magnetic cycle where the magnetic configuration of
the Sun remains constant (from the minimum where the sunspot sign changes
according to Hale's law to the magnetic-field reversal and from the reversal to
the minimum). The sign of the north-south asymmetry for the time interval
considered was determined by the phase of the 11-year cycle (before or after
the reversal); the sign of the imbalance of the positive and the negative
fluxes depends on both the phase of the 11-year cycle and on the parity of the

Condensation phenomena, of the harmonic analysis aspects arising from additive
and density zero perturbations, previously investigated by the author in a
separate work. Concerning the appearance of the Bose-Einstein Condensation, the
results are surprisingly in accordance with the previous ones, despite the lack
of amenability. We indeed first show the following fact. Even when the critical
density is finite (which is implied in all the models under consideration,
thanks to the appearance of the hidden spectrum), if the adjacency operator of
the graph is recurrent, it is impossible to exhibit temperature locally normal
states (i.e. states for which the local particle density is finite) describing
the condensation at all. The same occurs in the transient cases for which it is
impossible to exhibit locally normal states describing the Bose--Einstein
Condensation at mean particle density strictly greater than the critical
density . In addition, for the transient cases, in order to construct locally
normal temperature states through infinite volume limits of finite volume Gibbs
states, a careful choice of the the sequence of the finite volume chemical
potential should be done. For all such states, the condensate is essentially
allocated on the base--point supporting the perturbation. This leads that the
particle density always coincide with the critical one. It is shown that all
such temperature states are Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states for a natural
dynamics. The construction of such a dynamics, which is a very delicate issue,
is also done.

We study the evolution of the shocked stellar and pulsar winds on scales in
which the orbital motion is important. Potential sites of non-thermal activity
are investigated. Relativistic hydrodynamical simulations in two dimensions,
performed with the code PLUTO and using the adaptive mesh refinement technique,
are used to model interacting stellar and pulsar winds on scales ~80 times the
distance between the stars. The hydrodynamical results suggest the suitable
locations of sites for particle acceleration and non-thermal emission. In
addition to the shock formed towards the star, the shocked and unshocked
components of the pulsar wind flowing away from the star terminate by means of
additional strong shocks produced by the orbital motion. Strong instabilities
lead to the development of turbulence and an effective two-wind mixing in both
the leading and trailing sides of the interaction structure, which starts to
merge with itself after one orbit. The adopted moderate pulsar-wind Lorentz
factor already provides a good qualitative description of the phenomena
involved in high-mass binaries with pulsars, and can capture important physical
effects that would not appear in non-relativistic treatments. Simulations show
that shocks, instabilities, and mass-loading yield efficient mass, momentum,
and energy exchanges between the pulsar and the stellar winds. This renders a
rapid increase in the entropy of the shocked structure, which will likely be
disrupted on scales beyond the simulated ones. Several sites of particle
acceleration and low- and high-energy emission can be identified. Doppler
boosting will have significant and complex effects on radiation.

our total sample of reddened quasars from the UKIDSS-LAS to 12 at z=1.4-2.7. At
these redshifts, Ha (6563A) is in the K-band. However, the mean Ha equivalent
width of the reddened quasars is only ten per cent larger than that of the
optically selected population and cannot explain the extreme colours. Instead,
dust extinction of Av~2-6 mags is required to reproduce the continuum colours
of our sources. This is comparable to the dust extinctions seen in
submillimetre galaxies at similar redshifts. We argue that the AGN are likely
being observed in a relatively short-lived breakout phase when they are
expelling gas and dust following a massive starburst, subsequently turning into
UV-luminous quasars. Some of our quasars show direct evidence for strong
outflows (v~800-1000 km/s) affecting the Ha line consistent with this scenario.
We predict that a larger fraction of reddened quasar hosts are likely to be
submillimetre bright compared to the UV-luminous quasar population. We use our
sample to place new constraints on the fraction of obscured Type 1 AGN likely
to be missed in optical surveys. Taken at face-value our findings suggest that
the obscured fraction depends on quasar luminosity. The space density of
obscured quasars is ~5x that inferred for UV-bright quasars from the SDSS
luminosity function at Mi<-30 but seems to drop at lower luminosities even

elliptic problem on a compact smooth connected and oriented surface. An
interior penalty (IP) method is introduced on a discrete surface and we derive
a-priori error estimates by relating the latter to the original surface via the
lift introduced in Dziuk (1988). The estimates suggest that the geometric error
terms arising from the surface discretisation do not affect the overall
convergence rate of the IP method when using linear ansatz functions. This is
then verified numerically for a number of test problems. An intricate issue is
the approximation of the surface conormal required in the IP formulation,
choices of which are investigated numerically. Furthermore, we present a
generic implementation of test problems on surfaces.

bounds of Value Iteration with errors bounded by $\epsilon$ at each iteration
from $\frac{\gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2}\epsilon$ to
$\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}\epsilon$, which is significant in the usual situation
when $\gamma$ is close to 1. Given Bellman operators that can only be computed
with some error $\epsilon$, a surprising consequence of this result is that the

planetary systems. Eccentric, Jupiter-sized planets are particularly
interesting: they may link the ""cold"" Jupiters beyond the ice line to close-in
hot Jupiters, which are unlikely to have formed in situ. To date,
eccentricities of individual transiting planets primarily come from radial
velocity measurements. Kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting Jupiters
spanning a range of periods, but the faintness of the host stars precludes
radial velocity follow-up of most. Here we demonstrate a Bayesian method of
measuring an individual planet's eccentricity solely from its transit light
curve using prior knowledge of its host star's density. We show that eccentric
Jupiters are readily identified by their short ingress/egress/total transit
durations -- part of the ""photoeccentric"" light curve signature of a planet's
eccentricity --- even with long-cadence Kepler photometry and
loosely-constrained stellar parameters. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration
of parameter posteriors naturally marginalizes over the periapse angle and
automatically accounts for the transit probability. To demonstrate, we use
three published transit light curves of HD 17156 b to measure an eccentricity
of e = 0.71 +0.16/-0.09, in good agreement with the discovery value e =
0.67+/-0.08 based on 33 radial-velocity measurements. We present two additional
tests using actual Kepler data. In each case the technique proves to be a
viable method of measuring exoplanet eccentricities and their confidence
intervals. Finally, we argue that this method is the most efficient, effective
means of identifying the extremely eccentric, proto hot Jupiters predicted by
Socrates et al. (2012).

impossible to accommodate a light Higgs scalar of mass ~125 GeV. We present
several benchmark points which are expandable to slopes and planes. Natural
SUSY is difficult to see at LHC unless some third generation squarks are very

charginos and neutralinos via numerous possibilities, leading to a rather

conjecture that the incorporation of a Peccei-Quinn sector or light moduli into
the theory will augment higgsino dark matter production, possibly together with
an admixture of axions. We present rates for direct and indirect higgsino dark

bolometers at low, ~10""-30"", resolution. All three sources -- AzTEC/C1, Cosbo-3
and Cosbo-8 -- are identified to coincide with positions of 20 cm radio
sources. Cosbo-3, however, is not associated with the most likely radio
counterpart, closest to the MAMBO source position, but that further away from
it. This illustrates the need for intermediate-resolution (~2"") mm-observations
to identify the correct counterparts of single-dish detected SMGs. All of our
three sources become prominent only at NIR wavelengths, and their mm-to-radio
flux based redshifts suggest that they lie at redshifts z>~2. As a proof of
concept, we show that photometric redshifts can be well determined for SMGs,
and we find photometric-redshifts of 5.6+/-1.2, 1.9+0.9(-0.5), and ~4 for

galaxies have radio-based star formation rates of >~1000 Msol/yr, and IR
luminosities of ~10^13 Lsol consistent with properties of high-redshift SMGs.

dampened brightening of [0.3 - 0.5] magnitude happens at M$_{H}$ and a plateau
or dimming of [-0.2 - -0.3] magnitude is seen in M$_{K}$. Comparing with
evolutionary models that vary gravity, metallicity, and cloud thickness we find
that a near constant temperature of 1200 $\pm$100 K along a narrow spectral
subtype of T0-T4 is required to account for the brightening and color magnitude
diagram of the L-dwarf/T-dwarf transition. Furthermore, there is a significant
population of both L and T dwarfs which are red or potentially ""ultra-cloudy""

correlation between enhanced photospheric dust and youth. For the low

extragalactic standard candle. In theory, the PNLF method should not work at
all, since the luminosities of the brightest planetary nebulae (PNe) should be
highly sensitive to the age of their host stellar population. Yet the method
appears robust, as it consistently produces < 10% distances to galaxies of all
Hubble types, from the earliest ellipticals to the latest-type spirals and
irregulars. It is therefore uniquely suited for cross-checking the results of
other techniques and finding small offsets between the Population I and
Population II distance ladders. We review the calibration of the method and
show that the zero points provided by Cepheids and the Tip of the Red Giant
Branch are in excellent agreement. We then compare the results of the PNLF with
those from Surface Brightness Fluctuation measurements, and show that, although
both techniques agree in a relative sense, the latter method yields distances
that are ~15% larger than those from the PNLF. We trace this discrepancy back
to the calibration galaxies and argue that, due to a small systematic error
associated with internal reddening, the true distance scale likely falls
between the extremes of the two methods. We also demonstrate how PNLF
measurements in the early-type galaxies that have hosted Type Ia supernovae can
help calibrate the SN Ia maximum magnitude-rate of decline relation. Finally,
we discuss how the results from space missions such as Kepler and Gaia can help
our understanding of the PNLF phenomenon and improve our knowledge of the
physics of local planetary nebulae.

gas-phase, one that includes accretion and desorption, and one, the complete
gas-grain network, that includes surface chemistry in addition. We compare our
results with observed molecular abundances for two representative IRDCs --
IRDC013.90-1 and IRDC321.73-1 -- using the molecular species N$_2$H$^+$,
HC$_3$N, HNC, HCO$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H, NH$_3$ and CS. IRDC013.90-1 is a cold IRDC,
with a temperature below 20 K, while IRDC321.73-1 is somewhat warmer, in the
range 20 - 30 K. We find that the complete gas-grain model fits the data very
well, but that the goodness-of-fit is not sharply peaked at a particular
temperature. Surface processes are important for the explanation of the high
gas-phase abundance of N$_2$H$^+$ in IRDC321.73-1. The general success of the
0-D model in reproducing single-dish observations of our limited sample of 8

electron transport in different ways. In the case of weak scattering strength,
electron trapping increase the electron density, hereafter boost the

the Seebeck coefficient slightly, the power factor still increases. In the case
of strong scattering strength, electron diffraction causes the redistribution

paper, we prove that the energy-momentum conservation is preserved and the
energy-momentum is well defined in Finslerian special relativity. The
Cherenkov-like process is forbidden in the Finslerian special relativity. Thus,
the superluminal neutrinos would not lose energy in their distant propagation.

crucial role in various astrophysical processes, including star formation,
accretion of matter, transport processes (e.g., transport of heat), and cosmic
rays. We identified a process ""ground state alignment"" as a new way to
determine the magnetic field direction in diffuse medium. The alignment is due
to anisotropic radiation impinging on the atom/ion, while the magnetic field
induces precession and realign the atom/ion and therefore the polarization of
the emitted or absorbed radiation reflects the direction of the magnetic field.
The atoms get aligned at their low levels and, as the life-time of the
atoms/ions we deal with is long, the alignment induced by anisotropic radiation
is susceptible to weak magnetic fields ($1{\rm G}\gtrsim B\gtrsim 10^{-15}$G).
Compared to the upper level Hanle effect, atomic realignment is most suitable
for the studies of magnetic field in the diffuse medium, where magnetic field
is relatively weak. In fact, the effects of atomic/ionic alignment, including
the realignment in magnetic field, were studied in the laboratory decades ago,
mostly in relation to the maser research. Recently, the atomic effect has been
already detected in observations from circumstellar medium and this is a
harbinger of future extensive magnetic field studies. A unique feature of the
atomic realignment is that they can reveal the 3D orientation of magnetic
field. In this article, we shall review the basic physical processes involved
in atomic realignment and its applications to interplanetary, circumstellar and
interstellar magnetic fields. In addition, our research reveals that the
polarization of the radiation arising from the transitions between fine and
hyperfine states of the ground level can provide a unique diagnostics of
magnetic fields, including those in the Early Universe.

formalized by Eichler and directed information theory developed by Massey and
Kramer. We particularly insist on the implication of two notions of causality
that may occur in physical systems. It is well accepted that dynamical
causality is assessed by the conditional transfer entropy, a measure appearing
naturally as a part of directed information. Surprisingly the notion of
instantaneous causality is often overlooked, even if it was clearly understood
in early works. In the bivariate case, instantaneous coupling is measured
adequately by the instantaneous information exchange, a measure that
supplements the transfer entropy in the decomposition of directed information.
In this paper, the focus is put on the multivariate case and conditional graph
modeling issues. In this framework, we show that the decomposition of directed
information into the sum of transfer entropy and information exchange does not
hold anymore. Nevertheless, the discussion allows to put forward the two
measures as pillars for the inference of causality graphs. We illustrate this
on two synthetic examples which allow us to discuss not only the theoretical
concepts, but also the practical estimation issues.

advantage of an isolobal analogy that can be established between the orbitals

analogous to classical resonance models. The effective Hamiltonians for all

between a bridge-charged diabatic state and a superposition representing the
canonical resonance. We find that the structure of the bridge-charged state
changes in a regular fashion across the series. The change is consistent with
an inversion of the sign of the charge carrier on the bridge, which changes
from an electron pair to a hole as the series is traversed.

model that induces a Poincar\'e supergeometry. The deformations of the geometry
due to gauging are briefly discussed. The possible $p$-form field strengths are
studied using supersymmetry and SO(8,n) symmetry. The set of such forms obeying
consistent Bianchi identities constitutes a Lie super co-algebra while the
demand that these identities admit solutions places a further constraint on the
possible representations of SO(8,n) that the forms transform under which can be
easily understood using superspace cohomology. The dual Lie superalgebra can
then be identified as the positive sector of a Borcherds superalgebra that

understanding, the most correct theory of gravity is general relativity. It is
therefore important to understand which degrees of freedom and which features
are lost when the relativistic universe is approximated, or rather replaced, by
a Newtonian one. This is the main purpose of our investigation. We first define
Newtonian cosmology and we give an overview on general relativity, both in its
standard and covariant formulations. We show how the two theories deal with
inhomogeneous cosmological models and we introduce the backreaction conjecture.
Then we review on how Newtonian gravity and general relativity relate to each
other in the fully non-linear regime. For this purpose we discuss frame theory.
We carry out the same investigation also in the weak-field, small-velocity
limit of general relativity, and we derive the Newtonian limit resorting to the
framework of post-Newtonian cosmology. Finally we remark that there are
solutions of Newtonian gravity which do not have any relativistic counterpart.

quantum dynamics is that the quantum trajectories subject to typical `guiding'
wavefunctions turn to be quite irregular, i.e. {\it chaotic} (in the dynamical
systems' sense). In the present paper, we consider mainly cases in which the
quantum trajectories are {\it ordered}, i.e. they have zero Lyapunov
characteristic numbers. We use perturbative methods to establish the existence
of such trajectories from a theoretical point of view, while we analyze their
properties via numerical experiments. Using a 2D harmonic oscillator system, we
first establish conditions under which a trajectory can be shown to avoid close
encounters with a moving nodal point, thus avoiding the source of chaos in this
system. We then consider series expansions for trajectories both in the
interior and the exterior of the domain covered by nodal lines, probing the
domain of convergence as well as how successful the series are in comparison
with numerical computations or regular trajectories. We then examine a
H\'{e}non - Heiles system possessing regular trajectories, thus generalizing
previous results. Finally, we explore a key issue of physical interest in the
context of the de Broglie - Bohm formalism, namely the influence of order in
the so-called {\it quantum relaxation} effect. We show that the existence of
regular trajectories poses restrictions to the quantum relaxation process, and
we give examples in which the relaxation is suppressed even when we consider
initial ensembles of only chaotic trajectories, provided, however, that the
system as a whole is characterized by a certain degree of order.

CO J=2-1,13CO J=2-1,13CO J=3-2 by the KOSMA 3 m telescope. The mapping of the
intensity ratio of 13CO J=3-2 and 13CO J=2-1 shows the distribution of the
temperature with two peaks, which don't coincide with IRAS22475+5939 source and
the center of the HII region, but at the edge of the HII region. The overlays
of the Spitzer IRAC 8um and CO contours indicate that they are associated with
each other and the strongest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission
is at the position of IRAS22475+5939 source. While the IRAS LRS spectrum at
7-23 um and the PHT-s spectrum at 2-12 um of IRAS22475+5939 source also exhibit
strong PAHs emission characters at the main PAH bands. The diversity of PAH
family should be responsible for the plateaus of PAHs emission in the PHT-s
spectrum and the IRAS-LRS spectrum. An analysis and modeling in infrared bands
suggest that IRAS22475+5939 is more likely to be a Class I YSO. Where this is
the case, the star is likely to have a temperature T_{EFF} \sim 9995.8 K, mass
\sim15.34 M_(sun), luminosity \sim 1.54*10^4 L_(sun) and age \sim 1.54*10^4 yr.
The model shows that the circumstellar disc emission is important for the
wavelength between 1 and 10 um, otherwise, envelope fluxes for lambda >10 um.
The bipolar outflow is confirmed in the molecular cloud. The excited star of
the HII region has the chance to be the driving source of the outflow. The high

of neutral and mildly ionised gas in the Milky Way halo, based on a large
absorption-selected data set. Multi-wavelength studies were performed combining
optical absorption line data of CaII and NaI with follow-up HI 21-cm emission
line observations along 408 sight lines towards low- and high-redshift QSOs. We
made use of archival optical spectra obtained with UVES/VLT. HI data were
extracted from the Effelsberg-Bonn HI survey and the Galactic All-Sky survey.
For selected sight lines we obtained deeper follow-up observations using the
Effelsberg 100-m telescope. CaII (NaI) halo absorbers at intermediate and high
radial velocities are present in 40-55% (20-35%) of the sightlines, depending
on the column density threshold chosen. Many halo absorbers show
multi-component absorption lines, indicating the presence of sub-structure. In
65% of the cases, absorption is associated with HI 21-cm emission. The CaII
(NaI) column density distribution function follows a power-law with a slope of
-2.2 (-1.4). Our absorption-selected survey confirms our previous results that
the Milky Way halo is filled with a large number of neutral gas structures
whose high column density tail represents the population of common HI high- and
intermediate-velocity clouds seen in 21-cm observations. We find that CaII/NaI
column density ratios in the halo absorbers are typically smaller than those in
the Milky Way disc, in the gas in the Magellanic Clouds, and in damped
Lyman-alpha systems. The small ratios (prominent in particular in high-velocity
components) indicate a lower level of Ca depletion onto dust grains in Milky
Way halo absorbers compared to gas in discs and inner regions of galaxies.

degree two, weight (k,2) and level one. Our approach is based on Satoh's
description of the module of vector-valued Siegel modular forms of weight (k,
2) and an explicit description of the Hecke action on Fourier expansions. We
highlight three experimental results: (1) we identify a rational eigenform in a
three dimensional space of cusp forms, (2) we observe that non-cuspidal
eigenforms of level one are not always rational and (3) we verify a number of
cases of conjectures about congruences between classical modular forms and
Siegel modular forms.

gain is derived. Many closed-form critical conditions for various control
schemes in terms of converter parameters are also derived. Some previously
known critical conditions become special cases in the generalized framework.
Given an arbitrary control scheme, a systematic procedure is proposed to derive
the critical condition for that control scheme. Different control schemes share
similar forms of critical conditions. For example, both V2 control and voltage
mode control have the same form of critical condition. A peculiar phenomenon in
average current mode control where subharmonic oscillation occurs in a window
value of pole can be explained by the derived critical condition. A ripple
amplitude index to predict subharmonic oscillation proposed in the past
research has limited application and is shown invalid for a converter with a
large pole.

GEO gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. These data have been searched for GWs
emitted by cataclysmic phenomena in the universe, by non-axisymmetric rotating
neutron stars or from a stochastic background in the frequency band of the
detectors. The sensitivity of GW searches is limited by noise produced by the
detector or its environment. It is therefore crucial to characterize the
various noise sources in a GW detector. This paper reviews the Virgo detector
noise sources, noise propagation, and conversion mechanisms which were
identified in the three first Virgo observing runs. In many cases, these
investigations allowed us to mitigate noise sources in the detector, or to
selectively flag noise events and discard them from the data. We present
examples from the joint LIGO-GEO-Virgo GW searches to show how well noise
transients and narrow spectral lines have been identified and excluded from the
Virgo data. We also discuss how detector characterization can improve the
astrophysical reach of gravitational-wave searches.

astronomy at mm wavelengths. The Antarctic plateau is recognized to be an ideal
site for mm and sub-mm observations, and the French/Italian base of Dome C is
among the best sites on Earth for these observations. In this paper we present
measurements, performed using the BRAIN-pathfinder experiment, at Dome C of the
atmospheric emission in intensity and polarization at 150GHz, one of the best
observational frequencies for CMB observations when considering cosmic signal
intensity, atmospheric transmission, detectors sensitivity, and foreground
removal. Careful characterization of the air-mass synchronous emission has been
performed, acquiring more that 380 elevation scans (i.e. ""skydip"") during the
third BRAIN-pathfinder summer campaign in December 2009/January 2010. The
extremely high transparency of the Antarctic atmosphere over Dome Concordia is
proven by the very low measured optical depth: <tau_I>=0.050 \pm 0.003 \pm
0.011 where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic error.
Mid term stability, over the summer campaign, of the atmosphere emission has
also been studied. Adapting the radiative transfer atmosphere emission model
""am"" to the particular conditions found at Dome C, we also infer the level of
the PWV content of the atmosphere, notoriously the main source of disturbance
in millimetric astronomy (<PWV>=0.77 +/- 0.06 + 0.15 - 0.12 mm). Upper limits
on the air-mass correlated polarized signal are also placed for the first time.
The degree of circular polarization of atmospheric emission is found to be
lower than 0.2% (95%CL), while the degree of linear polarization is found to be
lower than 0.1% (95%CL). These limits include signal-correlated instrumental
spurious polarization.

theories are often considered as a special case of a much more general
framework of generalized probabilistic theories. We first present a detailed
introduction to generalized probabilistic theories before we examine new
approaches towards a physical axiomatization of quantum theory. The main result
of the thesis is that one postulate concerning post-measurement states (which
have gained almost no attention in this context so far) is sufficient to rule
out all probabilistic theories with a polytopic state space, except for
classical theory. The postulate states that a measurement with a definite
outcome does not alter the state. This rules out almost all toy theories
considered so far, for instance the PR-box, but is compatible with quantum
theory. Thus, this result can be seen as an approach towards a classification
of quantum theory in physical terms. It only deals with local state spaces, in
contrast to other approaches that are mostly concerned with nonlocality in
composite systems.

mechanisms involved. The reason is the lack of information about magnon

demonstrate a conceptually new device that allows us to gather information on

between a hot and a cold source and connected thermally in parallel and
electrically in series. By controlling the relative orientation of the
magnetization in pairs of wires, the magnon-drag can be studied independently
of the electron and phonon-drag thermoelectric effects. Measurements as a
function of temperature reveal the effect on magnon drag following a variation
of magnon and phonon populations. This information is crucial to understand the
physics of electron-magnon interactions, magnon dynamics and thermal spin
transport.

decoherence will lessen and close the gap between them. To understand this
process, it is necessary to investigate the evolution of quantum walk under
different situation of decoherence. In this article, we study a non-Markovian
decoherent quantum walk on a line. In the short time regime, the behavior of
the walk deviates from both idea quantum walks and classical random walks. The
position variance as a measure of quantum walk starts oscillating from the
first several steps and tends to be linear on time and showing a diffusive
spread in the long time limit, which is caused by the non-Markovian dephasing
affecting on quantum correlations between quantum walker and his coin. We also
study both quantum discord and measurement-induced disturbance as measures of
quantum correlations and observe that both of them oscillate in the short time
regime and tend to be zero in the long time limit. Therefore quantum walk with
non-Markovian decoherence tends to diffusive spreading behavior in the long
time limit, while in the short time regime it oscillates between a ballistic
and diffusive spreading behavior, and the quantum correlation collapses and
revivals due to the memory effect.

input is limited to an independent Gaussian input. A ""single crossing point""
property is derived for each diagonal element of the MMSE matrix. iii) The
Gaussian input is allowed to be an arbitrary Gaussian random vector. A ""single
crossing point"" property is derived for each eigenvalue of the MMSE matrix.
  These three extensions are then translated to new information theoretic
properties on the mutual information, using the fundamental relationship
between estimation theory and information theory. The results of the last phase
are also translated to a new property of Fisher's information. Finally, the
applicability of all three extensions on information theoretic problems is
demonstrated through: a proof of a special case of Shannon's vector EPI, a
converse proof of the capacity region of the parallel degraded MIMO broadcast
channel (BC) under per-antenna power constrains and under covariance
constraints, and a converse proof of the capacity region of the compound
parallel degraded MIMO BC under covariance constraint.

complex region called Kookaburra, which includes two adjacent TeV $\gamma$-ray

revealed X-ray diffuse emission around a middle-aged pulsar PSR J1420-6048 and
a plausible PWN Rabbit with elongated sizes of $\sigma_{\rm X}=1^{\prime}.66$
and $\sigma_{\rm X}=1^{\prime}.49$, respectively. The peaks of the diffuse
X-ray emission are located within the $\gamma$-ray excess maps obtained by
H.E.S.S. and the offsets from the $\gamma$-ray peaks are $2^{\prime}.8$ for PSR
J1420-6048 and $4^{\prime}.5$ for Rabbit. The X-ray spectra of the two sources
were well reproduced by absorbed power-law models with $\Gamma=1.7-2.3$. The
spectral shapes tend to become softer according to the distance from the X-ray
peaks. Assuming the one zone electron emission model as the first order
approximation, the ambient magnetic field strengths of HESS J1420-607 and HESS
J1418-609 can be estimated as 3 $\mu$G, and $2.5 \mu$G, respectively. The X-ray
spectral and spatial properties strongly support that both TeV sources are
pulsar wind nebulae, in which electrons and positrons accelerated at
termination shocks of the pulsar winds are losing their energies via the
synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering as they are transported
outward.

sub-optimally in the studied contexts and requires careful calibration to
correct for unexpected and potentially misleading statistical behaviour. More
specifically, failure to recognise and correct for erroneous estimates of

alternative joint likelihood technique is introduced, which is designed to

encompasses the classical differential boundary value problems. In an extension
of the concept of Lopatinski and Shapiro, it associates to each operator two
symbols: a pseudodifferential principal symbol, which is a bundle homomorphism,
and an operator-valued boundary symbol. Ellipticity requires the invertibility
of both. If the underlying manifold is compact, elliptic elements define
Fredholm operators. Boutet de Monvel showed how then the index can be computed
in topological terms. The crucial observation is that elliptic operators can be
mapped to compactly supported $K$-theory classes on the cotangent bundle over
the interior of the manifold. The Atiyah-Singer topological index map, applied
to this class, then furnishes the index of the operator. Based on this result,
Fedosov, Rempel-Schulze and Grubb have given index formulas in terms of the
symbols. In this paper we survey previous work how C*-algebra K-theory can be
used to give a proof of Boutet de Monvel's index theorem for boundary value
problems, and how the same techniques yield an index theorem for families of
Boutet de Monvel operators. The key ingredient of our approach is a precise
description of the K-theory of the kernel and of the image of the boundary
symbol.

formula by Wilton to prove those conjectures. As example of applications, some
special cases are explored, yielding rapidly converging series representations
for the Ap\'{e}ry constant, $\zeta(3)$, and the Catalan constant, $G =
\beta(2)$. Interestingly, our series for $\,\zeta(3)\,$ converges faster than
that used by Ap\'{e}ry in his irrationality proof (1978). Also, our series for
$\,G\,$ converges faster than a celebrated one discovered by Ramanujan (1915).
At last, I present a simpler, more direct proof for a recent theorem by
Katsurada which generalizes the above results.

introduction of a new scheme for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays (GCR),
which for the first time enables a self-consistent calculation of their
composition during galactic evolution. The scheme accounts for key features of
the present-day GCR source composition, it is based on the wind yields of the
Geneva models of rotating, mass losing stars and it is fully coupled to a
detailed galactic chemical evolution code. We find that the adopted GCR source
composition accounts naturally for the observations of primary Be and helps
understanding why Be follows closer Fe than O. We find that GCR produce ~70% of
the solar B11/B10 isotopic ratio; the remaining 30% of B11 presumably result
from neutrino-nucleosynthesis in massive star explosions. We find that GCR and
primordial nucleosynthesis can make at most 30% of solar Li. At least half of
solar Li has to originate in low-mass stellar sources (red giants, asymptotic
giant branch stars or novae), but the required average yields of those sources
are found to be much larger than obtained in current models of stellar
nucleosynthesis. We also present radial profiles of LiBeB elemental and
isotopic abundances in the Milky Way disc. We argue that the shape of those
profiles - and the late evolution of LiBeB in general - reveals important
features of the production of those light elements through primary and
secondary processes.

  Mathematical Society, 2018, 253 (1206)",,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is concerned with a complete asymptoticanalysis as $\mathfrak{E}
\to 0$ of the stationary Munk equation $\partial\_x\psi-\mathfrak{E} \Delta^2
\psi=\tau$ in a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbf{R}^2$, supplemented with
boundaryconditions for $\psi $ and $\partial\_n \psi$. This equation is a
simplemodel for the circulation of currents in closed basins, the variables$x$
and $y$ being respectively the longitude and the latitude. A crudeanalysis
shows that as $\mathfrak{E} \to 0$, the weak limit of $\psi$ satisfiesthe
so-called Sverdrup transport equation inside the domain, namely$\partial\_x
\psi^0=\tau$, while boundary layers appear in the vicinity ofthe boundary.These
boundary layers, which are the main center of interest of thepresent paper,
exhibit several types of peculiar behaviour. First, thesize of the boundary
layer on the western and eastern boundary, whichhad already been computed by
several authors, becomes formally verylarge as one approaches northern and
southern portions of the boudary,i.e. pieces of the boundary on which the
normal is vertical. Thisphenomenon is known as geostrophic degeneracy. In order
to avoid suchsingular behaviour, previous studies imposed restrictive
assumptionson the domain $\Omega$ and on the forcing term $\tau$. Here, we
provethat a superposition of two boundary layers occurs in the vicinity ofsuch
points: the classical western or eastern boundary layers, andsome northern or
southern boundary layers, whose mathematicalderivation is completely new. The
size of northern/southern boundarylayers is much larger than the one of western
boundary layers($\mathfrak{E}^{1/4}$ vs. $\mathfrak{E}^{1/3}$). We explain in
detail how the superpositiontakes place, depending on the geometry of the
boundary.Moreover, when the domain $\Omega$ is not connex in the $x$
direction,$\psi^0$ is not continuous in $\Omega$, and singular layers appear
inorder to correct its discontinuities. These singular layers areconcentrated
in the vicinity of horizontal lines, and thereforepenetrate the interior of the
domain $\Omega$. Hence we exhibit some kindof boundary layer separation.
However, we emphasize that we remainable to prove a convergence theorem, so
that the singular layerssomehow remain stable, in spite of the
separation.Eventually, the effect of boundary layers is non-local in
severalaspects. On the first hand, for algebraic reasons, the boundary
layerequation is radically different on the west and east parts of theboundary.
As a consequence, the Sverdrup equation is endowed with aDirichlet condition on
the East boundary, and no condition on the Westboundary. Therefore western and
eastern boundary layers have in factan influence on the whole domain $\Omega$,
and not only near theboundary. On the second hand, the northern and southern
boundary layerprofiles obey a propagation equation, where the space variable
$x$plays the role of time, and are therefore not local.

of galactic winds driven by massive stars because direct injection of supernova
energy in thermal form leads to strong radiative losses, rendering the feedback
inefficient. We argue that the main cause of the catastrophic cooling is a
mismatch between the mass of the gas in which the energy is injected and the
mass of the parent stellar population. Because too much mass is heated, the
temperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic
arguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical
resolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected
thermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose
and test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum
temperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both
particle- and grid-based codes. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics
simulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in dark
matter haloes with total mass 10^10 and 10^12 h^-1 solar masses. The thermal
feedback strongly suppresses the star formation rate and can drive massive,
large-scale outflows without the need to turn off radiative cooling
temporarily. In accord with expectations derived from analytic arguments, for
sufficiently high resolution the results become insensitive to the imposed
temperature jump and also agree with high-resolution simulations employing
kinetic feedback.

situations can be distinguished, with machine learning techniques, provided the
data are rich enough. In order to do this, we study the problem of inferring a
kinetic Ising model, stationary or nonstationary, from the available data. We
apply the inference procedure to two data sets: one from salamander retinal
ganglion cells and the other from a realistic computational cortical network
model. We show that many aspects of the concerted activity of the salamander
retinal neurons can be traced simply to the external input. A model of
non-interacting neurons subject to a non-stationary external field outperforms
a model with stationary input with couplings between neurons, even accounting
for the differences in the number of model parameters. When couplings are added
to the non-stationary model, for the retinal data, little is gained: the
inferred couplings are generally not significant. Likewise, the distribution of
the sizes of sets of neurons that spike simultaneously and the frequency of
spike patterns as function of their rank (Zipf plots) are well-explained by an
independent-neuron model with time-dependent external input, and adding
connections to such a model does not offer significant improvement. For the
cortical model data, robust couplings, well correlated with the real
connections, can be inferred using the non-stationary model. Adding connections
to this model slightly improves the agreement with the data for the probability
of synchronous spikes but hardly affects the Zipf plot.

workload due to the plethora of graph structured data becoming available. An
aspect of graph algorithms that has hitherto not received much interest is the
effect of memory hierarchy on accesses. A typical system today has multiple
levels in the memory hierarchy with differing units of locality; ranging across
cache lines, TLB entries and DRAM pages. We postulate that it is possible to
allocate graph structured data in main memory in a way as to improve the
spatial locality of the data. Previous approaches to improving cache locality
have focused only on a single unit of locality, either the cache line or
virtual memory page. On the other hand cache oblivious algorithms can optimise
layout for all levels of the memory hierarchy but unfortunately need to be
specially designed for individual data structures. In this paper we explore
hierarchical blocking as a technique for closing this gap. We require as input
a specification of the units of locality in the memory hierarchy and lay out
the input graph accordingly by copying its nodes using a hierarchy of breadth
first searches. We start with a basic algorithm that is limited to trees and
then extend it to arbitrary graphs. Our most efficient version requires only a
constant amount of additional space. We have implemented versions of the
algorithm in various environments: for C programs interfaced with macros, as an
extension to the Boost object oriented graph library and finally as a
modification to the traversal phase of the semispace garbage collector in the

are important to our understanding of the nucleosynthesis of elements heavier
than the iron group. We present a detailed abundance analysis of carbon and
twelve neutron-capture elements from Sr up to Pb for a peculiar halo star
G24-25 with [Fe/H] = -1.4 in order to probe its origin. The equivalent widths
of unblended lines are measured from high resolution NOT/FIES spectra and used
to derive abundances based on Kurucz model atmospheres. In the case of CH, Pr,
Eu, Gd, and Pb lines, the abundances are derived by fitting synthetic profiles
to the observed spectra. Abundance analyses are performed both relative to the
Sun and to a normal halo star G16-20 that has similar stellar parameters as
G24-25. We find that G24-25 is a halo subgiant star with an unseen component.
It has large overabundances of carbon and heavy s-process elements and mild
overabundances of Eu and light s-process elements. This abundance distribution
is consistent with that of a typical CH giant. The abundance pattern can be
explained by mass transfer from a former asymptotic giant branch component,
which is now a white dwarf.

we find that the skew and the curvature of the smile are very poorly reproduced
by the standard Edgeworth (cumulant) expansion. Most notably, the relation
between the skew and the skewness is inverted at small and large vols, a
feature that none of the model studied so far is able to reproduce.
Furthermore, the around-the-money curvature of the smile is found to be very
small, in stark contrast with the highly kurtic nature of the returns.

interaction between the two. The aim is a complete description of particle
production at all transverse momentum ($p_{t}$) scales. In this picture, the
hard initial scatterings result in mainly longitudinal flux tubes, with
transversely moving pieces carrying the $p_{t}$ of the partons from hard
scatterings. These flux tubes constitute eventually both bulk matter (which
thermalizes and flows) and jets. We introduce a criterion based on parton
energy loss to decide whether a given string segment contributes to the bulk or
leaves the matter to end up as a jet of hadrons. Essentially low $p_{t}$
segments from inside the volume will constitute the bulk, high $p_{t}$ segments
(or segments very close to the surface) contribute to the jets. The latter ones
appear after the usual flux tube breaking via q-qbar production (Schwinger
mechanism). Interesting is the transition region: Intermediate $p_{t}$ segments
produced inside the matter close to the surface but having enough energy to
escape, are supposed to pick up q-qbar pairs from the thermal matter rather
than creating them via the Schwinger mechanism. This represents a communication
between jets and the flowing bulk matter (fluid-jet interaction). Also very
important is the interaction between jet hadrons and the soft hadrons from the
fluid freeze-out. We employ the new picture to investigate Pb-Pb collisions at
2.76 TeV. We discuss the centrality and $p_{t}$ dependence of particle
production and long range dihadron correlations at small and large $p_{t}$.

result to arbitrary codimension. More precisely, we show that the p-th de Rham

represented by differential forms of degree (pD)^{O(pm)}. This result is
relevant for the algorithmic computation of the cohomology, but is also
motivated by questions in the theory of ordinary differential equations related
to the infinitesimal Hilbert 16th problem.

mesoscopic single-channel rings and multi-channel cylinders within a
tight-binding formalism. The main focus of this review is to illustrate how the
long standing anomalies between the calculated and measured current amplitudes
carried by a small conducting ring upon the application of a magnetic flux
$\phi$ can be removed. We discuss two different cases. First, we examine the
combined effect of second-neighbor hopping integral and Hubbard correlation on
the enhancement of persistent current in presence of disorder. A significant
change in current amplitude is observed compared to the traditional
nearest-neighbor hopping model and the current amplitude becomes quite
comparable to experimental realizations. In the other case we verify that in
presence of spin-orbit interaction a considerable enhancement of persistent
current amplitude takes place, and the current amplitude in a disordered ring
becomes almost comparable to that of an ordered one. In addition to these, we
also present the detailed band structures and some other related issues to get
a complete picture of the phenomena at the microscopic level.

we extract the spherical solutions of the theory. Using these spherical
solutions to describe the Sun's gravitational field, we use recently determined
supplementary advances of planetary perihelia, to infer upper bounds on the
allowed f(T) corrections. We find that the maximal allowed divergence of the
gravitational potential in f(T) gravity from that in the teleparallel
equivalent of General Relativity is of the order of 6.2 \times 10^{-10}, in the
applicability region of our analysis. This is much smaller than the
corresponding (significantly small too) divergence that is predicted from
cosmological observations, as expected. Such a tiny allowed divergence from the
linear form should be taken into account in f(T) model building.

encounters with extraterrestrials provide a rather bizarre image of Aliens
behavior on Earth. It is far from stereotypes of human space exploration. The
reported Aliens are not missions of diplomats, scientists nor even invasion
fleets; typical encounters are with lone ETs (or small groups), and involve
curious behavior: abductions and experiments (often of sexual nature), cattle
mutilations, localized killing and mixing in human society using various
methods. Standard scientific explanations of these social memes point to
influence of cultural artifacts (movies, literature) on social imagination,
projection of our fears and observations of human society, and, in severe
cases, psychic disorder of the involved individuals. In this work we propose an
alternate explanation, claiming that the memes might be the result of
observations of actual behavior of true Aliens, who, visiting Earth behave in a
way that is then reproduced by such memes. The proposal would solve, in natural
way, the Fermi paradox.
