fixed-target experiment using the LHC proton and Pb beams extracted by a bent
crystal. In a proton run with the LHC 7-TeV beam, one can analyze pp, pd and pA
collisions at sqrt(s_NN)~115 GeV and even higher using the Fermi motion in a
nuclear target. In a Pb run with a 2.76 TeV-per-nucleon beam, sqrt(s_NN) is as
high as 72 GeV. Bent crystals can be used to extract about 5x10^8 protons/s;
the integrated luminosity over a year reaches 0.5fb-1 on a typical 1 cm-long
target without species limitation. Such an extraction mode does not alter the
performance of the collider experiments at the LHC. By instrumenting the
target-rapidity region, gluon and heavy-quark proton and neutron PDFs can be
accessed at large x and even at x larger than 1 in the nuclear case. Single
diffractive physics and, for the first time, the large negative-xF domain can
be accessed. The nuclear target-species versatility provides a unique
opportunity to study nuclear matter vs. the features of the hot and dense
matter formed in heavy-ion collisions, which can be studied in PbA collisions
over the full range of target-rapidity domain with a large variety of nuclei.
The polarization of hydrogen and nuclear targets allows an ambitious spin
program, including measurements of the QCD lensing effects which underlie the
Sivers single-spin asymmetry, the study of transversity distributions and
possibly of polarized PDFs. We also emphasize the potential offered by pA
ultra-peripheral collisions where the nucleus target A is used as a coherent
photon source, mimicking photoproduction processes in ep collisions. Finally,
we note that W and Z bosons can be produced and detected in a fixed-target
experiment and in their threshold domain for the first time, providing new ways
to probe the partonic content of the proton and the nucleus.

Unsupervised markerless 3D motion tracking systems determine the most relevant
object in the screen and then track it by continuously estimating its
projection features (center and area) from the edge image and a point inside
the relevant object projection (namely, inner point), until the tracking fails.
Existing object projection feature estimation techniques are based on
ray-casting from the inner point. These techniques present three main
drawbacks: when the inner point is surrounded by edges, rays may not reach
other relevant areas; as a consequence of that issue, the estimated features
may greatly vary depending on the position of the inner point relative to the
object projection; and finally, increasing the number of rays being casted and
the ray-casting iterations (which would make the results more accurate and
stable) increases the processing time to the point the tracking cannot be
performed on the fly. In this paper, we analyze an intuitive filling-based
object projection feature estimation technique that solves the aforementioned
problems but is too sensitive to edge miscalculations. Then, we propose a less
computing-intensive modification to that technique that would not be affected
by the existing techniques issues and would be no more sensitive to edge
miscalculations than ray-casting-based techniques.

very low $\sim$ 0.7, which substantially relaxes the difficulty of scaling-up
the architecture. All key elements and their accuracy required for the present

underlying Bayesian networks, which represent multivariate probability
distributions. In many practical applications, such as the reverse engineering
of gene regulatory networks, not only the estimation of model parameters but
the reconstruction of the structure itself is of great interest. As well as for
the assessment of different structure learning algorithms in simulation
studies, a uniform sample from the space of directed acyclic graphs is required
to evaluate the prevalence of certain structural features. Here we analyse how
to sample acyclic digraphs uniformly at random through recursive enumeration,
an approach previously thought too computationally involved. Based on
complexity considerations, we discuss in particular how the enumeration
directly provides an exact method, which avoids the convergence issues of the
alternative Markov chain methods and is actually computationally much faster.
The limiting behaviour of the distribution of acyclic digraphs then allows us
to sample arbitrarily large graphs. Building on the ideas of recursive
enumeration based sampling we also introduce a novel hybrid Markov chain with
much faster convergence than current alternatives while still being easy to
adapt to various restrictions. Finally we discuss how to include such
restrictions in the combinatorial enumeration and the new hybrid Markov chain
method for efficient uniform sampling of the corresponding graphs.

profile widths do not fit the widths of the processed lines obtained at the
telescope. After processing, the halfwidths of the generated and telescope
profiles must agree below n = 200 if we are to believe that the processed
generated linewidths above n = 200 are meaningful. Theirs do not. Furthermore,
we find that after applying the linewidth reduction factors found by Alexander
and Gulyaev for their noise added profiles to our generated profiles to
simulate their noise adding effect, the processed widths we obtain still do not
come close to explaining the narrowing seen in the telescope lines for n values
in the range 200 < n < 250. It is concluded that what is needed to solve this
mystery is a completely new approach using a different observing technique
instead of simply a further manipulation of the frequency-switched data.

a non-shellable rectilinear triangulation of the tetrahedron. Our main tool is
a new relative notion of shellability that characterizes the behavior of
shellable complexes under gluing.
  As a corollary, we obtain a new characterization of the PL property in terms
of shellability: A triangulation of a sphere or of a ball is PL if and only if
it becomes shellable after sufficiently many derived subdivisions. This
improves on results by Whitehead, Zeeman and Glaser, and answers a question by
Billera and Swartz.
  We also show that any contractible complex can be made collapsible by
repeatedly taking products with an interval. This strengthens results by
Dierker and Lickorish, and resolves a conjecture of Oliver. Finally, we give an
example that this behavior extends to non-evasiveness, thereby answering a

at the LHC have been excluded by 2011 searches if they are lighter than around
800 GeV. This adds to the tension between experiment and supersymmetric
solutions of the naturalness problem, since the gluino is required to be light
if the electroweak scale is to be natural. Here, we examine natural scenarios
where supersymmetry is present, but was hidden from 2011 searches due to
violation of R-parity and the absence of a large missing transverse momentum
signature. Naturalness suggests that third generation states should dominate
gluino decays and we argue that this leads to a generic signature in the form
of same-sign, flavour-ambivalent leptons, without large missing transverse
momentum. As a result, searches in this channel are able to cover a broad range
of scenarios with some generality and one should seek gluinos that decay in
this way with masses below a TeV. We encourage the LHC experiments to tailor a
search for supersymmetry in this form. We consider a specific case that is good
at hiding: baryon number violation, and estimate that the most constraining
existing search from 2011 data implies a lower bound on the gluino mass of 550
GeV.

Hadron Collider (LHC). With a realistic equation of state, Glauber model
initial conditions and a small specific shear viscosity eta/s = 0.08, the
differential charged hadron elliptic flow v_2^{ch}(p_T,sqrt(s)) is found to
exhibit a very broad maximum as a function of sqrt(s) around top RHIC energy,
rendering it almost independent of collision energy for 39 < sqrt(s) < 2760 A
GeV. Compared to ideal fluid dynamical simulations, this ""saturation"" of
elliptic flow is shifted to higher collision energies by shear viscous effects.
For color-glass motivated MC-KLN initial conditions, which require a larger
shear viscosity eta/s = 0.2 to reproduce the measured elliptic flow, a similar
""saturation"" is not observed up to LHC energies, except for very low p_T. We
emphasize that this ""saturation"" of the elliptic flow is not associated with
the QCD phase transition, but arises from the interplay between radial and
elliptic flow which shifts with sqrt(s) depending on the fluid's viscosity and
leads to a subtle cancellation between increasing contributions from light and
decreasing contributions from heavy particles to v_2 in the sqrt(s) range where
v_2^{ch}(p_T,sqrt(s)) at fixed p_T is maximal. By generalizing the definition
of spatial eccentricity epsilon_x to isothermal hyper-surfaces, we calculate
epsilon_x on the kinetic freeze-out surface at different collision energies. Up
to top RHIC energy, sqrt(s)=200 A GeV, the fireball is still out-of-plane

are used in conjunction with power law models of stochastic noise in order to
characterize time or frequency regimes by pointing out the different types of
frequency modulated (FM) or phase modulated (PM) noise. In the case of phase
noise, only Modified Allan variance can tell between white PM and flicker PM
noise. Oscillations in the system can be detected accurately with the
Bretthorst periodogram. Through the detection of colored noise, which is
expected to appear in almost all electronic devices, a lower threshold of
measurement uncertainty is obtained and the white noise model of statistical
independence can no longer provide accurate results for the examined data set.

Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). $WZ$ candidates are reconstructed from
decays containing three charged leptons and missing energy from a neutrino,
where the charged leptons are either electrons or muons. Using data collected
by the CDF II detector (7.1 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity), 63 candidate
events are observed with the expected background contributing $8 \pm 1$ events.
The measured total cross section $\sigma (p \bar p \to WZ) =
3.93_{-0.53}^{+0.60}(\text{stat})_{-0.46}^{+0.59}(\text{syst}) $ pb is in good
agreement with the standard model prediction of $3.50\pm 0.21$. The same sample
is used to set limits on anomalous $WWZ$ couplings.

observables, of a class of pre-inflationary dynamics suggested by string models
where SUSY is broken due to the presence of D-branes and orientifolds
preserving incompatible portions of it. In these models the would-be inflaton
is forced to emerge from the initial singularity climbing up a mild exponential
potential, until it bounces against a steep exponential potential of ""brane
SUSY breaking"" scenarios, and as a result the ensuing descent gives rise to an
inflationary epoch that begins when the system is still well off its eventual
attractor. If a pre-inflationary climbing phase of this type had occurred
within 6-7 e-folds of the horizon exit for the largest observable wavelengths,
displacement off the attractor and initial-state effects would conspire to
suppress power in the primordial scalar spectrum, enhancing it in the tensor
spectrum and typically superposing oscillations on both. We investigate these
imprints on CMB observables over a range of parameters, examine their
statistical significance, and provide a semi-analytic rationale for our
results. It is tempting to ascribe at least part of the large-angle anomalies
in the CMB to pre-inflationary dynamics of this type.

displays coherent structure, with galaxies residing in groups and clusters on
scales of ~1-3 Mpc/h, which lie at the intersections of long filaments of
galaxies that are >10 Mpc/h in length. Vast regions of relatively empty space,
known as voids, contain very few galaxies and span the volume in between these
structures. This observed large scale structure depends both on cosmological
parameters and on the formation and evolution of galaxies. Using the two-point
correlation function, one can trace the dependence of large scale structure on
galaxy properties such as luminosity, color, stellar mass, and track its
evolution with redshift. Comparison of the observed galaxy clustering
signatures with dark matter simulations allows one to model and understand the
clustering of galaxies and their formation and evolution within their parent
dark matter halos. Clustering measurements can determine the parent dark matter
halo mass of a given galaxy population, connect observed galaxy populations at
different epochs, and constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy evolution
models. This chapter describes the methods used to measure the two-point
correlation function in both redshift and real space, presents the current
results of how the clustering amplitude depends on various galaxy properties,
and discusses quantitative measurements of the structures of voids and
filaments. The interpretation of these results with current theoretical models
is also presented.

generic corrections lead to a replacement of the Lifshitz metric, in the deep
infrared, by a re-emergent $AdS_2 \times R^2$ geometry. Thus, at least in these

reduction to the finite field with two elements, we show that if ab = 0 for
non-trivial elements in the group ring of a torsion-free group over the
rationals, then the lengths of a and b cannot be among certain combinations.
More precisely, we show for various pairs of integers (i,j) that if one of the
lengths is at most i then the other length must exceed j. Using combinatorial
arguments we show this for the pairs (3,6) and (4,4). With a computer-assisted
approach we strengthen this to show the statement holds for the pairs (3,16)

we call matched rectangles, and show that for these a canonical labeling can be
computed in quadratic time. Each matched rectangle gives rise to a presentation
of a group. These associated groups are universal in the sense that there is no
counterexample to the conjecture among them if and only if the conjecture is
true over the rationals.

(nitrotoluene) on mesoporous silicon using soft X-ray spec- troscopy. The Si
atoms strongly interact with adsorbed molecules to form Si-O and Si-N bonds, as
evident from the large shifts in emission energy present in the Si L2,3 X-ray
emission spectroscopy (XES) measurements. Furthermore, we find that the energy
gap of mesoporous silicon changes depending on the adsorbant, as estimated from
the Si L2,3 XES and 2p X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements. Our ab
initio molecular dynamics calculations of model compounds suggest that these
changes are due to spontaneous breaking of the nitro groups upon contacting

transmit-receive pairs that communicate over a common noisy medium. Each
transmitter has an individual message for its paired receiver, and
additionally, both transmitters have a common message to deliver to both
receivers. In this paper, through explicit inner and outer bounds on the
capacity region, we establish the capacity region of the Gaussian IC-CI to
within a bounded gap of one bit, independently of the values of all channel
parameters. Using this constant-gap characterization, the generalized degrees
of freedom (GDoF) region is determined. It is shown that the introduction of
the common message leads to an increase in the GDoF over that achievable over
the Gaussian interference channel without a common message, and hence to an
unbounded improvement in the achievable rate. A surprising feature of the
capacity-within-one-bit result is that most of the available benefit (i.e., to
within one bit of capacity) due to the common message is achieved through a
simple and explicit coding scheme that involves independent signaling at the
two transmitters so that, in effect, this scheme forgoes the opportunity for
transmitter cooperation that is inherently available due to shared knowledge of
the common message at both transmitters.

the influence of noise on the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian of a set of
image patches, and an algorithm to estimate a denoised set of patches from a
noisy image. The algorithm relies on the following two observations: (1) the
low-index eigenvectors of the diffusion, or graph Laplacian, operators are very
robust to random perturbations of the weights and random changes in the
connections of the patch-graph; and (2) patches extracted from smooth regions
of the image are organized along smooth low-dimensional structures in the
patch-set, and therefore can be reconstructed with few eigenvectors.
Experiments demonstrate that our denoising algorithm outperforms the denoising
gold-standards.

  Kolmogorov complexity","13 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Peter Gacs showed (Gacs 1974) that for every n there exists a bit string x of
length n whose plain complexity C(x) has almost maximal conditional complexity
relative to x, i.e., C(C(x)|x) > log n - log^(2) n - O(1). (Here log^(2) i =
log log i.) Following Elena Kalinina (Kalinina 2011), we provide a simple
game-based proof of this result; modifying her argument, we get a better (and
tight) bound log n - O(1). We also show the same bound for prefix-free
complexity.
  Robert Solovay showed (Solovay 1975) that infinitely many strings x have
maximal plain complexity but not maximal prefix complexity (among the strings
of the same length): for some c there exist infinitely many x such that |x| -
C(x) < c and |x| + K(|x|) - K(x) > log^(2) |x| - c log^(3) |x|. In fact, the
results of Solovay and Gacs are closely related. Using the result above, we
provide a short proof for Solovay's result. We also generalize it by showing
that for some c and for all n there are strings x of length n with n - C (x) <
c and n + K(n) - K(x) > K(K(n)|n) - 3 K(K(K(n)|n)|n) - c. We also prove a close
upper bound K(K(n)|n) + O(1).
  Finally, we provide a direct game proof for Joseph Miller's generalization
(Miller 2006) of the same Solovay's theorem: if a co-enumerable set (a set with
c.e. complement) contains for every length a string of this length, then it
contains infinitely many strings x such that |x| + K(|x|) - K(x) > log^(2) |x|
+ O(log^(3) |x|).

coding rate and jamming power) new mixed Nash equilibria appear with surprising
properties. We show the existence of a threshold ($J_{TH}$) such that if the
jammer average power exceeds $J_{TH}$, the channel capacity at the NE is the
same as if the jammer was using its maximum allowable power, $J_{Max}$, all the

jammers. We also show how the NE strategies can be derived, and we provide very

drive the excitatory subnetwork to instability, the network will dynamically
stabilize provided feedback inhibition is sufficiently strong. For a wide range
of network and stimulus parameters, this dynamic stabilization yields a
transition from supralinear to sublinear summation of network responses to
multiple inputs. We compare this to the dynamic stabilization in the ""balanced

2-dimensional case of 1 excitatory and 1 inhibitory population. We show that in

a closely spaced discretum of states. We study in detail the graviton

resonances can be resolved at the LHC, several of them can be discovered
simultaneously and allow for the linear dilaton geometry to be uniquely

become similar to the 5-d ADD scenario while relaxing the astrophysical and

on-shell and decay inside the LHC detector, modifying the diphoton and dilepton

the requests sent by mobile device users over a period of time and later wants
to publish/share these logs. Log sharing can be extremely valuable for
advertising, data mining research and network management, but it poses a
serious threat to the privacy of LBS users. Sender anonymity solutions prevent
a malicious attacker from inferring the interests of LBS users by associating
them with their service requests after gaining access to the anonymized logs.
With the fast-increasing adoption of smartphones and the concern that historic
user trajectories are becoming more accessible, it becomes necessary for any
sender anonymity solution to protect against attackers that are
trajectory-aware (i.e. have access to historic user trajectories) as well as
policy-aware (i.e they know the log anonymization policy). We call such
attackers TP-aware.
  This paper introduces a first privacy guarantee against TP-aware attackers,
called TP-aware sender k-anonymity. It turns out that there are many possible
TP-aware anonymizations for the same LBS log, each with a different utility to
the consumer of the anonymized log. The problem of finding the optimal TP-aware
anonymization is investigated. We show that trajectory-awareness renders the
problem computationally harder than the trajectory-unaware variants found in
the literature (NP-complete in the size of the log, versus PTIME). We describe
a PTIME l-approximation algorithm for trajectories of length l and empirically
show that it scales to large LBS logs (up to 2 million users).

the B-L breaking Higgs field and thermal processes produce an abundance of
heavy neutrinos whose decays generate entropy, baryon asymmetry and gravitino
dark matter. We study the phase transition for the full supersymmetric Abelian
Higgs model. For the subsequent reheating process we give a detailed
time-resolved description of all particle abundances. The competition of cosmic
expansion and entropy production leads to an intermediate period of constant
'reheating' temperature, during which baryon asymmetry and dark matter are

gravitons, one of which is massive and another is massless. These black holes
possess a regular event horizon which is common for both metrics and has the
same values of the surface gravity and Hawking temperature with respect to each
metric. The ratio of the event horizon radii measured by the two metrics is a
free parameter that labels the solutions. We present a numerical evidence for
their existence and find that they comprise several classes. Black holes within
each class approach the same AdS-type asymptotic at infinity but differ from
each other in the event horizon vicinity where the short-range massive modes
reside. In addition, there are solutions showing a curvature singularity at a
finite proper distance from the horizon. For some special solutions the
graviton mass may become effectively imaginary, causing oscillations around the
flat metric at infinity. The only asymptotically flat black hole we find -- the
Schwarzschild solution obtained by identifying the two metrics -- seems to be
exceptional, since changing even slightly its horizon boundary conditions
completely changes the asymptotic behavior at infinity. We also construct
globally regular solutions describing `lumps of pure gravity' which can be

modified Wolff single-cluster Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate
equilibrium spin configurations on square lattices in the critical region. A
tie-breaking rule is employed to identify non-intersecting spin cluster
boundaries along the edges of the dual lattice. The values obtained for the
fractal dimensions of the spanning geometrical clusters $D_{c}$, and their
interfaces $D_{I}$, are in perfect agreement with those reported for the
standard two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model. Furthermore, the variance
of the winding angles, results in a diffusivity $\kappa=3$ for the
two-dimensional thermalized bond Ising model, thus placing it in the
universality class of the regular Ising model. A finite-size scaling analysis
of the largest geometrical clusters, results in a reliable estimation of the
critical percolation exponents for the geometrical clusters in the limit of an
infinite lattice size. The percolation exponents thus obtained, are also found
to be consistent with those reported for the regular Ising model. These
consistencies are explained in terms of the Fisher renormalization relations,

the H\alpha{} line, A(H\alpha{}), which are lower than many of those used in

diversity of planetary systems by shedding light on the frequency and timing of
planetesimal formation, the location and physical properties of the

between SN ejecta and the progenitor star's circumstellar material. The most
distinct trend is an increase in the strength of [O III]/([O I]+[O II]) with
age, and a decline in Halpha/([O I]+[O II]) which is broadly consistent with
the view that the reverse shock has passed through the H envelope of the ejecta

the young Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). Similarities
observed between the emission line profiles of the 330 yr old Cas A remnant and

spectra may be associated with dust in the ejecta, and that minor peak
substructure typically interpreted as 'clumps' or 'blobs' of ejecta may instead
be linked with large-scale rings of SN debris.

mass functions of satellites are similar in shape to those of field galaxies,
but for lower mass primaries they are significantly steeper. The steepening is
particularly marked for the stellar mass function. Satellite abundance
increases strongly with primary stellar mass, approximately in proportion to
expected dark halo mass. Massive red primaries have up to a factor of 2 more
satellites than blue ones of the same stellar mass. Satellite galaxies are
systematically redder than field galaxies of the same stellar mass. Satellites
are also systematically redder around more massive primaries. At fixed primary
mass, they are redder around red primaries. We select similarly isolated
galaxies from mock catalogues based on the simulations of Guo et al.(2011) and
analyze them in parallel with the SDSS data. The simulation reproduces all the
above trends qualitatively, except for the steepening of the satellite
luminosity and stellar mass functions. Model satellites, however, are
systematically redder than in the SDSS, particularly at low mass and around
low-mass primaries. Simulated haloes of a given mass have satellite abundances
that are independent of central galaxy colour, but red centrals tend to have
lower stellar masses, reflecting earlier quenching of their star formation by
feedback. This explains the correlation between satellite abundance and primary
colour in the simulation. The correlation between satellite colour and primary
colour arises because red centrals live in haloes which are more massive, older
and more gas-rich, so that satellite quenching is more efficient.

underwater bubble entirely alters the final breakup dynamics. Here I examine
the influence of initial asymmetry on the final breakup by simulating the
bubble surface evolution as a Hamiltonian evolution corresponding to an
inviscid, two-dimensional, planar implosion. I find two types of breakups: a
previously reported coalescence mode in which distant regions along the
air-water surface curve inwards and eventually collide with finite speed, and a
hitherto unknown cusp-like mode in which the surface develops sharp tips whose
radii of curvature are much smaller than the average neck radius. I present
three sets of results that characterize the nature of this cusp mode. First, I
show that the cusp mode corresponds to a saddle-node. In other words, an
evolution towards a cross-section shape with sharp tips invariably later
evolves away from it. In phase space, this saddle-node separates coalescence
modes whose coalescence planes lie along different spatial orientations.
Second, I show that the formation of the sharp tips can be interpreted as a
weakly first-order transition which becomes second-order, corresponding to the
formation of a finite-time curvature singularity, in the limit that the initial
perturbation amplitude approaches zero. Third I show that, as the curvature
singularity is approached, the maximum surface curvature diverges approximately
as $(t_c - t)^{-0.8}$, where $t_c$ is the onset time of the singularity and the
maximum velocity diverges approximately as $(t_c-t)^{-0.4}$. In practice, these
divergences imply that viscous drag and compressibility of the gas flow, two
effects not included in my analysis, become significant as the interface
evolves towards the curvature singularity.

reference[1]), the authors consider, among other equations,the diophantine
equations 2xy=n(x+y) and 3xy=n(x+y). For the first equation, with n being an
odd positive integer, they give the solution x=(n+1)/2, y=n(n+1)/2. For the
second equation they present the particular solution, x=(n+1)/3,y=n(n+1)/3,
where is n is a positive integer congruent to 2modulo3. If in the above
equations we assume n to be prime, then these two equations become special
cases of the diophantine equation, nxy=p(x+y) (1), with p being a prime and n a
positive integer greater than or equal to 2. This 2-variable symmetric
diophantine equation is the subject matter of this article; with the added
condition that the intager n is not divisible by the prime p. Observe that this
equation can be written in fraction form: n/p= 1/x + 1/y(See [2] for more
details)
  In this work we prove the following result, Theorem1(stated on page2 of this
paper):Let p be a prime, n a positive integer at least2, and not divisible by
p. Then, 1)If n=2 and p is an odd prime, equation (1) has exactly three
distinct positive integer solutions:x=p, y=p ; x=p(p+1)/2, y=(p+1)/2 ;
x=(p+1)/2, y=p(p+1)/2 2)If n is greater than or equal to 3, and n is a divisor
of p+1. Then equation (1) has exactly two distinct solutions: x=p(p+1)/n,
y=(p+1)/n ; x=(p+1)/n, y=p(p+1)/n 3) if n is not a divisor of p+1. Then
equation (1) has no positive integer solution. The proof of this result is
elementary, and only uses Euclid's Lemma from number theory,and basic divisor
arguments(such that if a prime divides a product of two integers; it must
divide at least one of them).

the dynamics and the manipulation of data are equally central. In this paper we
study verification of (first-order) mu-calculus variants over relational
data-centric dynamic systems, where data are represented by a full-fledged
relational database, and the process is described in terms of atomic actions
that evolve the database. The execution of such actions may involve calls to
external services, providing fresh data inserted into the system. As a result
such systems are typically infinite-state. We show that verification is
undecidable in general, and we isolate notable cases, where decidability is
achieved. Specifically we start by considering service calls that return values
deterministically (depending only on passed parameters). We show that in a
mu-calculus variant that preserves knowledge of objects appeared along a run we
get decidability under the assumption that the fresh data introduced along a
run are bounded, though they might not be bounded in the overall system. In
fact we tie such a result to a notion related to weak acyclicity studied in
data exchange. Then, we move to nondeterministic services where the assumption
of data bounded run would result in a bound on the service calls that can be
invoked during the execution and hence would be too restrictive. So we
investigate decidability under the assumption that knowledge of objects is
preserved only if they are continuously present. We show that if infinitely
many values occur in a run but do not accumulate in the same state, then we get
again decidability. We give syntactic conditions to avoid this accumulation
through the novel notion of ""generate-recall acyclicity"", which takes into
consideration that every service call activation generates new values that
cannot be accumulated indefinitely.

energy distributions (SEDs) of dust emission to observed fluxes. Under the
standard assumption of optically thin single temperature (T) sources the dust
SED as represented by a power--law modified black body is subject to a strong
degeneracy between T and the spectral index beta. The traditional
non-hierarchical approaches, typically based on chi-square minimization, are
severely limited by this degeneracy, as it produces an artificial
anti-correlation between T and beta even with modest levels of observational
noise. The hierarchical Bayesian method rigorously and self-consistently treats
measurement uncertainties, including calibration and noise, resulting in more
precise SED fits. As a result, the Bayesian fits do not produce any spurious
anti-correlations between the SED parameters due to measurement uncertainty. We
demonstrate that the Bayesian method is substantially more accurate than the
chi-square fit in recovering the SED parameters, as well as the correlations
between them. As an illustration, we apply our method to Herschel and sub
millimeter ground-based observations of the star-forming Bok globule CB244.
This source is a small, nearby molecular cloud containing a single low-mass
protostar and a starless core. We find that T and beta are weakly positively
correlated -- in contradiction with the chi-square fits, which indicate a
T-beta anti-correlation from the same data-set. Additionally, in comparison to
the chi-square fits the Bayesian SED parameter estimates exhibit a reduced
range in values.

with uncertainty related to the non-linearity and the metallicity dependence of
their period-luminosity (PL) relation. Although a general consensus on these
effects is still not achieved, classical Cepheids remain the most used primary
distance indicators. A possible extension of these standard candles to further
distances would be important. In this context, a very promising new tool is
represented by the ultra-long period (ULP) Cepheids (P \geq 80 days), recently
identified in star-forming galaxies. Only a small number of ULP Cepheids have
been discovered so far. Here we present and analyse the properties of an
updated sample of 37 ULP Cepheids observed in galaxies within a very large
metallicity range of 12+log(O/H) from ~7.2 to 9.2 dex. We find that their
location in the colour(V-I)-magnitude diagram as well as their Wesenheit (V-I)
index-period (WP) relation suggests that they are the counterparts at high
luminosity of the shorter-period (P \leq 80 days) classical Cepheids. However,
a complete pulsation and evolutionary theoretical scenario is needed to
properly interpret the true nature of these objects. We do not confirm the
flattening in the studied WP relation suggested by Bird et al. (2009). Using
the whole sample, we find that ULP Cepheids lie around a relation similar to
that of the LMC, although with a large spread (~0.4 mag).

network on its sensor link, the Medium Access Controller (MAC) may discard some

scheduler to select a few critical data packets to send to the MAC. In this
paper, we analyze the impact of such a scheduler on the closed-loop system in
the presence of traffic, and show that there is a dual effect with state-based
scheduling. In general, this makes the optimal scheduler and controller hard to
find. However, by removing past controls from the scheduling criterion, we find
that certainty equivalence holds. This condition is related to the classical
result of Bar-Shalom and Tse, and it leads to the design of a scheduler with a
certainty equivalent controller. This design, however, does not result in an
equivalent system to the original problem, in the sense of Witsenhausen.
Computing the estimate is difficult, but can be simplified by introducing a
symmetry constraint on the scheduler. Based on these findings, we propose a
dual predictor architecture for the closed-loop system, which ensures
separation between scheduler, observer and controller. We present an example of
this architecture, which illustrates a network-aware event-triggering

the system can be transferred from one ground state to another with a single

local U/LIRGs (66 galaxies). From this initial sample we select 26 objects with
H{\alpha} luminosities (L(H{\alpha})) similar to those of massive (i.e. M\ast
\sim 10^10 M\odot or larger) SFGs at z \sim 2, and observed on similar physical
scales. Results. The sizes of the H{\alpha} emitting region in the sample of
local U/LIRGs span a large range, with r1/2(H{\alpha}) from 0.2 to 7 kpc.
However, about 2/3 of local U/LIRGs with Lir > 10^11.4 L\odot have compact
H{\alpha} emission (i.e. r1/2 < 2 kpc). The comparison sample of local U/LIRGs
also shows a higher fraction (59%) of objects with compact H{\alpha} emission
than the high-z sample (25%). This gives further support to the idea that for
this luminosity range the size of the star forming region is a distinctive
factor between local and distant galaxies of similar SF rates. However, when
using H{\alpha} as a tracer for both local and high-z samples, the differences
are smaller than the ones recently reported using a variety of other tracers.
Despite of the higher fraction of galaxies with compact H{\alpha} emission, a
sizable group (\sim 1/3) of local U/LIRGs are large (i.e. r1/2 > 2 kpc). These
are systems showing pre-coalescence merger activity and they are
indistinguishable from the massive high-z SFGs galaxies in terms of their
H{\alpha} sizes, and luminosity and SFR surface densities.

  502-513 (2012)",,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern business applications and scientific databases call for inherently
dynamic data storage environments. Such environments are characterized by two
challenging features: (a) they have little idle system time to devote on
physical design; and (b) there is little, if any, a priori workload knowledge,
while the query and data workload keeps changing dynamically. In such
environments, traditional approaches to index building and maintenance cannot
apply. Database cracking has been proposed as a solution that allows on-the-fly
physical data reorganization, as a collateral effect of query processing.
Cracking aims to continuously and automatically adapt indexes to the workload
at hand, without human intervention. Indexes are built incrementally,
adaptively, and on demand. Nevertheless, as we show, existing adaptive indexing
methods fail to deliver workload-robustness; they perform much better with
random workloads than with others. This frailty derives from the inelasticity
with which these approaches interpret each query as a hint on how data should
be stored. Current cracking schemes blindly reorganize the data within each
query's range, even if that results into successive expensive operations with
minimal indexing benefit. In this paper, we introduce stochastic cracking, a
significantly more resilient approach to adaptive indexing. Stochastic cracking
also uses each query as a hint on how to reorganize data, but not blindly so;
it gains resilience and avoids performance bottlenecks by deliberately applying
certain arbitrary choices in its decision-making. Thereby, we bring adaptive
indexing forward to a mature formulation that confers the workload-robustness
previous approaches lacked. Our extensive experimental study verifies that
stochastic cracking maintains the desired properties of original database
cracking while at the same time it performs well with diverse realistic
workloads.

expansion, allowing the addition of new attributes to the database at query
time. However, the number of crowd-sourced mini-tasks to fill in missing values
may often be prohibitively large and the resulting data quality is doubtful.
Instead of simple crowd-sourcing to obtain all values individually, we leverage
the user-generated data found in the Social Web: By exploiting user ratings we
build perceptual spaces, i.e., highly-compressed representations of opinions,
impressions, and perceptions of large numbers of users. Using few training
samples obtained by expert crowd sourcing, we then can extract all missing data
automatically from the perceptual space with high quality and at low costs.
Extensive experiments show that our approach can boost both performance and

being integrated to provide conflicting information about the same entity.
Consequently, a major challenge for data integration is to derive the most
complete and accurate integrated records from diverse and sometimes conflicting
sources. We term this challenge the truth finding problem. We observe that some
sources are generally more reliable than others, and therefore a good model of
source quality is the key to solving the truth finding problem. In this work,
we propose a probabilistic graphical model that can automatically infer true
records and source quality without any supervision. In contrast to previous
methods, our principled approach leverages a generative process of two types of
errors (false positive and false negative) by modeling two different aspects of
source quality. In so doing, ours is also the first approach designed to merge
multi-valued attribute types. Our method is scalable, due to an efficient
sampling-based inference algorithm that needs very few iterations in practice
and enjoys linear time complexity, with an even faster incremental variant.
Experiments on two real world datasets show that our new method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches to the truth finding problem.

their cost among users. The problem is especially challenging when users are
selfish and will only report their true values for different optimizations if
doing so maximizes their utility. In this paper, we present a new approach for
selecting and pricing shared optimizations by using Mechanism Design. We first
show how to apply the Shapley Value Mechanism to the simple case of selecting

access the service for the same time-period. Second, we extend the approach to
online scenarios where users come and go. Finally, we consider the case of

organizations in the past few years. This large scale data analysis is
facilitated by the MapReduce programming and execution model and its
implementations, most notably Hadoop. Users of MapReduce often have analysis
tasks that are too complex to express as individual MapReduce jobs. Instead,
they use high-level query languages such as Pig, Hive, or Jaql to express their
complex tasks. The compilers of these languages translate queries into
workflows of MapReduce jobs. Each job in these workflows reads its input from
the distributed file system used by the MapReduce system and produces output
that is stored in this distributed file system and read as input by the next
job in the workflow. The current practice is to delete these intermediate
results from the distributed file system at the end of executing the workflow.
One way to improve the performance of workflows of MapReduce jobs is to keep
these intermediate results and reuse them for future workflows submitted to the
system. In this paper, we present ReStore, a system that manages the storage
and reuse of such intermediate results. ReStore can reuse the output of whole
MapReduce jobs that are part of a workflow, and it can also create additional
reuse opportunities by materializing and storing the output of query execution
operators that are executed within a MapReduce job. We have implemented ReStore

Unsupervised markerless 3D motion tracking systems determine the most relevant
object in the screen and then track it by continuously estimating its
projection features (center and area) from the edge image and a point inside
the relevant object projection (namely, inner point), until the tracking fails.
Existing reliable object projection feature estimation techniques are based on
ray-casting or grid-filling from the inner point. These techniques assume the
edge image to be accurate. However, in real case scenarios, edge
miscalculations may arise from low contrast between the target object and its
surroundings or motion blur caused by low frame rates or fast moving target
objects. In this paper, we propose a barrier extension to casting-based

GN-SQL and GN-Datalog subsume a number of well known query languages and

The band structures of supported graphene are similar with that of suspending

agents for production of the Galactic cosmic rays. Recent $\gamma$-ray
observations of several SNRs have made this case more compelling. However,
these broadband high-energy measurements also reveal a variety of spectral
shape demanding more comprehensive modeling of emissions from SNRs. According
to the locally observed fluxes of cosmic ray protons and electrons, the
electron-to-proton number ratio is known to be about 1%. Assuming such a ratio
is universal for all SNRs and identical spectral shape for all kinds of
accelerated particles, we propose a unified model that ascribes the distinct
$\gamma$-ray spectra of different SNRs to variations of the medium density and
the spectral difference between cosmic ray electrons and protons observed at
Earth to transport effects. For low density environments, the $\gamma$-ray
emission is inverse-Compton dominated. For high density environments like
systems of high-energy particles interacting with molecular clouds, the
$\gamma$-ray emission is $\pi^0$-decay dominated. The model predicts a hadronic
origin of $\gamma$-ray emission from very old remnants interacting mostly with
molecular clouds and a leptonic origin for intermediate age remnants whose
shocks propagate in a low density environment created by their progenitors via
e.g., strong stellar winds. These results can be regarded as evidence in
support of the SNR-origin of the Galactic cosmic rays.

sets, with an application to aligning steroid molecules in chemoinformatics.
Methods from statistical shape analysis are combined with techniques for
predicting random fields in spatial statistics in order to define a suitable
measure of similarity between two marked point sets. Bayesian modeling of the
predicted field overlap between pairs of point sets is proposed, and posterior
inference of the alignment is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo
simulation. By representing the fields in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces,
the degree of overlap can be computed without expensive numerical integration.
Superimposing entire fields rather than the configuration matrices of point
coordinates thereby avoids the problem that there is usually no clear
one-to-one correspondence between the points. In addition, mask parameters are
introduced in the model, so that partial matching of the marked point sets can
be carried out. We also propose an adaptation of the generalized Procrustes
analysis algorithm for the simultaneous alignment of multiple point sets. The
methodology is illustrated with a simulation study and then applied to a data
set of 31 steroid molecules, where the relationship between shape and binding
activity to the corticosteroid binding globulin receptor is explored.

investigating the dependence of cosmic rays on temperature and time of the year
took place locally in Magnolia, AR. We found that cosmic muon flux is uniform,
appears to be independent of conditions on earth, and is anti-correlative with
temperature. We are convinced that the sun has minimal to zero effect on
cosmic-ray flux; it cannot be a major contributing source of this background
radiation. The source of cosmic radiation remains one of the biggest unanswered
questions in physics today.

long-term project for redeveloping logic on the basis of a constructive game
semantics, with games seen as abstract models of interactive computational
problems. Among the fragments of this logic successfully axiomatized so far is
CL12 --- a conservative extension of classical first-order logic, whose
language augments that of classical logic with the so called choice sorts of
quantifiers and connectives. This system has already found fruitful
applications as a logical basis for constructive and complexity-oriented
versions of Peano arithmetic, such as arithmetics for polynomial time
computability, polynomial space computability, and beyond. The present paper
introduces a third, indispensable complexity measure for interactive
computations termed amplitude complexity, and establishes the adequacy of CL12
with respect to A-amplitude, S-space and T-time computability under certain
minimal conditions on the triples (A,S,T) of function classes. This result very
substantially broadens the potential application areas of CL12. The paper is
self-contained, and targets readers with no prior familiarity with the subject.

MgAl2O4, indicating the possibility of a large TMR in Fe/MgAl2O4/Fe(001) MTJs.
The small TMR ratio of the Fe/MgAl2O4/Fe(001) MTJ was due to new conductive
channels in the minority spin states resulting from a band-folding effect in
the two-dimensional (2-D) Brillouin zone of the in-plane wave vector (k//) of
the Fe electrode. Since the in-plane cell size of MgAl2O4 is twice that of the
primitive in-plane cell size of bcc Fe, the bands in the boundary edges are
folded, and minority-spin states coupled with the delta 1 evanescent state in
the MgAl2O4 barrier appear at k//=0, which reduces the TMR ratio of the MTJs
significantly.

undecidable whether

interest in this kind of problem, which is very important in classical automata
theory, but also due to that the problem itself, personally, is a challenge.

solar features such as coronal holes, filaments, and flares. However, images
taken in different bands often look remarkably similar as each band receives
contributions coming from regions with a range of different temperatures. This
has motivated the search for empirical techniques that may unmix these
contributions and concentrate salient morphological features of the corona in a
smaller set of less redundant source images. Blind Source Separation (BSS)
precisely does this. Here we show how this novel concept also provides new
insight into the physics of the solar corona, using observations made by
SDO/AIA. The source images are extracted using a Bayesian positive source
separation technique. We show how observations made in six spectral bands,
corresponding to optically thin emissions, can be reconstructed by linear
combination of three sources. These sources have a narrower temperature
response and allow for considerable data reduction since the pertinent
information from all six bands can be condensed in only one single composite
picture. In addition, they give access to empirical temperature maps of the
corona. The limitations of the BSS technique and some applications are briefly
discussed.

models following a quantum quench can behave essentially as thermal
correlations provided the entanglement between two eigenmodes is sufficiently
strong. We provide one example and one counter example of this observation. The
example illustrates the fact that the thermal correlations arise from initial
states where the entanglement between the eigenmodes stems from the existence
of a large energy gap in the initial state. On the other hand, the
counter-example shows that when the bi-partite entanglement of the eigenmodes
stems from interactions that do not open a gap, the correlations at
asymptotically long times are non-thermal. We also show that the thermal
behavior concerns only the asymptotic correlation functions, as the difference
with an actual thermal ensemble can be observed measuring the energy
fluctuations of the system. The latter observation implies a breakdown of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

  In this paper we show that this is not necessarily the case. In fact, the

to the minority product rule at $p=1$. Using the finite-size scaling analysis,

dependent magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and specific heat
revealing that the magnetic and structural transition is rapidly suppressed
upon Na-substitution at the Ba-site in BaFe$_2$As$_2$, giving rise to
superconductivity. A superconducting transition as high as 34 K is reached for
a Na-content of $x$=0.4. The positive Hall coefficient confirms that the
substitution of Ba by Na results in hole-doping similarly to the substitution
of Ba by K. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy was performed on all
Ba$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ crystals. The Fermi surface of hole-doped
Ba$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ is to high extent the same as the Fermi surface
found for the K-doped sister compounds, suggesting a similar impact of the
substitution of Ba by either K or Na on the electronic band dispersion at the
Fermi level

create an exciton in the antenna complex of the photosynthetic pigments. This
exciton then migrates along the chain-biomolecules, like FMO complex, to the
reaction centre where it initiates the chemical reactions leading to biomass
generation. Recently, it has been experimentally observed that the exciton
motion is highly quantum mechanical in nature i.e., it involve long time ($\sim
600$ femto sec) quantum coherence effects. Traditional semiclassical theories
like Forrester's and second Born master equations cannot be applied. We point
out why the 2nd Born non-Markovian master equation and its Markovian limit
(also called the Redfield master equation) cannot be used to explain the
observed long coherences. Briefly, the reason is that these approaches are
perturbative in nature and in real light harvesting systems various couplings
(system-system and system-bath) are of the similar order of magnitude. Various
new approaches are being developed to go beyond the above two limiting
theories. The present review is not a review in the usual sense of the word as

Galaxy. Using the Planck experiment as an example, we investigate the impact of
incorrectly modelling foregrounds on estimates of the polarized CMB, quantified
by the bias in tensor-to-scalar ratio r, and optical depth tau. We use a
Bayesian parameter estimation method to estimate the CMB, synchrotron, and
thermal dust components from simulated observations spanning 30-353 GHz,
starting from a model that fits the simulated data, returning r<0.03 at 95%
confidence for an r=0 model, and r=0.09+-0.03 for an r=0.1 model. We then
introduce a set of mismatches between the simulated data and assumed model.
Including a curvature of the synchrotron spectral index with frequency, but
assuming a power-law model, can bias r high by ~1-sigma (delta r ~ 0.03). A
similar bias is seen for thermal dust with a modified black-body frequency
dependence, incorrectly modelled as a power-law. If too much freedom is allowed
in the model, for example fitting for spectral indices in 3 degree pixels over
the sky with physically reasonable priors, we find r can be biased up to
~3-sigma high by effectively setting the indices to the wrong values.
Increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by reducing parameters, or adding
additional foreground data, reduces the bias. We also find that neglecting a 1%
polarized free-free or spinning dust component has a negligible effect on r.
These tests highlight the importance of modelling the foregrounds in a way that
allows for sufficient complexity, while minimizing the number of free
parameters.

several variants of descents and excedances, and more precisely of flag

of this model is that it exhibits an infinity of spatially heterogeneous
absorbing configurations for $L \to \infty$ whose statistical properties we
probe analytically using a mean-field framework based on the decomposition of
the $L$-site joint probability distribution into the $n$-contiguous-site joint
distributions, the so-called $n$-site approximation. To describe the

asymptotic limit $t \to \infty$ reveals the mapping between the statistical
properties of the random initial configurations and those of the final
absorbing configurations. For the pair approximation ($n=2$) we derive that
mapping using a trick that avoids solving the full dynamics. Most remarkably,
we find that the predictions of the 4-site approximation reduce to those of the
3-site in the case of expectations involving three contiguous sites. In
addition, those expectations fit the Monte Carlo data perfectly and so we

this question by using the Product Space to study the productive structure of

Zambia. The Product Space is a network connecting products that tend to be
exported by the same sets of countries. Since countries are more likely to
develop products that are close by in the Product Space to the ones that they
already produce, the Product Space can be used to help anticipate a country's
industrial opportunities.
  Our results suggest that the most natural avenue for future product
diversification for these five south-east African nations resides in the
agricultural sector, since all of these nations appear to have productive
structures that are pre-adapted to the production of many agricultural products
that none of them are currently exporting.
  We conclude this paper by exploring the potential benefits of further
regional economic integration by doing an exercise in which we pull together
the productive structures of these five countries. This exercise shows that the
products that become more accessible in the combined economy are once again
predominantly agricultural. These results suggest that while diversification
into all sectors should remain an important long-term goal of the region, the
path towards increased diversification in the near future may well lie in a
more empowered and diverse agricultural sector.

since they do not experience nuclear interaction, and therefore they are useful
to explore properties of nuclear matter. We investigated hard photon production
and its properties in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions with the help of
the Blotzmann-Uehling-Ulenbeck model. Two components of hard photons are
discussed: direct and thermal. The positive directed flow parameter and
negative elliptic flow parameter of direct photons are demonstrated and they
are anti-correlated to the flows of free protons. The dependencies of hard
photon production and anisotropic parameters on impact parameter, beam energy,
nuclear equation of state and symmetry energy are also discussed. Furthermore,
we investigated the two-photon momentum correlation function from which the
space-time structure information of the photon source could be extracted as
well as the two-photon azimuthal correlation which could provide another good
method to determine the elliptic flow parameter $v_{2}$ of direct hard photons.

found in the case with N=3, and the result shown here is a generalization to
the case with an arbitrary odd $N$. We can obtain the matrix representation of

it has been proven that Nelson's diffusion is not asymptotically equivalent to
GARCH in deficiency, in the present paper, we investigate the relation between
GARCH and COGARCH in Le Cam's framework of statistical equivalence. We show
that GARCH converges generically to COGARCH, even in deficiency, provided that
the volatility processes are observed. Hence, from a theoretical point of view,
COGARCH can indeed be considered as a continuous-time equivalent to GARCH.
Otherwise, when the observations are incomplete, GARCH still has a limiting
experiment, which we call MCOGARCH, which is not equivalent, but nevertheless
quite similar, to COGARCH. In the COGARCH model, the jump times can be more
random than for the MCOGARCH, a fact practitioners may see as an advantage of
COGARCH.

charged dilepton states have already been studied with reference to the LHC.
Here we study the production and detection at the LHC of flavor violating
charged quadrileptons which are shown to have certain advantages over dileptons
in searching for lepton flavor violation. A classification of all six-fermionic
operators, in the chiral basis and contributing to such processes, is made and
the corresponding cross section for each in 14 TeV pp collisions is computed

The process happens in the absence or for very low Schwoebel barriers at the
ideal surface. Bunches of several steps are well separated, move slowly and are
rather stiff. Character of the process changes for more rapid sublimation
process where double step formations become dominant and together with meanders
and local bunches assemble into the less ordered surface pattern. Solution of
the analytic equations written for one dimensional system confirms that step
bunching is induced by the particle advection caused by step-flow anisotropy.
This anisotropy becomes important when due to the low Schwoebel barrier both

very high Schwoebel barrier steps fracture and rough surface builds up.

imaginary part of time-dependent linear susceptibility Im[X(t)] of the atomic

of a discretised version of a string diagram called a string graph. String

double-pushout graph rewriting. Furthermore, we show how string graphs modulo a

  The second contribution is in the application of graphical languages to
quantum information theory. We use a mixture of diagrammatic and algebraic

therefore cannot be applied to many real-world problems. We consider the RL
problem in the supervised classification framework where the optimal policy is
obtained through a multiclass classifier, the set of classes being the set of
actions of the problem. We introduce error-correcting output codes (ECOCs) in
this setting and propose two new methods for reducing complexity when using
rollouts-based approaches. The first method consists in using an ECOC-based
classifier as the multiclass classifier, reducing the learning complexity from
O(A2) to O(Alog(A)). We then propose a novel method that profits from the
ECOC's coding dictionary to split the initial MDP into O(log(A)) seperate
two-action MDPs. This second method reduces learning complexity even further,
from O(A2) to O(log(A)), thus rendering problems with large action sets
tractable. We finish by experimentally demonstrating the advantages of our
approach on a set of benchmark problems, both in speed and performance.

higher order long distance matrix elements are estimated through velocity
scaling rule with adopting $v^2=0.23$ and the lower order long distance matrix
elements are fixed, the leading order cross sections of color-octet states are
reduced by about a factor of $20\sim40%$ at large $p_T$ at both the Tevatron

relativistic correction is ignored along with $p_T$ increasing. Using long
distance matrix elements extracted from the fit to $J/\psi$ production at the
Tevatron, we can find the unpolarization cross sections of $J/\psi$ production
at the LHC taking into account both QCD and relativistic corrections are
changed by about $20\sim50%$ of that considering only QCD corrections. These
results indicate that relativistic corrections may play an important role in
$J/\psi$ production at the Tevatron and the LHC.

the unusual broad absorption line (BAL) quasars and the strong iron emitters

reproduce very closely that of the full simulation and reconstruction of the

calorimetric performance from full simulation is presented. The procedure is
parametric, with no the need to simulate the detailed shower development, and

long-period spectroscopic binary system seen almost pole-on (i~21 deg. The
brighter component, which also has the higher rotational velocity (v sin i=37.5
km/s), is a delta Sct-type variable. There is a dominant axisymmetric mode
(17.16 c/d). After the detection of about 250 terms (corresponding to an
amplitude of about 0.045 mmag) a flat plateau appears in the power spectrum in
the low-frequency region up to about 35 c/d. We were able to detect this
plateau only thanks to the short cadence sampling of the CoRoT measurements (32
s). The density distribution vs. frequency of the detected frequencies seems
rule out the possibility that this plateau is the result of a process with a
continuum power spectrum. The spacings of the strongest modes suggest a
quasi-periodic pattern. We failed to find a satisfactory seismic model that
simultaneously matches the frequency range, the position in the HR diagram, and
the quasi-periodic pattern interpreted as a large separation. Nineteen modes
were detected spectroscopically from the line profile variations and associated
to the photometric ones. Tentative l,m values have been attributed to the modes
detected spectroscopically. Prograde as well as retrograde modes are present

that problem instances have large girth. We show that if the girth is some $k$,
the problem is roughly $2^{\log^{1-\epsilon} n/k}$ hard to approximate for all
constant $\epsilon > 0$. A similar theorem was claimed by Elkin and Peleg
[ICALP 2000], but their proof was later found to have a fundamental error. We
use the new proof to show inapproximability for the basic $k$-spanner problem,
which is both the simplest problem in graph spanners and one of the few for
which super-logarithmic hardness was not known. Assuming $NP \not\subseteq
BPTIME(2^{polylog(n)})$, we show that for every $k \geq 3$ and every constant
$\epsilon > 0$ it is hard to approximate the basic $k$-spanner problem within a
factor better than $2^{(\log^{1-\epsilon} n) / k}$ (for large enough $n$). A
similar hardness for basic $k$-spanner was claimed by Elkin and Peleg [ICALP
2000], but the error in their analysis of Label Cover made this proof fail as
well. Thus for the problem of Label Cover with large girth we give the first
non-trivial lower bound. For the basic $k$-spanner problem we improve the
previous best lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)/k$ by Kortsarz [Algorithmica
1998]. Our main technique is subsampling the edges of 2-query PCPs, which
allows us to reduce the degree of a PCP to be essentially equal to the
soundness desired. This turns out to be enough to essentially guarantee large

ordered groups of a special type.

The proposed circuit not only indicates the type of transistor(NPN/PNP) but
also indicates the terminals(emitter, base and collector) using simple dual
color (red/green) LEDs. Color diagrams of testing procedure have been given for
easy following. This article describes the construction of this apparatus in
all detail with schematic circuit diagram, circuit layout and constructional
illustration. The second part describes a simple circuit to test digital ICs in
a physics lab. Small scale integration digital ICs like logic gates,
flip-flops, registers, counters, decoders, multiplexers etc are used in physics
lab for various purposes either in a commercially obtained equipment or lab
made circuits. The non-functionality of a circuit may call for a test of the
digital chip. Commercially available test equipment is expensive, bulky and
some times useless with regard to the concerned test. This article describes an
inexpensive, portable and useful digital IC test circuit that could be helpful
in detecting the actual fault with the chip provided the data sheet for the
chip is available. In a very convenient and easy way. The article contains neat
diagrams and illustrations to help the reader build a proper functional digital
IC tester.

cosmological model representing massive strings. The energy-momentum tensor, as
formulated by Letelier (Phys. Rev. D 28: 2414, 1983) has been used to construct
massive string cosmological model for which we assume that the expansion scalar
in the model is proportional to one of the components of shear tensor. The
Einstein's field equations have been solved by considering time dependent
deceleration parameter which renders the scale factor $a = (\sinh(\alpha
t))^{\frac{1}{n}}$, where $\alpha$ and $n$ are constants. It has been detected
that, for $n > 1$, the presented model has a transition of the universe from
the early decelerated phase to the recent accelerating phase at present epoch
while for $0 < n \leq 1$, this describes purely accelerating universe which is
consistent with recent astrophysical observations. Moreover, some physical and
geometric properties of the model along with physical acceptability of the
solutions have been also discussed in detail.

specified as a classical extended real object whose response to an external
force is aptly specified solely by the trajectory of a single point, whose
velocity eventually stops changing after the cessation of the external force.
Second, the dynamic models of an PO that generalize the Newton second law by
the explicit modeling of PO-acceleration by nonlinear functions of the external
force. Third, the long-time asymptotic dynamics of an PO (LTAD) modeled by
polynomials in time-derivatives of the external force (by LTAD-models). To make
LTAD-models we do not need to know the PO equation of motion. Given the PO
equation of motion, without solving it, we can calculate the appropriate
LTAD-models, but not vice verse. Fourth, the asymptotic differential equations
about the LTAD. They are equivalent to the LTAD-models, but not to the PO
equation of motion.
  To resolve the conceptual controversy surrounding the relativistic
Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation, we interpret this equation as an asymptotic
differential equation about the LTAD of an electrified PO, and not as a
differential equation of motion for an electrified PO.

two-terminal electrical circuit element, had finally been discovered. The
memristor is the fourth and last such circuit element and thus completes
circuit theory. Predicted already in 1971, the eventual discovery of something
seemingly so basic needed almost 40 years. However, this discovery is doubted.
The predicted memristor has no material memory and is based on magnetic flux,
but the discovered devices constitute analogue memory storage that do not
involve magnetism. The person who originally proposed the memristor did not
reject the discovery but instead changed his mind about what a memristor is. We
briefly introduce the history and then carefully memristance and the memristor
as such. We discuss its status as a model rather than a device. We discuss the
discovered devices, their stability, and how stability relates to the
consistency of the theoretical entities. A thought experiment assumes a world
without magnetism. Inductors cannot exist there, but memory resistors could
still be constructed. On the same grounds as the memristor was historically
predicted, an ""inductor"" could then be predicted. Likely, somebody would also
'discover' one. A tentative sociological analysis compares to the flawed
detection of gravitational waves but comes to very different conclusions.
