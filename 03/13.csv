we investigate both circular and flat interfaces and report their statistics in

scaling exponents but beyond: they asymptotically share even the precise forms
of the distribution function and the spatial correlation function in common
with solvable models of the KPZ class, demonstrating also an intimate relation
to random matrix theory. We then determine other statistical properties for
which no exact theoretical predictions were made, in particular the temporal
correlation function and the persistence probabilities. Experimental results on
finite-time effects and extreme-value statistics are also presented. Throughout
the paper, emphasis is put on how the universal statistical properties depend
on the global geometry of the interfaces, i.e., whether the interfaces are
circular or flat. We thereby corroborate the powerful yet geometry-dependent
universality of the KPZ class, which governs growing interfaces driven out of
equilibrium.

wires formed by dangling bonds on Si(100)-H (2 x 1). The calculations are
performed with density functional theory (DFT). Infinite wires are found to be
insulating and Peierls distorted, however finite wires develop localized
electronic states that can be of great use for molecular-based devices. The
ground state solution of finite wires does not correspond to a geometrical
distortion but rather to an antiferromagnetic ordering. For the stability of
wires, the presence of abundant H atoms in nearby Si atoms can be a problem. We
have evaluated the energy barriers for intradimer and intrarow diffusion
finding all of them about 1 eV or larger, even in the case where a H impurity
is already sitting on the wire. These results are encouraging for using
dangling-bond wires in future devices.

offering efficient means of obtaining spectral as well as imaging information
at the same time. IFU instrument designs are complex and spectral images have
typically highly condensed formats, therefore presenting challenges for the IFU
data reduction pipelines. In the case of the VLT VIMOS-IFU, a fringe-like
pattern affecting the spectra well into the optical and blue wavelength regime
as well as artificial intensity variations, require additional reduction steps
beyond standard pipeline processing. In this research note we propose an
empirical method for the removal of the fringe-like pattern in the spectral
domain and the intensity variations in the imaging domain. We also demonstrate
the potential consequences for data analysis if the effects are not corrected.
Here we use the example of deriving stellar velocity, velocity dispersion and
absorption line-strength maps for early-type galaxies. We derive for each
spectrum, reduced by the ESO standard VIMOS pipeline, a correction-spectrum by
using the median of the eight surrounding spectra as a proxy for the
unaffected, underlying spectrum. This method relies on the fact that our
science targets (nearby ETGs) cover the complete FoV of the VIMOS-IFU with
slowly varying spectral properties and that the exact shape of the fringe-like
pattern is nearly independent and highly variable between neighboring spatial
positions. We find that the proposed correction methods for the removal of the
fringe-like pattern and the intensity variations in VIMOS-IFU data-cubes are
suitable to allow for meaningful data analysis in our sample of nearby
early-type galaxies. Since the method relies on the scientific target
properties it is not suitable for general implementation in the pipeline
software for VIMOS.

designed to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. Fields range in
size from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using Herschel-SPIRE (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),
and Herschel-PACS (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of
270 deg^2 with SPIRE alone. These bands cover the peak of the redshifted
thermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capture
the re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation that
has been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a complete
multi-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.
  The survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of the
best studied fields in the sky. Additionally, HerMES is closely coordinated
with the PACS Evolutionary Probe survey. Making maximum use of the full
spectrum of ancillary data, from radio to X-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:
facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; and
understand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and other
processes. Scientific questions HerMES will be used to answer include: the
total infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;
the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populations
of galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statistical
techniques.
  This paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines the
primary scientific goals of the HerMES team, and reviews some of the early
results.

graphical condition does not require that the network be balanced or symmetric,
thereby extending many previous results in the literature. The key novelty of
our approach is to augment an additional variable for each agent, called
""surplus"", whose function is to locally record individual state updates. For
convergence analysis, we employ graph-theoretic and nonnegative matrix tools,
with the eigenvalue perturbation theory playing a crucial role.

  single-loss approximation","18 pages, 20 figures",,,,"stat.AP q-fin.RM q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A perturbative approach is used to derive approximations of arbitrary order
to estimate high percentiles of sums of positive independent random variables
that exhibit heavy tails. Closed-form expressions for the successive
approximations are obtained both when the number of terms in the sum is
deterministic and when it is random. The zeroth order approximation is the
percentile of the maximum term in the sum. Higher orders in the perturbative
series involve the right-truncated moments of the individual random variables
that appear in the sum. These censored moments are always finite. As a result,
and in contrast to previous approximations proposed in the literature, the
perturbative series has the same form regardless of whether these random
variables have a finite mean or not. The accuracy of the approximations is
illustrated for a variety of distributions and a wide range of parameters. The
quality of the estimate improves as more terms are included in the perturbative
series, specially for higher percentiles and heavier tails.

has created an arms race among database vendors to offer ever more
sophisticated in-database analytics. One challenge in this race is that each
new statistical technique must be implemented from scratch in the RDBMS, which
leads to a lengthy and complex development process. We argue that the root
cause for this overhead is the lack of a unified architecture for in-database
analytics. Our main contribution in this work is to take a step towards such a
unified architecture. A key benefit of our unified architecture is that
performance optimizations for analytics techniques can be studied generically
instead of an ad hoc, per-technique fashion. In particular, our technical
contributions are theoretical and empirical studies of two key factors that we
found impact performance: the order data is stored, and parallelization of
computations on a single-node multicore RDBMS. We demonstrate the feasibility
of our architecture by integrating several popular analytics techniques into
two commercial and one open-source RDBMS. Our architecture requires changes to
only a few dozen lines of code to integrate a new statistical technique. We
then compare our approach with the native analytics tools offered by the
commercial RDBMSes on various analytics tasks, and validate that our approach
achieves competitive or higher performance, while still achieving the same
quality.

fully simulated multi-hadronic events with multiple pi0's with widely varying

become challenging as the number of pi0's increases and we employ the Blossom V

where both photons of the pi0 are detected, the resulting solutions lead to an
improvement in the pi0 component of the event energy resolution for 91.2 GeV Z0
events from 18.0%/sqrt(E) to 13.9%/sqrt(E) using the ILD00 detector and its

goodness of fit for the best fit constant intensity. We also created structure
functions (SFs) for every object in our sample, the first time this technique

more variability than the published ensemble SF of AGN. Our brightest XBs were

The 5/2- states attributed to the the f5/2 orbital and positive parity 5/2+ and
7/2+ states from the g9/2 orbital have been identified in both 71,73Ni. In 71Ni
the location of a 1/2- {\beta}-decaying isomer is proposed and limits are

filling pattern of horizontal flows. While typical supergranules have diameters
of about 35 Mm, they exhibit a broad spectrum of sizes from ~10 Mm to ~100 Mm.
Here we show that supergranules of different sizes can be used to probe the
rotation rate in the Sun's outer convection zone. We find that the equatorial
rotation rate as a function of depth as measured by global helioseismology
matches the equatorial rotation as a function of wavelength for the
supergranules. This suggests that supergranules are advected by flows at depths
equal to their wavelengths and thus can be used to probe flows at those depths.
The supergranule rotation profiles show that the surface shear layer, through
which the rotation rate increases inward, extends to depths of ~50 Mm and to
latitudes of at least 70 degrees. Typical supergranules are well observed at
high latitudes and have a range of sizes that extend to greater depths than
those typically available for measuring subsurface flows with local
helioseismology. These characteristics indicate that probing the solar
convection zone dynamics with supergranules can complement the results of
helioseismology.

large deviations from LD in the region $Q^2=20-50$ GeV$^2$ seem very unlikely.
The data on the ($\eta,\eta')\to\gamma\gamma^*$ form factors meet the
expectations from the LD model. However, the {\sc BaBar} results for the
$\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma^*$ form factor imply a violation of LD growing with $Q^2$

redshifts z>2x10^6. At these early times, the Universe was dense and hot enough
that complete thermal equilibrium between baryonic matter (electrons and ions)
and photons could be established. Any perturbation away from the blackbody
spectrum was suppressed exponentially. New physics, for example annihilation
and decay of dark matter, can add energy and photons to CMB at redshifts z>10^5
and result in a Bose-Einstein spectrum with a non-zero chemical potential
($\mu$). Precise evolution of the CMB spectrum around the critical redshift of
z~2x10^6 is required in order to calculate the $\mu$-type spectral distortion
and constrain the underlying new physics. Although numerical calculation of
important processes involved (double Compton process, comptonization and
bremsstrahlung) is not difficult, analytic solutions are much faster and easier
to calculate and provide valuable physical insights. We provide precise (better
than 1%) analytic solutions for the decay of $\mu$, created at an earlier
epoch, including all three processes, double Compton, Compton scattering on
thermal electrons and bremsstrahlung in the limit of small distortions. This is
a significant improvement over the existing solutions with accuracy ~10% or
worse. We also give a census of important sources of energy injection into CMB
in standard cosmology. In particular, calculations of distortions from
electron-positron annihilation and primordial nucleosynthesis illustrate in a
dramatic way the strength of the equilibrium restoring processes in the early
Universe. Finally, we point out the triple degeneracy in standard cosmology,

electrons, Silk damping and annihilation of thermally produced WIMP dark matter

An iron abundance of [Fe/H]=--4.89 makes SDSS J102915+172927 one of the lowest

objects challenge traditional notions of both galaxies and star clusters. To
address this, we propose a definition of galaxy independent of the cold dark
matter model of the universe: A galaxy is a gravitationally bound set of stars
whose properties cannot be explained by a combination of baryons and Newton's
laws of gravity. After exploring observational diagnostics of this definition,
we examine the classification of ultra-faint dwarfs, globular clusters,
ultra-compact dwarfs, and tidal dwarfs. While kinematic studies provide an
effective galaxy diagnostic in many regimes, they can be less useful for
compact or faint systems. To explore the use of [Fe/H] spread as a
complementary diagnostic, we use published spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements of
16 Milky Way dwarfs and 24 globular clusters to calculate their [Fe/H] spreads
and uncertainties. Our principal results are: (i) no old star cluster less
luminous then M_V = -10 has a significant (> 0.1 dex) spread in iron; (ii)
known ultra-faint dwarfs can be classified with a combination of kinematics and
[Fe/H]; (iii) the observed [Fe/H] spreads in massive (> 10^6 M_Sun) globular
clusters do not necessarily imply they are the stripped nuclei of dwarfs, nor a
need for dark matter; and (iv) if ultra-compact dwarfs reside in dark matter
halos akin to those of ultra-faint dwarfs of the same half-light radii, then
they will show no clear dynamical signature of dark matter. We suggest
measurements that may assist future classification of massive globular
clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and ultra-faint galaxies. Our galaxy definition
is designed to be independent of the details of current observations and
models, while our proposed diagnostics can be refined or replaced as our
understanding of the universe evolves.

wavelengths provide important information on the evolution of infrared-bright
galaxies. We combine the data from six blank-field surveys carried out at 1.1
mm with AzTEC, totalling 1.6 square degrees in area with root-mean-square
depths ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 mJy, and derive the strongest constraints to
date on the 1.1 mm source counts at flux densities S(1100) = 1-12 mJy. Using
additional data from the AzTEC Cluster Environment Survey to extend the counts
to S(1100) ~ 20 mJy, we see tentative evidence for an enhancement relative to
the exponential drop in the counts at S(1100) ~ 13 mJy and a smooth connection
to the bright source counts at >20 mJy measured by the South Pole Telescope;
this excess may be due to strong lensing effects. We compare these counts to
predictions from several semi-analytical and phenomenological models and find
that for most the agreement is quite good at flux densities > 4 mJy; however,
we find significant discrepancies (>3sigma) between the models and the observed
1.1 mm counts at lower flux densities, and none of them are consistent with the
observed turnover in the Euclidean-normalised counts at S(1100) < 2 mJy. Our
new results therefore may require modifications to existing evolutionary models
for low luminosity galaxies. Alternatively, the discrepancy between the
measured counts at the faint end and predictions from phenomenological models
could arise from limited knowledge of the spectral energy distributions of
faint galaxies in the local Universe.

ring galaxy. Auriga's Wheel has a number of interesting features including a
bridge of stars linking the neighbouring elliptical to the ring galaxy, and
evidence for components of expansion and rotation within the ring. Using
N-body/SPH modelling, we study collisions between an elliptical galaxy and a
late-type disk galaxy. A near direct collision, with a mildy inclined disk, is
found to reasonably reproduce the general system morphology ~50 Myr following
the collision. The collision must have a relatively low velocity (initially
~150 km s^{-1}) in order to form the observed bridge, and simultaneously match
the galaxies separation. Our best-match model suggests the total disk galaxy is
~5 times more massive than the elliptical. We find that the velocity of
expansion of the ring is sensitive to the mass of the elliptical, while
insensitive to the encounter velocity. We evolve our simulation beyond the
current epoch to study the future destiny of the galaxy pair. In our model, the
nucleus moves further away from the plane of the ring in the direction of the
stellar bridge. The nucleus eventually merges with the elliptical galaxy ~100
Myr after the present time. The ring continues to expand for ~200 Myr before
collapsing back. The low initial relative velocity of the two galaxies will
eventually result in a complete merger.

called ""metallicity"". A number of very metal poor stars have been found some of
which, while having a low iron abundance, are rich in carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen. For theoretical reasons and because of an observed absence of stars
with metallicities lower than Z=1.5E-5, it has been suggested that low mass
stars (M<0.8M\odot, the ones that survive to the present day) cannot form until
the interstellar medium has been enriched above a critical value, estimated to
lie in the range 1.5E-8\leqZ\leq1.5E-6, although competing theories claiming
the contrary do exist. Here we report the chemical composition of a star with a
very low Z\leq6.9E-7 (4.5E-5 of that of the Sun) and a chemical pattern typical
of classical extremely metal poor stars, meaning without the enrichment of
carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. This shows that low mass stars can be formed at
very low metallicity. Lithium is not detected, suggesting a low metallicity
extension of the previously observed trend in lithium depletion. Lithium
depletion implies that the stellar material must have experienced temperatures
above two million K in its history, which points to rather particular formation
condition or internal mixing process, for low Z stars.

generating supermassive black holes in the early universe. It is expected that
an SMS could form via very rapid mass accretion with Mdot ~ 0.1 - 1 Msun/yr
during the gravitational collapse of an atomic-cooling primordial gas cloud. In
this paper we study how stars would evolve under such extreme rapid mass
accretion, focusing on the early evolution until the stellar mass reaches 1000
Msun. To this end we numerically calculate the detailed interior structure of
accreting stars with primordial element abundances. Our results show that for
accretion rates higher than 0.01 Msun/yr, stellar evolution is qualitatively
different from that expected at lower rates. While accreting at these high
rates the star always has a radius exceeding 100 Rsun, which increases
monotonically with the stellar mass. The mass-radius relation for stellar
masses exceeding ~ 100 Msun follows the same track with R_* \propto M_*^0.5 in
all cases with accretion rates > 0.01 Msun/yr; at a stellar mass of 1000 Msun
the radius is about 7000 Rsun (~= 30 AU). With higher accretion rates the onset
of hydrogen burning is shifted towards higher stellar masses. In particular,
for accretion rates exceeding Mdot > 0.1 Msun/yr, there is no significant
hydrogen burning even after 1000 Msun have accreted onto the protostar. Such
""supergiant"" protostars have effective temperatures as low as Teff ~= 5000 K
throughout their evolution and because they hardly emit ionizing photons, they
do not create an HII region or significantly heat their immediate surroundings.
Thus, radiative feedback is unable to hinder the growth of rapidly accreting
stars to masses in excess of 1000 Msun, as long as material is accreted at
rates Mdot > 0.01 Msun/yr.

Our results show that multiple-halo lines of sight can increase the magnified
source-plane region compared to the single cluster lenses typically targeted

high-redshift sources. The configurations that result in optimal lensing cross
sections benefit from interactions between the lens potentials of the halos
when they overlap somewhat on the sky, creating regions of high magnification
in the source plane not present when the halos are considered individually. The
effect of these interactions on the lensing cross section can even be
comparable to changing the total mass of the lens from 10^15 M_sun to 3x10^15
M_sun. The gain in lensing cross section increases as the mass is split into
more halos, provided that the lens potentials are projected close enough to
interact with each other. A nonzero projected halo angular separation, equal
halo mass ratio, and high projected halo concentration are the best mass
configurations, whereas projected halo ellipticity, halo triaxiality, and the
relative orientations of the halos are less important. Such high mass,
multiple-halo lines of sight exist in the SDSS.

offer an unprecedented view of the system, allowing us to obtain H and 3.3$
micron photometry of the innermost planet (for the first time) and put strong
upper-limits on the presence of a hypothetical fifth companion. We find that
all four planets are unexpectedly bright at 3.3 microns compared to the
equilibrium chemistry models used for field brown dwarfs, which predict that
planets should be faint at 3.3 microns due to CH4 opacity. We attempt to model
the planets with thick-cloudy, non-equilibrium chemistry atmospheres, but find
that removing CH4 to fit the 3.3 micron photometry increases the predicted L'
(3.8 microns) flux enough that it is inconsistent with observations. In an
effort to fit the SED of the HR 8799 planets, we construct mixtures of cloudy
atmospheres, which are intended to represent planets covered by clouds of
varying opacity. In this scenario, regions with low opacity look hot and
bright, while regions with high opacity look faint, similar to the patchy cloud
structures on Jupiter and L/T transition brown-dwarfs. Our mixed cloud models
reproduce all of the available data, but self-consistent models are still
necessary to demonstrate their viability.

framework of halo occupation statistics. Using two-point statistics in
projection, we define the galaxy bias function, b_g(r_p), and the galaxy-dark
matter cross-correlation function, R_{gm}(r_p), where r_p is the projected
distance. We use the analytical halo model to predict how the scale dependence
of b_g and R_{gm}, over the range 0.1 Mpc/h < r_p < 30 Mpc/h, depends on the
non-linearity and stochasticity in halo occupation models. In particular we
quantify the effect due to the presence of central galaxies, the assumption for
the radial distribution of satellite galaxies, the richness of the halo, and
the Poisson character of the probability to have a certain number of satellite
galaxies in a halo of a certain mass. Overall, brighter galaxies reveal a
stronger scale dependence, and out to a larger radius. In real-space, we find
that galaxy bias becomes scale independent, with R_{gm} = 1, for radii r > 1 -
5 Mpc/h, depending on luminosity. However, galaxy bias is scale-dependent out
to much larger radii when one uses the projected quantities defined in this
paper. These projected bias functions have the advantage that they are more
easily accessible observationally and that their scale dependence carries a
wealth of information regarding the properties of galaxy biasing. To
observationally constrain the parameters of the halo occupation statistics and
to unveil the origin of galaxy biasing we propose the use of the bias function
Gamma_{gm}(r_p)=b_g(r_p)/R_{gm}(r_p). This function is obtained via a
combination of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, and it can be
measured using existing and forthcoming imaging and spectroscopic galaxy
surveys.

galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be obtained efficiently only through single-epoch
spectra, using a combination of their broad emission-line widths and continuum
luminosities. Yet the reliability and accuracy of the method, and the resulting
mass estimates, M_BH, remain uncertain. A recent study by Croom using a sample
of SDSS, 2QZ and 2SLAQ quasars suggests that line widths contribute little
information about the BH mass in these single-epoch estimates and can be
replaced by a constant value without significant loss of accuracy. In this
Letter, we use a sample of nearby reverberation-mapped AGNs to show that this
conclusion is not universally applicable. We use the bulge luminosity (L_Bulge)
of these local objects to test how well the known M_BH - L_Bulge correlation is
recovered when using randomly assigned line widths instead of the measured ones
to estimate M_BH. We find that line widths provide significant information
about M_BH, and that for this sample, the line width information is just as
significant as that provided by the continuum luminosities. We discuss the
effects of observational biases upon the analysis of Croom and suggest that the
results can probably be explained as a bias of flux-limited, shallow quasar
samples.

produces an initial mass function (IMF) consistent both with that of the ONC

reproduces the observed IMF in a cluster large enough to contain massive stars,
and where the result is determined by a fully self-consistent calculation of
gas thermodynamics. This simulation also produces a star formation rate that,
while still somewhat too high, is much closer to observed values than if we
omit either the larger turbulent volume or the outflows. Moreover, we show that
the combination of outflows, self-consistently turbulent initial conditions,
and turbulence continually fed by motions on scales larger than that of the
protocluster yields an IMF that is in agreement with observations and invariant
with time, resolving the ""overheating"" problem in which simulations without
these features have an IMF peak that shifts to progressively higher masses over
time. The simulation that matches the observed IMF also reproduces the observed
trend of stellar multiplicity strongly increasing with mass. We show that this
simulation produces massive stars from distinct massive cores whose properties
are consistent with those of observed massive cores. However, the stars formed
in these cores also undergo dynamical interactions that naturally produce
Trapezium-like hierarchical multiple systems.

simulations. We find that disks, initially truncated at three scale-lengths,
can triple their radial extent, solely driven by secular evolution. Both Type I
(single exponential) and Type II (down-turning) observed disk
surface-brightness profiles can be explained by our findings. We relate these
results to the strong angular momentum outward transfer, resulting from torques
and radial migration associated with multiple patterns, such as central bars
and spiral waves of different multiplicity. We show that even for stars ending
up on cold orbits, the changes in angular momentum exhibit complex structure as
a function of radius, unlike the expected effect of transient spirals alone.
Focussing on one of our models, we find evidence for non-linear coupling among
m=1, 2, 3 and 4 density waves, where m is the pattern multiplicity. We suggest
that the naturally occurring larger resonance widths at galactic radii beyond
four scale-lengths may have profound consequences on the formation and location
of breaks in disk density profiles, provided spirals are present at such large
distances. We also consider the effect of gas inflow and show that when
in-plane smooth gas accretion of ~5 M_sun/yr is included, the outer disks
become more unstable, leading to a strong increase in the stellar velocity
dispersion. This, in turn, causes the formation of a Type III (up-turning)
profile in the old stellar population. We propose that observations of Type III
surface brightness profiles, combined with an up-turn in the stellar velocity
dispersions beyond the disk break, could be a signature of ongoing
gas-accretion. The results of this study suggest that disk outskirts comprised
of stars migrated from the inner disk would have relatively large radial
velocity dispersions, and significant thickness when seen edge-on. [Abridged]

found in NGC 1365 and Mrk 766. Unlike these other examples, however, the clouds

remarkably free of any absorption features. A particularly intriguing
alternative is that the accretion disk is undergoing the same cycle of

We aim to constrain the amount and nature of stellar and dark mass associated

near-infrared imaging to determine the $K_\mathrm{s}$-band luminosity function
of the S-star cluster members, and the distribution of the diffuse background
emission and the stellar number density counts around the central black hole.
This allows us to determine the stellar light and mass contribution expected
from the faint members of the cluster. We then use post-Newtonian N-body
techniques to investigate the effect of stellar perturbations on the motion of
S2, as a means of detecting the number and masses of the perturbers. We find
that the stellar mass derived from the $K_\mathrm{s}$-band luminosity
extrapolation is much smaller than the amount of mass that might be present
considering the uncertainties in the orbital motion of the star S2. Also the
amount of light from the fainter S-cluster members is below the amount of
residual light at the position of the S-star cluster after removing the bright
cluster members. If the distribution of stars and stellar remnants is strongly
enough peaked near Sagittarius A*, observed changes in the orbital elements of

that the predominantly ionized HVCs contain at least as much mass as the
traditional HI HVCs and show that large HI HVC complexes have generally ionized

the Galactic sky that are covered with ionized high-velocity gas with little HI
emission nearby. We show that the covering factors of HVCs with 90<|v_LSR|<170
km/s drawn from the AGN and stellar samples are similar. This confirms that
these HVCs are within 5-15 kpc of the sun. The covering factor of these HVCs
drops with decreasing vertical height, which is consistent with HVCs being
decelerated or disrupted as they fall to the Milky Way disk. The HVCs with
|v_LSR|>170 km/s are largely associated with the Magellanic Stream at b<0 and
its leading arm at b>0 as well as other large known HI complexes. Therefore

to disappear locally. This is the essence of the equivalence principle. In
general relativity the equivalence principle is implemented using differential
geometry. The connection that comes from a metric is used to glue together the
different gravity-free Minkowski spaces. In this article we argue that there is
another way to implement the equivalence principle. In this new way it is not
different Minkowski spaces that are connected but different vacua of an

that one can start with a quantum mechanical model so that the question of how

triplets and a complex scalar singlet to its particle content. In this
framework, the CP symmetry is spontaneously broken at high energies by the
complex vacuum expectation value of the scalar singlet. Such a breaking leads
to leptonic CP violation at low energies. The model also exhibits an $A_4\times
Z_4$ flavour symmetry which, after being spontaneously broken at a high-energy
scale, yields a tribimaximal pattern in the lepton sector. We consider small
perturbations around the tribimaximal vacuum alignment condition in order to
generate nonzero values of $\theta_{13}$, as required by the latest neutrino
oscillation data. It is shown that the value of $\theta_{13}$ recently measured
by the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment can be accommodated in our
framework together with large Dirac-type CP violation. We also address the
viability of leptogenesis in our model through the out-of-equilibrium decays of
the Higgs triplets. In particular, the CP asymmetries in the triplet decays

effect of differential magnification on simulated far-infrared and submm
surveys of strong gravitational lenses, using a foreground population of
Navarro-Frenk-White plus de Vaucouleurs' density profiles, with a model source
resembling the Cosmic Eyelash and QSO J1148+5251. Some emission line
diagnostics are surprisingly unaffected by differential magnification effects:
for example, the bolometric fractions of [C II] 158um and CO(J=1-0), often used
to infer densities and ionisation parameters, have typical differential
magnification effects that are smaller than the measurement errors. However,
the CO ladder itself is significantly affected. Far-infrared lensed galaxy
surveys (e.g. at 60um) strongly select for high-redshift galaxies with caustics
close to AGN, boosting the apparent bolometric contribution of AGN. The lens
configuration of IRAS F10214+4724 is naturally explained in this context.
Conversely, submm/mm-wave surveys (e.g. 500-1400um) strongly select for
caustics close to knots of star formation boosting the latter's bolometric
fraction. In general, estimates of bolometric fractions from spectral energy
distributions of strongly lensed infrared galaxies are so unreliable as to be
useless, unless a lens mass model is available to correct for differential
magnification.

reflecting the light from the central star. Due to the changing luminosity of
the central source, light echoes propagate into the nebula. This remarkable
phenomenon was the subject of Paper I.The origin and physical properties of the
nebula are however uncertain: it may have been created through mass loss from
the star itself, or it could be the remnant of a pre-existing interstellar
cloud. Our goal is to determine the 3D structure of the nebula, and estimate
its mass. Knowing the geometrical shape of the nebula will also allow us to
retrieve the distance of RS Pup in an unambiguous manner using a model of its
light echoes (in a forthcoming work). The scattering angle of the Cepheid light
in the circumstellar nebula can be recovered from its degree of linear
polarization. We thus observed the nebula surrounding RS Pup using the
polarimetric imaging mode of the VLT/FORS instrument, and obtained a map of the
degree and position angle of linear polarization. From our FORS observations,
we derive a 3D map of the distribution of the dust, whose overall geometry is
an irregular and thin layer. The nebula does not present a well-defined
symmetry. Using a simple model, we derive a total dust mass of M(dust) = 2.9
+/- 0.9 Msun for the dust within 1.8 arcmin of the Cepheid. This translates
into a total mass of M(gas+dust) = 290 +/- 120 Msun, assuming a dust-to-gas
ratio of 1.0 +/- 0.3 %. The high mass of the dusty nebula excludes that it was
created by mass-loss from the star. However, the thinness nebula is an
indication that the Cepheid participated to its shaping, e.g. through its
radiation pressure or stellar wind. RS Pup therefore appears as a regular
long-period Cepheid located in an exceptionally dense interstellar environment.

an indication of nonclassical behavior. However, this does not preclude states
that are non-negative from exhibiting phenomena typically associated with
quantum mechanics - the single qubit stabilizer states have non-negative Wigner
functions and yet play a fundamental role in many quantum information tasks. We
seek to determine what other sets of quantum states and measurements for a
qubit can be non-negative in a quasiprobability representation, and to identify
nontrivial unitary groups that permute the states in such a set. These sets of
states and measurements are analogous to the single qubit stabilizer states. We
show that no quasiprobability representation of a qubit can be non-negative for
more than four bases and that the non-negative bases in any quasiprobability
representation must satisfy certain symmetry constraints. We provide an
exhaustive list of the sets of single qubit bases that are non-negative in some
quasiprobability representation and are also permuted by a nontrivial unitary
group. This list includes two families of three bases that both include the
single qubit stabilizer states as a special case and a family of four bases
whose symmetry group is the Pauli group. For higher dimensions, we prove that
there can be no more than 2^{d^2} states in non-negative bases of a
d-dimensional Hilbert space in any quasiprobability representation.
Furthermore, these bases must satisfy certain symmetry constraints,
corresponding to requiring the bases to be sufficiently complementary to each
other.

observable with the unaided eye, a remarkable property shared only by Algol,

combination of spectroscopy, high-precision astrometry of the orbits of Aab-B

(VLTI/AMBER). The main eclipsing component is a pair of A-type stars in rapid
rotation. We modeled the photometric and radial velocity measurements of the
eclipsing pair Aa-Ab using a self consistent method based on physical
parameters (mass, radius, luminosity, rotational velocity). From this modeling,
we derive the fundamental parameters of the eclipsing stars with a typical
accuracy of 1%. We find that they have similar masses, respectively 2.43 +/-
0.02 and 2.27 +/- 0.02 Msun. The physical parameters of the tertiary component

effects at low-energies. Presently, the largest discrepancy between a standard
model prediction and experimental measurements appears in the branching ratio
of the charged current mediated B to tau nu decay, where the large tau mass
lifts the helicity suppression arising in leptonic B decays. Less significant
systematic deviations are also observed in the semileptonic B to D(*) tau nu
rates. Due to the rich spin structure of the final state, the decay mode B to
D* tau nu offers a number of tests of such possible standard model deviations.
We investigate the most general set of lowest dimensional effective operators
leading to helicity suppressed modifications of b to c (semi)leptonic
transitions. We explore such contributions to the B to D* tau nu decay
amplitudes by determining the differential decay rate, longitudinal D*
polarization fraction, D* - tau opening angle asymmetry and the tau helicity
asymmetry. We identify the size of possible new physics contributions
constrained by the present B to D(*) tau nu rate measurements and find
significant modifications are still possible in all of them. In particular, the
opening angle asymmetry can be shifted by almost 30%, relative to the standard
model prediction, while the tau helicity asymmetry can still deviate by as much
as 80%.

intermediate-redshift lensed quasars is formed well outside the region of
strong relativistic boosting and light-bending, relativistic effects have
important influence on microlensing curves. The reason is in the divergent
nature of amplification factors near fold caustics increasingly sensitive to
small spatial size details. Higher-order disc images produced by strong light
bending around the black hole may affect the amplification curves, making a
contribution of up to several percent near maximum amplification. In accordance
with theoretical predictions, some of the observed high-amplification events
possess fine structure. Here we consider three putative caustic crossing
events, one by SBS1520+530 and two events for individual images of the
Einstein's cross (QSO J2237+0305). Using relativistic disc models allows to
improve the fits, but the required inclinations are high, about 70deg or
larger. Such high inclinations apparently contradict the absence of any strong
absorption that is likely to arise if a disc is observed edge-on through a dust
torus. Still, the high inclinations are required only for the central parts of
the disc, that allows the disc itself to be initially tilted by 60-90deg with
respect to the black hole and aligned toward the black hole equatorial plane
near the last stable orbit radius. For SBS1520+530, an alternative explanation
for the observed amplification curve is a superposition of two subsequent fold
caustic crossings. While relativistic disc models favour black hole masses
~10^10 solar (several times higher than the virial estimates) or small
Eddington ratios, this model is consistent with the observed distribution of
galaxies over peculiar velocities only if the black hole mass is about 3 10^8

theoretic concepts and the second from physical constraints on the quantum

out: i) the set C composed of the so called classical-classical (CC)
states---separable states that are locally distinguishable and do not possess
quantum discord; ii) the set P of states endowed with a positive
P-representation (P-classical states)---mixture of Glauber coherent states
that, e.g., fail to show negativity of their Wigner function. By showing that C
and P are almost disjoint, we prove that the two defining criteria are
maximally inequivalent. Thus, the notions of classicality that they put forward
are radically different. In particular, generic CC states show quantumness in
their P-representation and, viceversa, almost all P-classical states have
positive quantum discord, hence are not CC. This inequivalence is further
elucidated considering different applications of P-classical and CC states. Our
results suggest that there are other quantum correlations in nature than those
revealed by entanglement and quantum discord.

often illustrated by the following thought experiment: A drug may be found in a
trial to increase the survival rate for both men and women, but decrease the
rate for all the subjects as a whole. This paradoxical reversal effect has been
found in numerous datasets across many disciplines, and is now included in most
introductory statistics textbooks. In the language of the drug trial, the
effect is impossible, however, if both treatment groups' survival rates are
higher than both control groups'. Here we show that for quantum probabilities,
such a reversal remains possible. In particular, a ""quantum drug"", so to speak,
could be life-saving for both men and women yet deadly for the whole
population. We further identify a simple inequality on conditional
probabilities that must hold classically but is violated by our quantum
scenarios, and completely characterize the maximum quantum violation. As
polynomial inequalities on entries of the density operator, our inequalities
are of degree 6.

quickly dissipated by Silk-damping, a process that inevitably generates mu- and
y-type spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These
spectral distortions depend on the shape and amplitude of the primordial power
spectrum at wavenumbers k < 10^4 Mpc^{-1}. Here we study constraints on the
primordial power spectrum derived from COBE/FIRAS and forecasted for PIXIE. We
show that measurements of mu and y impose strong bounds on the integrated
small-scale power, and we demonstrate how to compute these constraints using
k-space window functions that account for the effects of thermalization and
dissipation physics. We show that COBE/FIRAS places a robust upper limit on the
amplitude of the small-scale power spectrum. This limit is about three orders
of magnitude stronger than the one derived from primordial black holes in the
same scale range. Furthermore, this limit could be improved by another three
orders of magnitude with PIXIE, potentially opening up a new window to early
Universe physics. To illustrate the power of these constraints, we consider
several generic models for the small-scale power spectrum predicted by
different inflation scenarios, including running-mass inflation models and
inflation scenarios with episodes of particle production. PIXIE could place
very tight constraints on these scenarios, potentially even ruling out
running-mass inflation models if no distortion is detected. We also show that
inflation models with sub-Planckian field excursion that generate detectable
tensor perturbations should simultaneously produce a large CMB spectral
distortion, a link that could potentially be established by PIXIE.

the incorporation of screening effects. For this purpose in a first step, an
energy functional is defined by the mean value for the full Hamiltonian, not in
a Slater determinant state, but in the result of the adiabatic connection of
Coulomb plus the nuclear (jellium charge) in the Slater determinant.
Afterwards, the energy functional defining the screening approximation is
defined in a diagrammatic way, by imposing a special ""screening"" restriction on
the contractions retained in the Wick expansion. The generalized
self-consisting set of equations for the one particle orbitals are written by
imposing the extremum conditions. The scheme is applied to the homogeneous
electron gas. After simplifying the discussion by assuming the screening as
static and that the mean distance between electrons is close to the Bohr
radius, the equations for the electron spectrum and the static screening
properties are solved by iterations. The self-consistent results for the
self-energies dispersion does not show the vanishing density of states at the
Fermi level predicted by the HF self-energy spectrum. In this extreme non
retarded approximation, both, the direct and the exchange potentials are
strongly screened, and the energy is higher that the one given by the usual HF
scheme. However, the inclusion of the retardation in the exact solution and the
sum rules associated to the dielectric response of the problem, can lead to
energy lowering. These effects will be considered in the extension of the work.

temperature, because the large lattice mismatch between InAs and GaAs greatly
enhances the valence band offset. The single particle energy levels in the QDs
show strong temperature dependence due to the change of confinement potentials.
Because of the changes of the band offsets, the electron wave functions
confined in QDs increase by about 1 - 5%, whereas the hole wave functions
decrease by about 30 - 40% when the temperature increases from 0 to 300 K. The

corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action and to the cosmological constant,
and those we can not derive yet in a consistent and safe way. At the same time,
if we assume that these quantum terms are covariant and that they have relevant
magnitude, their functional form can be defined up to a single free parameter,
which can be defined on the phenomenological basis. It turns out that the
quantum correction may lead, in principle, to surprisingly strong and
interesting effects in astrophysics and cosmology.

Nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor (NEMP) stars. In order to deal with some of these
theoretical issues, we suggest an alternative explanation, where some of the
Pop. III SNe are followed by the detonation of their neutron stars
(Quark-Novae; QNe). In QNe occurring a few days to a few weeks following the
preceding SN explosion, the neutron-rich relativistic QN ejecta leads to
spallation of 56Ni processed in the ejecta of the preceding SN explosion and
thus to ""iron/metal impoverishment"" of the primordial gas swept by the combined
SN+QN ejecta. We show that the generation of stars formed from fragmentation of
pristine clouds swept-up by the combined SN+QN ejecta acquire a metallicity
with -7.5 < Fe/H] < -1.5 for dual explosions with 2 < t_delay (days) < 30.
Spallation leads to the depletion of 56Ni and formation of sub-Ni elements such
as Ti, V, Cr, and Mn providing a reasonable account of the trends observed in
galactic halo metal-poor stars. CEMP stars form in dual explosions with short
delays (t_delay < 5 days). These lead to important destruction of 56Ni (and
thus to a drastic reduction of the amount of Fe in the swept up cloud) while
preserving the carbon processed in the outer layers of the SN ejecta. Lithium
is produced from the interaction of the neutron-rich QN ejecta with the outer
(oxygen-rich) layers of the SN ejecta. A Lithium plateau with 2 < A(Li) < 2.4
can be produced in our model as well as a corresponding 6Li plateau with
6Li/7Li < 0.3.

synthesis solutions are compared with estimates of the polarization parameters

reliability of RM synthesis estimates. We show that estimates of the
polarization parameters can be made at lower S/N if the range of RMs is
bounded, but reliable estimates of individual sources with unusual RMs require
unconstrainted solutions and higher S/N.
  We derive from first principles the statistical properties of the
polarization amplitude associated with RM synthesis in the presence of noise.
The amplitude distribution depends explicitly on the amplitude of the
underlying (intrinsic) polarization signal. Hence it is necessary to model the
underlying polarization signal distribution in order to estimate the
reliability and errors in polarization parameter estimates. We introduce a
Bayesian method to derive the distribution of intrinsic amplitudes based on the
distribution of measured amplitudes.
  The theoretically-derived distribution is compared with the empirical data to
provide quantitative estimates of the probability that an RM synthesis solution
is correct as a function of S/N. We provide quantitative estimates of the
probability that any given RM synthesis solution is correct as a function of
measured polarized amplitude and the intrinsic polarization amplitude compared

Solving the Jacobi equation for such hyperbolic metrics effectively sets the

increases prompt splashing at the advancing contact line but inhibits the
formation of the thin sheet. If the air pressure is lowered, droplet ejection
is suppressed not only during thin-sheet formation but for prompt splashing as
well. The threshold pressure depends on impact velocity, liquid viscosity and
surface roughness.

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/751/1/53",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present multi-wavelength observations of the radio magnetar PSR J1622-4950
and its environment. Observations of PSR J1622-4950 with Chandra (in 2007 and
2009) and XMM (in 2011) show that the X-ray flux of PSR J1622-4950 has
decreased by a factor of ~50 over 3.7 years, decaying exponentially with a
characteristic time of 360 +/- 11 days. This behavior identifies PSR J1622-4950
as a possible addition to the small class of transient magnetars. The X-ray
decay likely indicates that PSR J1622-4950 is recovering from an X-ray outburst
that occurred earlier in 2007, before the 2007 Chandra observations.
Observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array show strong radio
variability, including a possible radio flaring event at least one and a half
years after the 2007 X-ray outburst that may be a direct result of this X-ray
event. Radio observations with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope
reveal that PSR J1622-4950 is 8' southeast of a diffuse radio arc, G333.9+0.0,
which appears non-thermal in nature and which could possibly be a previously
undiscovered supernova remnant. If G333.9+0.0 is a supernova remnant then the
estimates of its size and age, combined with the close proximity and reasonable
implied velocity of PSR J1622-4950, suggests that these two objects could be
physically associated.

channel with Gaussian noise and equal-power users. For each user, $s$
information bits are spread \emph{jointly} into a length-$sL$ vector by $L$
multiplications on GF($2^s$). Thus, each information bit is dispersed into $sL$
transmitted symbols, and the finite field despreading (FF-DES) of each bit can
take advantage of $sL$ independent receiving observations. To show the
performance gain of joint spreading quantitatively, an extrinsic information
transfer (EXIT) function analysis of the FF-DES is given. It shows that the
asymptotic slope of this EXIT function increases as $s$ increases and is in
fact the absolute slope of the bit error rate (BER) curve at the low BER
region. This means that by increasing the length $s$ of information bits for
joint spreading, a larger absolute slope of the BER curve is achieved. For $s,
L\geq 2$, the BER curve of the finite field spreading has a larger absolute
slope than that of the single-user transmission with BPSK modulation.

proposal is based on self-consistent analytic solutions of quasi-classical
Green's function with an edge. The local density of states and edge mass
current in the A-phase or edge spin current in the B-phase can be obtained from
these solutions. The edge current carried by the Majorana fermions is partially
cancelled by quasiparticles (QPs) in the continuum state outside the superfluid
gap. QPs contributing to the edge current in the continuum state are
distributed in energy even away from the superfluid gap. The effect of Majorana
fermions emerges in the depletion of the edge current by temperature within a
low-temperature range. The observations that the reduction in the mass current
is changed by $T^2$-power in the A-phase and the reduction in the spin current
is changed by $T^3$-power in the B-phase establish the existence of Majorana
fermions. We also point out another possibility for observing Majorana fermions
by controlling surface roughness.

effective solvents under physiological conditions is presented.
Analytically-computed first passage time densities of a diffusing particle in a
spherical shell with absorbing boundaries are combined with densities obtained
from explicit simulation to obtain the overall probability density for the
total reaction cycle time of the enzymatic system. The method is used to
investigate the catalytic transfer of a phosphoryl group in a phosphoglycerate
kinase-ADP-bis phosphoglycerate system, one of the steps of glycolysis. The
direct simulation of the enzyme-substrate binding and reaction is carried out
using an elastic network model for the protein, and the solvent motions are
described by multiparticle collision dynamics, which incorporates hydrodynamic
flow effects. Systems where solvent-enzyme coupling occurs through explicit
intermolecular interactions, as well as systems where this coupling is taken
into account by including the protein and substrate in the multiparticle
collision step, are investigated and compared with simulations where
hydrodynamic coupling is absent. It is demonstrated that the flow of solvent
particles around the enzyme facilitates the large-scale hinge motion of the
enzyme with bound substrates, and has a significant impact on the shape of the
probability densities and average time scales of substrate binding for
substrates near the enzyme, the closure of the enzyme after binding, and the

protocols to reduce Bk and E[t]. A novel contribution of this work is
enhancement of default ERS in the protocols to optimize Bk and E[t]. Using
NS-2, we evaluate and compare default-ERS used by these protocols; AODV-ERS1,
DSR-ERS1 and DYMO-ERS1 with enhanced-ERS; AODVERS2, DSR-ERS2 and DYMO-ERS2.
From modeling and analytical comparison, we deduce that by adjusting

can be achieved.

in iterative linear solvers. The same sparse matrix is multiplied by a dense
vector repeatedly in these solvers. Matrices with irregular sparsity patterns
make it difficult to utilize cache locality effectively in SpMxV computations.
In this work, we investigate single- and multiple-SpMxV frameworks for
exploiting cache locality in SpMxV computations. For the single-SpMxV
framework, we propose two cache-size-aware top-down row/column-reordering
methods based on 1D and 2D sparse matrix partitioning by utilizing the
column-net and enhancing the row-column-net hypergraph models of sparse
matrices. The multiple-SpMxV framework depends on splitting a given matrix into
a sum of multiple nonzero-disjoint matrices so that the SpMxV operation is
performed as a sequence of multiple input- and output-dependent SpMxV
operations. For an effective matrix splitting required in this framework, we
propose a cache-size-aware top-down approach based on 2D sparse matrix
partitioning by utilizing the row-column-net hypergraph model. The primary
objective in all of the three methods is to maximize the exploitation of
temporal locality. We evaluate the validity of our models and methods on a wide
range of sparse matrices by performing actual runs through using OSKI.
Experimental results show that proposed methods and models outperform
state-of-the-art schemes.

function of increasing occupancy of the 3d metal states. We show that all four
TMPc receive approximately one electron from the substrate. Charge transfer
occurs from the substrate to the molecules, inducing a charge reorganization in
FePc and CoPc, while adding one electron to ligand \pi-orbitals in NiPc and
CuPc. This has opposite consequences on the molecular magnetic moment: in FePc
and CoPc the interaction with the substrate tends to reduce the TM spin,
whereas in NiPc and CuPc an additional spin is induced on the aromatic Pc
ligand, leaving the TM spin unperturbed. In CuPc, the presence of both TM and
ligand spins leads to a triplet ground state arising from intramolecular
exchange coupling between d and \pi electrons. In FePc and CoPc the magnetic
moment of C and N atoms is antiparallel to that of the TM. The different
character and symmetry of the frontier orbitals in the TMPc series leads to
varying degrees of hybridization and correlation effects, ranging from the
mixed-valence (FePc, CoPc) to the Kondo regime (NiPc, CuPc). Coherent coupling
between Kondo and inelastic excitations induces finite-bias Kondo resonances

strands on the dendrimer molecule was found to be influenced by the charge
ratio of DNA and the dendrimer. As G4 dendrimer contains relatively more
positive charge than G3 dendrimer, we observe extensive wrapping of ssDNAs on
the G4 dendrimer. The ssDNA strands along with the linkers are seen to
penetrate the surface of the dendrimer molecule and approach closer to the
center of the dendrimer indicating the soft sphere nature of the dendrimer
molecule. The effective radius of DNA-functionalized dendrimer nanoparticle was
found to be independent of base composition of ssDNAs and was observed to be
around 19.5 {\AA} and 22.4 {\AA} when we used G3 and G4 PAMAM dendrimer as the

co-mounted optical trains with 8.4m primary mirrors. The telescope Adaptive
Optics (AO) system uses two innovative key components, namely an adaptive
secondary mirror with 672 actuators and a high-order pyramid wave-front sensor.
During the on-sky commissioning such a system reached performances never
achieved before on large ground-based optical telescopes. Images with 40mas
resolution and Strehl Ratios higher than 80% have been acquired in H band (1.6
micron). Such images showed a contrast as high as 10e-4. Based on these
results, we compare the performances offered by a Natural Guide Star (NGS)
system upgraded with the state-of-the-art technology and those delivered by
existing Laser Guide Star (LGS) systems. The comparison, in terms of sky
coverage and performances, suggests rethinking the current role ascribed to NGS
and LGS in the next generation of AO systems for the 8-10 meter class
telescopes and Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs).

Spectropolarimetric atlas of Smith, Young & Robinson (2002) from the observed
degrees of linear polarization and the positional angles of spectral lines
(H-alpha) (broad line regions of AGNs) and nearby continuum. The observed
polarization is lower than the Milne value in a non-magnetized atmosphere. We
hypothesize that the polarized radiation escapes from optically thick
magnetized accretion discs and is weakened by the Faraday rotation effect. This
effect is able to explain both the value of the polarization and the position
angle. We estimate the required magnetic field in the broad line region by
using simple asymptotic analytical formulas for Milne's problem in magnetized
atmosphere, which take into account the last scattering of radiation before
escaping from the accretion disc. The polarization of a broad spectral line
escaping from disc is described by the same mechanism. The characteristic
features of polarization of a broad line is the minimum of the degree of
polarization in the center of the line and continuous rotation of the position
angle from one wing to another. These effects can be explained by existence of
clouds in the left (velocity is directed to an observer) and the right
(velocity is directed from an observer) parts of the orbit in a rotating
keplerian magnetized accretion disc. The base of explanation is existence of
azimuthal magnetic field in the orbit. The existence of normal component of
magnetic field makes the picture of polarization asymmetric. The existence of
clouds in left and right parts of the orbit with different emissions also give
the contribution in asymmetry effect. Assuming a power-law dependence of the
magnetic field inside the disc, we obtain the estimate of the magnetic field
strength at first stable orbit near the central SMBH for a number of AGNs.

classified according to the inequivalent classes of monodromy, is shown to
exactly corresponds to the global description of the supermembrane with central
charges. The global description is a realization of the sculpting mechanism of
gauging (arXiv:1107.3255) and it is associated to particular deformation of
fibrations. The supermembrane with central charges may be formulated in terms
of sections on symplectic torus bundles with SL(2,Z) monodromy. This global
formulation corresponds to the gauging of the abelian subgroups of SL(2,Z)
associated to monodromies acting on the target torus. We show the existence of
the trombone symmetry in the supermembrane formulated as a non-linear
realization of the SL(2,Z) symmetry and construct its gauging in terms of the
supermembrane formulated on an inequivalent class of symplectic torus
fibration. The supermembrane also exhibits invariance under T-duality and we
find the explicit T-duality transformation. It has a natural interpretation in
terms of the cohomology of the base manifold and the homology of the target
torus. We conjecture that this construction also holds for the IIA origin of
gauged supergravities in 9D such that the supermembrane becomes the origin of
all type II supergravities in 9D. The geometric structure of the symplectic
torus bundle goes beyond the classification on conjugated classes of SL(2,Z).
It depends on the elements of the coinvariant group associated to the monodromy
group. The possible values of the (p,q) charges on a given symplectic torus
bundle are restricted to the corresponding equivalence class defining the

numerically solve a detailed model of a complete dynamic force spectroscopy

surface, the formation of bonds, their dissociation under load, and the post

after elimination of obvious multiple rupture events, may still contain a
considerable number of ""hidden"" multiple bonds, which are experimentally
indistinguishable from ""true"" single bonds, but which have considerable effects
on the resulting rupture force statistics and its consistent theoretical

Cu3Bi(SeO3)2O2Br have been studied by bulk magnetization and magnetic
susceptibility measurements as well as powder and single-crystal neutron
diffraction. At T_N = 27.4 K the system develops an alternating
antiferromagnetic order of (ab) layers, which individually exhibit canted
ferrimagnetic moment arrangement, resulting from the competing ferro- and
antiferro-magnetic intralayer exchange interactions. A magnetic field B_C ~ 0.8
T applied along the c axis (perpendicular to the layers) triggers a
metamagnetic transition, when every second layer flips, i.e., resulting in a
ferrimagnetic structure. Significantly higher fields are required to rotate the
ferromagnetic component towards the b axis (~7 T) or towards the a axis (~15
T). The estimates of the exchange coupling constants and features indicative of
an XY character of this quasi-2D system are presented.

functional theory (DFT) based investigation of Co atoms on Ge(111)2x1 surfaces.
When deposited on cold surfaces, individual Co atoms have a limited diffusivity
on the atomically flat areas and apparently reside on top of the upper
pi-bonded chain rows exclusively. Voltage-dependent STM imaging reveals a
highly anisotropic electronic perturbation of the Ge surface surrounding these
Co atoms and pronounced one-dimensional confinement along the pi-bonded chains.
DFT calculations reveal that the individual Co atoms are in fact embedded in
the Ge surface, where they occupy a quasi-stationary position within the big
7-member Ge ring in between the 3rd and 4th atomic Ge layer. The energy needed
for the Co atoms to overcome the potential barrier for penetration in the Ge
surface is provided by the kinetic energy resulting from the deposition
process. DFT calculations further demonstrate that the embedded Co atoms form
four covalent Co-Ge bonds, resulting in a Co4+ valence state and a 3d5
electronic configuration. Calculated STM images are in perfect agreement with
the experimental atomic resolution STM images for the broad range of applied
tunneling voltages.

region connecting two cylindrical pipes when the inlet flow is a solid body
rotation with a uniform axial flow of speeds Omega and U, respectively. A

equation, mainly the Bragg-Hawthorne equation. As in our previous work on the
cylindrical region downstream [R Gonz\'alez et al., Phys. Fluids 20, 24106

al., J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 296, 012024 (2011)], the steady flow in the
transition region shows a Beltrami flow structure. The Beltrami flow is defined
as a field v_B that satisfies omega_B=nabla v_B= gamma v_B, with gamma =
constant. We say that the flow has a Beltrami flow structure when it can be put
in the form v = U e_z + Omega r e_theta + v_B, being U and Omega constants, i.e
it is the superposition of a solid body rotation and translation with a
Beltrami one. Therefore, those findings about flow stability hold. The
quasi-cylindrical solutions do not branch off and the results do not depend on
the chosen transition profile in view of the boundary conditions considered. By

(hereafter C80) located ~80 mas from the core, which was previously shown to
display a brightness temperature ~600 times lager than expected at such

and June 2010 -- has revealed that C80 corresponds to the eastern flux density
peak of an arc of emission (hereafter A80), downstream of which extends a large
(~20 mas in size) bubble-like structure that resembles an inverted bow shock.
The linearly polarized emission closely follows that of the total intensity in
A80, with the electric vector position angle distributed nearly perpendicular
to the arc-shaped structure. Despite the stationary nature of C80/A80,
superluminal components with speeds up to ~3 c have been detected downstream
from its position, resembling the behavior observed in the HST-1 emission
complex in M87. The total and polarized emission of the C80/A80 structure, its
lack of motion, and brightness temperature excess are best reproduced by a
model based on synchrotron emission from a conical shock with cone opening
angle \eta=10 degrees, jet viewing angle \theta=16 degrees, a completely
tangled upstream magnetic field, and upstream Lorentz factor \gamma=8.4. The
good agreement between our observations and numerical modeling leads us to
conclude that the peculiar feature associated with C80/A80 corresponds to a
conical recollimation shock in the jet of 3C120 located at a de-projected
distance of ~190 pc downstream from the nucleus.

These optimal hyperplanes are then aligned by the principal components of their
normal vectors. It is proved that the aligned normal vectors provide an
unbiased, $\sqrt{n}$-consistent, and asymptotically normal estimator of the
sufficient dimension reduction space. The method is then generalized to
nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction using the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space. In that context, the aligned normal vectors become functions and it is

nonlinear sufficient predictors. We compare PSVM with other sufficient
dimension reduction methods by simulation and in real data analysis, and
through both comparisons firmly establish its practical advantages.

In the former two cases, the tunneling is enhanced in a wide range of
modulation frequencies, while in the latter case the resonance is narrow. We
explain this difference with the help of Floquet analysis. If the modulation
amplitude is weak, the locations of the resonances can be found using the
spectrum of the non-modulated Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we use Floquet analysis
to explain the coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT) occurring in a
large-amplitude modulated system. Finally, we present two ways to create a NOON
state (a superposition of $N$ particles in mode 1 with zero particles in mode 2
and vice versa). One is based on a coherent oscillation caused by detuning from
a partial CDT. The other makes use of an adiabatic variation of the modulation
frequency. This results in a Landau-Zener type of transition between the ground
state and a NOON-like state.

galaxy or region is equivalent to assume that at any point within that
environment, there is an accelerator inputing cosmic rays at a reduced rate.
This rate should be compatible with the overall volume-average injection, given
by the total number of accelerators that were active during the starburst age.
These assumptions seem reasonable, especially under the supposition of an
homogeneous and isotropic distribution of accelerators. However, in this
approach the temporal evolution of the superposed spectrum is not explicitly
derived; rather, it is essentially assumed ab-initio. Here, we test the
validity of this approach by following the temporal evolution and spatial
distribution of the superposed cosmic-ray spectrum and compare our results with
those from theoretical models that treat the starburst region as a single
source. In the calorimetric limit (with no cosmic-ray advection), homogeneity
is reached (typically within 20%) across most of the starburst region. However,
values of center-to-edge intensity ratios can amount to a factor of several.
Differences between the common homogeneous assumption for the cosmic-ray
distribution and our models are larger in the case of two-zone geometries, such
as a central nucleus with a surrounding disc. We have also found that the decay
of the cosmic-ray density following the duration of the starburst process is
slow, and even approximately 1 Myr after the burst ends (for a gas density of
35 cm-3) it may still be within an order of magnitude of its peak value. Based
on our simulations, it seems that the detection of a relatively hard spectrum
up to the highest gamma-ray energies from nearby starburst galaxies favors a
relatively small diffusion coefficient (i.e., long diffusion time) in the
region where most of the emission originates.

power-law function fits to these lightcurves. We present a systematical
analysis for statistical properties and their relations to prompt gamma-ray
emission and X-ray afterglow for each component. We show that peak luminosity
in the prompt and late flares are correlated and the evolution of the peak
luminosity may signal the evolution of the accretion rate. No tight correlation
between the shallow decay phase/plateau and prompt gamma-ray emission is found.
Assuming that they are due to a long-lasting wind injected by a compact object,
we show that the injected behavior favors the scenarios of a long-lasting wind
after the main burst episode. The peak luminosity of the afterglow onset is
tightly correlated with Eiso, and it is dimmer as peaking later. Assuming that
the onset bump is due to the fireball deceleration by the external medium, we
examine the Gamma_0-Eiso relation and find that it is confirmed with the
current sample. Optical re-brightening is observed in 30 GRBs in our sample. It
shares the same relation between the width and the peak time as found in the
onset bump, but no clear correlation between the peak luminosity and Eiso as
observed in the onset bumps is found. Although its peak luminosity also decays
with time, the slope is much shallower than that of the onset peak. We get L
t^{-1}_{p}$, being consistent with off-axis observations to an expanding
external fireball in a wind-like circum medium. The late re-brightening may
signal another jet component. Mixing of different emission components may be
the reason for the observed chromatic breaks in different energy bands.

originate from a significant deuteration in the previous cold pre-protostellar

determine the deformation of the regularized phase space along the orbits when
a cutoff is introduced for the scale factor of the universe or for the Hubble

the energy density budget of the Universe should be of an unknown physical

is not merely to reproduce the observations, but also to give a physical
understanding of the Universe we live in. Moreover, even if the assumption of
homogeneity seems to be more or less valid at large scales, it appears to be in
contradiction with observations at intermediate scales (between the scale of
non linear structure formation and that where structures virialize). This is
the reason why, during the last decade, a community of researchers formed whose

inhomogeneities seen in the Universe and to construct accurate cosmological
models which could possibly get rid of the dark components. This task, which is
still in its infancy, is currently progressing towards promising results. Two

GNRs in a few nanometer width already exhibits an approximate low-temperature
dependence of $T^{1.5}$, like that of 2D graphene sheet which is attributed to
the quadratic nature of dispersion relation for the out-of-plane acoustic
phonon modes. Using a zone-folding method, we heuristically derive the

Combining our calculations with the experimental phonon mean-free path, some
typical values of thermal conductivity at room temperature are estimated for

there is no tunneling between them. Using a mapping of this system onto a Kondo
model, we show analytically that the system undergoes a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition as function of the
Luttinger liquid parameter in the leads and the dot-lead interaction. The phase
with low values of the Luttinger-liquid parameter is characterized by an abrupt
switch of the population between the impurities as function of a common applied
gate voltage. However, this behavior is hard to verify numerically since one
would have to study extremely long systems. Interestingly though, at the
transition the entanglement entropy drops from a finite value of $\ln(2)$ to
zero. The drop becomes sharp for infinite systems. One can employ finite size
scaling to extrapolate the transition point and the behavior in its vicinity
from the behavior of the entanglement entropy in moderate size samples. We
employ the density matrix renormalization group numerical procedure to

Observing the level of deuterium fractionation of OH, a radical involved in the

at understanding the formation mechanisms of water by investigating the origin
of its deuterium fractionation. This can be achieved by observing the abundance
of OD towards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422, where the HDO distribution

in absorption towards the source continuum. This is the first detection of OD
outside the solar system. The SOFIA observation, coupled to the observation of
the HDO 111-000 line, provides an estimate of the abundance ratio OD/HDO ~
17-90 in the gas where the absorption takes place. This value is fairly high
compared with model predictions. This may be reconciled if reprocessing in the
gas by means of the dissociative recombination of H2DO+ further fractionates OH
with respect to water. The present observation demonstrates the capability of
the SOFIA/GREAT instrument to detect the ground transition of OD towards
star-forming regions in a frequency range that was not accessible before.
Dissociative recombination of H2DO+ may play an important role in setting a
high OD abundance. Measuring the branching ratios of this reaction in the

as well as super-Earths at visible wavelengths. So far, studies for
high-contrast imaging instruments have mainly focused on technical feasibility
because of the challenging planet/star flux ratio of 10-8-10-10 required at
short separations (200 mas or so) to image cold exoplanets. However, the
analysis of planet atmospheric/surface properties has remained largely
unexplored. Aims. The aim of this paper is to determine which planetary
properties SPICES or an equivalent direct imaging mission can measure,
considering realistic reflected planet spectra and instrument limitation.
Methods. We use numerical simulations of the SPICES instrument concept and
theoretical planet spectra to carry out this performance study. Results. We
find that the characterization of the main planetary properties (identification
of molecules, effect of metallicity, presence of clouds and type of surfaces)
would require a median signal-to-noise ratio of at least 30. In the case of a
solar-type star \leq 10 pc, SPICES will be able to study Jupiters and Neptunes
up to ~5 and ~2 AU respectively. It would also analyze cloud and surface
coverage of super-Earths of radius 2.5 RE at 1 AU. Finally, we determine the
potential targets in terms of planet separation, radius and distance for
several stellar types. For a Sun analog, we show that SPICES could characterize
Jupiters (M \geq 30 ME) as small as 0.5 Jupiter radii at ~2 AU up to 10 pc, and
super-Earths at 1-2 AU for the handful of stars that exist within 4-5 pc.
Potentially, SPICES could perform analysis of a hypothetical Earth-size planet
around alpha Cen A and B.

(CSMA)-based scheduling algorithms have attracted extensive interest due to
their throughput-optimal characteristics in general network topologies.
However, these algorithms are not well-suited for serving real-time traffic
under time-varying channel conditions for two reasons: (1) the mixing time of
the underlying CSMA Markov Chain grows with the size of the network, which, for
large networks, generates unacceptable delay for deadline-constrained traffic;
(2) since the dynamic CSMA parameters are influenced by the arrival and channel
state processes, the underlying CSMA Markov Chain may not converge to a
steady-state under strict deadline constraints and fading channel conditions.
  In this paper, we attack the problem of distributed scheduling for serving
real-time traffic over time-varying channels. Specifically, we consider
fully-connected topologies with independently fading channels (which can model
cellular networks) in which flows with short-term deadline constraints and
long-term drop rate requirements are served. To that end, we first characterize
the maximal set of satisfiable arrival processes for this system and, then,
propose a Fast-CSMA (FCSMA) policy that is shown to be optimal in supporting
any real-time traffic that is within the maximal satisfiable set. These
theoretical results are further validated through simulations to demonstrate
the relative efficiency of the FCSMA policy compared to some of the existing
CSMA-based algorithms.

stack of heaters and thermometer in the center of a silicon nitride membrane,
in total giving a background heat capacity less than 100 nJ/K at 300 K,
decreasing to 10 pJ/K at 1K. The device has several distinctive features: i)
The resistive thermometer, made of a Ge_{1-x}Au_{x} alloy, displays a high
dimensionless sensitivity |dlnR/dlnT | \geq 1 over the entire temperature
range. ii) The sample is placed in direct contact with the thermometer, which
is allowed to self-heat. The thermometer can thus be operated at high dc
current to increase the resolution. iii) Data are acquired with a set of eight
synchronized lock-in amplifiers measuring dc, 1st and 2nd harmonic signals of
heaters and thermometer. This gives high resolution and allows continuous
output adjustments without additional noise. iv) Absolute accuracy is achieved
via a variable-frequency-fixed-phase technique in which the measurement
frequency is automatically adjusted during the measurements to account for the
temperature variation of the sample heat capacity and the device thermal
conductance. The performance of the calorimeter is illustrated by studying the
heat capacity of a small Au sample and the specific heat of a 2.6 {\mu}g piece

performance evaluation. The impact of shadowing caused by other vehicles has,
however, largely been neglected in most of the models, as well as in the system
simulations. In this paper we present a shadow fading model targeting system
simulations based on real measurements performed in urban and highway
scenarios. The measurement data is separated into three categories,
line-of-sight (LOS), obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) by vehicles, and non
line-of-sight due to buildings, with the help of video information recorded
during the measurements. It is observed that vehicles obstructing the LOS
induce an additional average attenuation of about 10 dB in the received signal
power. An approach to incorporate the LOS/OLOS model into existing VANET
simulators is also provided. Finally, system level VANET simulation results are
presented, showing the difference between the LOS/OLOS model and a channel
model based on Nakagami-m fading.

presented. If the original quadrilateral is itself a parallelogram, then the
procedure gives squares. Hence, when applied two times, this procedure
generates squares from any quadrilateral. The proof needs only undergraduate

micro/nano-fluidic channels provided the width of the histogram is narrow.
Photonic shot noise and residence time fluctuations, caused by longitudinal
diffusion, are the major sources of the histogram width. This Communication is
a sequel to an earlier Letter of ours [L. L. Kish et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 99,
143121 (2011)] and demonstrates that, for a given diffusion coefficient, an
increase of the drift velocity enhances the relative shot noise and decreases
the relative residence time fluctuations. This leads to an optimum drift
velocity which minimizes the histogram width and maximizes the ability to
identify single molecules, which is an important result for applications.

diamond shaped billiard. We defined this billiard as a half stadium connected
with a triangular billiard. A parameter $\xi$ which gradually change the shape
of the billiard from a regular equilateral triangle ($\xi=1$) to a diamond
($\xi=0$) was used to control the transition between the regular and chaotic
regimes. The classical behaviour is regular when the control parameter $\xi$ is
one; in contrast, the system is chaotic when $\xi \neq 1$ even for values of
$\xi$ close to one. The entropy grows fast as $\xi$ is decreased from 1 and the
Lyapunov exponent remains positive for $\xi<1$. The Finite Difference Method
was implemented in order to solve the quantum problem. The energy spectrum and
eigenstates were numerically computed for different values of the control
parameter. The nearest-neighbour spacing distribution is analysed as a function
of $\xi$, finding a Poisson and a Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble(GOE)
distribution for regular and chaotic regimes respectively. Several scars and
bouncing ball states are shown with their corresponding classical periodic
orbits. Along the document the classical chaos identifiers are computed to show
that system is chaotic. On the other hand, the quantum counterpart is in
agreement with the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture and exhibits the standard
features for chaotic billiard such as the scarring of the wavefunction.
