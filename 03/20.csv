11.86 yr). The side frequencies are related to the spring tidal period of
Jupiter and Saturn (9.93 yr) and to the tidal sidereal period of Jupiter (11.86
yr). A simplified harmonic constituent model based on the above two planetary
tidal frequencies and on the exact dates of Jupiter and Saturn planetary tidal
phases, plus a theoretically deduced 10.87-year central cycle reveals complex
quasi-periodic interference/beat patterns at about 115, 61 and 130 years, plus
a quasi-millennial large beat cycle around 983 years. We show that equivalent
synchronized cycles are found in cosmogenic records used to reconstruct solar
activity and in proxy climate records throughout the Holocene. The
quasi-secular beat oscillations hindcast reasonably well the known prolonged
periods of low solar activity during the last millennium known as Oort, Wolf,
Sporer, Maunder and Dalton minima, as well as 17 115-year long oscillations
found in temperature reconstructions during the last 2000 years. The millennial
three-frequency beat cycle hindcasts equivalent solar and climate cycles for
12,000 years. Prolonged solar minima in 1900-1920 and 1960-1980, the secular
solar maxima around 1870-1890, 1940-1950 and 1995-2005, and a secular upward
trending during the 20th century is recovered: this modulated trending agrees
well with some solar proxy model, with the ACRIM TSI satellite composite and
with the global surface temperature modulation since 1850. The model forecasts
a new prolonged solar grand minimum during 2020-2045, which would be produced
by the minima of both the 61 and 115-year reconstructed cycles. Solar and
climate oscillations are linked to planetary motion and, furthermore, their
timing can be reasonably hindcast and forecast for decades, centuries and
millennia. The critique by Smythe and Eddy (1977) is rebutted.

associated with strong zonal winds alternating in direction with latitude. We
use three-dimensional numerical simulations of compressible convection in the
anelastic approximation to explore the properties of zonal winds in rapidly
rotating spherical shells. Since the model is restricted to the electrically
insulating outer envelope, we therefore neglect magnetic effects.
  A systematic parametric study for various density scaleheights and Rayleigh
numbers allows to explore the dependence of convection and zonal jets on these
parameters and to derive scaling laws.
  While the density stratification affects the local flow amplitude and the
convective scales, global quantities and zonal jets properties remain fairly
independent of the density stratification. The zonal jets are maintained by
Reynolds stresses, which rely on the correlation between zonal and
cylindrically radial flow components. The gradual loss of this correlation with
increasing supercriticality hampers all our simulations and explains why the
additional compressional source of vorticity hardly affects zonal flows.
  All these common features may explain why previous Boussinesq models were
already successful in reproducing the morphology of zonal jets in gas giants.

central limit theorem (called the ""Fourth Moment Theorem"" in the sequel) for

convergence in distribution to the standard normal law is equivalent to
convergence of just the fourth moment. Shortly afterwards, Peccati and Tudor
gave a multidimensional version of this characterization. Since the publication
of these two beautiful papers, many improvements and developments on this theme
have been considered. Among them is the work by Nualart and Ortiz-Latorre,
giving a new proof only based on Malliavin calculus and the use of integration
by parts on Wiener space. A second step is my joint paper ""Stein's method on
Wiener chaos"" (written in collaboration with Peccati) in which, by bringing
together Stein's method with Malliavin calculus, we have been able (among other
things) to associate quantitative bounds to the Fourth Moment Theorem. It turns
out that Stein's method and Malliavin calculus fit together admirably well.
Their interaction has led to some remarkable new results involving central and
non-central limit theorems for functionals of infinite-dimensional Gaussian
fields. The current survey aims to introduce the main features of this recent
theory. It originates from a series of lectures I delivered at the Coll\`ege de

perform on their share of the system. The outcomes of the measurements should
follow a distribution predicted by quantum mechanics; however, in practice, the
detectors may fail to produce an output in some of the runs. The efficiency of
the experiment is the probability that the experiment succeeds (neither of the
detectors fails).
  When the players share a quantum state, this gives rise to a new bound on
quantum communication complexity (eff*) that subsumes the factorization norm.
When players share randomness instead of a quantum state, the efficiency bound
(eff), coincides with the partition bound of Jain and Klauck. This is one of
the strongest lower bounds known for randomized communication complexity, which
subsumes all the known combinatorial and algebraic methods including the
rectangle (corruption) bound, the factorization norm, and discrepancy.
  The lower bound is formulated as a convex optimization problem. In practice,
the dual form is more feasible to use, and we show that it amounts to
constructing an explicit Bell inequality (for eff) or Tsirelson inequality (for
eff*). We give an example of a quantum distribution where the violation can be
exponentially bigger than the previously studied class of normalized Bell
inequalities.
  For one-way communication, we show that the quantum one-way partition bound

unknown. Maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) and minimum mean square error
(MMSE) approaches leverage channel knowledge to make explicit use of soft
information (priors over the transmitted data bits) in a manner that is
distinctly nonlinear, appearing either in a trellis formulation (MAP) or inside
an inverted matrix (MMSE). To date, nearly all adaptive turbo equalization
methods either estimate the channel or use a direct adaptation equalizer in
which estimates of the transmitted data are formed from an expressly linear
function of the received data and soft information, with this latter
formulation being most common. We study a class of direct adaptation turbo
equalizers that are both adaptive and nonlinear functions of the soft
information from the decoder. We introduce piecewise linear models based on
context trees that can adaptively approximate the nonlinear dependence of the
equalizer on the soft information such that it can choose both the partition
regions as well as the locally linear equalizer coefficients in each region
independently, with computational complexity that remains of the order of a
traditional direct adaptive linear equalizer. This approach is guaranteed to
asymptotically achieve the performance of the best piecewise linear equalizer
and we quantify the MSE performance of the resulting algorithm and the
convergence of its MSE to that of the linear minimum MSE estimator as the depth
of the context tree and the data length increase.

massive cluster discovered by our systematic search programme.
  Methods: Using near-infrared (J, H, and Ks) photometry we selected 23 OB-type

spectral classification.
  Results: Of the 28 spectroscopically observed stars, 17 were classified as
OB-type, four as supergiants, one as an A-type dwarf star, and six as late-type
giant stars. The presence of a supergiant population implies a massive nature
of Masgomas-1, supported by our estimate of the cluster initial total mass of
(1.94\pm0.28)\cdot10^4 M_{sun}, obtained after integrating of the cluster mass
function. The distance estimate of 3.53 kpc locates the cluster closer than the
Scutum--Centaurus base but still within that Galactic arm. The presence of an
O9V star and red supergiants in the same population indicates that the cluster
age is in the range of 8 to 10 Myr.

a structure formation model. This is achieved by splitting the inversion
problem into two Gibbs-sampling steps: the first being a Gaussianisation step
transforming a distribution of point sources at Lagrangian positions -which are
not a priori given- into a linear alias-free Gaussian field. This step is based
on Hamiltonian sampling with a Gaussian-Poisson model. The second step consists
on a likelihood comparison in which the set of matter tracers at the initial
conditions is constrained on the galaxy distribution and the assumed structure
formation model. For computational reasons second order Lagrangian Perturbation
Theory is used. However, the presented approach is flexible to adopt any
structure formation model. A semi-analytic halo-model based galaxy mock catalog
is taken to demonstrate that the recovered initial conditions are closely
unbiased with respect to the actual ones from the corresponding N-body
simulation down to scales of a ~ 5 Mpc/h. The cross-correlation between them
shows a substantial gain of information, being at k ~ 0.3 h/Mpc more than
doubled. In addition the initial conditions are extremely well Gaussian
distributed and the power-spectra follow the shape of the linear power-spectrum

a comparative study between local Lyapunov exponent, manifold's curvature and

the FTLE average mostly come from points of the orbit where the structure of
the manifolds is locally hyperbolic: where the manifolds are flat and
transversal, the one-step exponent is predominantly positive and large; this

beyond the already troubling 120 orders of magnitude that separate dark energy

fine-tuning problem, but instead an artifact of anthropic selection. Rather
than assuming measurements are equally likely in all epochs, one should insist
that measurements of a quantity be typical amongst all such measurements. As a
consequence, particular observations will reflect the epoch in which they are
most easily made. In the specific case of cosmology, most measurements of dark
energy and dark matter will done during an epoch when large numbers of linear
modes are available to observers, so we should not be surprised at living at
such a time. This is made precise in a particular model for the probability
distribution for r=min(Omega_m/Omega_L,Omega_L/Omega_m), where it is shown that
if p(r) \sim [N(r)]^b (where N(r) is the number of linear modes, and bis some
arbitrary positive power), the probability that r is greater than its observed
value of 0.4, is close to 1. Thus the cosmological coincidence is no longer

fundamental T$_{1u}$ modes of \C60a\ are split into doublets already at the
lowest applied pressure and harden with increasing pressure. Several cation
modes and fullerene-related modes split into doublets at around 2 GPa, the most
prominent one being the G$_{1u}$ mode. The splitting of the vibrational modes
can be attributed to the transition from the dynamic to static Jahn-Teller
effect, caused by steric crowding at high pressure. Four absorption bands are
observed in the NIR-VIS frequency range. They are discussed in terms of
transitions between LUMO electronic states in \C60a, which are split because of
the Jahn-Teller distortion and can be coupled with vibrational modes. Various
distortions and the corresponding symmetry lowering are discussed. The observed
redshift of the absorption bands indicates that the splitting of the LUMO

\log n)$ and with post-processing in $O(n^2)$ (worst case) time where $n$ is
the size of the data set. We also show that our generalized graph model which
also allows the use of potentials at vertices can be used to extract a more
detailed pack of information as the {\it outlier profile} of the data set. In
this direction we show that our approach can be used to define the concept of
an outlier-set in a precise way and we propose approximation algorithms for
finding such sets. We also provide a comparative performance analysis of our
algorithm with other related ones and we show that the new clustering algorithm
(without the outlier extraction procedure) behaves quite effectively even on
hard benchmarks and handmade examples.

decoder and maintains a computational complexity that is only linear in the
channel memory. By partitioning the space of likelihood information from the
decoder, based on either hard or soft clustering, and using locally-linear
adaptive equalizers within each clustered region, the performance gap between
the linear MMSE equalizer and low-complexity, LMS-based linear turbo equalizers
can be dramatically narrowed.

statistical models on the underlying signals and systems. Hence, such an

mixing and CP violation, confirmed by the data so far, while allowing for
observable deviations from it, as expected in most models of ElectroWeak
Symmetry Breaking. Building on previous work in the specific context of
supersymmetry, we analyze the expected effects and we quantify the current
bounds in a general Effective Field Theory framework. As a further relevant
example we then show how the U(2)^3 symmetry and its breaking can be
implemented in a generic composite Higgs model and we make a first analysis of
its peculiar consequences. We also discuss how some partial extension of U(2)^3
to the lepton sector can arise, both in general and in composite Higgs models.
An optimistic though conceivable interpretation of the considerations developed
in this paper gives reasons to think that new physics searches in the flavour

compute some relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the thermal energy and
entropy, and we study the stability and phase structure of the ensemble. In
particular, for negative values of the hair parameter, the phase structure is
isomorphic to the one of Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in the canonical
ensemble. Moreover, the phase-diagram in the plan ($Q,T$) has a line of
first-order phase transition that at a critical value of $Q$ terminates in a

of a uniformly chosen triangle. This stochastic process terminates once it
arrives at a triangle-free graph, and the fundamental question is to estimate
the final number of edges (equivalently, the time it takes the process to
finish, or how many edge-disjoint triangles are packed via the random greedy
algorithm). Bollob\'as and Erd\H{o}s (1990) conjectured that the expected final
number of edges has order $n^{3/2}$, motivated by the study of the Ramsey
number $R(3,t)$. An upper bound of $o(n^2)$ was shown by Spencer (1995) and
independently by R\""odl and Thoma (1996). Several bounds were given for
variants and generalizations (e.g., Alon, Kim and Spencer (1997) and Wormald
(1999)), while the best known upper bound for the original question of
Bollob\'as and Erd\H{o}s was $n^{7/4+o(1)}$ due to Grable (1997). No nontrivial
lower bound was available.
  Here we prove that with high probability the final number of edges in random
triangle removal is equal to $n^{3/2+o(1)}$, thus confirming the 3/2 exponent
conjectured by Bollob\'as and Erd\H{o}s and matching the predictions of Spencer
et al. For the upper bound, for any fixed $\epsilon>0$ we construct a family of
$\exp(O(1/\epsilon))$ graphs by gluing $O(1/\epsilon)$ triangles sequentially
in a prescribed manner, and dynamically track all homomorphisms from them,
rooted at any two vertices, up to the point where $n^{3/2+\epsilon}$ edges
remain. A system of martingales establishes concentration for these random
variables around their analogous means in a random graph with corresponding
edge density, and a key role is played by the self-correcting nature of the
process. The lower bound builds on the estimates at that very point to show
that the process will typically terminate with at least $n^{3/2-o(1)}$ edges
left.

Near-Horizon-Extremal-Kerr (NHEK) spacetime can be obtained from an AdS_3 X S^3

present three ways of viewing these pseudo-dualities: as a series of

T-dualities and, finally, as a sequence of two generalized spectral flows and a
coordinate transformation. We then use these to find an infinite family of
asymptotically flat embeddings of NHEK spacetimes in string theory,
parameterized by the arbitrary values of the moduli at infinity. Our
construction reveals the existence of non-perturbative deformations of
asymptotically-NHEK spacetimes, which correspond to the bubbling of nontrivial
cycles wrapped by flux, and paves the way for finding a microscopic field
theory dual to NHEK which involves Melvin twists of the D1-D5 gauge theory. Our

following self-similar relations, galaxy groups are ideal systems to study
baryon physics, which is important for both cluster cosmology and galaxy
formation. We review the recent observational results on the hot gas in galaxy
groups. The first part of the paper is on the scaling relations, including
X-ray luminosity, entropy, gas fraction, baryon fraction and metal abundance.
Compared to clusters, groups have a lower fraction of hot gas around the center
(e.g., r < r_2500), but may have a comparable gas fraction at large radii
(e.g., r_2500 < r < r_500). Better constraints on the group gas and baryon
fractions require sample studies with different selection functions and deep
observations at r > r_500 regions. The hot gas in groups is also iron poor at
large radii (0.3 r_500 - 0.7 r_500). The iron content of the hot gas within the
central regions (r < 0.3 r_500) correlates with the group mass, in contrast to
the trend of the stellar mass fraction. It remains to be seen where the missing
iron in low-mass groups is. In the second part, we discuss several aspects of
X-ray cool cores in galaxy groups, including their difference from cluster cool
cores, radio AGN heating in groups and the cold gas in group cool cores.
Because of the vulnerability of the group cool cores to radio AGN heating and
the weak heat conduction in groups, group cool cores are important systems to
test the AGN feedback models and the multiphase cool core models. At the end of
the paper, some outstanding questions are listed.

apply stacking techniques to perform the first sensitive search for CO emission
in dwarfs outside the Local Group ranging from single lines-of-sight, stacked
over IR-bright regions of embedded star formation, and stacked over the entire

and have L_CO < 0.4-8 1e6 Kkmspc2. We combine our sample of dwarfs with a large
literature sample of spirals to study scaling relations of L_CO with M_B and
metallicity. We find that dwarfs with metallicities of Z ~ 1/2-1/10 Z_sun have
L_CO about 1e2-1e4x smaller than spirals and that their L_CO per unit L_B is
10-100x smaller. A comparison with tracers of star formation (FUV and 24
micron) shows that L_CO per unit SFR is 10-100x smaller in dwarfs. One possible
interpretation is that dwarfs form stars much more efficiently, however we
argue that the low L_CO/SFR ratio is due to significant changes of the CO-to-H2
conversion factor, alpha_CO, in low metallicity environments. Assuming a
constant H2 depletion time of 1.8 Gyr (as found for nearby spirals) implies
alpha_CO values for dwarfs with Z ~ 1/2-1/10 Z_sun that are more than 10x
higher than those found in solar metallicity spirals. This significant increase
of alpha_CO at low metallicity is consistent with previous studies, in
particular those which model dust emission to constrain H2 masses. Even though
it is difficult to parameterize the metallicity dependence of alpha_CO, our
results suggest that CO is increasingly difficult to detect at lower
metallicities.

than 0.8 Msun and a metallicity of Z = 4.5 10^{-5} Zsun. We investigate the
origin and properties of this star by reconstructing the physical conditions in
its birth cloud. We show that the observed elemental abundance trend of SDSS
J102915+172927 can be well fitted by the yields of core-collapse supernovae
with metal-free progenitors of 20 Msun and 35 Msun. Using these selected
supernova explosion models, we compute the corresponding dust yields and the
resulting dust depletion factor taking into account the partial destruction by
the supernova reverse shock. We then follow the collapse and fragmentation of a
star forming cloud enriched by the products of these SN explosions at the
observed metallicity of SDSS J102915+172927. We find that [0.05 - 0.1] Msun
mass fragments, which then lead to the formation of low-mass stars, can occur
provided that the mass fraction of dust grains in the birth cloud exceeds 0.01
of the total mass of metals and dust. This, in turn, requires that at least 0.4
Msun of dust condense in the first supernovae, allowing for moderate
destruction by the reverse shock. If dust formation in the first supernovae is
less efficient or strong dust destruction does occur, the thermal evolution of
the SDSS J102915+172927 birth cloud is dominated by molecular cooling, and only
> 8 Msun fragments can form. We conclude that the observed properties of SDSS
J102915+172927 support the suggestion that dust must have condensed in the
ejecta of the first supernovae and played a fundamental role in the formation
of the first low-mass stars.

maximally supersymmetric gauge theories that arise on the worldvolumes branes
in String Theory and M-Theory. Particular focus is made on the relatively
recent construction of M2-brane worldvolume theories. In a formal sense, the
existence of these quantum field theories can be viewed as predictions of
M-Theory. Their construction is therefore a reinforcement of the ideas
underlying String Theory and M-Theory. We also briefly discuss the
six-dimensional conformal field theory that is expected to arise on M5-branes.
The construction of this theory is not only an important open problem for
M-Theory but also a significant challenge to our current understanding of
quantum field theory more generally.

that they have much higher star formation rates than one would expect based on
their observed CO luminosities and the molecular gas masses that are inferred
from them. This finding can be understood if one assumes that the conversion
factor between CO luminosity and H2 mass is much larger in these low
metallicity systems than in nearby molecular clouds. However, it is unclear
whether this is the only factor at work, or whether the star formation rate of
the clouds is directly sensitive to the metallicity of the gas.
  To investigate this, we have performed numerical simulations of the coupled
dynamical, chemical and thermal evolution of model clouds with metallicities
ranging from 0.01 Z_solar to Z_solar. We find that the star formation rate in
our model clouds has little sensitivity to the metallicity. Reducing the
metallicity of the gas by two orders of magnitude delays the onset of star
formation in the clouds by no more than a cloud free-fall time and reduces the
time-averaged star formation rate by at most a factor of two. On the other
hand, the chemical state of the clouds is highly sensitive to the metallicity,
and at the lowest metallicities, the clouds are completely dominated by atomic
gas. Our results confirm that the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in these systems
depends strongly on the metallicity, but also show that the precise value is
highly time-dependent, as the integrated CO luminosity of the most metal-poor
clouds is dominated by emission from short-lived gravitationally collapsing
regions. Finally, we find evidence that the star formation rate per unit H2
mass increases with decreasing metallicity, owing to the much smaller H2
fractions present in our low metallicity clouds.

of time scale separation between relatively small set of slowly evolving

computational expense. As a result, it became a popular approach in
applications to develop a closed approximate model for slow variables alone,
which both effectively reduces the dimension of the phase space of dynamics, as
well as allows for a longer time discretization step. In this work we develop a
new method for approximate reduced model, based on the linear
fluctuation-dissipation theorem applied to statistical states of the fast
variables. The method is suitable for situations with quadratically nonlinear
and multiplicative coupling. We show that, with complex quadratically nonlinear
and multiplicative coupling in both slow and fast variables, this method
produces comparable statistics to what is exhibited by an original multiscale
model. In contrast, it is observed that the results from the simplified closed

method is the first to be applied directly to the gravitational-wave (GW)

contaminated by gauge effects, which, in moving-puncture simulations, limit
orbital-motion-based measurements of the eccentricity to an uncertainty of
$\Delta e \sim 0.002$, making it difficult to reduce the eccentricity below
this value. Our new method can reach eccentricities below $10^{-3}$ in one or
two iteration steps; we find that this is well below the requirements for GW
astronomy in the advanced detector era. Our method can be readily adapted to
any compact-binary simulation with GW emission, including black-hole-binary
simulations that use alternative approaches, and neutron-star-binary

hole X-ray binaries is critically investigated in this paper. New observations
of known sources, along with newly discovered ones, have resulted in an
increasingly large number of outliers lying well outside the scatter about the
quoted best-fit relation. Here, we employ and compare state of the art data
clustering techniques in order to identify and characterize different data
groupings within the radio:X-ray luminosity plane for 18 hard and quiescent
state black hole X-ray binaries with nearly simultaneous multi-wavelength
coverage. Linear regression is then carried out on the clustered data to infer
the parameters of a relationship of the form {ell}_{r}=alpha+beta {ell}_x
through a Bayesian approach (where {ell} denotes log lum). We conclude that the
two cluster model, with independent linear fits, is a significant improvement
over fitting all points as a single cluster. While the upper track slope
(0.63\pm0.03) is consistent, within the errors, with the fitted slope for the
2003 relation (0.7\pm0.1), the lower track slope (0.98\pm0.08) is not
consistent with the upper track, nor it is with the widely adopted value of
~1.4 for the neutron stars. The two luminosity tracks do not reflect systematic
differences in black hole spins as estimated either from reflection, or
continuum fitting method. These results are insensitive to the selection of
sub-samples, accuracy in the distances, and to the treatment of upper limits.
Besides introducing a further level of complexity in understanding the
interplay between synchrotron and Comptonised emission from black hole X-ray
binaries, the existence of two tracks in the radio:X-ray domain underscores
that a high level of caution must be exercised when employing black hole
luminosity relations for the purpose of estimating a third parameter, such as
distance or mass.

defy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model, leading to
a variety of new models. Polarimetry can be a major independent diagnostic of
afterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and internal structure
of the GRB jets. In this paper we present the first high quality multi-night
polarimetric light curve of a Swift GRB afterglow, aimed at providing a well
calibrated dataset of a typical afterglow to serve as a benchmark system for
modelling afterglow polarisation behaviour. In particular, our dataset of the
afterglow of GRB 091018 (at redshift z=0.971) comprises optical linear
polarimetry (R band, 0.13 - 2.3 days after burst); circular polarimetry (R
band) and near-infrared linear polarimetry (Ks band). We add to that high
quality optical and near-infrared broadband light curves and spectral energy
distributions as well as afterglow spectroscopy. The linear polarisation varies
between 0 and 3%, with both long and short time scale variability visible. We
find an achromatic break in the afterglow light curve, which corresponds to
features in the polarimetric curve. We find that the data can be reproduced by
jet break models only if an additional polarised component of unknown nature is
present in the polarimetric curve. We probe the ordered magnetic field
component in the afterglow through our deep circular polarimetry, finding
P_circ < 0.15% (2 sigma), the deepest limit yet for a GRB afterglow, suggesting
ordered fields are weak, if at all present. Our simultaneous R and Ks band
polarimetry shows that dust induced polarisation in the host galaxy is likely
negligible.

different accretion spectral models. While either an irradiated disk model or
an O-supergiant plus accretion disk model fit the data very well, we prefer the

early-type galaxies and bulges of high surface-brightness galaxies. The age,
metallicity, and alpha/Fe enhancement of the stellar populations in the

variable element abundance ratios. Almost all the sample bulges are
characterized by a young stellar population, on-going star formation, and a
solar alpha/Fe enhancement. Their metallicity spans from high to sub-solar
values. No significant gradient in age and alpha/Fe enhancement is measured,
whereas only in a few cases a negative metallicity gradient is found. These
properties suggest that a pure dissipative collapse is not able to explain
formation of all the sample bulges and that other phenomena, like mergers or
acquisition events, need to be invoked. Such a picture is also supported by the
lack of a correlation between the central value and gradient of the metallicity
in bulges with very low metallicity. The stellar populations of the bulges
hosted by low surface-brightness discs share many properties with those of high
surface-brightness galaxies. Therefore, they are likely to have common
formation scenarios and evolution histories. A strong interplay between bulges
and discs is ruled out by the fact that in spite of being hosted by discs with
extremely different properties, the bulges of low and high surface-brightness
discs are remarkably similar.

the nuclear symmetry energy. The density dependence of the symmetry energy is
important in nuclear astrophysics, as it controls the neutronization of matter
in core-collapse supernovae, the radii of neutron stars and the thicknesses of
their crusts, the rate of cooling of neutron stars, and the properties of
nuclei involved in r-process nucleosynthesis. We show that fits of nuclear
masses to experimental masses, combined with other experimental information
from neutron skins, heavy ion collisions, giant dipole resonances and dipole
polarizabilities, lead to stringent constraints on parameters that describe the
symmetry energy near the nuclear saturation density. These constraints are
remarkably consistent with inferences from theoretical calculations of pure
neutron matter, and, furthermore, with astrophysical observations of neutron
stars. The concordance of experimental, theoretical and observational analyses
suggests that the symmetry parameters S_v and L are in the range 29.0 - 32.7
MeV and 40.5 - 61.9 MeV, respectively, and that the neutron star radius, for a
1.4 M_sun star, is in the narrow window 10.7 km < R < 13.1 km (90% confidence).
We can also set tight limits to the size of neutron star crusts and the
fractional moment of inertia they contain, as well as the overall moment of
inertia and quadrupole polarizability of 1.4 M_sun stars. Our results also have
implications for the disk mass and ejected mass of compact mergers involving

Inference in these languages is based on enumerative construction of proofs
over logic programs. Consequently, these languages permit very limited use of
random variables with continuous distributions. In this paper, we extend PRISM
with Gaussian random variables and linear equality constraints, and consider
the problem of parameter learning in the extended language. Many statistical
models such as finite mixture models and Kalman filter can be encoded in
extended PRISM. Our EM-based learning algorithm uses a symbolic inference
procedure that represents sets of derivations without enumeration. This permits
us to learn the distribution parameters of extended PRISM programs with
discrete as well as Gaussian variables. The learning algorithm naturally
generalizes the ones used for PRISM and Hybrid Bayesian Networks.

$\Delta\dot{\nu}_{p}$ span two orders of magnitude. The pulsar suffered the

$\sim$ 6.8 $\times 10^{-6}$ Hz, $\sim$ 3.5 times that of the glitch occured in
1989 glitch, with a very large permanent changes in frequency and pulse
frequency derivative and followed by a decay with time constant $\sim$ 21 days.

a varying particle wind strength which may be caused by glitch activities. We

de-Sitter space by expanding the perturbation around Minkowski and introducing
the effects of the Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$), first as an additional
source (de-Donder gauge) and after as a gauge effect ($\Lambda$-gauge). In both
cases the inclusion of the Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$ impedes the
detection of a gravitational wave at a distance larger than
$L_{crit}=(6\sqrt{2}\pi f \hat{h}/\sqrt{5})r_\Lambda^2$, where
$r_\Lambda=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Lambda}}$ and f and $\hat{h}$ are the frequency and
strain of the wave respectively. We demonstrate that $L_{crit}$ is just a
confirmation of the Cosmic No hair Conjecture (CNC) already explained in the
literature.

intuition to the properties of the supported plasmon mode. For parallel
graphene pairs separated by small gaps, the dispersion relation of the surface
plasmon splits into two branches, one with a symmetric and the other with an
antisymmetric magnetic field across the gap. For the symmetric (magnetic field)
branch, the confinement may be improved at reduced absorption loss over a wide
spectrum, unlike conventional SP modes supported on metallic surfaces that are
subjected to the trade-off between loss and confinement. This symmetric mode
becomes strongly suppressed for very small separations however. On the other
hand, its antisymmetric counterpart exhibits reduced absorption loss for very
small separations or long wavelengths, serving as a complement to the symmetric
branch. Our results suggest that graphene plasmon structures could be promising
for waveguiding and sensing applications in the mid-infrared and terahertz

bounds also allow us to characterize the optimal distortion in several
interesting regimes. Moreover, we show that causal and noncausal estimation are
not equivalent for this problem. Finally, we consider the case where the
desired signal is also available at the helper. We develop new lower bounds for

roughness parameters which are not consistent with measurements of similar

used to capture the chirality inherent in materials. However when reduced to a
two dimensional (2D) isotropic problem, the resulting model becomes non-chiral.
Therefore, influence of the chiral effect cannot be properly characterized by
existing theories for 2D chiral solids. To circumvent this difficulty, based on
reinterpretation of isotropic tensors in a 2D case, we propose a continuum
theory to model the chiral effect for 2D isotropic chiral solids. A single
material parameter related to chirality is introduced to characterize the
coupling between the bulk deformation and the internal rotation which is a
fundamental feature of 2D chiral solids. Coherently, the proposed continuum
theory is also derived for a triangular chiral lattice from a homogenization
procedure, from which the effective material constants of the lattice are
analytically determined. The unique behavior in the chiral lattice is
demonstrated through the analyses of a static tension problem and a plane wave
propagation problem. The results, which cannot be predicted by the non-chiral
model, are validated by the exact solution of the discrete model.

tuning parameter in bridge regression models. The choice of the adjusted
parameters can be viewed as a model selection and evaluation problem. We
propose a model selection criterion for evaluating bridge regression models in
terms of Bayesian approach. This selection criterion enables us to select the
adjusted parameters objectively. We investigate the effectiveness of our

and taxonomic classes, size, and density. Mass and volume estimates for 287
small bodies are collected from the literature. The accuracy and biases
affecting the methods used to estimate these quantities are discussed and
best-estimates are strictly selected. Bulk densities are subsequently computed
and compared with meteorite density, allowing to estimate the macroporosity
within these bodies. Dwarf-planets apparently have no macroporosity, while
smaller bodies can have large voids. This trend is apparently correlated with
size: C and S-complex asteroids tends to have larger density with increasing
diameter. The average density of each Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classes is computed.
S-complex asteroids are more dense on average than those in the C-complex that
in turn have a larger macroporosity, although both complexes partly overlap.
Within the C-complex, B-types stand out in albedo, reflectance spectra, and
density, indicating a unique composition. Asteroids in the X-complex span a
wide range of densities, suggesting that many compositions are included in the
complex. Comets and TNOs have high macroporosity and low density, supporting
the current models of internal structures made of icy aggregates. The number of
density estimates sky-rocketed during last decade from a handful to 287, but
only a third of the estimates are more precise than 20%. Several lines of
investigation to refine this are contemplated, including observations of
multiple systems, 3-D shape modeling, and orbital analysis from Gaia

the late stages of the stellar evolution, in particular for cooling of neutron
stars and white dwarfs. Proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase
approximation (pn-QRPA) theory has recently being used for a microscopic
calculation of stellar weak interaction rates of iron isotopes with success.
Here I present the detailed calculation of neutrino and antineutrino cooling
rates due to key iron isotopes in stellar matter using the pn-QRPA theory. The
rates are calculated on a fine grid of temperature-density scale suitable for
core-collapse simulators. The calculated rates are compared against earlier
calculations. The neutrino cooling rates due to isotopes of iron are in overall
good agreement with the rates calculated using the large-scale shell model.
During the presupernova evolution of massive stars, from oxygen shell burning
till around end of convective core silicon burning phases, the calculated
neutrino cooling rates due to $^{54}$Fe are three to four times larger than the
corresponding shell model rates. The Brink's hypothesis used in previous
calculations can at times lead to erroneous results. The Brink's hypothesis
assumes that the Gamow-Teller strength distributions for all excited states are
the same. It is, however, shown by the present calculation that both the
centroid and total strength for excited states differ appreciably from the
ground state distribution. These changes in the strength distributions of
thermally populated excited states can alter the total weak interaction rates
rather significantly. The calculated antineutrino cooling rates, due to
positron capture and $\beta$-decay of iron isotopes, are orders of magnitude
smaller than the corresponding neutrino cooling rates and can safely be
neglected specially at low temperatures and high stellar densities.

in a differentially rotating incompressible fluid contained in a spherical
shell. For cylindrical and shellular rotation profiles and in the inviscid
limit, inertial waves obey a second-order partial differential equation of
mixed type. Two kinds of inertial modes therefore exist, depending on whether
the hyperbolic domain where characteristics propagate covers the whole shell or
not. The occurrence of these two kinds of inertial modes is examined, and we
show that the range of frequencies at which inertial waves may propagate is
broader than with solid-body rotation. Using high-resolution calculations based
on a spectral method, we show that, as with solid-body rotation, singular modes
with thin shear layers following short-period attractors still exist with
differential rotation. They exist even in the case of a full sphere. In the
limit of vanishing viscosities, the width of the shear layers seems to weakly
depend on the global background shear, showing a scaling in E^{1/3} with the
Ekman number E, as in the solid-body rotation case. There also exist modes with
thin detached layers of width scaling with E^{1/2} as Ekman boundary layers.
The behavior of inertial waves with a corotation resonance within the shell is
also considered. For cylindrical rotation, waves get dramatically absorbed at
corotation. In contrast, for shellular rotation, waves may cross a critical
layer without visible absorption, and such modes can be unstable for small
enough Ekman numbers.

homogeneous magnetic field. With the fluid/flow coupling and the Hall effect
included, the magnetorotational instability and the Hall effect are both acting
together. Results differ for magnetic fields aligned with the rotation axis and
anti-parallel magnetic fields. For a positive alignment of the magnetic field
the instability grows on a rotational time-scale for any sufficiently large
magnetic Reynolds number. Even the magnetic fields which are stable against the
MRI due to the magnetic diffusion are now susceptible to the shear-Hall
instability. In contrast, the negative alignment places strong restrictions on
the growth and the magnitude of the fields, hindering the effectiveness of the
Hall-MRI. While non-axisymmetric modes of the MRI can be suppressed by strong
enough rotation, there is no such restriction when the Hall effect is present.
The implications for the magnitude and the topology of the magnetic field of a
young neutron star may be significant.

Here we report the first results of an investigation whose main goal is to
understand the physical mechanisms that control the scattering polarization
across these resonance lines and to achieve a realistic radiative transfer
modeling in the presence of arbitrary magnetic fields. We show that the joint
action of partial frequency redistribution (PRD) and quantum interference
between the two excited J-levels produces a complex fractional linear
polarization (Q/I) pattern with large polarization amplitudes in the blue and
red wings, and a negative feature in the spectral region between the two lines.
Another remarkable peculiarity of the Q/I profile is a conspicuous
antisymmetric signal around the center of the h line, which cannot be obtained
unless both PRD and J-state interference effects are taken into account. In the
core of the k line, PRD effects alone produce a triplet peak structure in the
Q/I profile, whose modeling can be achieved also via the two-level atom
approximation. In addition to the Hanle effect in the core of the k line, we
emphasize also the diagnostic potential of the circular polarization produced
by the Zeeman effect in the h and k lines, as well as in other MgII lines
located in their wings.

real-valued random parameter, conveyed over an additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channel, where the performance metric is the large deviations behavior
of the estimator, namely, the exponential decay rate (as a function of the
observation time) of the probability that the estimation error would exceed a
certain threshold. Our basic result is in providing an exact characterization
of the fastest achievable exponential decay rate, among all possible
modulator-estimator (transmitter-receiver) pairs, where the modulator is
limited only in the signal power, but not in bandwidth. This exponential rate
turns out to be given by the reliability function of the AWGN channel. We also
discuss several ways to achieve this optimum performance, and one of them is
based on quantization of the parameter, followed by optimum channel coding and
modulation, which gives rise to a separation-based transmitter, if one views
this setting from the perspective of joint source-channel coding. This is in
spite of the fact that, in general, when error exponents are considered, the
source-channel separation theorem does not hold true. We also discuss several
observations, modifications and extensions of this result in several
directions, including other channels, and the case of multidimensional
parameter vectors. One of our findings concerning the latter, is that there is
an abrupt threshold effect in the dimensionality of the parameter vector: below
a certain critical dimension, the probability of excess estimation error may
still decay exponentially, but beyond this value, it must converge to unity.

of multiple gene networks into joint modeling of genomic data by introducing a
mixture model based on the use of multiple Markov random fields (MRFs). Another
important contribution of our work is to allow different genomic data to be

The study is carried out comparatively for two homologous

carbamoyltransferase (AOTCase) and an unknotted ornithine carbamoyltransferase
(OTCase). In addition, two different sets of pairwise amino acid interactions

additionally including non-native quasi-chemical and electrostatic
interactions. With the former model neither protein show a propensity to form
knots. With the additional non-native interactions, knotting propensity remains
negligible for the natively-unknotted OTCase while for AOTCase it is much
enhanced. Analysis of the trajectories suggests that the different entanglement

point away from (for OTCase) or approach and eventually thread (for AOTCase)
other regions of partly-folded protein. The analysis of the OTCase/AOTCase pair

possibly non-uniform, Fermi velocity. Along with the modes with unit
transmission usually found across a single barrier, we analytically find
additional resonant modes when considering a periodic structure of several
strain-induced barriers. We also study the band-like spectrum of bound states,
as a function of conserved energy and transverse momentum. Such a
strain-induced superlattice may thus effectively work as a mode filter for
transport in graphene.

gravitational binding energy. Such hypothetical primordial objects may have
been the seed of the massive black holes (BHs) observed at the centre of
galaxies. Under the standard picture, these objects can be approximately
described as n=3 polytropes, and they are expected to shine extremely close to
their Eddington luminosity. Once however, one considers the porosity induced by
instabilities near the Eddington limit, which give rise to super-Eddington
states, the standard picture should be modified. We study the structure,
evolution and mass loss of these objects. We find the following. First, the
evolution of SMSs is hastened due to their increased energy release. They
accelerate continuum driven winds. If there is no rotational stabilization,
these winds are insufficient to ""evaporate"" the objects, such that they can
collapse to form a supermassive BHs, however, they do prevent SMSs from
emitting a copious amount of ionizing radiation. If the SMSs are rotationally
stabilized, the winds ""evaporate"" the objects until a normal sub-Eddington star
remains, having a mass of a few 100Msun.

reliability of the method is studied by means of synthetic data analysis. The
experimental measurements on MAST indicate that the apparent mean poloidal

longest correlation direction of the patterns (parallel to the local background
magnetic fields) is not parallel to the direction of the fastest mean plasma
flows (usually toroidal when strong neutral beam injection is present). The
experimental measurements are consistent with the mean motion of plasma being
toroidal. The sum of all other contributions (mean poloidal plasma flow, phase
velocity of the density patterns in the plasma frame, non-linear effects, etc.)
to the apparent mean poloidal velocity of the density patterns is found to be
negligible. These results hold in all investigated L-mode, H-mode and internal
transport barrier (ITB) discharges. The one exception is a high-poloidal-beta
(the ratio of the plasma pressure to the poloidal magnetic field energy
density) discharge, where a large magnetic island exists. In this case BES

power spectra, where signatures of nonuniform surface rotation are expected, as
well as in the frequency splittings induced by the internal rotation rate. We
wish to figure out whether the differences between the seismic rotation period
as determined by a mean rotational splitting, and the rotation period measured
from the low frequency peak in the Fourier spectrum (observed for some of
CoRoT's targets) can provide constraints on the rotation profile. For uniform
moderate rotators,perturbative corrections to second and third order in terms
of the rotation angular velocity \Omega, may mimic differential rotation. We
apply our perturbation method to evaluate mode frequencies accurate up to
\Omega^3 for uniform rotation. Effects of latitudinal dependence are calculated
in the linear approximation. In \beta Cephei pulsators models, third order
effects become comparable to that of a horizontal shear similar to the solar
one at rotation rates well below the breakup values. We show how a clean
signature of the latitudinal shear may be extracted. Our models of two CoRoT
target HD 181906 and HD 181420, represent lower main sequence objects. These
are slow rotators and nonlinear effects in splittings are accordingly small. We
use data on one low frequency peak and one splitting of a dipolar mode to
constrain the rotation profile in HD 181420 and HD 181906. The relative
influence of the two effects strongly depends on the type of the oscillation
modes in the star and on the magnitude of the rotation rate. Given mean
rotational splitting and the frequency of a spot signature, it is possible to
distinguish between the two hypothesis, and in the case of differential
rotation in latitude, we propose a method to determine the type of rotation
profile and a range of values for the shear.

  through a constrained hidden Markov model",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The detection of change-points in heterogeneous sequences is a statistical
challenge with applications across a wide variety of fields. In bioinformatics,
a vast amount of methodology exists to identify an ideal set of change-points
for detecting Copy Number Variation (CNV). While considerable efficient
algorithms are currently available for finding the best segmentation of the
data in CNV, relatively few approaches consider the important problem of
assessing the uncertainty of the change-point location. Asymptotic and
stochastic approaches exist but often require additional model assumptions to
speed up the computations, while exact methods have quadratic complexity which
usually are intractable for large datasets of tens of thousands points or more.
In this paper, we suggest an exact method for obtaining the posterior
distribution of change-points with linear complexity, based on a constrained
hidden Markov model. The methods are implemented in the R package postCP, which
uses the results of a given change-point detection algorithm to estimate the
probability that each observation is a change-point. We present the results of
the package on a publicly available CNV data set (n=120). Due to its
frequentist framework, postCP obtains less conservative confidence intervals
than previously published Bayesian methods, but with linear complexity instead
of quadratic. Simulations showed that postCP provided comparable loss to a
Bayesian MCMC method when estimating posterior means, specifically when
assessing larger-scale changes, while being more computationally efficient. On
another high-resolution CNV data set (n=14,241), the implementation processed
information in less than one second on a mid-range laptop computer.

increases dramatically with the application of the electric current. The
current-induced change of the SHG intensity rises linearly with the current

lying parallel to the photosphere. In this work the possible link between
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and thread lifetimes is investigated. This is
done by calculating the eigenmodes of a thread modelled as a Cartesian slab
under the presence of gravity. An analytical dispersion relation is derived
using the incompressible assumption for the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
perturbations. The system allows a mode that is always stable, independently of
the value of the Alfv\'en speed in the thread. The character of this mode
varies from being localised at the upper interface of the slab when the
magnetic field is weak, to having a global nature and resembling the transverse
kink mode when the magnetic field is strong. On the contrary, the slab model
permits another mode that is unstable and localised at the lower interface when
the magnetic field is weak. The growth rates of this mode can be very short, of
the order of minutes for typical thread conditions. This Rayleigh-Taylor
unstable mode becomes stable when the magnetic field is increased, and in the
limit of strong magnetic field it is essentially a sausage magnetic mode. The
gravity force might have a strong effect on the modes of oscillation of
threads, depending on the value of the Alfv\'en speed. In the case of threads
in quiescent filaments, where the Alfv\'en speed is presumably low, very short
lifetimes are expected according to the slab model. In active region
prominences, the stabilising effect of the magnetic tension might be enough to
suppress the Rayleigh-Taylor instability for a wide range of wavelengths.

highly suitable for nanoelectromechanical devices such as e.g. mass sensors,

many of the mechanical properties of graphene membranes can be described by
classical continuum mechanics. An important parameter for predicting the
performance and linearity of graphene nanoelectromechanical devices as well as
for describing ripple formation and other properties such as electron
scattering mechanisms, is the bending rigidity, {\kappa}. In spite of the
importance of this parameter it has so far only been estimated indirectly for
monolayer graphene from the phonon spectrum of graphite, estimated from AFM
measurements or predicted from ab initio calculations or bond-order potential
models. Here, we employ a new approach to the experimental determination of
{\kappa} by exploiting the snap-through instability in pre-buckled graphene
membranes. We demonstrate the reproducible fabrication of convex buckled
graphene membranes by controlling the thermal stress during the fabrication
procedure and show the abrupt switching from convex to concave geometry that
occurs when electrostatic pressure is applied via an underlying gate electrode.
The bending rigidity of bilayer graphene membranes under ambient conditions was
determined to be $35.5^{+20}_{-15}$ eV. Monolayers have significantly lower

as their constrained distances, post-AGB stars in external galaxies offer
unprecedented tests to AGB nucleosynthesis and dredge-up predictions. We focus
here on one object J004441.04-732136.4, which is the only known 21 micrometer
source of the SMC. Spectral abundance results reveal J004441.04-732136.4 to be
one of the most s-process enriched objects found up to date, while the
photospheric C/O ratio of 1.9 +- 0.7, shows the star is only modestly C-rich.
J004441.04-732136.4 also displays a low [Fe/H] = -1.34 +- 0.32, which is
significantly lower than the mean metallicity of the SMC. From the SED, a
luminosity of 7600 +- 200 solar luminosities is found, together with E(B-V) =
0.64 +- 0.02. According to evolutionary post-AGB tracks, the initial mass
should be approximately 1.3 solar masses. The photometric variability shows a
clear period of 97.6 +- 0.3 days. The detected C/O as well as the high
s-process overabundances (e.g. [Y/Fe] = 2.15, [La/Fe] = 2.84) are hard to
reconcile with the predictions. The chemical models also predict a high Pb
abundance, which is not compatible with the detected spectrum, and a very high
12C/13C, which is not yet constrained by observations. The predictions are only
marginally dependent on the evolution codes used. We show that our theoretical
predictions match the s-process distribution, but fail in reproducing the
detected high overabundances and predict a high Pb abundance which is not
detected. Additionally, there remain serious problems in explaining the
observed pulsational properties of this source.

coherences which can be easily prepared in star-topology spin-systems. In this
method we exploit the high sensitivity of the NOON states for z-rotations. As a
result, Torrey oscillations with NOON states decay much faster than that of
single quantum coherences. Therefore the present method requires shorter pulse
durations, and enables the study of inhomogeneity at higher RF powers. To model
such a inhomogeneity profile, we propose a two-parameter asymmetric Lorentzian
function. The experiments are carried out in 1H channels of two different
high-resolution NMR probes and the results are compared. Finally, we also
extend the NOON state method to characterize the inhomogeneity correlations

the Galactic globular clusters (GCs) are constructed based on their observed
luminosities, the stellar evolution and dynamical mass-loss processes, and the
mass-to-light ratio (MLR). Under these conditions, a Schechter-like ICMF is
evolved for approximately a Hubble time and converted into the luminosity
function (LF), which requires finding the values of 5 free parameters: the mean
GC age (\tA), the dissolution timescale of a $10^5 \ms$ cluster ($\tau_5$), the
exponential truncation mass (\mc) and 2 MLR parametrising constants. This is
achieved by minimising the residuals between the evolved and observed LFs, with
the minimum residuals and realistic parameters obtained with MLRs that increase
with luminosity (or mass). The optimum PMDFs indicate a total stellar mass of
$\sim4\times10^7$ \ms\ still bound to GCs, representing $\sim15%$ of the mass
in clusters at the beginning of the gas-free evolution. The corresponding ICMFs
resemble the scale-free MFs of young clusters and molecular clouds observed in
the local Universe, while the PDMFs follow closely a lognormal distribution
with a turnover at $\mto\sim7\times10^4$\,\ms. For most of the GC mass range,
we find an MLR lower than usually adopted, which explains the somewhat low
\mto. Our results confirm that the MLR increases with cluster mass (or
luminosity), and suggest that GCs and young clusters share a common origin in
terms of physical processes related to formation.

inevitable when optimal exploitation of the instrumental capacities is desired.
Fringe tracking allows continuous fringe observation, considerably increasing
the sensitivity of the interferometric system. In addition to the correction of
atmospheric path-length differences, a decent control algorithm should correct
for disturbances introduced by instrumental vibrations, and deal with other
errors propagating in the optical trains. We attempt to construct control
schemes based on Kalman filters. Kalman filtering is an optimal data processing
algorithm for tracking and correcting a system on which observations are
performed. As a direct application, control schemes are designed for GRAVITY, a
future four-telescope near-infrared beam combiner for the Very Large Telescope
Interferometer (VLTI). We base our study on recent work in adaptive-optics
control. The technique is to describe perturbations of fringe phases in terms
of an a priori model. The model allows us to optimize the tracking of fringes,
in that it is adapted to the prevailing perturbations. Since the model is of a
parametric nature, a parameter identification needs to be included. Different
possibilities exist to generalize to the four-telescope fringe tracking that is
useful for GRAVITY. On the basis of a two-telescope Kalman-filtering control
algorithm, a set of two properly working control algorithms for four-telescope
fringe tracking is constructed. The control schemes are designed to take into
account flux problems and low-signal baselines. First simulations of the
fringe-tracking process indicate that the defined schemes meet the requirements
for GRAVITY and allow us to distinguish in performance. In a future paper, we
will compare the performances of classical fringe tracking to our Kalman-filter
control.

mixing patterns for quarks and leptons. The model employs the see-saw mechanism
for generation of the light neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry is
produced via leptogenesis. We perform detailed calculations of both the CP
violating lepton asymmetries, originating from the decays of the heavy Majorana
neutrinos operative in the see-saw mechanism, and of the efficiency factors
which account for the lepton asymmetry wash-out processes in the Early
Universe. The latter are calculated by solving numerically the system of
Boltzmann equations describing the generation and the evolution of the lepton
asymmetries. The baryon asymmetry in the model considered is proportional to
the J_{CP} factor, which determines the magnitude of CP violation effects in
the oscillations of flavour neutrinos. The leptogenesis scale can be
sufficiently low, allowing to avoid the potential gravitino problem.

inertial-vortex forces of the eddies are larger than all the other forces that
tend to damp the eddies out. Fossil turbulence is a perturbation produced by
turbulence that persists after the fluid ceases to be turbulent at the scale of
the perturbation. Because vorticity is produced at small scales, turbulence
must cascade from small scales to large, providing a consistent physical basis
for Kolmogorovian universal similarity laws. Oceanic and astrophysical mixing
and diffusion are dominated by fossil turbulence and fossil turbulent waves.
Observations from space telescopes show turbulence and vorticity existed in the
beginning of the universe and that their fossils persist. Fossils of big bang
turbulence include spin and the dark matter of galaxies: clumps of ~ 10^12
frozen hydrogen planets that make globular star clusters as seen by infrared
and microwave space telescopes. When the planets were hot gas, they hosted the
formation of life in a cosmic soup of hot-water oceans as they merged to form
the first stars and chemicals. Because spontaneous life formation according to
the standard cosmological model is virtually impossible, the existence of life
falsifies the standard cosmological model.

especially interesting on this regard. Many studies on lithium abundances in
M67 have already been performed, but a homogeneous global analysis of lithium
in stars from subsolar up to the most massive members, was never accomplished
for a large sample based on high-quality spectra. We tested our non-standard
models, which were calibrated using the Sun with observational data. We
collected literature data to follow, for the first time in a homogeneous way,
NLTE lithium abundances of all observed single stars in M67 more massive than
about 0.9 solar masses. Our grid of evolutionary models were computed with
non-standard mixing at metallicity [Fe/H] = 0.01, using the Toulouse-Geneva
evolution code. The analysis is started from the entrance in the ZAMS. Lithium
in M67 is a tight function of mass for stars more massive than the Sun, apart
of a few outliers. A plateau in lithium abundances is observed for turn-off
stars. Both less massive and more massive stars are more depleted than those in
the plateau. There is a significant scatter in lithium abundances for any given
mass lower than M <= 1.1 solar masses. Our models qualitatively reproduce most
of the features described above, although the predicted depletion of lithium is
0.45 dex smaller than observed for masses in the plateau region, i.e. between
1.1 and 1.28 solar masses. Clearly, more work is needed to throughly match the

after the discovery of the Chameleon mechanism and of the Galileon models. The
former allows, in principle, to reconcile the presence of cosmological scalar
fields with the constraints from experiments at the Solar System scale. The
latter open up the possibility of building inflationary models that, among
other things, do not need ad hoc potentials. Further generalizations have
finally led to the most general tensor-scalar theory, recently dubbed the ""Fab
Four"", with only first and second order derivatives of the fields in the
equations of motion and that self-tune to a vanishing cosmological constant.
This model has a very rich phenomenology that needs to be explored and
confronted with experimental data in order to constrain a very large parameter
space. In this paper, we present some results regarding a subset of the theory
named ""John"", which corresponds to a non-minimal derivative coupling between
the scalar field and the Einstein tensor in the action. We show that this
coupling gives rise to an inflationary model with very unnatural initial
conditions. Thus, we include a non-minimal, but non-derivative, coupling
between scalar field and Ricci scalar, a term named ""George"" in the Fab Four
terminology. In this way, we find a more sensible inflationary model, and, by
performing a post-newtonian expansion of spherically symmetric solutions, we
derive the set of equations that constrain the parameter space with data from
experiments in the solar system.

exchange interactions and dangling spins. The dangling spins couple with one
another via effective exchange interactions, which are mediated by chain spins.
The dangling spins are further divided into two subsystems, DS1 and DS2. The
dangling spins in DS1 undergo three-dimensional ferromagnetic ordering at 3.14
K, while those in DS2 remain paramagnetic down to 0.35 K. The effective
interaction between the DS1 spins is approximately expressed by the

where the sellers have private costs to produce items, and the
buyer(auctioneer) aims to maximize a social valuation function on subsets of
items, under the budget constraint on the total payment. One of the most
important questions in the field is ""which valuation domains admit truthful
budget feasible mechanisms with `small' approximations (compared to the social
optimum)?"" Singer showed that additive and submodular functions have such
constant approximations. Recently, Dobzinski, Papadimitriou, and Singer gave an
O(log^2 n)-approximation mechanism for subadditive functions; they also
remarked that: ""A fundamental question is whether, regardless of computational
constraints, a constant-factor budget feasible mechanism exists for subadditive
functions.""
  We address this question from two viewpoints: prior-free worst case analysis
and Bayesian analysis. For the prior-free framework, we use an LP that
describes the fractional cover of the valuation function; it is also connected
to the concept of approximate core in cooperative game theory. We provide an
O(I)-approximation mechanism for subadditive functions, via the worst case
integrality gap I of LP. This implies an O(log n)-approximation for subadditive
valuations, O(1)-approximation for XOS valuations, and for valuations with a
constant I. XOS valuations are an important class of functions that lie between
submodular and subadditive classes. We give another polynomial time O(log
n/loglog n) sub-logarithmic approximation mechanism for subadditive valuations.
  For the Bayesian framework, we provide a constant approximation mechanism for
all subadditive functions, using the above prior-free mechanism for XOS
valuations as a subroutine. Our mechanism allows correlations in the
distribution of private information and is universally truthful.

  Modugno",,,,"cond-mat.quant-gas","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The central problem of this chapter is temporal coherence of a
three-dimensional spatially homogeneous Bose-condensed gas, initially prepared
at finite temperature and then evolving as an isolated interacting system. A
first theoretical tool is a number-conserving Bogoliubov approach that allows
to describe the system as a weakly interacting gas of quasi-particles. This
approach naturally introduces the phase operator of the condensate: a central
actor since loss of temporal coherence is governed by the spreading of the
condensate phase-change. A second tool is the set of kinetic equations
describing the Beliaev-Landau processes for the quasi-particles. We find that
in general the variance of the condensate phase-change at long times $t$ is the
sum of a ballistic term $\propto t^2$ and a diffusive term $\propto t$ with
temperature and interaction dependent coefficients. In the thermodynamic limit,
the diffusion coefficient scales as the inverse of the system volume. The
coefficient of $t^2$ scales as the inverse volume squared times the variance of
the energy of the system in the initial state and can also be obtained by a
quantum ergodic theory (the so-called eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis).

apart from each other. We obtain simple analytical expressions of the first

discontinuity of the incident field and whose amplitude rapidly decreases with
this order (rise-time effects). We show that, in a strictly speaking asymptotic
limit, the second (Brillouin) precursor is entirely determined by the
frequency-dependence of the medium attenuation and has a Gaussian or
Gaussian-derivative shape. We point out that this result applies to the
precursor directly observed in a Debye medium at decimetric wavelengths. When
attenuation and group-delay dispersion both contribute to its formation, we
establish a more general expression of the Brillouin precursor, containing the
previous one (dominant-attenuation limit) and that obtained by Brillouin
(dominant-dispersion limit) as particular cases. We finally study the
propagation of square or Gaussian pulses and we determine the pulse parameters

geometries, representing creep- and avalanche-like glitches, provide lower and
upper bounds on the gravitational wave signal strength respectively. The signal
arising from homogeneous glitches is found to scale with the square root of
glitch size, whereas the signal from inhomogeneous glitches scales proportional
to glitch size. The signal is also computed as a function of vortex travel
distance and stellar angular velocity. Convenient amplitude scalings are
derived as functions of these parameters. For the typical astrophysical
situation, where the glitch duration (in units of the spin period) is large
compared to the vortex travel distance (in units of the stellar radius), an
individual glitch from an object $1\,\rm{kpc}$ from Earth generates a wave
strain of $10^{-24} [(\Delta\omega/\omega) / 10^{-7}] (\omega/10^2 \rm{rad

non-detection of a signal from the 2006 Vela glitch in data from the fifth

technique for finding the maximum likelihood estimates for parametric models
when the data are not fully observed. The EM is best suited for situations
where the expectation in each E-step and the maximization in each M-step are
straightforward. A difficulty with the implementation of the EM algorithm is
that each E-step requires the integration of the log-likelihood function in
closed form. The explicit integration can be avoided by using what is known as
the Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm. The MCEM uses a random sample to estimate
the integral at each E-step. However, the problem with the MCEM is that it
often converges to the integral quite slowly and the convergence behavior can
also be unstable, which causes a computational burden. In this paper, we
propose what we refer to as the quantile variant of the EM (QEM) algorithm. We
prove that the proposed QEM method has an accuracy of $O(1/K^2)$ while the MCEM
method has an accuracy of $O_p(1/\sqrt{K})$. Thus, the proposed QEM method
possesses faster and more stable convergence properties when compared with the
MCEM algorithm. The improved performance is illustrated through the numerical
studies. Several practical examples illustrating its use in interval-censored
data problems are also provided.

Thus, we calculate a new quantity, $w_0$, for setting the scale in lattice QCD,
which is based on the Wilson flow like the scale $t_0$ (M. Luscher, JHEP 1008

particular, it does not involve the delicate fitting of correlation functions
at asymptotic times. It typically can be determined on the few per-mil level.
We compute its continuum extrapolated value in 2+1-flavor QCD for physical and
non-physical pion and kaon masses, to allow for mass-independent scale setting
even away from the physical mass point. We demonstrate its robustness by
computing it with two very different actions (one of them with staggered, the
other with Wilson fermions) and by showing that the results agree for physical

homogeneity and isotropy. In statistically homogeneous and isotropic
spacetimes, we find that the acceleration inferred from observations of the
distance-redshift relation is closely related to the acceleration of the
spatially averaged universe, but does not necessarily bear any resemblance to
the average of the local acceleration of spacetime itself. For inhomogeneous
spacetimes that do not display statistical homogeneity and isotropy, however,
we find little correlation between acceleration inferred from observations and
the acceleration of the averaged spacetime. This shows that observations made
in an inhomogeneous universe can imply acceleration without the existence of
dark energy.

extend the method to also infer the a posteriori signal uncertainty any
tempering of the posterior has to be undone at the end of the calculations, as
they correctly point out. Furthermore, a distinction is made here between
maximum entropy, the maximum entropy principle, and the so-called maximum

attributed to an increase of hydrodynamic constraint (viscous stress and/or

reverse phenomenon and build a phase diagram of shapes --- which are classified

Unexpectedly, shapes are relatively wider in the narrowest direction of the
channel. We highlight the role of flow patterns on the membrane in this
response to the asymmetry of stress distribution.

molecular aggregates is an issue of central interest. This article shows the
important role of high-energy quantized vibrations and their non-equilibrium
dynamics for energy transfer in photosynthetic systems with highly localized
excitonic states. We consider the cryptophyte antennae protein phycoerythrin
545 and show that coupling to quantized vibrations which are quasi-resonant
with excitonic transitions is fundamental for biological function as it
generates non-cascaded transport with rapid and wider spatial distribution of
excitation energy. Our work also indicates that the non-equilibrium dynamics of
such vibrations can manifest itself in ultrafast beating of both excitonic
populations and coherences at room temperature, with time scales in agreement
with those reported in experiments. Moreover, we show that mechanisms
supporting coherent excitonic dynamics assist coupling to selected modes that
channel energy to preferential sites in the complex. We therefore argue that,
in the presence of strong coupling between electronic excitations and quantized
vibrations, a concrete and important advantage of quantum coherent dynamics is
precisely to tune resonances that promote fast and effective energy
distribution.

gravitational shift in the frame of the accelerating twin. We use the same
