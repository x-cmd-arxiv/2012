performance trade-off between centralized and distributed processing. In our
model, a fraction $p$ of an available resource is deployed in a centralized
manner (e.g., to serve a most-loaded station) while the remaining fraction
$1-p$ is allocated to local servers that can only serve requests addressed
specifically to their respective stations.
  Using a fluid model approach, we demonstrate a surprising phase transition in
the steady-state delay, as $p$ changes: in the limit of a large number of
stations, and when any amount of centralization is available ($p>0$), the
average queue length in steady state scales as $\log_{1/(1-p)} 1/(1-\lambda)$
when the traffic intensity $\lambda$ goes to 1. This is exponentially smaller
than the usual M/M/1-queue delay scaling of $1/(1-\lambda)$, obtained when all
resources are fully allocated to local stations ($p=0$). This indicates a
strong qualitative impact of even a small degree of centralization.
  We prove convergence to a fluid limit, and characterize both the transient
and steady-state behavior of the finite system, in the limit as the number of
stations $N$ goes to infinity. We show that the sequence of queue-length
processes converges to a unique fluid trajectory (over any finite time
interval, as $N$ approaches infinity, and that this fluid trajectory converges
to a unique invariant state $v^I$, for which a simple closed-form expression is
obtained. We also show that the steady-state distribution of the $N$-server
system concentrates on $v^I$ as $N$ goes to infinity.

large-amplitude oscillations along filament axes that explains the restoring
force and damping mechanism. We have investigated the oscillations of multiple
threads formed in long, dipped flux tubes through the thermal nonequilibrium
process, and found that the oscillation properties predicted by our simulations
agree with the observed behavior. We then constructed a model for the
large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations that demonstrates that the restoring
force is the projected gravity in the tube where the threads oscillate.
Although the period is independent of the tube length and the constantly
growing mass, the motions are strongly damped by the steady accretion of mass
onto the threads by thermal nonequilibrium. The observations and our model
suggest that a nearby impulsive event drives the existing prominence threads
along their supporting tubes, away from the heating deposition site, without
destroying them. The subsequent oscillations occur because the displaced
threads reside in magnetic concavities with large radii of curvature. Our model
yields a powerful seismological method for constraining the coronal magnetic
field and radius of curvature of dips. Furthermore, these results indicate that
the magnetic structure is most consistent with the sheared-arcade model for
filament channels.

(AGB stars) are in transition to become Planetary Nebulae (PNe) are still
poorly understood. An important question is how the circumstellar envelopes of
AGB stars switch from spherical symmetry to the axially symmetric structures
frequently observed in PNe. In many cases there is clear evidence that the
shaping of the circumstellar envelopes of PNe is linked to the formation of
jets/collimated winds and their interaction with the remnant AGB envelope.
Because of the short evolutionary time, objects in this phase are rare, but
their identification provides valuable probes for testing evolutionary models.
We have observed (sub)millimeter CO rotational transitions with the APEX
telescope in a small sample of stars hosting high-velocity OH and water masers.
These targets are supposed to have recently left the AGB, as indicated by the
presence of winds traced by masers, with velocities larger than observed during
that phase. We have carried out observations of several CO lines, ranging from
J=2-1 up to J=7-6. In IRAS 15452-5459 we detect a fast molecular outflow in the

two-fluids concept. Both components are materially identical and inviscid. The
first component is an ensemble of quasi-rigid dipole-vortex tubes as
quasi-particles in chaotic motion. The second is a superfluid performing
evasive motions between the tubes. The local dipole motions follow Helmholtz'
law. The vortex radii scale with the energy-containing length scale. Collisions
between quasi-particles lead either to annihilation (likewise rotation,
turbulent dissipation) or to scattering (counterrotation, turbulent diffusion).
There are analogies with birth and death processes of population dynamics and
their master equations. For free homogeneous decay the theory predicts the TKE
to follow 1/t. With an adiabatic condition at the wall it predicts the
logarithmic law with von Karman's constant as 1/\sqrt{2 pi} = 0.399. Likewise
rotating couples form dissipative patches almost at rest ($\rightarrow$
intermittency) wherein the spectrum evolves like an ""Apollonian gear"" as
discussed first by Herrmann, 1990. On this basis the prefactor of the

arsenide has led to an intensive search to optimize the superconducting
properties of iron-based superconductors by changing the chemical composition
of the spacer layer that is inserted between adjacent anionic iron arsenide
layers. Until now, superconductivity has only been found in compounds with a
cationic spacer layer consisting of metal ions: Li+, Na+, K+, Ba2+ or a
PbO-type or perovskite-type oxide layer. Electronic doping is usually necessary
to control the fine balance between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity.
Superconductivity has also been reported in FeSe, which contains neutral layers
similar in structure to those found in the iron arsenides but without the
spacer layer. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of Lix(NH2)y(NH3)1-yFe2Se2 (x
~0.6 ; y ~ 0.2), with lithium ions, lithium amide and ammonia acting as the
spacer layer, which exhibits superconductivity at 43(1) K, higher than in any
FeSe-derived compound reported so far and four times higher at ambient pressure
than the transition temperature, Tc, of the parent Fe1.01Se. We have determined
the crystal structure using neutron powder diffraction and used magnetometry
and muon-spin rotation data to determine the superconducting properties. This
new synthetic route opens up the possibility of further exploitation of related
molecular intercalations in this and other systems in order to greatly optimize
the superconducting properties in this family.

surveys. We evaluate a simulation-based calibration method to create a bias
model as a function of galaxy properties and observing conditions. This model

measurement of the mass distribution of the universe. A challenge for this
technique is to control systematic errors that occur when measuring the shapes
of distant galaxies. In this paper we investigate noise bias, a systematic
error that arises from second order noise terms in the shape measurement
process. We first derive analytical expressions for the bias of general Maximum
Likelihood Estimators (MLEs) in the presence of additive noise. We then find
analytical expressions for a simplified toy model in which galaxies are modeled
and fitted with a Gaussian with its size as a single free parameter. Even for
this very simple case we find a significant effect. We also extend our analysis
to a more realistic 6-parameter elliptical Gaussian model. We find that the
noise bias is generically of the order of the inverse-squared signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of the galaxies and is thus of the order of a percent for galaxies
of SNR of 10, i.e. comparable to the weak lensing shear signal. This is nearly
two orders of magnitude greater than the systematics requirements for future
all-sky weak lensing surveys. We discuss possible ways to circumvent this
effect, including a calibration method using simulations discussed in an

the Gr\""obner bases theory). Finally, we explain how to ""deform"" the

significant fractions of the dense circumnuclear gas have high kinetic
temperatures, which are hard to explain by pure photon excitation, but may be
caused by dissipation of turbulent energy.
  Aims. We aim to determine to what extent mechanical heating should be taken
into account while modelling PDRs. To this end, the effect of dissipated
turbulence on the thermal and chemical properties of PDRs is explored. Methods.
Clouds are modelled as 1D semi-infinite slabs whose thermal and chemical
equilibrium is solved for using the Leiden PDR-XDR code.
  Results. In a steady-state treatment, mechanical heating seems to play an
important role in determining the kinetic temperature of the gas in molecular
clouds. Particularly in high-energy environments such as starburst galaxies and
galaxy centers, model gas temperatures are underestimated by at least a factor
of two if mechanical heating is ignored. The models also show that CO, HCN and
H2 O column densities increase as a function of mechanical heating. The HNC/HCN
integrated column density ratio shows a decrease by a factor of at least two in
high density regions with n \sim 105 cm-3, whereas that of HCN/HCO+ shows a
strong dependence on mechanical heating for this same density range, with
boosts of up to three orders of magnitude.
  Conclusions. The effects of mechanical heating cannot be ignored in studies
of the molecular gas excitation whenever the ratio of the star formation rate
to the gas density is close to, or exceeds, 7 \times 10-6 M yr-1 cm4.5 . If
mechanical heating is not included, predicted column densities are
underestimated, sometimes even by a few orders of magnitude. As a lower bound
to its importance, we determined that it has non-negligible effects already
when mechanical heating is as little as 1% of the UV heating in a PDR.

regime to a constant level. This transition characterizes a non-asymptotic
emergence of the pointer basis, while the system-apparatus can still be quantum
correlated. We provide a formalization of the concept of emergence of a pointer
basis in an apparatus subject to decoherence. This contrast of the pointer
basis emergence to the quantum to classical transition is demonstrated in an
experiment with polarization entangled photon pairs.

masking instrument FIRST. Its principle relies on the combination of spatial
filtering and aperture masking using single-mode fibers, a novel technique that
is aimed at high dynamic range imaging with high angular resolution. The
prototype has been tested with the Shane 3-m telescope at Lick Observatory. The
entrance pupil is divided into subpupils feeding single-mode fibers. The flux
injection into the fibers is optimized by a segmented mirror. The beams are
spectrally dispersed and recombined in a non-redundant exit configuration in
order to retrieve all contrasts and phases independently. The instrument works
at visible wavelengths between 600 nm and 760 nm and currently uses nine of the
30 43 cm subapertures constituting the full pupil. First fringes were obtained
on Vega and Deneb. Stable closure phases were measured with standard deviations
on the order of 1 degree. Closure phase precision can be further improved by
addressing some of the remaining sources of systematic errors. While the number
of fibers used in the experiment was too small to reliably estimate visibility
amplitudes, we have measured closure amplitudes with a precision of 10 % in the
best case. These first promising results obtained under real observing
conditions validate the concept of the fibered aperture masking instrument and
open the way for a new type of ground-based instrument working in the visible.
The next steps of the development will be to improve the stability and the
sensitivity of the instrument in order to achieve more accurate closure phase
and visibility measurements, and to increase the number of sub-pupils to reach
full pupil coverage.

ARGOS is designed to bring a moderate but uniform reduction of the PSF size

Rayleigh beacons to sense the lower layers of the atmosphere achieving almost

secondaries of the LBT. This PhD thesis first discusses a study based on
numerical simulations and aimed to evaluate the performance of ARGOS. This work
has been carried out using CAOS and representing in the code most of the
features that characterize the system itself: as the laser beacon propagation
in the atmosphere, the SH type wavefront sensing, the AO reconstruction and
closed loop delays and the atmosphere tip-tilt sensing done using a NGS and a
quad-cell type sensor. The results obtained in this study are in agreement and
definitively confirm the performance evaluated in the phase studies of the
project. This study shows that ARGOS is able to produce a reduction of a factor
2 of the seeing bringing to a gain of a factor 4 in the integration time
required by LUCI. This PhD thesis reports also the optical design and
optimization of both the ARGOS dichroic window, used to separate the laser
light from the science light, and the LGS WFS, that evaluates the ground layer
aberrations averaging the SH measurements in the direction of the 3 LGS. For
both of the subsystems the optimization process is analyzed. Then are evaluated
the tolerances and specifications for the production and coating of the optics.

This is less
obvious for engineering networks (electric power, gas, water, transportation
systems etc.) that are expected to operate under normal conditions most of
time. As a result, the ability of a network to withstand massive sudden damage
caused by adverse events (or survivability) has not been among traditional
goals in the network design. Reality, however, calls for the adjustment of
design priorities. As modern networks develop toward increasing their size,
complexity, and integration, the likelihood of adverse events increases too due
to technological development, climate change, and activities in the political
arena among other factors. Under such circumstances, a network failure has an
unprecedented effect on lives and economy. To mitigate the impact of adverse
events on the network operability, the survivability analysis must be conducted
at the early stage of the network design. Such analysis requires the
development of new analytical and computational tools. Computational analysis
of the network survivability is the exponential time problem at least. The
current paper describes a new algorithm, in which the reduction of the
computational complexity is achieved by mapping an initial network topology
with multiple sources and sinks onto a set of simpler smaller topologies with
multiple sources and a single sink. Steps for further reducing the time and

the Cep F molecular clump. Using our census of young stars, we examine the
fraction of young stars with infrared excesses indicative of circumstellar
disks. We create a map of the disk fraction throughout the cluster and find
that it is spatially variable. Due to these spatial variations, the two
sub-clusters exhibit substantially different average disk fractions from each

most of the radiation at these bands originates in shocks. OB and WR stars
present supersonic and massive winds that, when colliding, emit largely due to
the free-free radiation. The non-thermal radio and X-ray emissions are due to
synchrotron and inverse compton processes, respectively. In this case, magnetic
fields are expected to play an important role on the emission distribution. In
the past few years the modeling of the free-free and synchrotron emissions from
massive binary systems have been based on purely hydrodynamical simulations,
and ad hoc assumptions regarding the distribution of magnetic energy and the
field geometry. In this work we provide the first full MHD numerical
simulations of wind-wind collision in massive binary systems. We study the
free-free emission characterizing its dependence on the stellar and orbital
parameters. We also study self-consistently the evolution of the magnetic field
at the shock region, obtaining also the synchrotron energy distribution
integrated along different lines of sight. We show that the magnetic field in
the shocks is larger than that obtained when the proportionality between $B$

synchrotron emission relative to the total radio emission has been

develops that is similar to the situation occurring for electronic systems

equivalent of negative differential conductivity observed in transport across

This problem includes environments where agents have budgets, risk preferences,

good (furthermore, it allows an agent's budget and risk preference to be known
only privately to the agent). These are the main challenge areas for auction
theory. A single-agent problem is to optimize a given objective subject to a
constraint on the maximum probability with which each type is allocated,
a.k.a., an allocation rule. Our approach is a reduction from multi-agent
mechanism design problem to collection of single-agent problems. We focus on
maximizing revenue, but our results can be applied to other objectives (e.g.,
welfare).
  An optimal multi-agent mechanism can be computed by a linear/convex program
on interim allocation rules by simultaneously optimizing several single-agent
mechanisms subject to joint feasibility of the allocation rules. For
single-unit auctions, Border \citeyearpar{B91} showed that the space of all
jointly feasible interim allocation rules for $n$ agents is a
$\NumTypes$-dimensional convex polytope which can be specified by $2^\NumTypes$
linear constraints, where $\NumTypes$ is the total number of all agents' types.
Consequently, efficiently solving the mechanism design problem requires a
separation oracle for the feasibility conditions and also an algorithm for
ex-post implementation of the interim allocation rules. We show that the
polytope of jointly feasible interim allocation rules is the projection of a
higher dimensional polytope which can be specified by only $O(\NumTypes^2)$
linear constraints. Furthermore, our proof shows that finding a preimage of the
interim allocation rules in the higher dimensional polytope immediately gives
an ex-post implementation.

terrestrial exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars may be tidally heated at high
enough levels to induce a runaway greenhouse for a long enough duration for all
the hydrogen to escape. Without hydrogen, the planet no longer has water and
cannot support life. We call these planets ""Tidal Venuses,"" and the phenomenon
a ""tidal greenhouse."" Tidal effects also circularize the orbit, which decreases
tidal heating. Hence, some planets may form with large eccentricity, with its
accompanying large tidal heating, and lose their water, but eventually settle
into nearly circular orbits (i.e. with negligible tidal heating) in the
habitable zone (HZ). However, these planets are not habitable as past tidal
heating desiccated them, and hence should not be ranked highly for detailed
follow-up observations aimed at detecting biosignatures. Planets orbiting stars
with masses <0.3 solar masses may be in danger of desiccation via tidal
heating. We apply these concepts to Gl 667C c, a ~4.5 Earth-mass planet
orbiting a 0.3 solar mass star at 0.12 AU. We find that it probably did not
lose its water via tidal heating as orbital stability is unlikely for the high
eccentricities required for the tidal greenhouse. As the inner edge of the HZ
is defined by the onset of a runaway or moist greenhouse powered by radiation,
our results represent a fundamental revision to the HZ for non-circular orbits.

from an accurate calibration of the redshift distribution, allowing new
measurements of the (non-linear) matter power spectrum in a unique range of
scales and redshifts sensitive to neutrino free streaming. Our analysis makes
use of a recent model for the effect of neutrinos on the weakly non-linear

large, statistical samples of objects that can be studied as populations, or as
tracers of larger structures. They can be also used to discover or generate
samples of rare or unusual objects, and may lead to discoveries of some
previously unknown types. We discuss a general framework of parameter spaces
that can be used for an assessment and comparison of different surveys, and the
strategies for their scientific exploration. As we move into the Petascale
regime, an effective processing and scientific exploitation of such large data
sets and data streams poses many challenges, some of which may be addressed in
the framework of Virtual Observatory and Astroinformatics, with a broader
application of data mining and knowledge discovery technologies.

inductive losses in superconducting resonators at microwave frequencies by use
of mixed-material, lumped element devices. In these devices, ultra-low loss
titanium nitride was progressively replaced with aluminum in the
inter-digitated capacitor and meandered inductor elements. By measuring the
power dependent loss at 50 mK as the Al-TiN fraction in each element is
increased, we find that at low electric field, i.e. in the single photon limit,
the loss is two level system in nature and is correlated with the amount of Al
capacitance rather than the Al inductance. In the high electric field limit,
the remaining loss is linearly related to the product of the Al area times its
inductance and is likely due to quasiparticles generated by stray radiation. At
elevated temperature, additional loss is correlated with the amount of Al in
the inductance, with a power independent TiN-Al interface loss term that
exponentially decreases as the temperature is reduced. The TiN-Al interface
loss is vanishingly small at the 50 mK base temperature.

This relative dearth of events with low photon number prompted a study of the

power-law with an exponent of -1.8 $\pm $ 0.3 for the differential

the number of lower energy photons detected by the GBM and the number observed

understanding the mechanisms that trigger active galactic nuclei (AGN) are
imperative to understanding galaxy evolution and the formation of massive
galaxies. It is observationally difficult to determine the trigger of a given
AGN due to the difference between the AGN lifetime and triggering timescales.
Here, we utilize AGN population synthesis modeling to determine the importance
of different AGN triggering mechanisms. An AGN population model is computed by
combining an observationally motivated AGN triggering rate and a theoretical
AGN light curve. The free parameters of the AGN light curve are constrained by
minimizing a \chi squared test with respect to the observed AGN hard X-ray
luminosity function. The observed black hole space density, AGN number counts,
and X-ray background spectrum are also considered as observational constraints.
It is found that major mergers are not able to account for the entire AGN
population. Therefore, non-merger processes, such as secular mechanisms, must
also trigger AGN. Indeed, non-merger processes are the dominant AGN triggering
mechanism at z \lesssim 1--1.5. Furthermore, the shape and evolution of the
black hole mass function of AGN triggered by major mergers is intrinsically
different from the shape and evolution of the black hole mass function of AGN
triggered by secular processes.

bilinear random effect models (matrix factorization) provide state-of-the-art

additional challenges that we carefully study in this paper. Data in many
applications usually consist of users' implicit response that are often binary

combined with other measures to calculate utilities to rank items at runtime of
the recommender systems. Because of the implicit nature, such data are usually
much larger than explicit rating data and often have an imbalanced distribution
with a small fraction of click events, making accurate click rate prediction
difficult. In this paper, we address two problems. First, we show previous

especially for imbalanced response. Second, we develop a parallel bilinear

multiple snapshots of an evolving complex network that can help uncover how
dense clusters in a network emerge, combine, split and decay with time. Current
methods for finding communities in a single snapshot are not straightforwardly
generalizable to finding temporal communities since the quality functions used
for finding static communities have highly degenerate landscapes, and the
eventual partition chosen among the many partitions of similar quality is
highly sensitive to small changes in the network. To reliably detect temporal
communities we need not only to find a good community partition in a given
snapshot but also ensure that it bears some similarity to the partition(s)
found in immediately preceding snapshots. We present a new measure of partition
distance called ""estrangement"" motivated by the inertia of inter-node
relationships which, when incorporated into the measurement of partition
quality, facilitates the detection of meaningful temporal communities.
Specifically, we propose the estrangement confinement method, which postulates
that neighboring nodes in a community prefer to continue to share community
affiliation as the network evolves. Constraining estrangement enables us to
find meaningful temporal communities at various degrees of temporal smoothness
in diverse real-world datasets. Specifically, we study the evolution of voting
behavior of senators in the United States Congress, the evolution of proximity
in human mobility datasets, and the detection of evolving communities in
synthetic networks that are otherwise hard to find. Estrangement confinement
thus provides a principled approach to uncovering temporal communities in
evolving networks.

operations per pixel, where \sigma_s is the (effective) width of the spatial
kernel. A fast implementation of the bilateral filter was recently proposed in
[2] that required O(1) operations per pixel with respect to \sigma_s. This was
done by using trigonometric functions for the range kernel of the bilateral
filter, and by exploiting their so-called shiftability property. In particular,
a fast implementation of the Gaussian bilateral filter was realized by
approximating the Gaussian range kernel using raised cosines. Later, it was
demonstrated in [3] that this idea could be extended to a larger class of
filters, including the popular non-local means filter [4]. As already observed
in [2], a flip side of this approach was that the run time depended on the
width \sigma_r of the range kernel. For an image with (local) intensity
variations in the range [0,T], the run time scaled as O(T^2/\sigma^2_r) with
\sigma_r. This made it difficult to implement narrow range kernels,
particularly for images with large dynamic range. We discuss this problem in
this note, and propose some simple steps to accelerate the implementation in
general, and for small \sigma_r in particular.

structures that are representative of quasi-two dimensional behavior of the
flow. It is known that when energy is injected into the fluid at an
intermediate scale $L_f$, it cascades towards smaller as well as larger scales.
In this paper we analyze the flow in the \textit{inverse cascade} range at a
small but fixed Rossby number, {$\mathcal{R}o_f \approx 0.05$}. Several
{numerical simulations with} helical and non-helical forcing functions are
considered in periodic boxes with unit aspect ratio. In order to resolve the
inverse cascade range with {reasonably} large Reynolds number, the analysis is
based on large eddy simulations which include the effect of helicity on eddy
viscosity and eddy noise. Thus, we model the small scales and resolve
explicitly the large scales. We show that the large-scale energy spectrum has
at least two solutions: one that is consistent with
Kolmogorov-Kraichnan-Batchelor-Leith phenomenology for the inverse cascade of
energy in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence with a {$\sim k_{\perp}^{-5/3}$}
scaling, and the other that corresponds to a steeper {$\sim k_{\perp}^{-3}$}
spectrum in which the three-dimensional (3D) modes release a substantial
fraction of their energy per unit time to 2D modes. {The spectrum that} emerges
{depends on} the anisotropy of the forcing function{,} the former solution
prevailing for forcings in which more energy is injected into 2D modes while
the latter prevails for isotropic forcing. {In the case of anisotropic forcing,
whence the energy} goes from the 2D to the 3D modes at low wavenumbers,
large-scale shear is created resulting in another time scale $\tau_{sh}$,
associated with shear, {thereby producing} a $\sim k^{-1}$ spectrum for the
{total energy} with the 2D modes still following a {$\sim k_{\perp}^{-5/3}$}
scaling.

rate of $\sigma \circ f$ (as measured by the modulus of the second largest

cannot improve the mixing rate of $f$, but typically makes it worse. Under some
mild assumptions on $m$ and $N$, we obtain a precise value for the worst mixing

Combinations of boundary polytopes without a valid intersection in the closure

without neighboring probe points are eliminated. 216 boundary polytopes are
found: 15 5-D boundary polytopes of the full G6 Niggli cone, 53 4-D boundary

parametrically incorrect in the case of chiral perturbation theory, and is
probably theoretically incorrect in general. In the chiral theory, we explore
perturbative unitarity violation as a function of the number of colors and the
number of flavors, holding the scale of the ""new physics"" (i.e. QCD) fixed.
This demonstrates that the onset of new physics is parametrically uncorrelated
with tree-unitarity violation. When the latter scale is lower than that of new
physics, the effective theory must heal its unitarity violation itself, which
is expected because the field theory satisfies the requirements of unitarity.
In the chiral theory, the self-healing results in a resonant structure with
scalar quantum numbers. In the electroweak variant of this argument, the
structure must have the properties of the Higgs and must couple proportional to
the mass in both gauge boson and fermion scattering. A similar example can be
seen in the case of general relativity coupled to multiple matter fields, where
iteration of the vacuum polarization diagram restores unitarity. We present
arguments that suggest the correct identification should be connected to the
onset of inelasticity rather than unitarity violation. We describe how the
onset of inelasticity can occur in the effective theory, although it does not
appear possible to predict the onset reliably.

the results from axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the
wind formed near the disk-magnetosphere boundary of classical T Tauri stars
(CTTSs). We extend the previous outflow models of `the conical-shell wind' by
Romanova et al. to include a well defined magnetospheric accretion funnel flow
which is essential for modelling the optical and near-infrared hydrogen and
helium lines of CTTSs. The MHD model with an intermediate mass-accretion rate
shows outflows in conical-shell shape with a half opening angle about 35
degrees. The flow properties such as the maximum outflow speed in the
conical-shell wind, maximum inflow speed in the accretion funnel,
mass-accretion and mass-loss rates are comparable to those found in a typical
CTTS. The density, velocity and modified temperature from the MHD simulations
are used in a separate radiative transfer model to predict the line profiles
and test the consistency of the MHD models with observations. The line profiles
are computed with various combinations of X-ray luminosities, temperatures of
X-ray emitting plasma, and inclination angles. A rich diversity of line profile
morphology is found, and many of the model profiles are very similar to those
found in observations. We find that the conical-shell wind may contribute to
the emission in some hydrogen lines (e.g. H-alpha, H-beta, Pa-beta and
Pa-gamma) significantly when the temperature in the wind is relatively high
(e.g. \sim 10^{4} K); however, the wind contribution decreases rapidly when a
lower wind temperature is adopted. The model well reproduces a relatively
narrow and low-velocity blueshifted absorption component in He I (10830), which
are often seen in observations.

depends on his type (possibly multidimensional) and on the strategy profile and
where players' types are distributed independently. We show that if their full
information version for any fixed instance of the type profile is a smooth game
then the Price of Anarchy bound implied by the smoothness property, carries
over to the Bayes-Nash Price of Anarchy. We show how some proofs from the
literature (item bidding auctions, greedy auctions) can be cast as smoothness
proofs or be simplified using smoothness. For first price item bidding with
fractionally subadditive bidders we actually manage to improve by much the
existing result \cite{Hassidim2011a} from 4 to $\frac{e}{e-1}\approx 1.58$.
This also shows a very interesting separation between first and second price
item bidding since second price item bidding has PoA at least 2 even under
complete information. For a larger class of Bayesian Games where the strategy
space of a player also changes with his type we are able to show that a
slightly stronger definition of smoothness also implies a Bayes-Nash PoA bound.
We show how weighted congestion games actually satisfy this stronger definition
of smoothness. This allows us to show that the inefficiency bounds of weighted
congestion games known in the literature carry over to incomplete versions
where the weights of the players are private information. We also show how an
incomplete version of a natural class of monotone valid utility games, called
effort market games are universally $(1,1)$-smooth. Hence, we show that
incomplete versions of effort market games where the abilities of the players
and their budgets are private information has Bayes-Nash PoA at most 2.

on spherical caps centered at $\boldsymbol{z}$ of height $t$, which reduce to
an integral over indicator functions of spherical caps as studied in [J.

  We show that the reproducing kernel is a sum of a Kamp{\'e} de F{\'e}riet

arguments of the kernel raised to the power of $2\beta -1$ if $2\beta - 1$ is
not an even integer; otherwise the logarithm of the distance
$\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{y}\|$ appears. For $\beta \in \mathbb{N}$ the
Kamp\'e de F\'eriet function reduces to a polynomial, giving a simple closed

  Using this space we can generalize Stolarsky's invariance principle to
arbitrary smoothness. Previously, Warnock's formula, which is the analogue to
Stolarsky's invariance principle for the unit cube $[0,1]^s$, has been

stable due to what is generically known as non-renormalization theorems. As a
result, all (equilibrium) dynamical models are divided into three major
categories: Markovian models with unbroken Q-symmetry, chaotic models with
Q-symmetry spontaneously broken on the mean-field level by, e.g., fractal
invariant sets (e.g., strange attractors), and intermittent or self-organized
critical (SOC) models with Q-symmetry dynamically broken by the condensation of
instanton-antiinstanton configurations (earthquakes, avalanches etc.) SOC is a
full-dimensional phase separating chaos and Markovian dynamics. In the
deterministic limit, however, antiinstantons disappear and SOC collapses into
the ""edge of chaos"". Goldstone theorem stands behind spatio-temporal
self-similarity of Q-broken phases known under such names as algebraic
statistics of avalanches, 1/f noise, sensitivity to initial conditions etc.
Other fundamental differences of Q-broken phases is that they can be
effectively viewed as quantum dynamics and that they must also have
time-reversal symmetry spontaneously broken. Q-symmetry breaking in
non-equilibrium situations (quenches, Barkhausen effect, etc.) is also briefly
discussed.

Scattering on random inhomogeneity of the waveguide leads to wave chaos. Chaos
reveals itself in spectral properties of the finite-range evolution operator
(FREO). FREO describes transformation of a wavefield in course of propagation
along a finite segment of a waveguide. We study transition to chaos by tracking
variations in spectral statistics with increasing length of the segment.
Analysis of the FREO is accompanied with ray calculations using the one-step
Poincar\'e map which is the classical counterpart of the FREO. Underwater sound
channel in the Sea of Japan is taken for an example. Several methods of
spectral analysis are utilized. In particular, we approximate level spacing
statistics by means of the Berry-Robnik and Brody distributions, explore the
spectrum using the procedure elaborated by A. Relano with coworkers (Relano et
al, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2002; Relano, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2008), and analyze modal
expansions of the eigenfunctions. We show that the analysis of FREO
eigenfunctions is more informative than the analysis of eigenvalue statistics.
It is found that near-axial sound propagation in the Sea of Japan preserves
stability even over distances of hundreds kilometers. This phenomenon is
associated with the presence of a shearless torus in the classical phase space.
Increasing of acoustic wavelength degrades scattering, resulting in recovery of
localization near periodic orbits of the one-step Poincar\'e map. Relying upon
the formal analogy between wave and quantum chaos, we suggest that the concept
of FREO, supported by classical calculations via the one-step Poincar\'e map,
can be efficiently applied for studying chaos-induced decoherence in quantum
systems.

these resonances is revealed by the frequency-resolved induced charge densities
present on a real-space grid. For long double chains, the excitation is similar
to that in long single atomic chains, showing longitudinal modes, end and
central transverse modes. However, for 2-D planes consisting of ($n \times n$)
atoms with $n$ up to 16, new 2-D characteristic modes emerge regardless of the
symmetries considered. For a kick parallel to the plane, besides the equivalent
end mode, mixed modes with contrary polarity occur, while for an impulse
perpendicular to the plane there will be corner, side center, bulk center, and

finite statistical mixtures of exponential families such as Gaussian mixture
models. Mixture models are traditionally learned using the
expectation-maximization (EM) soft clustering technique that monotonically
increases the incomplete (expected complete) likelihood. Given prescribed
mixture weights, the hard clustering $k$-MLE algorithm iteratively assigns data
to the most likely weighted component and update the component models using
Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs). Using the duality between exponential
families and Bregman divergences, we prove that the local convergence of the
complete likelihood of $k$-MLE follows directly from the convergence of a dual
additively weighted Bregman hard clustering. The inner loop of $k$-MLE can be
implemented using any $k$-means heuristic like the celebrated Lloyd's batched
or Hartigan's greedy swap updates. We then show how to update the mixture
weights by minimizing a cross-entropy criterion that implies to update weights
by taking the relative proportion of cluster points, and reiterate the mixture
parameter update and mixture weight update processes until convergence. Hard EM
is interpreted as a special case of $k$-MLE when both the component update and
the weight update are performed successively in the inner loop. To initialize
$k$-MLE, we propose $k$-MLE++, a careful initialization of $k$-MLE guaranteeing
probabilistically a global bound on the best possible complete likelihood.

Kato in the homogeneous incompressible case. Kato proved that if the energy
dissipation rate of the viscous flow in a boundary layer of width proportional
to the viscosity vanishes then the solutions of the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations converge to some solutions of the incompressible Euler
equations in the energy space. We provide here a natural extension of this
result to the compressible case. The other case is the Navier condition which
encodes that the fluid slips with some friction on the boundary. In this case
we show that the convergence to the Euler equations holds true in the energy
space, as least when the friction is not too large. In both cases we use in a
crucial way some relative energy estimates proved recently by Feireisl, Ja Jin

observations of VY CMa with spectral resolutions of 35 and 1500 using the AMBER
instrument at the VLTI. The visibility data indicate the presence of molecular
layers of water vapor and CO in the extended atmosphere with an asymmetric
morphology. The uniform disk diameter in the water band around 2.0 mu is
increased by \sim20% compared to the near-continuum bandpass at 2.20-2.25 mu
and in the CO band at 2.3-2.5 mu it is increased by up to \sim50%. The closure
phases indicate relatively small deviations from point symmetry close to the
photospheric layer, and stronger deviations in the extended H2O and CO layers.
Making use of the high spatial and spectral resolution, a near-continuum
bandpass can be isolated from contamination by molecular and dusty layers, and
the Rosseland-mean photospheric angular diameter is estimated to 11.3 +/- 0.3
mas based on a PHOENIX atmosphere model. Together with recent high-precision
estimates of the distance and spectro-photometry, this estimate corresponds to
a radius of 1420 +/- 120 Rsun and an effective temperature of 3490 +/- 90 K. VY
CMa exhibits asymmetric, possibly clumpy, atmospheric layers of H2O and CO,
which are not co-spatial, within a larger elongated dusty envelope. Our revised
fundamental parameters put VY CMa close to the Hayashi limit of recent
evolutionary tracks of initial mass 25 Msun with rotation or 32 Msun without
rotation, shortly before evolving blueward in the HR-diagram.

application services. In parallel, research in academia has been investigating
transversal aspects such as security, software frameworks, quality of service,

brokers, on behalf of end users, are in charge of selecting and composing the
services advertised by different Cloud vendors. In order to make this happen,
existing solutions and technologies have to be redesigned and extended from a
market-oriented perspective and integrated together, giving rise to what we
term Market-Oriented Cloud Computing.
  In this paper, we will assess the current status of Cloud computing by
providing a reference model, discuss the challenges that researchers and IT
practitioners are facing and will encounter in the near future, and present the
approach for solving them from the perspective of the Cloudbus toolkit, which
comprises of a set of technologies geared towards the realization of Market

21 cm observations. We consider multi-frequency interferometer observations. We
assume that the 21 cm signals in different frequency channels are uncorrelated
and the foreground signals change slowly as a function of frequency. When we
add the visibilities of all channels, the foreground signals increase roughly
by a factor of ~N because they are highly correlated. However, the 21 cm
signals increase by a factor of ~\sqrt{N} because the signals in different
channels contribute randomly. This enables us to obtain an accurate shape of
the foreground angular power spectrum. Then, we obtain the 21-cm power spectrum
by subtracting the foreground power spectrum obtained this way. We describe how
to obtain the average power spectrum of the 21 cm signal.

as an impurity or a non-adiabatic contact is studied theoretically. New regime
of conduction in correlated 1D systems is predicted beyond the well-known
regime of tunneling resulting in the power-law I-V-curves. In this regime a
quantum wire becomes ""opened"" at voltage biases above the threshold value
$V_T$, giving rise to a rapid increase of the dc current, $\bar I$, accompanied
by ac oscillations of frequency $f = \bar I/e$. The effect of ac generation is
related to sliding of the Friedel oscillations of electronic density produced
by the defect. Manifestations of the effect resemble the Coulomb blockade and
the Josephson effect. The spin bias applied to the system is shown to affect
the I-V curves due to violation of the spin-charge separation at the defect
site. In short quantum wires of length $L < L_0 \sim \hbar v_F/eV_T$ and at
high temperatures $T > T_0 \sim eV_T/k_B$ the effect is destroyed by
fluctuations. The threshold voltage $V_T$ is determined by $2k_F$-component of
impurity potential renormalized by fluctuations. The 1D conductor is described
in terms of the Tomonaga-Luttinger Hamiltonian with short range or long-range
Coulomb interaction by means of the bosonization technique. We derive boundary
conditions that take into account relaxation in the leads and permit to solve
non-equilibrium problems. Charge fluctuations are studied by means of Gaussian
model which can be justified strictly in the limit of large voltages or strong
enough inter-electronic repulsion. Spin fluctuations are taken into account
strictly by means of the refermionization technique applicable in case of
spin-rotation invariant interaction.

some collective field. Usually, many different collective fields with
appropriate tensor properties are candidates for a metric. Which collective
field describes the ""physical geometry""? We resolve this ""metric ambiguity"" by
an investigation of the most general form of the quantum effective action for
several metrics. In the long-distance limit the physical metric is universal
and accounts for a massless graviton. Other degrees of freedom contained in the
various metric candidates describe very massive scalars and symmetric second
rank tensors. They only play a role at microscopic distances, typically around
the Planck length. The universality of geometry at long distances extends to
the vierbein and the connection. On the other hand, for distances and time
intervals of Planck size geometry looses its universal meaning. Time is born
with the big bang.

quantum computation for them such that the client's input, output and
computation remain private. A desirable property for any BQC protocol is
verification, whereby the client can verify with high probability whether the
server has followed the instructions of the protocol, or if there has been some
deviation resulting in a corrupted output state. A verifiable BQC protocol can
be viewed as an interactive proof system leading to consequences for complexity
theory. The authors, together with Broadbent, previously proposed a universal
and unconditionally secure BQC scheme where the client only needs to be able to
prepare single qubits in separable states randomly chosen from a finite set and
send them to the server, who has the balance of the required quantum
computational resources. In this paper we extend that protocol with new
functionality allowing blind computational basis measurements, which we use to
construct a new verifiable BQC protocol based on a new class of resource
states. We rigorously prove that the probability of failing to detect an
incorrect output is exponentially small in a security parameter, while resource
overhead remains polynomial in this parameter. The new resource state allows
entangling gates to be performed between arbitrary pairs of logical qubits with
only constant overhead. This is a significant improvement on the original
scheme, which required that all computations to be performed must first be put
into a nearest neighbour form, incurring linear overhead in the number of
qubits. Such an improvement has important consequences for efficiency and
fault-tolerance thresholds.

using weak Hamiltonian and nuclear properties of initial and excited states are

  Aims. Our goal is to analyse and interpret the pulsational behaviour of the
B3 IV star HD 43317 using the CoRoT light curve along with the ground-based
spectroscopy gathered by the Harps instrument. This way we continue our efforts
to map the Beta Cep and SPB instability strips.
  Methods. We used different techniques to reveal the abundances and
fundamental stellar parameters from the newly-obtained high-resolution spectra.
We used various time-series analysis tools to explore the nature of variations
present in the light curve. We calculated the moments and used the
pixel-by-pixel method to look for line profile variations in the
high-resolution spectra.
  Results. We find that HD 43317 is a single fast rotator (v_rot ~ 50% v_crit)
and hybrid SPB/Beta Cep-type pulsator with Solar metal abundances. We interpret
the variations in photometry and spectroscopy as a result of rotational
modulation connected to surface inhomogeneities, combined with the presence of
both g and p mode pulsations. We detect a series of ten consecutive frequencies
with an almost constant period spacing of 6339 s as well as a second shorter
sequence consisting of seven frequencies with a spacing of 6380 s. The dominant
frequencies fall in the regime of gravito-inertial modes.

One of the reasons is the complex crystal structure of most of these materials.
An exception are the infinite layer (IL) compounds consisting essentially of
CuO2 planes. Unfortunately, these materials are difficult to grow and, thus,
there are only few experimental investigations. Recently, we succeeded in
depositing high quality films of the electron doped IL compound Sr1-xLaxCuO2

boundary Josephson junctions (GBJs) based on such SLCO films. Here we report on

fluctuations whose distributions cannot explicitly depend on position otherwise
vacuum's small-scale quantum structure would fail to be statistically
homogeneous. Since the collection of fluctuations is a many-body system, the
natural explanation for their position-independent statistics is that they are
in equilibrium with each other and distributed at maximum entropy.
Consequently, their probability distributions obey the laws of statistical
physics which enforces small-scale smoothness, prevents the
homogeneity-violating diffusion found in any free quantum system, and maintains
decoherence. Their entropy, calculated using the explicitly-constructed phase
space of the Riemann whose statistics are derived using a
background-independent graviton exchange ensemble, is proportional to the
Einstein-Hilbert action evaluated on the macroscopic expected geometry and
includes a small, positive cosmological constant. Entropy maximization yields
quantum spacetime's Ehrenfest equations of motion which are identical to
Einstein's expectation-valued field equations. This background-independent
dynamical formulation reveals curvature fluctuation entropy as a source of
expansion and raises the possibility that matter's zero-point energy problem,
which is action-based and not energy shift invariant, may not be a problem
after all.

make predictions concerning the WR populations and the frequency of different

good fits to the following features: solar luminosity and radius at the solar
age, main-sequence width, red-giant and red-supergiant (RSG) positions in the
HRD, surface abundances, and rotational velocities. Rotating stellar models
predict that about half of the observed WR stars and at least half of the type
Ibc SNe may be produced through the single-star evolution channel. Rotation
increases the duration of the WNL and WNC phases, while reducing those of the
WNE and WC phases, as was already shown in previous works. Rotation increases
the frequency of type Ic SNe. The upper mass limit for type II-P SNe is \sim
19.0 MSun for the non rotating models and \sim 16.8 MSun for the rotating ones.
Both values agree with observations. Moreover, present rotating models provide
a very good fit to the progenitor of SN 2008ax. We discuss future directions of
research for further improving the agreement between the models and the
observations. We conclude that the mass-loss rates in the WNL and RSG phases
are probably underestimated at present. We show that up to an initial mass of
40 M\odot, a surface magnetic field inferior to about 200 G may be sufficient
to produce some braking. Much lower values are needed at the red supergiant
stage. We suggest that the presence/absence of any magnetic braking effect may
play a key role in questions regarding rotation rates of young pulsars and the

it completely autonomous. Each positron and electron of the air shower is

the radio emission is mainly due to the time derivative of the transverse

to go beyond this limitation. We perform N-body and hydrodynamical simulations
within a sufficiently large cosmological volume to allow a direct connection
between simulations and linear spectra. While covering large length-scales, the
simulation resolution is good enough to allow us to explore the high-l
harmonics of the cosmic shear (up to l ~ 50000), well into the domain where
baryon physics becomes important. We then compare shear spectra in the absence
and in presence of various kinds of baryon physics, such as radiative cooling,
star formation, and supernova feedback in the form of galactic winds. We
distinguish several typical properties of matter fluctuation spectra in the
different simulations and test their impact on shear spectra. We compare our
outputs with those obtainable using approximate expressions for non--linear
spectra, and identify substantial discrepancies even between our results and
those of purely N-body results. Our simulations and the treatment of their
outputs however enable us, for the first time, to obtain shear results taht are

down the ASR output text into several word-tokens that are submitted as search

otherwise, no correction is performed and the algorithm continues with the next

The properties of dust grains, in particular their size
distribution, are expected to differ from the interstellar medium to the
high-density regions within molecular clouds. Since the extinction at
near-infrared wavelengths is caused by dust, the extinction law in cores should
depart from that found in low-density environments if the dust grains have
different properties. Aims. We explore methods to measure the near-infrared
extinction law produced by dense material in molecular cloud cores from
photometric data. Methods. Using controlled sets of synthetic and
semi-synthetic data, we test several methods for linear regression applied to
the specific problem of deriving the extinction law from photometric data. We
cover the parameter space appropriate to this type of observations. Results. We
find that many of the common linear-regression methods produce biased results
when applied to the extinction law from photometric colors. We propose and
validate a new method, LinES, as the most reliable for this effect. We explore
the use of this method to detect whether or not the extinction law of a given
reddened population has a break at some value of extinction.

an ultracompact HII region associated with a young B2 zero-age main sequence

that seems squeezed in between the cavity and a collimated outflow associated
with an intermediate-mass protostar. We have identified 5 millimeter continuum
condensations in the filament. All of them show column densities consistent
with potentially being the birthplace of intermediate- to high-mass objects.
These cores appear different from those observed in low-mass clustered
environments in sereval observational aspects (kinematics, temperature,
chemical gradients), indicating a strong influence of the most massive and
evolved members of the protocluster. We suggest a possible scenario in which
the B2 ZAMS star driving the cavity has compressed the surrounding gas,
perturbed its properties and induced the star formation in its immediate

organizations have been investing in Information Technology to automate their
internal processes to cut costs and efficiently support their business

Likewise, IT systems constantly evolves as developers make new versions of
them, which require endless administrative manual work to customize and
configure them, especially if they are being used in different contexts, by
different types of users, and for different requirements. Autonomic computing
was conceived to provide an answer to these ever-changing requirements.
Essentially, autonomic systems are self-configuring, self-healing,
self-optimizing, and self-protecting; hence, they can automate all complex IT
processes without human intervention. This paper proposes an autonomic model
based on Venn diagram and set theory for self-configuring C#.NET applications,
namely the self-customization of their GUI, event-handlers, and security
permissions. The proposed model does not require altering the source-code of
the original application; rather, it uses an XML-based customization file to
turn on and off the internal attributes of the application. Experiments
conducted on the proposed model, showed a successful automatic customization
for C# applications and an effective self-adaption based on dynamic business
requirements. As future work, other programming languages such as Java and C++
are to be supported, in addition to other operating systems such as Linux and
Mac so as to provide a standard platform-independent autonomic self-configuring
model.

another type of computational problem whose purpose is to recognize human
spoken speech and convert it into text that can be processed by a computer.
Despite that ASR has many versatile and pervasive real-world applications,it is
still relatively erroneous and not perfectly solved as it is prone to produce

operating in a noisy environment, its vocabulary size is limited, and its input
speech is of bad or low quality. This paper proposes a post-editing ASR error
correction method based on MicrosoftN-Gram dataset for detecting and correcting
spelling errors generated by ASR systems. The proposed method comprises an
error detection algorithm for detecting word errors; a candidate corrections
generation algorithm for generating correction suggestions for the detected
word errors; and a context-sensitive error correction algorithm for selecting
the best candidate for correction. The virtue of using the Microsoft N-Gram
dataset is that it contains real-world data and word sequences extracted from

by different speakers, showed a remarkable reduction in ASR errors. Future
research can improve upon the proposed algorithm so much so that it can be

moving in opposite directions spontaneously segregate into lanes of uniform
walking directions. This phenomenon is often referred to as a smart collective
pattern, as it increases the traffic efficiency with no need of external
control. However, the functional benefits of this emergent organization have
never been experimentally measured, and the underlying behavioral mechanisms
are poorly understood. In this work, we have studied this phenomenon under
controlled laboratory conditions. We found that the traffic segregation
exhibits structural instabilities characterized by the alternation of organized
and disorganized states, where the lifetime of well-organized clusters of
pedestrians follow a stretched exponential relaxation process. Further analysis
show that the inter-pedestrian variability of comfortable walking speeds is a
key variable at the origin of the observed traffic perturbations. We show that
the collective benefit of the emerging pattern is maximized when all
pedestrians walk at the average speed of the group. In practice, however, local
interactions between slow- and fast-walking pedestrians trigger global
breakdowns of organization, which reduce the collective and the individual
payoff provided by the traffic segregation. This work is a step ahead toward
the understanding of traffic self-organization in crowds, which turns out to be
modulated by complex behavioral mechanisms that do not always maximize the
group's benefits. The quantitative understanding of crowd behaviors opens the
way for designing bottom-up management strategies bound to promote the
emergence of efficient collective behaviors in crowds.

theoretical recombination values after correction for extinction with a single
value of the extinction coefficient C(Hbeta) across the entire wavelength range
from the near-ultraviolet to the NIR and mid-infrared for each of the studied
HII regions. Therefore there are no emission-line regions contributing to the
line emission in the NIR range, which are hidden in the optical range. The
agreement between the extinction-corrected and CLOUDY-predicted fluxes implies
that a HII region model including only stellar photoionisation is able to
account for the observed fluxes, in both the optical and NIR ranges. All
observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can be reproduced quite well
across the whole wavelength range by model SEDs except for Haro 11B, where
there is a continuum flux excess at wavelengths >1.6mum. It is possible that

Our monitoring observations in 2009-2011 revealed the star to show sporadic
flare events, each with brightening of < 0.5 mag lasting for days. These
brightening events, associated with a color change toward the blue, should
originate from an increased accretion activity. Moreover, the star also
underwent a brightness drop of ~1 mag lasting for about a month, during which
the star became bluer when fainter. Such brightness drops seem to have a
recurrence time scale of a year, as evidenced in our data and the photometric
behavior of GM Cep over a century. Between consecutive drops, the star
brightened gradually by about 1 mag and became blue at peak luminosity. We
propose that the drop is caused by obscuration of the central star by an

  the thermodynamic route",,,"10.1063/1.4718367",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The thermodynamic properties of highly charged colloidal suspensions in
contact with a salt reservoir are investigated in the framework of the
Renormalized Jellium Model (RJM). It is found that the equation of state is
very sensitive to the particular thermodynamic route used to obtain it.
Specifically, the osmotic pressure calculated within the RJM using the contact
value theorem can be very different from the pressure calculated using the
Kirkwood-Buff fluctuation relations. On the other hand, Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations show that both the effective pair potentials and the correlation
functions are accurately predicted by the RJM. It is suggested that the lack of
self-consistency in the thermodynamics of the RJM is a result of neglected
electrostatic correlations between the counterions and coions.

Existing experiments based on Fabry-Perot and ring resonators are considered as

Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3-added coals. Ca K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure
(XANES) spectroscopy was applied to determine the forms of Ca in chars prepared
from the pyrolysis of Ca-added coal. Results showed that Ca(OH)2 and CaSO4
existed in both the Ca(OH)2-added chars and the CaCO3-added chars, while CaS
and CaO only existed in the chars prepared from the Ca(OH)2-added coal.
Moreover, it was found that carboxyl Ca was formed during pyrolysis for either
the Ca(OH)2-added coal or the CaCO3-added coals.

of field voles was studied longitudinally, with presence or absence of six
different parasites measured repeatedly. Although trapping sessions were
regular, a different set of voles was caught at each session leading to
incomplete profiles for all subjects. We use a discrete-time hidden Markov
model for each disease with transition probabilities dependent on covariates
via a set of logistic regressions. For each disease the hidden states for each
of the other diseases at a given time point form part of the covariate set for
the Markov transition probabilities from that time point. This allows us to
gauge the influence of each parasite species on the transition probabilities
for each of the other parasite species. Inference is performed via a Gibbs
sampler, which cycles through each of the diseases, first using an adaptive
Metropolis-Hastings step to sample from the conditional posterior of the
covariate parameters for that particular disease given the hidden states for
all other diseases and then sampling from the hidden states for that disease
given the parameters. We find evidence for interactions between several pairs
of parasites and of an acquired immune response for two of the parasites.

  cascade?","8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Journal of Fluid Mechanics",,,,"physics.flu-dyn astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Turbulence is defined as an eddy-like state of fluid motion where the
inertial-vortex forces of the eddies are larger than any other forces that tend
to damp the eddies out. By this definition, turbulence always cascades from
small scales (where the vorticity is created) to larger scales (where other
forces dominate and the turbulence fossilizes). Fossil turbulence is any
perturbation in a hydrophysical field produced by turbulence that persists
after the fluid is no longer turbulent at the scale of the perturbation. Fossil
turbulence patterns and fossil turbulence waves preserve and propagate
information about previous turbulence to larger and smaller length scales. Big
bang fossil turbulence patterns are identified in anisotropies of temperature
detected by space telescopes in the cosmic microwave background. Direct
numerical simulations of stratified shear flows and wakes show that turbulence
and fossil turbulence interactions are recognizable and persistent.

establish the relations between octonion basis elements and Gell-Mann \lambda
matrices of SU(3)symmetry on comparing the multiplication tables for Gell-Mann
\lambda matrices of SU(3)symmetry and octonion basis elements. Consequently,
the quantum chromo dynamics (QCD) has been reformulated and it is shown that
the theory of strong interactions could be explained better in terms of
non-associative octonion algebra. Further, the octonion automorphism group
SU(3) has been suitably handled with split basis of octonion algebra showing
that the SU(3)_{C}gauge theory of colored quarks carries two real gauge fields
which are responsible for the existence of two gauge potentials respectively
associated with electric charge and magnetic monopole and supports well the
idea that the colored quarks are dyons.
