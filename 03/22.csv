Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a cosmic magnetic field. This is done in
the context of the {\it Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity}, which
is an alternative geometrical formulation of General Relativity, where gravity
is describe by a spacetime endowed with torsion, rather than curvature, with
the fundamental field variables being tetrads. We calculate the energy enclosed
by a two-surface of constant radius - in particular, the energy enclosed by the
event horizon of the black hole. In this case we find that the magnetic field
has the effect of increasing the gravitational energy as compared to the vacuum
Schwarzschild case. We also compute the energy (i) in the weak magnetic field
limit, (ii) in the limit of vanishing magnetic field, and (iii) in the absence
of the black hole. In all cases our results are consistent with what should be
expected on physical grounds.

star formation histories of a complete sample of visually classified galaxies
from SDSS-DR7 over the redshift range 0.01<z<0.025, covering a stellar mass
interval from 10^9 to 3 x 10^11 Msun. Our sample features the characteristic

We find a clear difference between the age and metallicity distributions of the
stellar populations above and beyond this knee, which suggests a sudden
transition from a constant, highly efficient mode of star formation in
high-mass galaxies, gradually decreasing towards the low-mass end of the
sample. At fixed mass, our early-type sample is more efficient in building up
the stellar content at early times in comparison to the general population of
galaxies, with half of the stars already in place by redshift z~2 for all
masses. The metallicity-age trend in low-mass galaxies is not compatible with
infall of metal-poor gas, suggesting instead an outflow-driven relation.

random variable whose n-th moment vanishes whenever n is not a multiple of k.
First, we consider the combinatorial convolution \ast in the lattices NC of
non-crossing partitions and NC^k of k-divisible non-crossing partitions and
show that convolving k times with the zeta-function in NC is equivalent to
convolving once with the zeta-function in NC^k. Furthermore, when x is
k-divisible, we derive a formula for the free cumulants of x^k in terms of the
free cumulants of x, involving k-divisible non-crossing partitions. Second, we
prove that if a and s are free and s is k-divisible then sps and a are free,
whenever p is any polynomial (on a and s) of degree k - 2 on s. Moreover, we
define a notion of R-diagonal k-tuples and prove similar results. Next, we show
that free multiplicative convolution between a measure concentrated in the
positive real line and a probability measure with k-symmetry is well defined.
Analytic tools to calculate this convolution are developed. Finally, we
concentrate on free additive powers of k-symmetric distributions and prove that
\mu t is a well defined probability measure, for all t > 1. We derive central
limit theorems and Poisson type ones. More generally, we consider freely
infinitely divisible measures and prove that free infinite divisibility is
maintained under the mapping \mu \rightarrow \mu^k . We conclude by focusing on
(k-symmetric) free stable distributions, for which we prove a reproducing
property generalizing the ones known for one sided and real symmetric free
stable laws.

linear regression, with weight of each resonance inversely proportional to its
half-width squared, $(\Gamma/2)^2$. That way we are side-stepping possible
channel-dependent and model-dependent extractions of the resonance parameters
and are able to undertake an error analysis. The method complies to the fact
that the pole position of the resonance is typically shifted from
channel-dependent extractions by $\sim\Gamma/2$. This is also a feature of the
large-$N_c$ limit of QCD, where the masses change by $ \Gamma/2$ when evolving
from $N_c=3$ to $N_c=\infty$. Our value for the slope of the radial Regge
trajectories is $a=1.35(4) GeV^2$. We discuss the fundamental issue whether the
masses of the light-quark non-strange states fit into a universal pattern
$M_{nJ}^2 = a(n+J) +b$, as suggested by Afonin, and also predicted by some
holographic models. Our joint linear-regression analysis in the $(n,J,M^2)$
Regge planes indicates, at a statistically significant level of 4.5 standard
deviations, that the slopes of the radial Regge trajectories are larger from
the angular-momentum slopes. Thus no strict universality of slopes occurs in

interacting with a single mode of the radiation field is investigated, as the
state of the field is gradually changed from a coherent state to a squeezed
coherent state. The effect of mild squeezing on the coherent light is shown to
be striking: the photon number distribution gets localized and it peaks
maximally for a particular value of squeezing. The atomic inversion retains its
structure for a longer time. The mean linear entropy shows that the atom has a
tendency to get disentangled from field within the collapse region and also in
the revival region, for mild squeezing. These properties are absent for the
case of a coherent state or for an excessively squeezed coherent state. We also
elucidate a connection between these properties and the photon statistics of
the mildly squeezed coherent state; these states have the minimum variance and
are also maximally sub-Poissonian.

discussion on the $5/2^+$ $\Delta$ resonances around 2000 MeV, where we suggest
that the $\Delta(2000)5/2^+$ resonance, which comes in the PDG from averaging a
set of resonances appearing around 1700 MeV and another one around 2200 MeV,
corresponds indeed to two distinct resonances. We also report on a hidden charm
baryon state around 4400 MeV coming from the interaction of vector mesons and
baryons with charm, and how this state has some repercussion in the $J/\psi$
suppression in nuclei. The interaction of $K^*$ in nuclei is also reported and
suggestions are made to measure by means of the transparency ratio the huge
width in the medium that the theoretical calculations predict. The formalism is
extended to $J/\psi$ interaction with nuclei and the transparency ratio for

study the $\bar{K}NN$ system, providing answers within this approximation to

sets and high sequencing error rates of modern sequencers present many new
computational challenges in data interpretation. These challenges have led to
the development of new classes of mapping tools and {\em de novo} assemblers.
These algorithms are challenged by the continued improvement in sequencing
throughput. We here describe digital normalization, a single-pass computational
algorithm that systematizes coverage in shotgun sequencing data sets, thereby
decreasing sampling variation, discarding redundant data, and removing the
majority of errors. Digital normalization substantially reduces the size of
shotgun data sets and decreases the memory and time requirements for {\em de

generated contigs. We apply digital normalization to the assembly of microbial
genomic data, amplified single-cell genomic data, and transcriptomic data. Our
implementation is freely available for use and modification.

  http://www4.ncsu.edu/~tawentwo/kappaSQ_upToDate.zip",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by the least squares solver Blendenpik, we investigate three
strategies for uniform sampling of rows from m x n matrices Q with orthonormal
columns. The goal is to determine, with high probability, how many rows are
required so that the sampled matrices have full rank and are well-conditioned
with respect to inversion.
  Extensive numerical experiments illustrate that the three sampling strategies
(without replacement, with replacement, and Bernoulli sampling) behave almost
identically, for small to moderate amounts of sampling. In particular, sampled
matrices of full rank tend to have two-norm condition numbers of at most 10.
  We derive a bound on the condition number of the sampled matrices in terms of
the coherence {\mu} of Q. This bound applies to all three different sampling
strategies; it implies a, not necessarily tight, lower bound of O(m {\mu}
ln(n)) for the number of sampled rows; and it is realistic and informative even
for matrices of small dimension and the stringent requirement of a 99 percent
success probability.
  For uniform sampling with replacement we derive a potentially tighter
condition number bound in terms of the leverage scores of Q. To obtain a more
easily computable version of this bound, in terms of just the largest leverage
scores, we first derive a general bound on the two-norm of diagonally scaled
matrices.
  To facilitate the numerical experiments and test the tightness of the bounds,
we present algorithms to generate matrices with user-specified coherence and
leverage scores. These algorithms, the three sampling strategies, and a large
variety of condition number bounds are implemented in the Matlab toolbox

noisy or delayed fashion. The problem considered in this paper is to estimate
the first time \tau the random walk reaches a given level. Specifically, the
p-moment (p\geq 1) optimization problem \inf_\eta \ex|\eta-\tau|^p is
investigated where the infimum is taken over the set of stopping times that are
defined on the observation process.
  When there is no drift, optimal stopping rules are characterized for both
types of observations. When there is a drift, upper and lower bounds on
\inf_\eta \ex|\eta-\tau|^p are established for both types of observations. The
bounds are tight in the large-level regime for noisy observations and in the
large-level-large-delay regime for delayed observations. Noteworthy, for noisy
observations there exists an asymptotically optimal stopping rule that is a
function of a single observation.
  Simulation results are provided that corroborate the validity of the results
for non-asymptotic settings.

formation takes place preferentially at high metallicity. In the core accretion
model of planet formation this is expected because heavy elements are needed to
form the dust grains which settle into the midplane of the protoplanetary disk
and coagulate to form the planetesimals from which planetary cores are
assembled. As well, there is observational evidence that the lifetimes of
circumstellar disks are shorter at lower metallicities, likely due to greater
susceptibility to photoevaporation. Here we estimate the minimum metallicity
for planet formation, by comparing the timescale for dust grain growth and
settling to that for disk photoevaporation. For a wide range of circumstellar
disk models and dust grain properties, we find that the critical metallicity
above which planets can form is a function of the distance r at which the
planet orbits its host star. With the iron abundance relative to that of the
Sun [Fe/H] as a proxy for the metallicity, we estimate a lower limit for the
critical abundance for planet formation of [Fe/H]_crit ~ -1.5 + log(r/1 AU),
where an astronomical unit (AU) is the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
This prediction is in agreement with the available observational data, and
carries implications for the properties of the first planets and for the
emergence of life in the early Universe. In particular, it implies that the
first Earth-like planets likely formed from circumstellar disks with
metallicities Z > 0.1 Z_Sun. If planets are found to orbit stars with
metallicities below the critical metallicity, this may be a strong challenge to
the core accretion model.

conducting portion serves as a natural lead that can be used to probe these

superconductor-Luttinger liquid junction. We investigate such junctions between
both helical and spinful Luttinger liquids, and topological as well as
non-topological superconductors. We determine the phase diagram for each case

fixed points describing either perfect normal reflection or perfect Andreev
reflection. In addition to capturing (in some instances) the familiar
Majorana-mediated `zero-bias anomaly' in a new framework, we show that
interactions yield dramatic consequences in certain regimes. Indeed, we
establish that strong repulsion removes this conductance anomaly altogether
while strong attraction produces dynamically generated effective Majorana modes
even in a junction with a trivial superconductor. Interactions further lead to
striking signatures in the local density of states and the line-shape of the
conductance peak at finite voltage, and also are essential for establishing
smoking-gun transport signatures of Majorana fermions in spinful Luttinger

mass 5 - 10 times heavier than the squark masses is automatic and technically
natural, in stark contrast to supersymmetric models with Majorana gaugino
masses. At the LHC, colored sparticle production is suppressed not only by the
absence of gluino pair (or associated) production, but also because several of
the largest squark pair production channels are suppressed or absent. We recast
the null results from the present jets plus missing energy searches at LHC for
supersymmetry onto a supersoft supersymmetric simplified model (SSSM). Assuming
a massless LSP, we find the strongest bounds are: 748 GeV from a 2j + MET

by an embedded giant planet. In this thesis, I discuss the stability of such
systems and explore the consequence of instability on planetary migration. I
begin with non-self-gravitating, low viscosity discs and show that giant
planets induce shocks inside its co-orbital region, leading to a profile
unstable to vortex formation around a potential vorticity minimum. This
instability is commonly known as the vortex or Rossby wave instability.
Vortex-planet interaction lead to episodic phases of migration, which can be
understood in the framework of type III migration. I then examine the effect of
disc self-gravity on gap stability. The linear theory of the Rossby wave
instability is extended to include disc gravity, which shows that self-gravity
is effective at stabilising the vortex instability at small azimuthal
wavenumber. This is consistent with the observation that more vortices develop
with increasing disc mass in hydrodynamic simulations. Vortices in
self-gravitating discs also resist merging, and is most simply understood as
pair-vortices undergoing mutual horsehoe turns upon encounter. I show that in
sufficiently massive discs vortex modes are suppressed. Instead, global spiral
instabilities develop which are associated with a potential vorticity maximum
at the gap edge. These edge modes can be physically understood as a result of
unstable interaction between the gap edge and the exterior disc through
gravity. I show the spiral arms can provide a positive torque on the planet,
leading to fast migration outwards. I confirm the above results, obtained from
razor-thin disc models, persist in three-dimensions.

  operators",,,,,"math.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that the standard projection methods allow one to recover
the whole spectrum of a bounded self-adjoint operator but they often lead to
spectral pollution, i.e. to spurious eigenvalues lying in the gaps of the
essential spectrum. Methods using second order relative spectra are free from
this problem, but they have not been proven to approximate the whole spectrum.
L. Boulton (2006, 2007) has shown that second order relative spectra
approximate all isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. The main result of
the present paper is that second order relative spectra do not in general
approximate the whole of the essential spectrum of a bounded self-adjoint
operator.

the spectra were obtained with the FAST spectrograph at the FLWO 1.5m telescope

SN Ia spectroscopic diversity. We study the spectroscopic and photometric
properties of SN Ia as a function of spectroscopic class using the
classification schemes of Branch et al. and Wang et al. The width-luminosity
relation appears to be steeper for SN Ia with broader lines. Based on the
evolution of the characteristic Si II 6355 line, we propose improved methods
for measuring velocity gradients, revealing a larger range than previously
suspected, from ~0 to ~400 km/s/day considering the instantaneous velocity
decline rate at maximum light. We find a weaker and less significant
correlation between Si II velocity and intrinsic B-V color at maximum light
than reported by Foley et al., owing to a more comprehensive treatment of
uncertainties and host galaxy dust. We study the extent of nuclear burning and
report new detections of C II 6580 in 23 early-time spectra. The frequency of C
II detections is not higher in SN Ia with bluer colors or narrower light
curves, in conflict with the recent results of Thomas et al. Based on nebular
spectra of 27 SN Ia, we find no relation between the FWHM of the iron emission
feature at ~4700 A and Dm15(B) after removing the two low-luminosity SN 1986G
and SN 1991bg, suggesting that the peak luminosity is not strongly dependent on
the kinetic energy of the explosion for most SN Ia. Finally, we confirm the
correlation of velocity shifts in some nebular lines with the intrinsic B-V
color of SN Ia at maximum light, although several outliers suggest a possible
non-monotonic behavior for the largest blueshifts.

Therefore, it is an important test case for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) models,
which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of these
objects. Here, we explore how available and expected future observations of SN
2011fe can be used to constrain SN Ia explosion scenarios. We base our
discussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in a
Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two white
dwarfs-realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the most
widely-discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to SNe Ia. Although
both models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early and
near-maximum spectra of SN 2011fe obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory
(SNfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. The level
of agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum,
but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified.
Observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating the
explosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leads
to differences in the 55Co production. SN 2011fe is close enough to be followed
sufficiently long to study this effect.

implement Congestion Diversity Protocol (CDP) adapted from [3] recognizing the
limitations of BP and E-BP for 802.11-based wireless networks. SRCR solely
utilizes link qualities, while BP relies on queue differential to route
packets. CDP and E-BP rely on distance metrics which take into account queue
backlogs and link qualities in the network. E-BP computes its metric by summing
the ETX and queue differential, while CDP determines its metric by calculating
the least draining time to the destination. Our small testbed consisting of
twelve 802.11g nodes enables us to empirically compare the performance of
congestion-aware routing protocols (BP, E-BP and CDP) against benchmark SRCR.
For medium to high load UDP traffic, we observe that CDP exhibits significant
improvement with respect to both end-end delay and throughput over other
protocols with no loss of performance for TCP traffic. Backpressure-based
routing algorithms (BP and E-BP) show poorer performance for UDP and TCP
traffic. Finally, we carefully study the effects of the modular approach to
congestion-aware routing design in which the MAC layer is left intact

is written in terms of the minima or stationary points (collectively called
solutions) of a gauge-fixing functional. Due to the non-linearity of this
functional, it usually has many solutions called Gribov copies. The dependence
of the number of Gribov copies, n[U] on the different gauge orbits plays an
important role in constructing the Faddeev-Popov procedure and hence in
realising the BRST symmetry on the lattice. Here, we initiate a study of
counting n[U] for different orbits using three complimentary methods: 1.
analytical results in lower dimensions, and some lower bounds on n[U] in higher
dimensions, 2. the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method, which
numerically finds all Gribov copies for a given orbit for small lattices, and
3. numerical minimisation (""brute force""), which finds many distinct Gribov
copies, but not necessarily all. Because n for the coset SU(N_c)/U(1) of an
SU(N_c) theory is orbit-independent, we concentrate on the residual compact
U(1) case in this article and establish that n is orbit-dependent for the
minimal lattice Landau gauge and orbit-independent for the absolute lattice
Landau gauge. We also observe that contrary to a previous claim, n is not

matter (ADM) almost certainly require that the DM be part of a richer hidden

of models of ADM is that the vast majority of the symmetric component of the DM
number density must be removed in order to explain the observed relationship
$\Omega_B\sim\Omega_{DM}$ via the DM asymmetry. Demanding the efficient
annihilation of the symmetric component leads to a tension with experimental
limits if the annihilation is directly to Standard Model (SM) degrees of

is presented. Notably, the limits obtained essentially exclude models of ADM
with mass 1GeV$\lesssim m_{DM} \lesssim$ 100GeV annihilating to SM quarks via
heavy mediator states. This motivates the study of portal interactions between

individual power constraints. In the first part, a unicast scenario is
considered. The problem of finding the maximum achievable rate is formulated as
an optimization problem. Rather than solving this non-concave maximization
problem, we derive upper and lower bounds for the optimal rate. A cut-set like
upper bound is obtained in a closed form for a layered relay network. A
pseudo-optimal AF scheme is developed for a two-hop parallel network, which is
different from the conventional scheme with all amplification gains chosen as
the maximum possible values. The conditions under which either the novel scheme
or the conventional one achieves a rate within half a bit of the upper bound
are found. Then we provide an AF-based multi-hop ANC scheme with the two
schemes for a layered relay network. It is demonstrated that the lower bound of
the optimal rate can asymptotically achieve the upper bound when the network is
in the generalized high-SNR regime. In the second part, the optimal rate region
for a two-hop multiple access channel (MAC) via AF relays is investigated. In a
similar manner, we first derive an outer bound for it and then focus on
designing low complexity AF-based ANC schemes for different scenarios. Several
examples are given and the numerical results indicate that the achievable rate
region of the ANC schemes can perform close to the outer bound.

whether the correlation between $X_i$ and $Y_i$ stays constant for all $i =
1,...,n$. We propose a nonparametric change-point test statistic based on
Kendall's tau and derive its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis
of no change by means a new U-statistic invariance principle for dependent
processes. The asymptotic distribution depends on the long run variance of
Kendall's tau, for which we propose an estimator and show its consistency.
Furthermore, assuming a single change-point, we show that the location of the
change-point is consistently estimated. Kendall's tau possesses a high
efficiency at the normal distribution, as compared to the normal maximum
likelihood estimator, Pearson's moment correlation coefficient. Contrary to
Pearson's correlation coefficient, it has excellent robustness properties and
shows no loss in efficiency at heavy-tailed distributions. We assume the data
$((X_i,Y_i))_{i=1,...,n}$ to be stationary and P-near epoch dependent on an
absolutely regular process. The P-near epoch dependence condition constitutes a
generalization of the usually considered $L_p$-near epoch dependence, $p \ge
1$, that does not require the existence of any moments. It is therefore very
well suited for our objective to efficiently detect changes in correlation for
arbitrarily heavy-tailed data.

data-hiding for security in camera surveillance. While most previous approaches
have focused on completely encrypting the video stream, we introduce a spatial
encryption scheme by blurring the image/video contents to create a CBP. Our
goal is to obscure detail in public video streams by blurring while allowing
behavior to be recognized and to quickly deblur the stream so that details are
available if behavior is recognized as suspicious. We create a CBP by blurring
the same latent image with two unknown kernels. The two kernels are coprime
when mapped to bivariate polynomials in the z domain. To deblur the CBP we
first use the coprime constraint to approximate the kernels and sample the
bivariate CBP polynomials in one dimension on the unit circle. At each sample
point, we factor the 1D polynomial pair and compose the results into a 2D
kernel matrix. Finally, we compute the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of
the kernel matrices to recover the coprime kernels and then the latent video
stream. It is therefore only possible to deblur the video stream if a user has
access to both streams. To improve the practicability of our algorithm, we
implement our algorithm using a graphics processing unit (GPU) to decrypt the
blurred video streams in real-time, and extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our new scheme can effectively protect sensitive identity
information in surveillance videos and faithfully reconstruct the unblurred
video stream when two blurred sequences are available.

distribution function involving both c-number variables (for the cavity mode)
and Grassmann variables (for the two level atom) can be used to treat the
Jaynes-Cummings model. Although it is a Grassmann function, the distribution
function is equivalent to six c-number functions of the two bosonic variables.
Experimental quantities are given as bosonic phase space integrals involving
the six functions. A Fokker-Planck equation involving both left and right
Grassmann differentiation can be obtained for the distribution function, and is
equivalent to six coupled equations for the six c-number functions.
  The approach used involves choosing the canonical form of the (non-unique)
positive P distribution function, where the correspondence rules for bosonic
operators are non-standard and hence the Fokker-Planck equation is also
unusual. Initial conditions, such as for initially uncorrelated states, are
used to determine the initial distribution function. Transformations to new
bosonic variables rotating at the cavity frequency enables the six coupled
equations for the new c-number functions (also equivalent to the canonical
Grassmann distribution function) to be solved analytically, based on an ansatz
from a 1980 paper by Stenholm. It is then shown that the distribution function
is the same as that determined from the well-known solution based on coupled
equations for state vector amplitudes of atomic and n-photon product states.
  The treatment of the simple two fermion mode Jaynes-Cummings model is a
useful test case for the future development of phase space Grassmann
distribution functional methods for multi-mode fermionic applications in

prover-verifier interactions under parallel repetition when quantum information
is allowed, and the verifier acts independently in them.
  We first consider the case in which a value is associated with each of the
possible outcomes of an interaction. We prove that it is not possible for the
prover to improve on the optimum average value per repetition by repeating the
protocol multiple times in parallel.
  We look then at games in which the outcomes are classified into two types,
winning outcomes and losing outcomes. We ask what is the optimal probability
for the prover of winning at least k times out of n parallel repetitions, given
that the optimal probability of winning when only one repetition is considered
is $p$. A reasonable conjecture for the answer would be \sum_{m \geq k} {n
\choose m} p^m (1-p)^{n-m}, as that is the answer when it is optimal for the
prover to act independently. This is known to be the correct answer when k=n,
and also in the classical case. It is also correct in some generalizations of
the classical case that we will discuss later. We will show how this cannot be
extended to all cases, presenting an example of an interaction with k=1,n=2 in
which p\approx 0.85, but it is possible to always win at least once. We will
then give some upper bounds on the optimal probability for the prover of
winning k times out of n parallel repetitions. These bounds are expressed as a
function of p.

pyrochlore lattice possess small magnetic moments that interact with each other
antiferromagnetically but exhibit no long-range order above 0.4 K, probably
owing to the geometrical frustration of the pyrochlore lattice. As a result,
the effective mass of the conduction electrons is considerably enhanced, as
observed in the related pyrochlore-lattice compounds (Y,Sc)Mn2 and LiV2O4.
However, the presence of excess Mn atoms with large localized magnetic moments

thermodynamics, a simple model is presented. In this model, we assume that the
binding of ATP will change the potential of the corresponding enzyme subunit,
and the degree of this change depends on the state of its adjacent subunits.
The probability of enzyme in a given state satisfies the Boltzmann's
distribution. Although it looks much simple, this model can fit the recent
experimental data of chaperonin TRiC/CCT well. From this model, the dominant
state of TRiC/CCT can be obtained. This study provided a new way to understand
biophysical processes by statistical thermodynamics analysis.

imagery from space, above the Earth's atmosphere, has been available. Unlike
other measurements this technique is largely independent of optical distortion.
The true solar radius is still a matter of debate in the literature as measured
differences of several tenths of an arcsecond (i.e., about 500 km) are
apparent. This is due mainly to systematic errors from different instruments
and observers since the claimed uncertainties for a single instrument are
typically an order of magnitude smaller. From the MDI transit data we find the
solar radius to be 960"".12 +/- 0"".09 (696,342 +/- 65 km). This value is
consistent between the transits and consistent between different MDI focus

They are used for
detection and localization of change for the purpose of anomaly detection,

sets such as measurements, snapshots of a system, content, traffic matrices,
and activity logs are collected repeatedly.
  Random sampling, which can be efficiently performed over streamed or
distributed data, is an important tool for scalable data analysis. The sample
constitutes an extremely flexible summary, which naturally supports domain
queries and scalable estimation of statistics, which can be specified after the
sample is generated. The effectiveness of a sample as a summary, however,
hinges on the estimators we have.
  We derive novel estimators for estimating $L_p$ distance from sampled data.
Our estimators apply with the most common weighted sampling schemes: Poisson
Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) and its fixed sample size variants. They
also apply when the samples of different data sets are independent or
coordinated. Our estimators are admissible (Pareto optimal in terms of
variance) and have compelling properties.
  We study the performance of our Manhattan and Euclidean distance ($p=1,2$)
estimators on diverse datasets, demonstrating scalability and accuracy even
when a small fraction of the data is sampled. Our work, for the first time,
facilitates effective distance estimation over sampled data.

competitiveness. Here we give a condition that allows WFA to forget the whole
previous history and restart from scratch without losing competitiveness.
Moreover for most of the metric spaces of practical interest (finite or bounded

being controlled by the aforementioned parameter. EXIT charts are used to shed
light on the convergence characteristics of the associated iterative decoder,

selection methods based on bootstrap for two methodologies: the Cox
proportional hazard model and survival trees. As far as the Cox model is
concerned, we investigate the bootstrapping applied to two variable selection
techniques: the stepwise algorithm based on the AIC criterion and the
L1-penalization of Lasso. Regarding survival trees, we review two
methodologies: the bootstrap node-level stabilization and random survival
forests. We apply these different approaches to two real data sets. We compare
the methods on the prediction error rate based on the Harrell concordance index
and the relevance of the interpretation of the corresponding selected models.
The aim is to find a compromise between a good prediction performance and ease
to interpretation for clinicians. Results suggest that in the case of a small
number of individuals, a bootstrapping adapted to L1-penalization in the Cox
model or a bootstrap node-level stabilization in survival trees give a good
alternative to the random survival forest methodology, known to give the
smallest prediction error rate but difficult to interprete by
non-statisticians. In a clinical perspective, the complementarity between the
methods based on the Cox model and those based on survival trees would permit
to built reliable models easy to interprete by the clinician.

describe the charging energy, the spin-exchange and the interaction in the
Cooper channel. In this paper we concentrate on the exchange interaction and
generalize the functional bosonization formalism developed earlier for the
charging energy. This turned out to be challenging as the effective bosonic
action is formulated in terms of a vector field and is non-abelian due to the
non-commutativity of the spin operators. Here we develop a geometric approach
which is particularly useful in the mesoscopic Stoner regime, i.e., when the
strong exchange interaction renders the system close the the Stoner
instability. We show that it is sufficient to sum over the adiabatic paths of
the bosonic vector field and, for these paths, the crucial role is played by
the Berry phase. Using these results we were able to calculate the magnetic
susceptibility of the dot. The latter, in close vicinity of the Stoner

Instrumental speckles average to a fixed pattern, which can be calibrated to a
certain extent, but their temporal evolution ultimately limit this possibility.
This study focuses on the laboratory evidence and characterization of the
quasi-static pinned speckle phenomenon. Specifically, we examine the coherent
amplification of the static speckle contribution to the noise variance in the
scientific image, through its interaction with quasi-static speckles. The
analysis of a time series of adaptively corrected, coronagraphic images
recorded in the laboratory enables the characterization of the temporal
stability of the residual speckle pattern in both direct and differential
coronagraphic images. We estimate that spoiled and fast-evolving quasi-static
speckles present in the system at the angstrom/nanometer level are affecting
the stability of the static speckle noise in the final image after the
coronagraph. The temporal evolution of the quasi-static wavefront error
exhibits linear power law, which can be used in first order to model

for multiplets where J-state interference plays a significant role. Through
simultaneous observations of all the 3 lines of a Cr I triplet, combined with
realistic radiative transfer modeling of the data, we show that it is necessary
to include J-state interference consistently when modeling lines with partially
interacting fine structure components. Polarized line formation theory that
includes J-state interference effects together with partial frequency
redistribution for a two-term atom is used to model the observations.
Collisional frequency redistribution is also accounted for. We show that the
resonance polarization in the Cr I triplet is strongly affected by the partial
frequency redistribution effects in the line core and near wing peaks. The Cr I
triplet is quite sensitive to the temperature structure of the photospheric
layers. Our complete frequency redistribution calculations in semi-empirical
models of the solar atmosphere cannot reproduce the observed near wing
polarization or the cross-over of the Stokes Q/I line polarization about the
continuum polarization level that is due to the J-state interference. When
however partial frequency redistribution is included, a good fit to these
features can be achieved. Further, to obtain a good fit to the far wings, a
small temperature enhancement of the FALF model in the photospheric layers is
necessary.

structural phase transition temperature $T_S$, antiferromagnetic transition
temperature $T_N$ and internal magnetic field $\mu_0H_{\rm int}$ are gradually
reduced for $x<0.04$. However, at $x=0.04$, $T_N$ is abruptly suppressed to be
30 K along with a tiny $\mu_0H_{\rm int}$, which is distinct from the
continuous disappearance of the ordered phases in the Ba122 systems of
Ba(Fe,Co)$_2$As$_2$ and BaFe$_2$(As,P)$_2$. The anisotropy of the spin-lattice
relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$, $(T_1)^{-1}_{H\parallel ab}/(T_1)^{-1}_{H\parallel
c}$, in the paramagnetic phase of $x = 0$ and 0.025 is constant ($\sim 1.5$),
but increases abruptly below $T_S$ due to the enhancement of
$(T_1)^{-1}_{H\parallel ab}$ by the slowing down of magnetic fluctuations. This
indicates that the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural distortion enhances
the anisotropy in the spin space via magnetoelastic coupling and/or spin-orbit
interaction.

in spatial coincidence with the binary system Eta Carinae. Since modulation of
the observed gamma-ray flux on orbital time scales has not been reported so
far, an unambiguous identification was hitherto not possible. Particularly the
observations made by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) posed additional
questions regarding the actual emission scenario owing to the existence of two
energetically distinct components in the gamma-ray spectrum of this source,
best described by an exponentially cutoff power-law function (CPL) at energies
below 10 GeV and a power-law (PL) component dominant at higher energies. The
increased exposure in conjunction with the improved instrumental response
functions of the LAT now allow us to perform a more detailed investigation of
location, spectral shape, and flux time history of the observed gamma-ray
emission.
  For the first time, we are able to report a weak but regular flux decrease
over time. This can be understood and interpreted in a colliding-wind binary
scenario for orbital modulation of the gamma-ray emission. We find the spectral
shape of the gamma-ray signal in agreement with a single emitting particle
population in combination with significant absorption by gamma-gamma pair
production.
  Studying the correlation of the flux decrease with the orbital separation of
the binary components allows us to predict the behaviour up to the next
periastron passage in 2014.

selection is strongly influenced by the structure of the underlying fitness
landscape, which encodes the interactions between mutations at different
genetic loci. Theoretical studies of such landscapes have been carried out for
several decades, but only recently experimental fitness measurements
encompassing all possible combinations of small sets of mutations have become
available. The empirical studies have spawned new questions about the
accessibility of optimal genotypes under natural selection. Depending on
population dynamic parameters such as mutation rate and population size,
evolutionary accessibility can be quantified through the statistics of
accessible mutational pathways (along which fitness increases monotoncially),
or through the study of the basin of attraction of the optimal genotype under
greedy (steepest ascent) dynamics. Here we investigate these two measures of
accessibility in the framework of Kauffman's $LK$-model, a paradigmatic family
of random fitness landscapes with tunable ruggedness. The key parameter
governing the strength of genetic interactions is the number $K$ of interaction
partners of each of the $L$ sites in the genotype sequence. In general,
accessibility increases with increasing genotype dimensionality $L$ and
decreases with increasing number of interactions $K$. Remarkably, however, we
find that some measures of accessibility behave non-monotonically as a function
of $K$, indicating a special role of the most sparsely connected, non-trivial
cases K=1 and 2. The relation between models for fitness landscapes and spin
glasses is also addressed.

Moran type is our object of study. At each timestep, a pair of diploid
individuals drawn uniformly at random contribute offspring to the population.
The number of offspring can be large relative to the total population size.
Similar `heavily skewed' reproduction mechanisms have been considered by
various authors recently. Each diploid parental individual contributes exactly
one chromosome to each diploid offspring, and hence ancestral lineages can only
coalesce when in distinct individuals. A separation of timescales phenomenon is
thus observed. A result of M\""{o}hle (1998) is extended to obtain convergence
of the ancestral process to an ancestral recombination graph necessarily
admitting simultaneous multiple mergers of ancestral lineages. The usual
ancestral recombination graph is obtained as a special case of our model when
the parents contribute only one offspring to the population each time. Due to
diploidy and large offspring numbers, novel effects appear. For example, the
marginal genealogy at each locus admits simultaneous multiple mergers in up to
four groups, and different loci remain substantially correlated even as the
recombination rate grows large. Thus, genealogies for loci far apart on the
same chromosome remain correlated. Correlation in coalescence times for two
loci is derived and shown to be a function of the coalescence parameters of our
model. Extending the observations by Eldon and Wakeley (2008), predictions of
linkage disequilibrium are shown to be functions of the reproduction parameters
of our model, in addition to the recombination rate. Correlations in ratios of
coalescence times between loci can be high, even when the recombination rate is
high and sample size is large.

the same time the space of bundle moduli of the new, twisted bundle is a proper
subspace (where the 'new', non-generic twist class exists) of the original

derive power series expansions to previously intractable problems. In this
method the coefficients at $k$ are determined by summing the contributions made
by each partition whose elements sum to $k$. These contributions are found by
assigning values to each element and multiplying by an appropriate multinomial
factor. This work presents a theoretical framework for the partition method for
a power series expansion. To overcome the complexity due to the contributions,
a programming methodology is created allowing more general problems to be
studied than envisaged originally. The methodology uses the bi-variate
recursive central partition (BRCP) algorithm, which is based on a tree-diagram
approach to scanning partitions. Its main advantage is that partitions are
generated in the multiplicity representation. During the development of the
theoretical framework, scanning over partitions was seen as a discrete
operation with an operator $L_{P,k}[ \cdot]$, whose summand depends on the
coefficients of the two series when the original function is written as a
pseudo-composite function. Simple modifications result in programs for other
operators of specific types of partitions such as: (1) only odd or even
elements, (2) a fixed number of elements, (3) discrete elements, (4) specific
elements and (5) those restricted by element size. Another modification
generates conjugate partitions by transposing Ferrers diagrams. The operator
approach is then applied to the generating functions for both discrete and
standard partitions. The main generalisation introduces a parameter $\omega$,
whose powers give the number of elements in the partitions while the
coefficients become polynomials in $\omega$. Finally, power series expansions
for more advanced infinite products are derived, culminating in Heine's
multi-parameter product.

outer parts of protostellar envelopes and dense inner regions of circumstellar

of circumstellar disks and in regions of powerful outflows and shocks. In this
paper we probe the mechanism regulating the warm gas-phase water abundance in
the innermost hundred AU of deeply embedded (Class~0) low-mass protostars, and
investigate its chemical relationship to other molecular species during these
stages. Millimeter wavelength thermal emission from the para-H2-18O
3(1,3)-2(2,0) (Eu=203.7 K) line is imaged at high angular resolution (0.75"";
190 AU) with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer towards the deeply
embedded low-mass protostars NGC 1333-IRAS2A and NGC 1333-IRAS4A. Compact
H2-18O emission is detected towards IRAS2A and one of the components in the
IRAS4A binary; in addition CH3OCH3, C2H5CN, and SO2 are detected. Extended
water emission is seen towards IRAS2A, possibly associated with the outflow.
The detections in all systems suggests that the presence of water on <100 AU
scales is a common phenomenon in embedded protostars. We present a scenario in
which the origin of the emission from warm water is in a flattened disk-like
structure dominated by inward motions rather than rotation. The gas-phase water
abundance varies between the sources, but is generally much lower than a
canonical abundance of 10^-4, suggesting that most water (>96 %) is frozen out
on dust grains at these scales. The derived abundances of CH3OCH3 and SO2
relative to H2-18O are comparable for all sources pointing towards similar
chemical processes at work. In contrast, the C2H5CN abundance relative to
H2-18O is significantly lower in IRAS2A, which could be due to different
chemistry in the sources.

mountain building. Another key product is the geomagnetic field, generated in
the liquid iron core by a dynamo running on heat released by cooling and
freezing to grow the solid inner core, and on chemical convection due to light
elements expelled from the liquid on freezing. The power supplied to the
geodynamo, measured by the heat-flux across the core-mantle boundary (CMB),
places constraints on Earth's evolution. Estimates of CMB heat-flux depend on
properties of iron mixtures under the extreme pressure and temperature
conditions in the core, most critically on the thermal and electrical
conductivities. These quantities remain poorly known because of inherent
difficulties in experimentation and theory. Here we use density functional
theory to compute these conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core
conditions from first principles- the first directly computed values that do
not rely on estimates based on extrapolations. The mixtures of Fe, O, S, and Si
are taken from earlier work and fit the seismologically-determined core density
and inner-core boundary density jump. We find both conductivities to be 2-3
times higher than estimates in current use. The changes are so large that core
thermal histories and power requirements must be reassessed. New estimates of
adiabatic heat-flux give 15-16 TW at the CMB, higher than present estimates of
CMB heat-flux based on mantle convection; the top of the core must be thermally
stratified and any convection in the upper core driven by chemical convection
against the adverse thermal buoyancy or lateral variations in CMB heat flow.
Power for the geodynamo is greatly restricted and future models of mantle
evolution must incorporate a high CMB heat-flux and explain recent formation of
the inner core.

incommensurate spectra in both samples but discover that in the one that

above $T_c$. Conversely a spin-gap and concomitant spectral weight shift happen
below $T_c$. Our results imply that the hourglass shaped dispersion is most
likely a pre-requisite for superconductivity, whereas the spin-gap and shift of
spectral weight are consequences of superconductivity. We explain this
observation by pointing out that an inwards dispersion towards the commensurate
wave-vector is needed for the opening of a spin gap to lower the magnetic

resolution (8"") over that of the Herschel Space Observatory 350-micron image
(25""). The 870-micron observation (at 20"" resolution) is a repetition of a
similar observation made in 2007. In both images, at 350 and 870 micron,
emission is detected from SN1987A, and the source is unresolved. The flux
densities in the new (2011) measurements are consistent with those measured
before with Herschel at 350 micron (in 2010) and with APEX at 870 micron (in
2007). A higher dust temperature (approximately 33 K) and lower dust mass might
be possible than what was previously thought. The new measurements, at the
highest angular resolution achieved so far at far-IR and sub-mm wavelengths,
strengthen the constraints on the location of the emission, which is thought to
be close to the site of SN1987A and its circumstellar ring structures. These
measurements set the stage for upcoming observations at even higher angular
resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).

given by an estimator and an event-trigger. The event-trigger has full state

alternates between optimizing one player while fixing the other player. It is
shown that the solution of the algorithm converges to a linear predictor and a
symmetric threshold policy, if the densities of the initial state and the noise

ultracompact HII regions (UCHIIRs). Until today, most studies of interstellar
OH involved the molecule's radio wavelength hyperfine structure (hfs)
transitions. These lines are generally not in LTE and either masing or
over-cooling complicates their interpretation. In the past, observations of
transitions between different rotational levels of OH, which are at
far-infrared wavelengths, have suffered from limited spectral and angular
resolution. Since these lines have critical densities many orders of magnitude
higher than the radio wavelength ground state hfs lines and are emitted from
levels with more than 100 K above the ground state, when observed in emission,
they probe very dense and warm material. We probe the warm and dense molecular
material surrounding the UCHIIR/OH maser sources W3(OH), G10.62-0.39 and NGC
7538 IRS1 by studying the $^2\Pi_{{1/2}}, J = {3/2} - {1/2}$ rotational

lines, which are near 1.84 THz ($163 \mu$m) and 2.51 THz ($119.3 \mu$m). We
clearly detect the OH lines, some of which are blended with each other.

dagger-compact closed categories.
  Using this framework, we establish a tight relationship between two key
quantum theoretical notions: non-locality and complementarity. In particular,
we establish a direct connection between Mermin-type non-locality scenarios,
which we generalise to an arbitrary number of parties, using systems of
arbitrary dimension, and performing arbitrary measurements, and a new stronger
notion of complementarity which we introduce here.
  Our derivation of the fact that strong complementarity is a necessary
condition for a Mermin scenario provides a crisp operational interpretation for
strong complementarity. We also provide a complete classification of strongly
complementary observables for quantum theory, something which has not yet been
achieved for ordinary complementarity.
  Since our main results are expressed in the (diagrammatic) language of
dagger-compact categories, they can be applied outside of quantum theory, in
any setting which supports the purely algebraic notion of strongly
complementary observables. We have therefore introduced a method for discussing
non-locality in a wide variety of models in addition to quantum theory.
  The diagrammatic calculus substantially simplifies (and sometimes even
trivialises) many of the derivations, and provides new insights. In particular,
the diagrammatic computation of correlations clearly shows how local
measurements interact to yield a global overall effect. In other words, we
depict non-locality.

to consider estimation of $L(\theta,\varphi(x))$ by an estimator $\delta$,

angle, including radio galaxies and blazars, we find that very high power
sources (L_kin > 10^45.5 erg s^{-1}) show a significant increase in the ratio
of inverse Compton to synchrotron power (Compton dominance) with decreasing
orientation angle, as measured by the radio core dominance and confirmed by the
distribution of superluminal speeds. This increase is consistent with beaming
expectations for external Compton (EC) emission, but not for synchrotron self
Compton (SSC) emission. For the lowest power jets (L_kin < 10^43.5 erg s^{-1}),
no trend between Compton and radio core dominance is found, consistent with
SSC. Importantly, the EC trend is not seen for moderately high power flat
spectrum radio quasars with strong external photon fields. Coupled with the
evidence that jet power is linked to the jet speed (Kharb et al. 2010), this
finding suggests that external photon fields become the dominant source of seed
photons in the jet comoving frame only for the faster and therefore more
powerful jets.

generation (SG), Globular Clusters (GCs) evolution models based on the
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) scenario so far included only the yields
available for the massive AGB stars, while the possible role of super-AGB
ejecta was either extrapolated or not considered. In this work, we explore the
role of super-AGB ejecta using yields recently calculated by Ventura and
D'Antona. Models of clusters showing extended Na-O anticorrelations, like NGC
2808, indicate that a SG formation history similar to that outlined in our
previous work is required: formation of an Extreme population with very large
helium content from the pure ejecta of super-AGB stars, followed by formation
of an Intermediate population by dilution of stellar ejecta with pristine gas.
The very O-poor Na-rich Extreme stars can be accounted for once deep-mixing is
assumed in SG giants forming in a gas with helium abundance Y> 0.34, which
significantly reduces the atmospheric oxygen content, while preserving the
sodium abundance. On the other hand, for clusters showing a mild O-Na
anticorrelation, like M 4, the use of the new yields broadens the range of SG
formation routes leading to abundance patterns consistent with observations. It
is shown that models in which SG stars form only from super-AGB ejecta promptly
diluted with pristine gas can reproduce the observations. We discuss the
variety of small helium variations occurring in this model and its relevance
for the horizontal branch morphology. In some of these models the duration of
the SG formation episode can be as short as \sim10 Myr; the formation time of
the SG is thus compatible with the survival of a cooling flow in the GC,
previous to the explosion of the SG core collapse supernovae. We also explore
models with formation of multiple populations in individual bursts, each
lasting no longer than \sim10 Myr.

  Intended for a non-specialist audience",,,,"gr-qc physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss the emergence of time in quantum gravity, and ask whether time is
always ""something that flows""'. We first recall that this is indeed the case in
both relativity and quantum mechanics, although in very different manners: time
flows geometrically in relativity (i.e. as a flow of proper time in the four
dimensional space-time), time flows abstractly in quantum mechanics (i.e. as a
flow in the space of observables of the system). We then ask the same question
in quantum gravity, in the light of the thermal time hypothesis of Connes and
Rovelli. The latter proposes to answer the question of time in quantum gravity
(or at least one of its many aspects), by postulating that time is a state
dependent notion. This means that one is able to make a notion of
time-as-an-abstract-flow - that we call the thermal time - emerge from the
knowledge of both: 1) the algebra of observables of the physical system under
investigation, 2) a state of thermal equilibrium of this system. Formally, this
thermal time is similar to the abstract flow of time in quantum mechanics, but
we show in various examples that it may have a concrete implementation either
as a geometrical flow, or as a geometrical flow combined with a non-geometric
action. This indicates that in quantum gravity, time may well still be
""something that flows"" at some abstract algebraic level, but this does not
necessarily imply that time is always and only ""something that flows"" at the
geometric level.

of the cylinder has N sites. We use a family of link modules over the periodic
Temperley-Lieb algebra EPTL_N(\beta, \alpha) introduced by Martin and Saleur,
and Graham and Lehrer. These are labeled by the numbers of sites N and of
defects d, and extend the standard modules of the original Temperley-Lieb
algebra. Beside the defining parameters \beta=u^2+u^{-2} with u=e^{i\lambda/2}
(weight of contractible loops) and \alpha (weight of non-contractible loops),
this family also depends on a twist parameter v that keeps track of how the
defects wind around the cylinder. The transfer matrix T_N(\lambda, \nu) depends
on the anisotropy \nu and the spectral parameter \lambda that fixes the model.
(The thermodynamic limit of T_N is believed to describe a conformal field
theory of central charge c=1-6\lambda^2/(\pi(\lambda-\pi)).)
  The family of periodic XXZ Hamiltonians is extended to depend on this new
parameter v and the relationship between this family and the loop models is
established. The Gram determinant for the natural bilinear form on these link
modules is shown to factorize in terms of an intertwiner i_N^d between these
link representations and the eigenspaces of S^z of the XXZ models. This map is
shown to be an isomorphism for generic values of u and v and the critical
curves in the plane of these parameters for which i_N^d fails to be an

projective-superspace techniques developed in arXiv:0807.3368. The virtue of
the approach (i) is that it makes manifest the geometric properties of the N=2
supersymmetric sigma-models in AdS_4. The target space must be a non-compact
hyperkahler manifold endowed with a Killing vector field which generates an
SO(2) group of rotations on the two-sphere of complex structures. The power of
the approach (ii) is that it allows us, in principle, to generate hyperkahler
metrics as well as to address the problem of deformations of such metrics.
  Here we show how to relate the formulation (ii) to (i) by integrating out an
infinite number of N=1 AdS auxiliary superfields and performing a superfield
duality transformation. We also develop a novel description of the most general
N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-model in AdS_4 in terms of chiral
superfields on three-dimensional N=2 flat superspace without central charge.
This superspace naturally originates from a conformally flat realization for
the four-dimensional N=2 AdS superspace that makes use of Poincare coordinates
for AdS_4. This novel formulation allows us to uncover several interesting
geometric results.

Since these parameters are unknown a priori, sample estimates are needed to
define suitable spatial models for the interpolation of incomplete data. The
distribution of the anisotropy statistics is determined by a non-Gaussian
sampling joint probability density. By means of analytical calculations, we
derive an explicit expression for the joint probability density function of the

density is independent of the autocovariance function and provides conservative

the theoretical analysis by means of simulations using synthetic data, and we
illustrate the detection of anisotropy changes with a case study involving

separation of variables for above domains helps to better understand the

in a small region of the domain, and decays rapidly outside this region. Using
the properties of Bessel and Mathieu functions, we derive the inequalities
which imply and clearly illustrate localization. Moreover, we provide an
example of a non-convex domain (an elliptical annulus) for which the
high-frequency localized modes are still present. At the same time, we show
that there is no localization in most of rectangle-like domains. This
observation leads us to formulating an open problem of localization in

(i.e. $g-2$) of the leptons. 3. Radiative lepton decays ($\mu\to e\gamma$ and
$\tau\to \mu\gamma, e\gamma$). 4. Rare Kaon decays ($K^0_L\to \pi^0\bar\nu\nu$
and $K^+\to \pi^+ \bar\nu\nu$). 5. Leptonic $B$ decays ($B_{s,d}\to l^+ l^-$,

all chirally enhanced corrections, i.e. takes into account the effects enhanced
by $\tan\beta$ and/or large trilinear soft mixing terms to all orders in
perturbation theory. All calculations are done using exact diagonalization of
the sfermion mass matrices. Comparing to previous versions, in SUSY_FLAVOR v2.5
parameter initialization in SLHA2 format has been significantly generalized and
simplified, so that program accepts without modifications most of the output
files produced by other codes calculating MSSM spectra and processes. In
addition, the routine calculating branching ratios for rare decays of top quark
to Higgs boson has been included. The program can be obtained from

metallic device elements. Metals have a high density of photon modes, and the
fields spill out of the bulk metal because of the evanescent-wave component.
Thus thermal and quantum electromagnetic Johnson- type noise from metallic
device elements can decohere nearby qubits. In this paper we use quantum
electrodynamics to compute the strength of this evanescent-wave Johnson noise
as a function of distance z from a metallic half-space. Previous treatments
have shown unphysical divergences at z = 0. We remedy this by using a proper
non-local dielectric function. Decoherence rates of local qubits are
proportional to the magnitude of electric or magnetic correlation functions
evaluated at the qubit position. We present formulas for the decoherence rates.
These formulas serve as an important constraint on future device architectures.

The HII region/PDR/molecular cloud complex S106 is excited by a
single O-star. The full extent of the warm and dense gas close to the star has
not been mapped in spectrally resolved high-J CO or [CII] lines, so the
kinematics of the warm, partially ionized gas, are unknown. Whether the
prominent dark lane bisecting the hourglass-shaped nebula is due solely to the
shadow cast by a small disk around the exciting star or also to extinction in
high column foreground gas was an open question until now. Aims. To disentangle
the morphology and kinematics of warm neutral and ionized gas close to the
star, study their relation to the bulk of the molecular gas, and to investigate
the nature of the dark lane. Methods. We use the heterodyne receiver GREAT on
board SOFIA to observe velocity resolved spectral lines of [C II] and CO 11-10
in comparison with so far unpublished submm continuum data at 350 micron
(SHARC-II) and complementary molecular line data. Results. The high angular and
spectral resolution observations show a very complex morphology and kinematics
of the inner S106 region, with many different components at different
excitation conditions contributing to the observed emission. The [C II] lines
are found to be bright and very broad, tracing high velocity gas close to the
interface of molecular cloud and HII region. CO 11-10 emission is more
confined, both spatially and in velocity, to the immediate surroundings of S106
IR showing the presence of warm, high density (clumpy) gas. Our high angular
resolution submm continuum observations rule out the scenario where the dark
lane separating the two lobes is due solely to the shadow cast by a small disk
close to the star. The lane is clearly seen also as warm, high column density
gas at the boundary of the molecular cloud and HII region.
