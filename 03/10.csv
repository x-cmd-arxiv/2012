problem in network science. Structural and dynamical similarities of different
real networks suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the
dynamics of these networks, albeit the nature and common origin of such laws
remain elusive. Here we show that the causal network representing the
large-scale structure of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law
graph with strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the
Internet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural
similarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the
large-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. This
equivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the dynamics of
complex networks and spacetime in the universe, with implications to network
science and cosmology.

pillars of the standard model of particle physics. The goal of this work is to
export such theories to cosmology. Here we are interested in models in which
the inflaton is a composite object, instead of a fundamental one. In so doing,
we first construct the general setup, in the metric formulation, for generic
models of composite inflation. We subsequently introduce the relevant examples
in which the inflaton is identified with: A) the lightest (composite) scalar
field in the minimal walking technicolor theory, and B) the glueball field of a
pure Yang-Mills theory. We demonstrate that they were both viable to achieve
successful inflation. Surprisingly, we find that the scale of composite
inflation is of the order of the expected grand unification scale, $10^{16}$
GeV.

observation of clear anomalies allows to establish the thermodynamic phase
diagram which features a small coexistence region of SDW and superconductivity
with a steep rise of Tc on the underdoped side. Samples that undergo the
tetragonal-orthorhombic structural transition are detwinned in situ, and the
response of the sample length to the magneto-structural and superconducting
transitions is studied for all three crystallographic directions. It is shown
that a reduction of the magnetic order by superconductivity is reflected in all
lattice parameters. On the overdoped side, superconductivity affects the
lattice parameters in much the same way as the SDW on the underdoped side,
suggesting an intimate relation between the two types of order. Moreover, the
uniaxial pressure derivatives of Tc are calculated using the Ehrenfest relation
and are found to be large and anisotropic. A correspondence between
substitution and uniaxial pressure is established, i.e., uniaxial pressure
along the b-axis (c-axis) corresponds to a decrease (increase) of the P
content. By studying the electronic contribution to the thermal expansion we
find evidence for a maximum of the electronic density of states at optimal

quantum mechanical context. It can, however, also be adapted to the classical
regime, which includes observational astronomy.
  Aims. I explain why POAM quantities are excellent metrics for describing the
end-to-end behavior of astronomical systems. To demonstrate their utility, I
calculate POAM probabilities and torques from holography measurements of EVLA
antenna surfaces.
  Methods. With previously defined concepts and calculi, I present generic
expressions for POAM spectra, total POAM, torque spectra, and total torque in
the image plane. I extend these functional forms to describe the specific POAM
behavior of single telescopes and interferometers.
  Results. POAM probabilities of spatially uncorrelated astronomical sources
are symmetric in quantum number. Such objects have zero intrinsic total POAM on
the celestial sphere, which means that the total POAM in the image plane is
identical to the total torque induced by aberrations within propagation media &
instrumentation. The total torque can be divided into source- independent and
dependent components, and the latter can be written in terms of three
illustrative forms. For interferometers, complications arise from discrete
sampling of synthesized apertures, but they can be overcome. POAM also
manifests itself in the apodization of each telescope in an array. Holography
of EVLA antennas observing a point source indicate that ~ 10% of photons in the
n = 0 state are torqued to n != 0 states.
  Conclusions. POAM quantities represent excellent metrics for characterizing
instruments because they are used to simultaneously describe amplitude and
phase aberrations. In contrast, Zernike polynomials are just solutions of a
differential equation that happen to ~ correspond to specific types of
aberrations and are typically employed to fit only phases.

reduce this contamination by only measuring cross-correlations between large

intrinsic ellipticity (II) correlation. A self-calibration technique based on
the redshift dependences of the IA correlations has also been proposed as a
means to remove the 2-point IA contamination from the lensing signal. We
explore here the redshift dependences of the IA and lensing bispectra in order
to propose a self-calibration of the IA auto-correlations at the 3-point level

3-point self-calibration technique for the total IA signal, which can be
accomplished through lensing tomography of photo-z bin size $\sim 0.01$. We
find that the 3-point self-calibration can function at the accuracy of the
2-point technique with modest constraints in redshift separation. This allows
the 3-point IA auto-correlation self-calibration technique proposed here to

  We investigate the conditional min- and max-entropy for quantum states,
generalizations of classical R\'enyi entropies. We introduce the purified
distance, a novel metric for unnormalized quantum states and use it to define
smooth entropies as optimizations of the min- and max-entropies over a ball of
close states. We explore various properties of these entropies, including
data-processing inequalities, chain rules and their classical limits. The most
important property is an entropic formulation of the asymptotic equipartition
property, which implies that the smooth entropies converge to the von Neumann
entropy in the limit of many independent copies. The smooth entropies also
satisfy duality and entropic uncertainty relations that provide limits on the
power of two different observers to predict the outcome of a measurement on a
quantum system.
  Finally, we discuss three example applications of the smooth entropy
framework. We show a strong converse statement for source coding with quantum
side information, characterize randomness extraction against quantum side
information and prove information theoretic security of quantum key
distribution using an intuitive argument based on the entropic uncertainty
relation.

compare these data to a series of Monte Carlo simulations to infer the
intrinsic binary fraction and distributions of mass ratios, periods, and
eccentricities. We model the distribution of mass ratio, log-period, and
eccentricity as power-laws and find best fitting indices of alpha=0.1+/-0.5,
beta=0.2+/-0.4, and gamma=-0.6+/-0.3 respectively. These distributions indicate
a preference for massive companions, short periods, and low eccentricities. Our
analysis indicates that the binary fraction of the cluster is 44+/-8% if all
binary systems are (artificially) assumed to have P<1000 days; if the power-law
period distribution is extrapolated to 10^4 years, a plausible upper limit for
bound systems, the binary fraction is ~90+/-10%. Of these binary (or higher
order) systems, ~45% will have companions close enough to interact during pre-
or post-main-sequence evolution (semi-major axis ~/<4.7 AU). The period
distribution for P<27 days is not well reproduced by any single power-law owing
to an excess of systems with periods around 3-5 days (0.08-0.31 AU) and a
relative shortage of systems with periods around 7-14 days (0.14-0.62 AU). We
explore the idea that these longer-period systems evolved to produce the
observed excess of short-period systems. The best fitting binary parameters
imply that secondaries generate, on average, ~16% of the V-band light in young
massive populations. This means that photometrically based distance
measurements for young massive clusters & associations will be systematically
low by ~8% (0.16 mag in the distance modulus) if the luminous contributions of

perturbations in the dark energy fluid. This means that dark energy has two
extra degrees of freedom: the sound speed $\cs$ and the anisotropic stress
$\sigma$. If dark energy is inhomogenous at the scales of interest then the
gravitational potentials are modified and the evolution of the dark matter
perturbations is also directly affected. In this paper we add an anisotropic
component to the dark energy perturbations. Following the idea introduced in
\cite{Sapone:2009mb}, we solve analytically the equations of perturbations in
the dark sector, finding simple and accurate approximated solutions. We also
find that the evolution of the density perturbations is governed by an
effective sound speed which depends on both the sound speed and the anisotropic

corresponding functional renormalization group equation on the as to yet
unexplored ""tetrad only"" theory space. It comprises action functionals which
depend on the tetrad field (along with the related background and ghost fields)
and are invariant under the semi-direct product of spacetime diffeomorphisms
and local Lorentz transformations. This theory space differs from that of
Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) in that the tetrad rather than the metric
constitutes the fundamental variable and because of the additional symmetry
requirement of local Lorentz invariance. It also differs from ""Quantum Einstein
Cartan Gravity"" (QECG) investigated recently since the spin connection is not
an independent field variable now. We explicitly compute the renormalization
group flow on this theory space within the tetrad version of the
Einstein-Hilbert truncation. A detailed comparison with analog results in QEG
and QECG is performed in order to assess the impact the choice of a fundamental
field variable has on the renormalization behavior of the gravitational average
action, and the possibility of an asymptotically safe infinite cutoff limit is
investigated. Implications for nonperturbative studies of fermionic matter
coupled to quantum gravity are also discussed. It turns out that, in the
context of functional flow equations, the ""hybrid calculations"" proposed in the
literature (using the tetrad for fermionic diagrams only, and the metric in all
others) are unlikely to be quantitatively reliable. Moreover we find that,
unlike in perturbation theory, the non-propagating Faddeev-Popov ghosts related
to the local Lorentz transformations may not be discarded but rather contribute

motion transverse to our line of sight. The rate at which the variability
occurs indicates the velocity of the cloud, which can provide constraints on
the cloud's distance from the central source. This requires detailed
spectroscopy during a variability event. Such spectra have proven elusive,
suggesting either the timescale of variability is too short to be caught, or
too long to notice until a sufficient amount of time has passed. Photometric
monitoring of BAL quasar colours may potentially be used as an early warning
system to trigger time resolved spectroscopic monitoring of BAL variability.
Towards this end, we are analyzing both BAL and non-BAL colour variability
using time series photometry from Stripe 82 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

  Data",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Operational network data, management data such as customer care call logs and
equipment system logs, is a very important source of information for network
operators to detect problems in their networks. Unfortunately, there is lack of
efficient tools to automatically track and detect anomalous events on
operational data, causing ISP operators to rely on manual inspection of this
data. While anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of network
data, operational data presents several new challenges, including the
volatility and sparseness of data, and the need to perform fast detection
(complicating application of schemes that require offline processing or
large/stable data sets to converge).
  To address these challenges, we propose Tiresias, an automated approach to
locating anomalous events on hierarchical operational data. Tiresias leverages
the hierarchical structure of operational data to identify high-impact
aggregates (e.g., locations in the network, failure modes) likely to be
associated with anomalous events. To accommodate different kinds of operational
network data, Tiresias consists of an online detection algorithm with low time
and space complexity, while preserving high detection accuracy. We present
results from two case studies using operational data collected at a large
commercial IP network operated by a Tier-1 ISP: customer care call logs and
set-top box crash logs. By comparing with a reference set verified by the ISP's
operational group, we validate that Tiresias can achieve >94% accuracy in
locating anomalies. Tiresias also discovered several previously unknown
anomalies in the ISP's customer care cases, demonstrating its effectiveness.

coordination numbers Z (i.e., many tunnelling partners). Via a controlled
expansion into powers of 1/Z, we establish a hierarchy of correlations, which
facilitates an approximate analytic solution of the quantum evolution. For the
Bose-Hubbard model, we derive the growth of phase coherence after a quench from
the Mott to the superfluid phase. For a quench within the Mott phase, we find
that various local observables approach a quasi-equilibrium state after a
finite period of time. However, this state is not thermal, i.e., real
thermalisation -- if it occurs -- requires much longer time scales. For a
tilted lattice in the Mott state, we calculate the tunnelling probability and
find a remarkable analogy to the Sauter-Schwinger effect (i.e.,
electron-positron pair creation out of the vacuum due to a strong electric
field). These analytical results are compared to numerical simulations for
finite lattices in one and two dimensions and we find qualitative agreement.
Finally, we generalize these studies to the more involved case of the
Fermi-Hubbard model.

the regret decreases asymptotically according to $O(e^{-\frac{\tau t}{(\ln

chemistry in the interstellar medium. A number of molecular species have their
abundance enhanced by several orders of magnitude in the outflow gas, likely as
a combined result of dust mantle disruption and high temperature gas chemistry,
and therefore become sensitive indicators of the physical changes taking place
in the shock. Identifying these species and understanding their chemical
behavior is therefore of high interest both to chemical studies and to our
understanding of the star-formation process. Here we review some of the recent
progress in the study of the molecular composition of bipolar outflows, with
emphasis in the tracers most relevant for shock chemistry. As we discuss, there
has been rapid progress both in characterizing the molecular composition of
certain outflows as well as in modeling the chemical processes likely involved.
However, a number of limitations still affect our understanding of outflow
chemistry. These include a very limited statistical approach in the
observations and a dependence of the models on plane-parallel shocks, which
cannot reproduce the observed wing morphology of the lines. We finish our
contribution by discussing the chemistry of the so-called extremely high
velocity component, which seems different from the rest of the outflow and may
originate in the wind from the very vicinity of the protostar.

analogous to the coupling of the graviton to energy/momentum, leading to strong
sensitivity of the effects associated with its virtual exchange to the energy

that implies tremendous potential for use in electronic devices. Unfortunately,
transport measurements find the expected high mobility only in freely suspended
graphen. When supported on a surface, graphene shows a strongly reduced
mobility, and an especially severe reduction for temperatures above 200 K. A
temperature-dependent mobility reduction could be explained by scattering of
carriers with phonons, but this is expected to be weak for pristine,
weakly-doped graphene. The mobility reduction has therefore been ascribed to
the interaction with confined ripples or substrate phonons. Here we study the
temperature-dependent electronic structure of supported graphene by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, a technique that can reveal the
origin of the phenomena observed in transport measurements. We show that the
electron-phonon coupling for weakly-doped, supported graphene on a metal
surface is indeed extremely weak, reaching the lowest value ever reported for
any material. However, the temperature-dependent dynamic interaction with the
substrate leads to a complex and dramatic change in the carrier type and
density that is relevant for transport. Using ab initio molecular dynamics
simulations, we show that these changes in the electronic structure are mainly
caused by fluctuations in the graphene-substrate distance.

inverse Compton, self-synchrotron-Compton, or synchrotron emission. We present
results of simultaneous X-ray and near-IR observations and show evidence that
X-ray peak flare emission lags behind near-IR flare emission with a time delay
ranging from a few to tens of minutes. Our Inverse Compton scattering modeling
places constraints on the electron density and temperature distributions of the

that a structure exists directly in front of the 0316 protocluster. We estimate

associated with a strong surface density peak 1.4 Mpc to the North-West of the

nature of the two structures, a merger scenario is a possible option. Simple
merger dynamics indicates that the observed relative velocity of 1600 km/s can
be reproduced if the two structures have masses of ~5x10^14 Msun and have

we propose a scalable non-parametric approach to automatically learn the
structural dynamics of the network and individual nodes. Roles may represent
structural or behavioral patterns such as the center of a star, peripheral
nodes, or bridge nodes that connect different communities. Our novel approach
learns the appropriate structural role dynamics for any arbitrary network and
tracks the changes over time. In particular, we uncover the specific global
network dynamics and the local node dynamics of a technological, communication,
and social network. We identify interesting node and network patterns such as
stationary and non-stationary roles, spikes/steps in role-memberships (perhaps
indicating anomalies), increasing/decreasing role trends, among many others.
Our results indicate that the nodes in each of these networks have distinct
connectivity patterns that are non-stationary and evolve considerably over
time. Overall, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
for fast mining and tracking of the dynamics in large networks. Furthermore,
the dynamic structural representation provides a basis for building more
sophisticated models and tools that are fast for exploring large dynamic
networks.

additions and multiplications over GF$(q)$ as well as cyclic shifts when a

codes, the former construction works for arbitrary code parameters, provided
that $q$ is large enough. This is the first construction of exact-MSR codes
with arbitrary code parameters, to the best of our knowledge. In comparison to
existing exact-MSR codes, while data construction of our exact-MSR codes has a
higher complexity, the complexity of data repair is lower. Thus, they are
attractive for applications that need a small number of data reconstructions

Using the map, we then investigate the droplet trajectories for two different

either non-periodic dense curves, or approach a quasiperiodic orbit. In
contrast, for waves which extend over many wavelengths, at low forcing,
trajectories tend to approach an array of circular attracting sets. As the
forcing increases, the attracting sets break down and the droplet travels
throughout space.

unsupervised learning techniques in computer vision and pattern recognition.
State-of-the-art techniques for subspace clustering make use of recent advances
in sparsity and rank minimization. However, existing techniques are
computationally expensive and may result in degenerate solutions that degrade
clustering performance in the case of insufficient data sampling. To partially
solve these problems, and inspired by existing work on matrix factorization,
this paper proposes fixed-rank representation (FRR) as a unified framework for
unsupervised visual learning. FRR is able to reveal the structure of multiple
subspaces in closed-form when the data is noiseless. Furthermore, we prove that
under some suitable conditions, even with insufficient observations, FRR can
still reveal the true subspace memberships. To achieve robustness to outliers
and noise, a sparse regularizer is introduced into the FRR framework. Beyond
subspace clustering, FRR can be used for unsupervised feature extraction. As a
non-trivial byproduct, a fast numerical solver is developed for FRR.
Experimental results on both synthetic data and real applications validate our
theoretical analysis and demonstrate the benefits of FRR for unsupervised
visual learning.

for integer least-square (LS) optimization problems. It is found that the
mixing time of MCMC for integer LS problems depends on the structure of the
underlying lattice. More specifically, the mixing time of MCMC is closely
related to whether there is a local minimum in the lattice structure. For some
lattices, the mixing time of the Markov chain is independent of the
signal-to-noise ($SNR$) ratio and grows polynomially in the problem dimension;
while for some lattices, the mixing time grows unboundedly as $SNR$ grows. Both
theoretical and empirical results suggest that to ensure fast mixing, the
temperature for MCMC should often grow positively as the $SNR$ increases. We
also derive the probability that there exist local minima in an integer

via charge transfer during state energy crossing. The simulation also shows
that the system is not in thermo dynamic equilibrium in terms of adiabatic

achieved by introducing a linear time dependence approximation of the

approximation algorithm presented by Weitz (2006) establish a beautiful picture
for the computational complexity of approximating the partition function of the
hard-core model. Let $\lambda_c(T_\Delta)$ denote the critical activity for the
hard-model on the infinite $\Delta$-regular tree. Weitz presented an FPTAS for
the partition function when $\lambda<\lambda_c(T_\Delta)$ for graphs with
constant maximum degree $\Delta$. In contrast, Sly showed that for all
$\Delta\geq 3$, there exists $\epsilon_\Delta>0$ such that (unless RP=NP) there
is no FPRAS for approximating the partition function on graphs of maximum
degree $\Delta$ for activities $\lambda$ satisfying
$\lambda_c(T_\Delta)<\lambda<\lambda_c(T_\Delta)+\epsilon_\Delta$.
  We prove that a similar phenomenon holds for the antiferromagnetic Ising
model. Recent results of Li et al. and Sinclair et al. extend Weitz's approach
to any 2-spin model, which includes the antiferromagnetic Ising model, to yield
an FPTAS for the partition function for all graphs of constant maximum degree
$\Delta$ when the parameters of the model lie in the uniqueness regime of the
infinite tree $T_\Delta$. We prove the complementary result that for the
antiferrogmanetic Ising model without external field that, unless RP=NP, for
all $\Delta\geq 3$, there is no FPRAS for approximating the partition function
on graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ when the inverse temperature lies in the
non-uniqueness regime of the infinite tree $T_\Delta$. Our results extend to a
region of the parameter space for general 2-spin models. Our proof works by
relating certain second moment calculations for random $\Delta$-regular
bipartite graphs to the tree recursions used to establish the critical points

existence of attractor points in digital chaos generated by arithmetic
operations on numbers. We also model Collatz convergence as a classical ruin

underlying semiring is restricted to complete semirings or complete
c-semirings. Algebraical properties that are similar to the classical case are
obtained in the formal power series case. Moreover, we show closure properties,
under quotients and residuals, of regular series and weighted context-free

for each formal power series $A$ two weighted automata ${\cal M}_A$ and ${\cal
U}_A$. Both weighted automata accepts $A$, and ${\cal M}_A$ is the minimal
deterministic weighted automaton of $A$. The universality of ${\cal U}_A$ is

observations--but also because they can be growing modes that are readily
excited by accretion events. Self-gravity being nonlocal, the eigenvalue
problem results in a pair of coupled integral equations, which we derive for a

numerically for various values of mass fraction in the counter-rotating
component. The eigenvalues are in general complex, being real only in the
absence of the counter-rotating component, or imaginary when both components
have identical surface density profiles. Our main results are as follows: (i)
the pattern speed appears to be non negative, with the growth (or damping) rate
being larger for larger values of the pattern speed; (ii) for a given value of
the pattern speed, the growth (or damping) rate increases as the mass in the
counter-rotating component increases; (iii) the number of nodes of the

For the case of $q=1$, the critical frontier yields the thresholds of bond
percolation on these lattices, which are exactly consistent with the results
given by Ziff et al [J. Phys. A 39, 15083 (2006)]. For the $q=2$ Potts model on
the bowtie-A lattice, the critical point is in agreement with that of the Ising
model on this lattice, which has been exactly solved. Furthermore, we do
extensive Monte Carlo simulations of Potts model on the bowtie-A lattice with
noninteger $q$. Our numerical results, which are accurate up to 7 significant
digits, are consistent with the theoretical predictions. We also simulate the
site percolation on the bowtie-A lattice, and the threshold is
$s_c=0.5479148(7)$. In the simulations of bond percolation and site
percolation, we find that the shape-dependent properties of the percolation
model on the bowtie-A lattice are somewhat different from those of an isotropic
lattice, which may be caused by the anisotropy of the lattice.

of a string is defined as the amount of self-descriptive information it
contains. It is proved that (under reasonable assumptions: the existence of an
empty machine and the availability of a faithful index) facticity is definite,
i.e. random strings have facticity 0 and for compressible strings 0 < {\phi}(x)
< 1/2 |x| + O(1). Consequently facticity measures the tension in a data set
between structural and ad-hoc information objectively. For binary strings there
is a so-called facticity threshold that is dependent on their entropy. Strings
with facticty above this threshold have no optimal stochastic model and are
essentially computational. The shape of the facticty versus entropy plot
coincides with the well-known sawtooth curves observed in complex systems. The
notion of factic processes is discussed. This approach overcomes problems with
earlier proposals to use two-part code to define the meaningfulness or
usefulness of a data set.

new angular-momentum dependent version of the Fusion by Diffusion (FBD) model
with fission barriers and ground-state masses taken from the Warsaw
macroscopic-microscopic model (involving non-axial shapes) of Kowal et al. The
only empirically adjustable parameter of the model, the injection-point
distance (sinj), has been determined individually for all the reactions and
very regular systematics of this parameter have been established. The
regularity of the obtained sinj systematics indirectly points at the internal
consistency of the whole set of fission barriers used in the calculations.
Having fitted all the experimental excitation functions for elements Z =
114-118, the FBD model (with the new sinj systematics) was used to predict
cross sections for synthesis of elements Z = 119 and 120. Regarding prospects
to produce the new element Z = 119, our calculations prefer the
252Es(48Ca,xn)300-x119 reaction, for which the synthesis cross section of about
0.2 pb in 4n channel at Ec.m.= 220 MeV is expected. The most favorable reaction
