infinite randomness critical point with exponent \psi ~ 0.43. Our main
conclusion for disordered anyon models in two spatial dimensions is that
systems of Ising anyons as well as systems of Fibonacci anyons do not realize
infinite randomness phases, but flow back to weaker disorder under the

makes it an ideal target for studying the evolution of stellar clusters. Our
goal is to study its star formation history and to analyse the primordial disk
evolution of its members. The study presented is based on data obtained with
Spitzer IRAC and MIPS, combined with deep NIR ground-based FLAMINGOS imaging
and previously published optical data. We build NIR dust extinction maps of the
molecular cloud associated with the cluster, and determine it to have a mass of
2.1x10^3Msun above an Av of 7mag. Using a differential K_s-band luminosity
function of the cluster, we estimate the size of its population to be
1436$\pm$242 members. The star formation efficiency is ~25%. We identify the
disk population: (i) optically thick inner disks, (ii) anaemic inner disks, and
(iii) disks with inner holes, or transition disks. We analyse the spatial
distribution of these sources and find that sources with thick disks segregate
into sub-clusterings, whereas sources with anaemic disks do not. Furthermore,
sources with anaemic disks are found to be unembedded (Av<3mag), whereas the
clustered sources with thick disks are still embedded within the parental
cloud. NGC2264 has undergone more than one star-forming event, where the
anaemic and extincted thick disk population appear to have formed in separate
episodes. We also find tentative evidence of triggered star-formation in the
Fox Fur Nebula. In terms of disk evolution, our findings support the emerging
disk evolution paradigm of two distinct evolutionary paths for primordial
optically thick disks: a homologous one where the disk emission decreases
uniformly at NIR and MIR wavelengths, and a radially differential one where the
emission from the inner region of the disk decreases more rapidly than from the
outer region (forming transition disks).

in more than one space dimension must confront the challenge of controlling
errors in the discrete divergence of the magnetic field. One approach that has
been shown successful in stabilizing MHD calculations are constrained transport
(CT) schemes. CT schemes can be viewed as predictor-corrector methods for
updating the magnetic field, where a magnetic field value is first predicted by
a method that does not exactly preserve the divergence-free condition on the
magnetic field, followed by a correction step that aims to control these
divergence errors. In Helzel et al. (2011) the authors presented an unstaggered
constrained transport method for the MHD equations on 3D Cartesian grids. In
this work we generalize the method of Helzel et al. (2011) in three important
ways: (1) we remove the need for operator splitting by switching to an
appropriate method of lines discretization and coupling this with a
non-conservative finite volume method for the magnetic vector potential
equation, (2) we increase the spatial and temporal order of accuracy of the
entire method to third order, and (3) we develop the method so that it is
applicable on both Cartesian and logically rectangular mapped grids. The
evolution equation for the magnetic vector potential is solved using a
non-conservative finite volume method. The curl of the magnetic potential is
computed via a third-order accurate discrete operator that is derived from
appropriate application of the divergence theorem and subsequent numerical
quadrature on element faces. Special artificial resistivity limiters are used
to control unphysical oscillations in the magnetic potential and field
components across shocks. Test computations are shown that confirm third order
accuracy for smooth test problems and high-resolution for test problems with
shock waves.

main objective for using mobile sensor nodes is to heal coverage holes after
the initial network deployment, when designing a hole healing algorithm, the
following issues need to be addressed. First, how to decide the existence of a
coverage hole and how to estimate the size of a hole. Second, what are the best
target locations to relocate mobile nodes to repair coverage holes? We use the
triangular oriented diagram (HSTT) for aim to goal where its simple, have low
calculation among construction and it is great to calculate the size of hole
exactly .

excess of data events with respect to the background estimation in the mass

This article presents a new statistical mechanical framework for predicting CU
based on first principles at the molecular level. The tablet is modeled as an
open system which can be treated as a grand canonical ensemble to calculate
fluctuations in the number of granules and thus the CU. Exact analytical
solutions to hard sphere mixture systems available in the literature are
applied to derive an expression for the CU and elucidate the different factors
that impact CU. It is shown that there is a single ratio,
{\lambda}\equiv<w^2.f^2>/<w.f>; that completely characterizes ""granule quality""
with respect to impact on CU. Here w and f denote the weight of granule and the
fractional (w/w) assay of API in it. This ratio should be as small as possible
to obtain best CU. We also derive analytical expressions which show how the
granule loading impacts the CU through the excluded volume, which has been
largely ignored in the literature to date. The model was tested against
literature data and a large set of tablet formulations specifically made and
analyzed for CU using a model API. The formulations covered the effect of
granule size, percentage loading, and tablet weight on the CU. The model is
able to predict the mean experimental coefficient of variation (CV) with good
success and captures all the elements that impact the CU. The predictions of
the model serve as a theoretical lower limit for the mean CV (for infinite
batches or tablets) that can be expected during manufacturing assuming the best
processing conditions.

from the bulk are taken into account. For this purpose, we study a large number
of realisations of the potential; we find the nature of the inflationary
trajectory to be very consistent despite the complex construction. Inflation is
always canonical and occurs in the vicinity of an inflection point. Extending
the transport method to non-slow-roll and to calculate the running, we obtain
distributions for observables. The spectral index is typically blue and the
running positive, putting the model under moderate pressure from WMAP7
constraints. The local f_NL and tensor-to-scalar ratio are typically
unobservably small, though we find approximately 0.5% of realisations to give
observably large local f_NL. Approximating the potential as sum-separable, we
are able to give fully analytic explanations for the trends in observed
behaviour. Finally we find the model suffers from the persistence of
isocurvature perturbations, which can be expected to cause further evolution of
adiabatic perturbations after inflation. We argue this is a typical problem for
models of multifield inflation involving inflection points and renders models
of this type technically unpredictive without a description of reheating.

complicated by the fact that the (necessarily essential) spectrum of the
associated linearization intersects the imaginary axis at the origin. We carry
out a numerical Evans function study of the spectral problem and find bands of
spectrally stable periodic traveling waves, in close agreement with previous
numerical studies of Frisch-She-Thual, Bar-Nepomnyashchy,
Chang-Demekhin-Kopelevich, and others carried out by other techniques. We also
compare predictions of the associated Whitham modulation equations, which
formally describe the dynamics of weak large scale perturbations of a periodic

effectiveness at a practical level. For the reader's convenience, we include in
an appendix the corresponding treatment of the Swift-Hohenberg equation, a

been shown to be a strong leading indicator of economic growth. Hence, methods
to characterize and predict the structure of the network connecting countries
to the products that they export are relevant for understanding the dynamics of
economic development. Here we study the presence and absence of industries at
the global and national levels and show that these networks are significantly
nested. This means that the less filled rows and columns of these networks'
adjacency matrices tend to be subsets of the fuller rows and columns. Moreover,
we show that nestedness remains relatively stable as the matrices become more
filled over time and that this occurs because of a bias for industries that
deviate from the networks' nestedness to disappear, and a bias for the missing
industries that reduce nestedness to appear. This makes the appearance and
disappearance of individual industries in each location predictable. We
interpret the high level of nestedness observed in these networks in the
context of the neutral model of development introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann
(2009). We show that, for the observed fills, the model can reproduce the high
level of nestedness observed in these networks only when we assume a high level
of heterogeneity in the distribution of capabilities available in countries and
required by products. In the context of the neutral model, this implies that
the high level of nestedness observed in these economic networks emerges as a
combination of both, the complementarity of inputs and heterogeneity in the
number of capabilities available in countries and required by products. The
stability of nestedness in industrial ecosystems, and the predictability
implied by it, demonstrates the importance of the study of network properties

around Lyman Break Galaxies. We construct phenomenological models of
large-scale outflows which consist of cold clumps that are in pressure
equilibrium with a constant-velocity hot wind. First we consider models in
which the cold clumps are distributed symmetrically around the galaxy, and in
which the clumps undergo a continuous acceleration in its 'circumgalactic'
medium (CGM). We constrain the properties of the cold clumps (radius, velocity,
HI column density, & number density) by matching the observed Lya absorption
strength of the CGM in the spectra of background galaxies. We then insert a Lya
source in the center of this clumpy outflow, which consists of 1e5-1e6 clumps,
and compute observable properties of the scattered Lya photons. In these
models, the scattered radiation forms halos that are significantly more
concentrated than is observed. In order to simultaneously reproduce the
observed Lya absorption line strengths and the Lya halos, we require -
preferably bipolar - outflows in which the clumps decelerate after their
initial acceleration. This deceleration is predicted naturally in
'momentum-driven' wind models of clumpy outflows. In models that simultaneously
fit the absorption and emission line data, the predicted linear polarization is
~30-40% at a surface brightness contour of S=1e-18 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2. Our
work illustrates clearly that Lya emission line halos around starforming
galaxies provide valuable constraints on the cold gas distribution & kinematics
in their circumgalactic medium, and that these constraints complement those
obtained from absorption line studies alone.

in the early universe. Perturbations that exceeded some critical threshold are
conjectured to have undergone gravitational collapse to form primordial black
holes (PBHs) at a range of masses. Such PBHs serve as candidates for cold dark
matter and their detection would shed light on conditions in the early
universe. Here we propose a mechanism to search for transits of PBHs
through/nearby Earth by studying the associated seismic waves. Using a
spectral-element method, we simulate and visualize this seismic wave field in
Earth's interior. We predict the emergence of two unique signatures, namely, a
wave that would arrive almost simultaneously everywhere on Earth's free surface
and the excitation of unusual spheroidal modes with a characteristic
frequency-spacing in free oscillation spectra. These qualitative
characteristics are unaffected by the speed or proximity of the PBH trajectory.
The seismic energy deposited by a proximal ${M^{PBH} = 10^{15}}$ g PBH is
comparable to a magnitude $M_w=4$ earthquake. The non-seismic collateral damage
due to the actual impact of such small PBHs with Earth would be negligible.
Unfortunately, the expected collision rate is very low even if PBHs constituted
all of dark matter, at ${\sim 10^{-7} {yr}^{-1}}$, and since the rate scales as
${1/M^{PBH}}$, fortunately encounters with larger, Earth-threatening PBHs are
exceedingly unlikely. However, the rate at which non-colliding close encounters
of PBHs could be detected by seismic activity alone is roughly two orders of
magnitude larger --- that is once every hundred thousand years --- than the
direct collision rate.

kinetics of assembly driven by short-range pair-potentials in an implicit
solvent, and provides illustrations of its unique capabilities. An atlas is a
labeled partition of the assembly landscape into a topological roadmap of
maximal, contiguous, nearly-equipotential-energy conformational regions or
macrostates, together with their neighborhood relationships. The new
methodology decouples the roadmap generation from sampling and produces: (1) a
query-able atlas of local potential energy minima, their basin structure,
energy barriers, and neighboring basins; (2) paths between a specified pair of
basins; and (3) approximations of relative path lengths, basin volumes
(configurational entropy), and path probabilities. Results demonstrating the
core algorithm's capabilities have been generated by a resource-light,
opensource software implementation EASAL. EASAL atlases several hundred
thousand macrostates in minutes on a standard laptop. Subsequent path and basin
computations each take seconds. The core algorithm's correctness, time
complexity, and efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs are formally guaranteed using
modern geometric constraint systems. The methodology further links geometric
variables of the input assembling units to a type of intuitive topological
bar-code of the output atlas, which in turn determine stable assembled
structures and kinetics. This succinct input-output relationship facilitates
reverse analysis, and control towards design. We use the novel convex Cayley
(distance-based) parametrization that is unique to assembly, as opposed to
folding. Sampling microstates with macrostate-specific Cayley parameters avoids
gradient-descent search used by all prevailing methods. This increases sampling
efficiency, significantly reduces the number of repeated and discarded samples.

also the tuning of the complex structure moduli of the Calabi-Yau threefolds.
This configuration is translated to geometric data on F-theory side. We find
that the monodromy locus for two-cycles in K3 fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds in a
stable degeneration limit is globally factorized with squared factors under the

there is a U(1) symmetry in a low energy effective field theory. To support
that, we explicitly check the reduction of a monodromy group in an appreciable

that computing fotw is fixed-parameter tractable with parameter fotw. Moreover,
we show that on classes of formulae of bounded fotw, model checking is fixed
parameter tractable, with parameter the length of the formula. This is done by
translating a formula \phi\ with fotw(\phi)<k into a formula of the k-variable
fragment L^k of first order logic. For fixed k, the question whether a given
first order formula is equivalent to an L^k formula is undecidable. In
contrast, the classes of first order formulae with bounded fotw are fragments
of first order logic for which the equivalence is decidable.
  Our notion of tree-width generalises tree-width of conjunctive queries to
arbitrary formulae of first order logic by taking into account the quantifier
interaction in a formula. Moreover, it is more powerful than the notion of
elimination-width of quantified constraint formulae, defined by Chen and Dalmau
(CSL 2005): for quantified constraint formulae, both bounded elimination-width
and bounded fotw allow for model checking in polynomial time. We prove that
fotw of a quantified constraint formula \phi\ is bounded by the
elimination-width of \phi, and we exhibit a class of quantified constraint
formulae with bounded fotw, that has unbounded elimination-width. A similar
comparison holds for strict tree-width of non-recursive stratified datalog as
defined by Flum, Frick, and Grohe (JACM 49, 2002).

parallel, optimised software package for parameter inference and model
selection. This package is motivated by the analysis needs of modern
astronomical surveys and the need to organise and reuse expensive derived data.
The BIE is the first platform for computational statistics designed explicitly
to enable Bayesian update and model comparison for astronomical problems.
Bayesian update is based on the representation of high-dimensional posterior
distributions using metric-ball-tree based kernel density estimation. Among its
algorithmic offerings, the BIE emphasises hybrid tempered MCMC schemes that
robustly sample multimodal posterior distributions in high-dimensional
parameter spaces. Moreover, the BIE is implements a full persistence or
serialisation system that stores the full byte-level image of the running
inference and previously characterised posterior distributions for later use.
Two new algorithms to compute the marginal likelihood from the posterior
distribution, developed for and implemented in the BIE, enable model comparison
for complex models and data sets. Finally, the BIE was designed to be a
collaborative platform for applying Bayesian methodology to astronomy. It
includes an extensible object-oriented and easily extended framework that
implements every aspect of the Bayesian inference. By providing a variety of
statistical algorithms for all phases of the inference problem, a scientist may
explore a variety of approaches with a single model and data implementation.

strangelets, where there is no restriction to the number of flavors of quarks,
and a particular case of the color superconducting phase, where exists a
restriction to the quark numbers and an additional energy gap. We study the
stability of strangelets, measured by the energy per baryon, to compare later
with that of the 56Fe : the most stable isotope known in nature. We employ the
Liquid Drop formalism of the Bag Model MIT to describe the interaction between
quarks. We conclude that the field effects tend to decrease the energy per
baryon of strangelets and temperature produces the opposite effect. It is also
shown that strangelets in the color superconducting phase are more stable than
those in the unpaired phase for an energy gap of about 100MeV. The radius of
strangelets shows an analogous behavior with the baryon number, as that of the
nuclei, and shows small variations with the magnetic field and temperature. It
is obtained that the presence of magnetic fields modify the values of the
electric charge regarding the non-magnetized case, being these higher (lower)

variability tends to occur in complex ways; however, all the variable lines
vary in intensity and not in velocity, not finding evidence for
acceleration/deceleration in these outflows. Due to the variations in strength,
mini-BALs can become BALs and vice versa, suggesting they share a similar

Hamiltonians and a noisy thermal environment to non-classical stationary states
by feedback loops based on weak measurements and conditioned linear driving. We
derive general analytical upper bounds for the single mode squeezing and
multimode entanglement at steady state, depending only on the Hamiltonian
parameters and on the number of thermal excitations of the bath. Our findings
show that, rather surprisingly, larger number of thermal excitations in the
bath allow for larger steady-state squeezing and entanglement if the efficiency
of the optimal continuous measurements conditioning the feedback loop is high
enough. We also consider the performance of feedback strategies based on
homodyne detection and show that, at variance with the optimal measurements, it
degrades with increasing temperature.

Classification methods like decision trees, Bayesian network etc can be applied
on the educational data for predicting the student's performance in
examination. This prediction will help to identify the weak students and help
them to score better marks. The C4.5, ID3 and CART decision tree algorithms are
applied on engineering student's data to predict their performance in the final
exam. The outcome of the decision tree predicted the number of students who are
likely to pass, fail or promoted to next year. The results provide steps to
improve the performance of the students who were predicted to fail or promoted.
After the declaration of the results in the final examination the marks
obtained by the students are fed into the system and the results were analyzed
for the next session. The comparative analysis of the results states that the

work effectively with non-normally distributed data. But optimal results are

the behaviour of a K-means fast learning artificial neural network(KFLANN) for
grouping the data is presented. Basically, the grouping of high dimensional
input data is controlled by additional neural network input parameters namely
vigilance and tolerance.Neural networks learn faster and give better
performance if the input variables are pre-processed before being fed to the
input units of the neural network. A common way of dealing with data that is
not normally distributed is to perform some form of mathematical transformation
on the data that shifts it towards a normal distribution.In a neural network,
data preprocessing transforms the data into a format that will be more easily
and effectively processed for the purpose of the user. Among various methods,
Normalization is one which organizes data for more efficient access.
Experimental results on several artificial and synthetic data sets indicate
that the groups formed in the data vary with non-normally distributed data and
normalized data and also depends on the normalization method used.

martensitic and magnetic domain structure is essential. In the case of Ni-Mn-Ga
bulk material and foils, a staircase-like magnetic domain structure with
90{\deg}- and 180{\deg}-domain walls is known for modulated martensite. In the
present paper we show that the magnetic domain pattern of thin epitaxial films
is fundamentally different. Here we analyze epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films by atomic
and magnetic force microscopy to investigate the correlation between the
twinned martensitic variants and the magnetic stripe domains. The observed
band-like domains with partially perpendicular outof-plane magnetization run
perpendicular to the microstructure domains defined by twinning variants. These
features can be explained by the finite film thickness, resulting in an
equilibrium twinning period much smaller than the domain period. This does not
allow the formation of a staircase domain patter. Instead the energies of the
magnetic and martensitic microstructures are minimized independently by
aligning both patterns perpendicularly to each other. By analyzing a thickness
series we can show that the observed magnetic domain pattern can be
quantitatively described by an adapted band domain model of Kittel.

interest for both laboratory and space plasma physics. In this paper we
investigate the linear coupling between whistler waves and slow magnetosonic
solitons through two-fluid numerical simulations. Whistler waves can be trapped
in the presence of inhomogeneous external fields such as a density hump or hole
where they can propagate for times much longer than their characteristic time
scale, as shown by laboratory experiments and space measurements. Space
measurements have detected whistler waves also in correspondence to magnetic
holes, i.e., to density humps with magnetic field minima extending on
ion-scales. This raises the interesting question of how ion-scale structures
can couple to whistler waves. Slow magnetosonic solitons share some of the main
features of a magnetic hole. Using the ducting properties of an inhomogeneous
plasma as a guide, we present a numerical study of whistler waves that are
trapped and transported inside propagating slow magnetosonic solitons.

of the STSP has an exponential number of constraints, just like the standard

the design of a desired active optical wavelength, the polarization response of
QDs is of particular interest for optical communications and quantum
information science. Previous theoretical studies based on a pure InAs QD model
failed to reproduce experimentally observed polarization properties. In this
work, multi-million atom simulations are performed to understand the
correlation between chemical composition and polarization properties of QDs. A
systematic analysis of QD structural parameters leads us to propose a two layer
composition model, mimicking In segregation and In-Ga intermixing effects. This
model, consistent with mostly accepted compositional findings, allows to
accurately fit the experimental PL spectra. The detailed study of QD morphology
parameters presented here serves as a tool for using growth dynamics to
engineer the strain field inside and around the QD structures, allowing tuning

demonstration that dependence of form factors on the spectator quark mass
between light and strange is very small. Apart from the phenomenology
implications, this has practical application to the normalisation of branching

interacting holographic dark energy. By obtaining conditions needed for some
observational evidence such as, positive acceleration expansion of universe,
crossing the phantom divide line and validity of thermodynamics second law in
an interacting HDE model and corresponding it with $f(R)$ mode of gravity we
find a viable $f(R)$ model which can explain the present universe. We also
obtain the explicit evolutionary forms of the corresponding scalar field,
potential and scale factor of universe.

phenomenological kind of dark energy (DE), which is known as QCD ghost dark
energy. Since this kind of dark energy is not stable in the context of
Einsteinian theory of gravity and Brans-Dicke model of gravity, we consider two
kinds of correspondence between modified gravity and DE. By studding the
dynamical evolution of model and finding relevant quantities such as, equation
of state parameter, deceleration parameter, dimensionless density parameter, we
show that the model can describe the present Universe and also the EoS
parameter can cross the phantom divide line without needs to any kinetic energy
with negative sign. Furthermore, by obtaining the adiabatic squared sound speed
of the model for different cases of interaction, we show that this model is
stable.
  Finally, we fit this model with supernova observational data in a non
interaction case and we find the best values of parameter at $1\sigma$
confidence interval as; $f_0=0.958^{+0.07}_{-0.25}$,
$\beta=-0,256^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$, and $\Om_{m_0} = 0.23^{+0.3}_{-0.15}$. These
best-fit values show that dark energy equation of state parameter, $\om_{d_0}$,
can cross the phantom divide line at the present time.
