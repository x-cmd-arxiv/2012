equations of the bosonic dynamical mean-field theory (B-DMFT) in the
strong-coupling limit. The approach is based on a linked-cluster expansion in
the hybridization function of normal bosons around the atomic limit. The
solution is used to compute the phase diagram of the bosonic Hubbard model for
different lattices. We compare our results with numerical solutions of the
B-DMFT equations and numerically exact methods, respectively. The very good
agreement with those numerical results demonstrates that our approach captures
the essential physics of correlated bosons both in the Mott insulator and in
the superfluid phase. Close to the transition into the superfluid phase the
momentum distribution function at zero momentum is found to be strongly
enhanced already in the normal phase. The linked-cluster expansion also allows
us to compute dynamical properties such as the spectral function of bosons. The
evolution of the spectral function across the transition from the normal to the
superfluid phase is seen to be characteristically different for the interaction
driven and density driven transition, respectively.

majority of experiments entanglement witnesses (EW) are used in order to prove
the presence of entanglement in a quantum state. EWs can be constructed from
available measurement results and do not require a reconstruction of the whole
density matrix (full tomography), which is especially valuable for
high-dimensional systems. We provide a method to construct {\it accessible
nonlinear EWs}, which incorporate two important properties. First, they improve
on linear EWs in the sense that each non-linear EW detects more entangled
states than its linear counterpart and therefore allow the verification of
entanglement without critical dependence on having found the 'right' linear
witness. Second, they can be evaluated using exactly the same data as for the
evaluation of the original linear witness. This allows a reanalysis of
published experimental data to strengthen statements about entanglement
verification without the requirement to perform additional measurements. These
particular properties make the accessible nonlinear EWs attractive for the
implementations in current experiments, for they can also enhance the
statistical significance of the entanglement verification.

the early-type merger remnant galaxy NGC 1316 which hosts a significant
population of metal-rich globular clusters of intermediate age (~3 Gyr). For
the old, metal-poor (`blue') clusters, the peak mass of the mass function M_p
increases with internal half-mass density rho_h as (M_p proportional to
rho_h^0.44) whereas it stays approximately constant with galactocentric
distance R_gal. The mass functions of these clusters are consistent with a
simple scenario in which they formed with a Schechter initial mass function and
evolved subsequently by internal two-body relaxation. For the intermediate-age
population of metal-rich (""red"") clusters, the faint end of the previously
reported power-law luminosity function of the clusters with R_gal > 9 kpc is
due to many of those clusters having radii larger than the theoretical maximum
value imposed by the tidal field of NGC 1316 at their R_gal. This renders
disruption by two-body relaxation ineffective. Only a few such diffuse clusters
are found in the inner regions of NGC 1316. Completeness tests indicate that
this is a physical effect. Using comparisons with star clusters in other
galaxies and cluster disruption calculations using published models, we
hypothesize that most red clusters in the low-rho_h tail of the initial
distribution have already been destroyed in the inner regions of NGC 1316 by
tidal shocking, and that several remaining low-rho_h clusters will evolve
dynamically to become similar to ""faint fuzzies"" that exist in several
lenticular galaxies. Finally, we discuss the nature of diffuse red clusters in
early-type galaxies.

finite nuclei behave like molecules composed of clusters of protons and
neutrons. Clustering is a recurrent feature in light nuclei, from beryllium to
nickel. For instance, in $^{12}$C the Hoyle state, crucial for stellar
nucleosynthesis, can be described as a nuclear molecule consisting of three
alpha-particles. The mechanism of cluster formation, however, has not yet been
fully understood. We show that the origin of clustering can be traced back to
the depth of the confining nuclear potential. By employing the theoretical
framework of energy density functionals that encompasses both cluster and
quantum liquid-drop aspects of nuclei, it is shown that the depth of the
potential determines the energy spacings between single-nucleon orbitals, the
localization of the corresponding wave functions and, therefore, the degree of
nucleonic density clustering. Relativistic functionals, in particular, are
characterized by deep single-nucleon potentials. When compared to
non-relativistic functionals that yield similar ground-state properties
(binding energy, deformation, radii), they predict the occurrence of much more
pronounced cluster structures. More generally, clustering is considered as a
transitional phenomenon between crystalline and quantum liquid phases of
fermionic systems.

detect the weak signal from the selected edge states on a dark background, and
drastically improves the detectivity. It also leads to the possibility to
directly visualize the topological edge states, using in situ imaging, offering
a unique and instructive view on topological insulating phases.

with the nervous impulse, e.g., the propagation velocity as well as the
measured reversible heat production and changes in thickness and length that
cannot be explained with traditional nerve models. A necessary condition for
solitary pulse propagation is the simultaneous existence of nonlinearity and
dispersion, i.e., the dependence of the speed of sound on density and
frequency. A prerequisite for the nonlinearity is the presence of a chain
melting transition close to physiological temperatures. The transition causes a
density dependence of the elastic constants which can easily be determined by
experiment. The frequency dependence is more difficult to determine. The
typical time scale of a nerve pulse is 1 ms, corresponding to a characteristic
frequency in the range up to one kHz. Dispersion in the sub-kHz regime is
difficult to measure due to the very long wave lengths involved. In this
contribution we address theoretically the dispersion of the speed of sound in
lipid membranes and relate it to experimentally accessible relaxation times by
using linear response theory. This ultimately leads to an extension of the
differential equation for soliton propagation.

different classes of characteristics are observed with coincident negative,
positive, or both negative and positive Doppler shifts of a few km/s. The
appearance of SCBs precede peak flare intensity by ~12 minutes and decay ~1

decrease across the observations indicating variability of the AGN, with the

  at JNCS: Vural-Leggett (2011)",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Disordered solids are known to exhibit quantitative universalities at low
temperatures, the most striking of which is the ultrasonic attenuation
coefficient Q. The established theory of tunneling two state systems (TTLS) in
its original form (i.e. without extra fitting functions and parameters), is
unable to explain this universality. While the TTLS model can be modified,
particularly by including long range phonon induced interactions to explain the
universal value of Q, (a) it is not clear that the essential features of the
original model that has been successful in explaining the experimental data is
preserved, and (b) even if it is, it is not clear that the postulates of the
original model remain necessary. The purpose of this study is to derive the
universal acoustic absorption and related quantities observed in disordered
solids by starting from a many-body quantum theory of unspecified amorphous
blocks that mutually interact through the strain field. Based on very generic
assumptions and having no adjustable fitting parameters, the frequency and
initial state averaged macroscopic attenuation of a group of interacting
disordered blocks is calculated in the low temperature regime by a novel ""trace
method"", which then is iterated up-to experimental length scales through a real
space renormalization group approach. Then using a heuristic second-order
perturbation argument, the frequency dependence of Q is found, and combined
with the previous result to yield the observed universal values in the MHz-Ghz
range of frequencies. It is concluded that strong microscopic postulates are
not necessary in order to explain the thermal conductivity, velocity shift and
sound attenuation of disordered media in the low temperature regime.

the prototypes of many-body systems with long-range interactions, and should be
the natural arena where to test theoretical predictions on the statistical
behaviour of long-range-interacting systems. Systems of classical
self-gravitating particles can be studied with the standard tools of
equilibrium statistical mechanics, provided the potential is regularized at
small length scales and the system is confined in a box. The confinement
condition looks rather unphysical in general, so that it is natural to ask
whether what we learn with these studies is relevant to real self-gravitating
systems. In order to provide a first answer to this question we consider a
basic, simple, yet effective model of globular clusters, the King model. This
model describes a self-consistently confined system, without the need of any
external box, but the stationary state is a non-thermal one. In particular, we
consider the King model with a short-distance cutoff on the interactions and we
discuss how such a cutoff affects the caloric curve, i.e. the relation between
temperature and energy. We find that the cutoff stabilizes a low-energy phase
which is absent in the King model without cutoff; the caloric curve of the
model with cutoff turns out to be very similar to that of previously studied
confined and regularized models, but for the absence of a high-energy gas-like
phase. We briefly discuss the possible phenomenological as well as theoretical
implications of these results.

reproduce asexually. In a seminal piece of work, Eigen and coauthors proposed
the quasispecies model in an attempt to understand such an evolutionary
process. Their work has impacted antiviral treatment and vaccine design
strategies. Yet, predictions of the quasispecies model are at best viewed as a
guideline, primarily because it assumes an infinite population size, whereas
realistic population sizes can be quite small. In this paper we consider a
population genetics-based model aimed at understanding the evolution of such
organisms with finite population sizes and present a rigorous study of the
convergence and computational issues that arise therein. Our first result is
structural and shows that, at any time during the evolution, as the population
size tends to infinity, the distribution of genomes predicted by our model
converges to that predicted by the quasispecies model. This justifies the
continued use of the quasispecies model to derive guidelines for intervention.
While the stationary state in the quasispecies model is readily obtained, due
to the explosion of the state space in our model, exact computations are
prohibitive. Our second set of results are computational in nature and address
this issue. We derive conditions on the parameters of evolution under which our
stochastic model mixes rapidly. Further, for a class of widely used fitness
landscapes we give a fast deterministic algorithm which computes the stationary
distribution of our model. These computational tools are expected to serve as a
framework for the modeling of strategies for the deployment of mutagenic drugs.

time. The skewness of the light curve appears to be compatible both with
binary-lens and binary-source models, including the possibility that the lens
system consists of an M dwarf orbited by a brown dwarf. The detection of this
microlensing anomaly and our analysis demonstrates that: 1) automated real-time
detection of weak microlensing anomalies with immediate feedback is feasible,
efficient, and sensitive, 2) rather common weak features intrinsically come
with ambiguities that are not easily resolved from photometric light curves, 3)
a modelling approach that finds all features of parameter space rather than
just the `favourite model' is required, and 4) the data quality is most
crucial, where systematics can be confused with real features, in particular
small higher-order effects such as orbital motion signatures. It moreover
becomes apparent that events with weak signatures are a silver mine for
statistical studies, although not easy to exploit. Clues about the apparent
paucity of both brown-dwarf companions and binary-source microlensing events
might hide here.

because it determines the quality of the snapshot point spread function (PSF,
or array beam). This is particularly true for experiments targeting the 21 cm
Epoch of Reionization signal as the quality of the foreground subtraction
depends directly on the spatial dynamic range and thus the smoothness of the
baseline distribution. Nearly all sites have constraints on where antennas can
be placed---even at the remote Australian location of the MWA (Murchison
Widefield Array) there are rock outcrops, flood zones, heritages areas,
emergency runways and trees. These exclusion areas can introduce spatial
structure into the baseline distribution that enhance the PSF sidelobes and
reduce the angular dynamic range. In this paper we present a new method of
constrained antenna placement that reduces the spatial structure in the
baseline distribution. This method not only outperforms random placement
algorithms that avoid exclusion zones, but surprisingly outperforms random
placement algorithms without constraints to provide what we believe are the
smoothest constrained baseline distributions developed to date. We use our new
algorithm to determine antenna placements for the originally planned MWA, and
present the antenna locations, baseline distribution, and snapshot PSF for this
array choice.

evidence suggests that subtotal order is actually slightly faster for the

because the weight vectors associated with the natural subtotal weight matrix

different, and Mathematica also uses those the corresponding weight vectors to
help select successive S polynomials and divisor polynomials: Those selection
heuristics appear to work slightly better more often with subtotal weight
vectors.

approach that lumps all interference into a single deterministic or random
parameter in a Wyner-type model, or via complex system level simulations that
often do not provide insight into why various trends are observed. This paper
proposes a novel middle way using point processes that is both accurate and
also results in easy-to-evaluate integral expressions based on the Laplace
transform of the interference. We assume mobiles and base stations are randomly
placed in the network with each mobile pairing up to its closest base station.
Compared to related recent work on downlink analysis, the proposed uplink model
differs in two key features. First, dependence is considered between user and
base station point processes to make sure each base station serves a single
mobile in the given resource block. Second, per-mobile power control is
included, which further couples the transmission of mobiles due to
location-dependent channel inversion. Nevertheless, we succeed in deriving the
coverage (equivalently outage) probability of a typical link in the network.
This model can be used to address a wide variety of system design questions in
the future. In this paper we focus on the implications for power control and
see that partial channel inversion should be used at low
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), while full power transmission
is optimal at higher SINR.

that such signals are most likely subdominant, the search for pronounced

monochromatic gamma-ray lines or similar features related to internal
bremsstrahlung, in particular, provide smoking gun signatures. We perform a
dedicated search for the latter in the data taken by the Fermi gamma-ray space
telescope during its first 43 months. To this end, we use a new adaptive
procedure to select optimal target regions that takes into account both
standard and contracted dark matter profiles. The behaviour of our statistical
method is tested by a subsampling analysis of the full sky data and found to
reproduce the theoretical expectations very well. The limits on the dark matter
annihilation cross-section that we derive are stronger than what can be
obtained from the observation of dwarf galaxies and, at least for the model
considered here, collider searches. While these limits are still not quite
strong enough to probe annihilation rates expected for thermally produced dark
matter, future prospects to do so are very good. In fact, we already find a
weak indication, with a significance of 3.1\sigma (4.3\sigma) when (not) taking
into account the look-elsewhere effect, for an internal bremsstrahlung-like
signal that would correspond to a dark matter mass of \sim150 GeV; the same
signal is also well fitted by a gamma-ray line at around 130 GeV. Although this
would be a fascinating possibility, we caution that a much more dedicated

Differential equations of $g(T)$ are established and solved, leading to the

Moreover, we take into account the viscosity in the fluid and discuss three
interesting cases: constant viscosity, viscosity proportional to $\sqrt{-T}$

radius of only r_e = 0.45\pm0.05kpc. We study the structure and kinematics with

lend support to the idea that a fraction of z\sim2 compact galaxies have

~ 2-4) bright submillimetre galaxy (SMG) population is heterogeneous, with
major mergers contributing both at early stages, where quiescently star-forming
discs are blended into one submm source (`galaxy-pair SMGs'), and late stages,
where mutual tidal torques drive gas inflows and cause strong starbursts. Here
we combine hydrodynamic simulations of major mergers with 3-D dust radiative
transfer calculations to determine observational diagnostics that can
distinguish between quiescently star-forming SMGs and starburst SMGs via
integrated data alone. We fit the far-IR SEDs of the simulated galaxies with
the optically thin single-temperature modified blackbody, the full form of the
single-temperature modified blackbody, and a power-law temperature-distribution
model. The effective dust temperature, T_dust, and power-law index of the dust
emissivity in the far-IR, \beta, derived can significantly depend on the
fitting form used, and the intrinsic \beta\ of the dust is not recovered.
However, for all forms used here, there is a T_dust above which almost all
simulated galaxies are starbursts, so a T_dust cut is very effective at
selecting starbursts. Simulated merger-induced starbursts also have higher
L_IR/M_gas and L_IR/L_FUV than quiescently star-forming galaxies and lie above
the star formation rate-stellar mass relation. These diagnostics can be used to
test our claim that the SMG population is heterogeneous and to observationally
determine what star formation mode dominates a given galaxy population. We
comment on applicability of these diagnostics to ULIRGs that would not be
selected as SMGs. These `hot-dust ULIRGs' are typically starburst galaxies
lower in mass than SMGs, but they can also simply be SMGs observed from a
different viewing angle.

kinematics and stellar properties of this system. The HI morphologies of NGC
4656UV and its parent galaxy NGC 4656 are extremely disturbed, with significant
amounts of counterrotating and extraplanar gas. From UV-FIR photometry,
computed using a new method to correct for surface gradients on faint objects,
we find that NGC 4656UV has no significant dust opacity and a blue spectral
energy distribution. We compute a star formation rate of 0.027 M_sun yr^-1 from
the FUV flux and measure a total HI mass of 3.8x10^8 M_sun for the object.
Evolutionary synthesis modeling indicates that NGC 4656UV is a low metallicity
system whose only major burst of star formation occurred within the last
~260-290 Myr. The age of the stellar population is consistent with a rough
timescale for a recent tidal interaction between NGC 4656 and NGC 4631,
although we discuss the true nature of the object--whether it is tidal or
pre-existing in origin--in the context of its metallicity being a factor of ten
lower than its parent galaxy. We estimate that NGC 4656UV is either marginally
bound or unbound. If bound, it contains relatively low amounts of dark matter.

dynamic system than is currently possible for most TDG candidates.

violation on t-channel mediator models explaining the top AFB excess measured
by CDF and D0. Flavor-violating u-t or d-t couplings of new scalar or vector
mediators generate at one-loop an anomalous contribution to the nuclear weak

t-channel models that give rise to a greater than 20% AFB at the parton level
for M_tt > 450 GeV while not producing too large a top cross-section. Even
stronger constraints are expected through future measurements of the proton
weak charge by the Q-Weak experiment.

of dust in the z ~< 2 universe. Dust grains 0.1- 1 um in size will scatter soft
X-rays, producing a diffuse ""halo"" image around an X-ray point source, with a
brightness ~ few % confined to an arcminute-sized region. We derive the
formulae for scattering in a cosmological context and calculate the surface
brightness of the scattering halo due to (i) an IGM uniformly enriched (Omega_
d ~ 10^-5) by a power-law distribution of grain sizes, and (ii) a DLA-type (N_H
~ 10^21 cm^-2) dust screen at cosmological distances. The morphology of the
surface brightness profile can distinguish between the two scenarios above,
place size constraints on dusty clumps, and constrain the homogeneity of the
IGM. Thus X-ray scattering can gauge the relative contribution of the first
stars, dwarf galaxies, and galactic outflows to the cosmic metallicity budget
and cosmic history of dust. We show that, because the amount of intergalactic
scattering is overestimated for photon energies < 1 keV, the non-detection of
an X-ray scattering halo by Petric et al. (2006) is consistent with `grey'
intergalactic dust grains (Omega_d ~ 10^-5$) when the data is restricted to the

cluster member galaxies with spectroscopic confirmations in the wide-field
image of the Subaru Deep Field (SDF). The overdensity of the protocluster is
significant at the 6 sigma level, based on the surface number density of
i'-dropout galaxies. The overdense region covers ~36 sq. arcmin, and includes
30 i'-dropout galaxies. Follow-up spectroscopy revealed that 15 of these are
real z~6 galaxies (5.7 < z < 6.3). Eight of the 15 are clustering in a narrow
redshift range centered at z=6.01, corresponding to a seven-fold increase in
number density over the average in redshift space. We found no significant
difference in the observed properties, such as Ly-alpha luminosities and UV
continuum magnitudes, between the eight protocluster members and the seven
non-members. The velocity dispersion of the eight protocluster members is 647
km/s, which is about three times higher than that predicted by the standard
cold dark matter model. This discrepancy could be attributed to the
distinguishing three-dimensional distribution of the eight protocluster
members. We discuss two possible explanations for this discrepancy: either the
protocluster is already mature, with old galaxies at the center, or it is still
immature and composed of three subgroups merging to become a larger cluster. In
either case, this concentration of z=6.01 galaxies in the SDF may be one of the
first sites of formation of a galaxy cluster in the universe.

Submillimeter Array and the Plateau de Bure Interferometer to obtain high
angular resolution (~1.5"" or 160 pc) images of the Antennae overlap region in
CO(2--1) to search for the molecular progenitors of the super star clusters. We
resolve the molecular gas distribution into a large number of clouds, extending
the differential cloud mass function down to a 5\sigma completeness limit of
3.8x10^5 M_sun. We identify a distinct break in the mass function around log
M_mol/M_sun ~ 6.5, which separates the molecular clouds into two distinct
populations. The smaller, less massive clouds reside in more quiescent areas in
the region, while the larger, more massive clouds cluster around regions of
intense star formation. A broken power-law fit to the mass function yields
slopes of \alpha = -1.39+/-0.10 and \alpha = -1.44+/-0.14 for the low- and
high-mass cloud population, well-matched to the mass function found for super
star clusters in the Antennae galaxies. We find large velocity gradients and
velocity dispersions at the locations of intense star formation, suggestive of
compressive shocks. It is likely that these environmental factors contribute to
the formation of the observed massive molecular clouds and super star clusters

of the so called unidentified gamma-ray sources remain unknown. The large
number of these sources suggests that among them there could be a population
that significantly contributes to the isotropic gamma-ray background and is
therefore crucial to understand their nature. The first step toward a complete
comprehension of the unidentified gamma-ray source population is to identify
those that can be associated with blazars, the most numerous class of
extragalactic sources in the gamma-ray sky. Recently, we discovered that
blazars can be recognized and separated from other extragalactic sources using
the infrared (IR) WISE satellite colors. The blazar population delineates a
remarkable and distinctive region of the IR color-color space, the WISE blazar
strip. In particular, the subregion delineated by the gamma-ray emitting
blazars is even narrower and we named it as the WISE Gamma-ray Strip (WGS). In
this paper we parametrize the WGS on the basis of a single parameter s that we
then use to determine if gamma-ray Active Galactic Nuclei of the uncertain type
(AGUs) detected by Fermi are consistent with the WGS and so can be considered
blazar candidates. We find that 54 AGUs out of a set 60 analyzed have IR colors
consistent with the WGS; only 6 AGUs are outliers. This result implies that a
very high percentage (i.e., in this sample about 90%) of the AGUs detected by

galaxy, 4C+29.30 (z=0.0647). The Chandra image resolves structures on
sub-arcsec to arcsec scales, revealing complex X-ray morphology and detecting
the main radio features: the nucleus, a jet, hotspots, and lobes. The nucleus
is absorbed (N(H)=3.95 (+0.27/-0.33)x10^23 atoms/cm^2) with an unabsorbed
luminosity of L(2-10 keV) ~ (5.08 +/-0.52) 10^43 erg/s characteristic of Type 2
AGN. Regions of soft (<2 keV) X-ray emission that trace the hot interstellar
medium (ISM) are correlated with radio structures along the main radio axis
indicating a strong relation between the two. The X-ray emission beyond the
radio source correlates with the morphology of optical line-emitting regions.
We measured the ISM temperature in several regions across the galaxy to be kT ~
0.5 with slightly higher temperatures (of a few keV) in the center and in the
vicinity of the radio hotspots. Assuming these regions were heated by weak
shocks driven by the expanding radio source, we estimated the corresponding
Mach number of 1.6 in the southern regions. The thermal pressure of the X-ray
emitting gas in the outermost regions suggest the hot ISM is slightly
under-pressured with respect to the cold optical-line emitting gas and
radio-emitting plasma, which both seem to be in a rough pressure equilibrium.
We conclude that 4C+29.30 displays a complex view of interactions between the
jet-driven radio outflow and host galaxy environment, signaling feedback
processes closely associated with the central active nucleus.

in clusters, and thus has a large impact on the evolution of cluster galaxies.
Recent observations have shown that key properties of ram pressure stripped
tails of galaxies are in conflict with predictions by simulations. To increase
the realism of existing simulations, we simulated for the first time a disk
galaxy exposed to a uniformly magnetized wind including radiative cooling and
self-gravity of the gas. We find that B-fields have a strong effect on the
morphology of the gas in the tail of the galaxy. While in the pure hydro case
the tail is very clumpy, the MHD case shows very filamentary structures in the
tail. The filaments can be strongly supported by magnetic pressure and, when
this is the case, the B-field vectors tend to be aligned with the filaments.
The ram pressure stripping may lead to the formation of magnetized density
tails that appear as bifurcated in the plane of the sky and resemble the double
tails observed in ESO 137-001 and ESO 137-002. Such tails can be formed under a
variety of situations, both for the disks oriented face-on with respect to the
ICM wind and for the tilted ones. While this bifurcation is due to the generic
tendency for the B-fields to produce very filamentary tail morphology, the tail
properties are further shaped by the combination of the B-field orientation and
the sliding of the field past the disk surface exposed to the wind. Magnetic
draping does not strongly change the rate of gas stripping. For a face-on
galaxy, the field tends to reduce the amount of stripping compared to the pure
hydro case, and is associated with the formation of a magnetic draping layer on
the side of the galaxy exposed to the ICM wind. For significantly tilted disks,
the stripping rate may be enhanced by the ``scraping'' of the disk surface by
the B-fields sliding past the ISM/ICM interface.

recorded with a binning of 50 ms over the time span of ~10 yr. In spite of the
fact that SPI-ACS does not have imaging capability, it provides high statistics
signal for each GRB event, because of its large effective area. We classify all
isolated excesses in the SPI-ACS count rate into three types: short spikes
produced by cosmic rays, GRBs and Solar flare induced events. We find some
~1500 GRB-like events in the 10 yr exposure. A significant fraction of the
GRB-like events identified in SPI-ACS occur in coincidence with triggers of
other gamma-ray telescopes and could be considered as confirmed GRBs. We study
the distribution of durations of the GRBs detected by SPI-ACS and find that the
peak of the distribution of long GRBs is at ~ 20, i.e. somewhat shorter than
for the long GRBs detected by BATSE. Contrary to the BATSE observation, the
population of short GRBs does not have any characteristic time scale. Instead,
the distribution of durations extends as a powerlaw to the shortest time scale
accessible for SPI-ACS, < 50 ms. We also find that a large fraction of long
GRBs has a characteristic variability time scale of the order of 1 s. We
discuss the possible origin of this time scale.

results indicate that the presence of NH2, H2PO3, NO2, and COOH functional

and entanglement, with many applications in quantum information. Despite the
huge literature on Bell inequalities, it is not easy to find a clear conceptual
answer to what a Bell inequality is, or a clear guiding principle as to how
they may be derived. In this paper, we introduce a notion of logical Bell
inequality which can be used to systematically derive testable inequalities for
a very wide variety of situations. There is a single clear conceptual
principle, based on purely logical consistency conditions, which underlies our
notion of logical Bell inequalities. We show that in a precise sense, all Bell
inequalities can be taken to be of this form. Our approach is very general. It
applies directly to any family of sets of commuting observables. Thus it covers
not only the n-partite scenarios to which Bell inequalities are standardly
applied, but also Kochen-Specker configurations, and many other examples. There
is much current work on experimental tests for contextuality. Our approach
directly yields, in a systematic fashion, testable inequalities for a very
general notion of contextuality.
  There has been much work on obtaining proofs of Bell's theorem `without
inequalities' or `without probabilities'. These proofs are seen as being in a
sense more definitive and logically robust than the inequality-based proofs. On
the hand, they lack the fault-tolerant aspect of inequalities. Our approach
reconciles these aspects, and in fact shows how the logical robustness can be
converted into systematic, general derivations of inequalities with provable
violations. Moreover, the kind of strong non-locality or contextuality
exhibited by the GHZ argument or by Kochen-Specker configurations can be shown
to lead to maximal violations of the corresponding logical Bell inequalities.

quasars is presented. New Subaru/Suprime-Cam observation is combined with
literature search, resulting in a compilation of 81 EELR measurements for
type-1 and type-2 quasars with associated active galactic nucleus (AGN) and
host galaxy properties. It is found that EELR phenomenon shows clear
correlation with Eddington ratio, which links EELR to the constituents of the
principal component 1 (PC 1), or eigenvector 1, of the AGN emission
correlations. We also find that EELR is preferentially associated with
gas-rich, massive blue galaxies. It supports the idea that the primary
determinant of EELR creation is the gas availability and that the gas may be
brought in by galaxy merger triggering the current star formation as well as
AGN activity, and also gives an explanation for the fact that most luminous
EELR is found around radio-loud sources with low Eddington ratio. By combining
all the observations, it is suggested that EELR quasars occupy the massive blue
corner of the green valley, the AGN realm, on the galaxy color - stellar mass
diagram. Once a galaxy is pushed to this corner, activated AGN would create
EELR by the energy injection into the interstellar gas and eventually blow it
away, leading to star-formation quenching. The results presented here provide a
piece of evidence for the presence of such AGN feedback process, which may be
playing a leading role in the co-evolution of galaxies and central
super-massive black holes.

dwarf novae using multi-band light curves of early superhumps. Our model
assumes that early superhumps are caused by the rotation effect of
non-axisymmetrically flaring disks. We have developed a Bayesian model for this
reconstruction, in which a smoother disk-structure tends to have a higher prior
probability. We analyzed simultaneous optical and near-infrared photometric
data of early superhumps of the dwarf nova, V455 And using this technique. The
reconstructed disk has two flaring parts in the outermost region of the disk.
These parts are responsible for the primary and secondary maxima of the light
curves. The height-to-radius ratio is h/r=0.20-0.25 in the outermost region. In
addition to the outermost flaring structures, flaring arm-like patterns can be
seen in an inner region of the reconstructed disk. The overall profile of the
reconstructed disk is reminiscent of the disk structure that is deformed by the
tidal effect. However, an inner arm-like pattern, which is responsible for the
secondary minimum in the light curve, cannot be reproduced only by the tidal
effect. It implies the presence of another mechanism that deforms the disk
structure. Alternatively, the temperature distribution of the disk could be
non-axisymmetric. We demonstrate that the disk structure with weaker arm-like
patterns is optimal in the model including the irradiation effect. However, the
strongly irradiated disk gives quite blue colors, which may conflict with the
observation. Our results suggest that the amplitude of early superhumps depends
mainly on the height of the outermost flaring regions of the disk. We predict
that early superhumps can be detected with an amplitude of >0.02 mag in about
90% of WZ Sge stars.

in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable,

can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon
explicit-duration semi-Markovianity, which has been developed mainly in the

  In this paper we introduce the explicit-duration Hierarchical Dirichlet

efficient posterior inference. The methods we introduce also provide new
methods for sampling inference in the finite Bayesian HSMM. Our modular Gibbs
sampling methods can be embedded in samplers for larger hierarchical Bayesian
models, adding semi-Markov chain modeling as another tool in the Bayesian
inference toolbox. We demonstrate the utility of the HDP-HSMM and our inference
methods on both synthetic and real experiments.

type, mode, and determinism systems. These systems not only provide Mercury
programmers with several direct software engineering benefits, such as
self-documenting code and clear program logic, but also give language
implementors a large amount of information that is useful for program analyses.
In this work, we make use of this information to develop program analyses that
determine the distribution of data into regions and transform Mercury programs
by inserting into them the necessary region operations. We prove the
correctness of our program analyses and transformation. To execute the
annotated programs, we have implemented runtime support that tackles the two
main challenges posed by backtracking. First, backtracking can require regions
removed during forward execution to be ""resurrected""; and second, any memory
allocated during a computation that has been backtracked over must be recovered
promptly and without waiting for the regions involved to come to the end of
their life. We describe in detail our solution of both these problems. We study
in detail how our RBMM system performs on a selection of benchmark programs,
including some well-known difficult cases for RBMM. Even with these difficult
cases, our RBMM-enabled Mercury system obtains clearly faster runtimes for 15

rate and the maximum flame tip velocity, and thereby moderates the finger flame

previous theoretical analysis. We have also conducted experiments for

galaxies in a zone of strong Galactic extinction (IC 342 group of galaxies).
The galaxy was resolved into stars with HST/ACS including old red giant branch.
We have constructed a model of the resolved stellar populations and measured
the star formation rate and metallicity as function of time. The main star
formation activity period occurred about 8 - 14 Gyr ago. These stars are mostly
metal-poor, with a mean metallicity [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 -- -2.0 dex. About 84 per
cent of the total stellar mass was formed during this event. There are also
indications of recent star formation starting about 1.5 Gyr ago and continuing
to the present. The star formation in this event shows moderate enhancement
from ~ 200 Myr to 300 Myr ago. It is very likely that the ongoing star
formation period has higher metallicity of about -0.6 -- -0.3 dex. UGCA 92 is

no causal or temporal connection between recent star formation events in these
two galaxies. We suggest that the starburst phenomenon in NGC 1569 is not
related to the galaxy's closest dwarf neighbours and does not affect their star
formation history.

sedimenting semiflexible polymers, ii) the propulsion and force-rectification
with a nano-machine realized by a rotating elastic rod, and iii) the
deformation of a brush made of grafted semiflexible polymers in shear flows. In
all these examples deformable polymers are subject to various hydrodynamic
flows and hydrodynamic interactions. Perfect stiff nano-cylinders are known to
show no orientational effects as they sediment through a viscous fluid, but it
is the coupling between elasticity and hydrodynamic torques that leads to an
orientation perpendicular to the direction of sedimentation. Likewise, a
rotating stiff rod does not lead to a net propulsion in the Stokes limit, but
if bending is allowed an effective thrust develops whose strength and direction
is independent of the sense of rotation and thus acts as a rectification
device. Lastly, surface-anchored polymers are deformed by shear flows, which
modifies the effective hydrodynamic boundary condition in a non-linear fashion.
All these results are obtained with hydrodynamic Brownian dynamics simulation
techniques, as appropriate for dilute systems. Scaling analyses are presented
when possible. The common theme is the interaction between elasticity of soft
matter and hydrodynamics, which can lead to qualitatively new effects.

to find quadratic permutation polynomials (QPP) based interleavers. Compared to
previous methods for founding QPP based interleavers, the search complexity is
reduced, allowing to find interleavers of higher length. This method has been
applied for QPP interleavers with lengths from the LTE (Long Term Evolution)
standard up to 1504. The analyzed classes are those with the largest spread QPP
(LS-QPP), with the D parameter equal to that of LTE interleaver (D_L_T_E-QPP),
and the class consisting of all QPP interleavers for lengths up to 1008. The
distance spectrum optimization is made for all classes. For the class of LS-QPP
interleavers of small lengths, the search led to superior or at least equal
performances with those of the LTE standard. For larger lengths the search in
the class of D_L_T_E-QPP interleavers is preferred. The interleavers from the
entire class of QPPs lead, in general, to weaker FER (Frame Error Rate)
performance.

the gravitational potential needs to be smoothed to avoid singularities in the
numerical evaluation of the gravitational potential or force. In order to
correctly resemble the realistic case of vertically extended 3D disks the
softening prescription used in 2D needs to be adjusted properly. In this paper
we analyze the embedded planet and the self-gravity case and provide a method
to evaluate the required smoothing in 2D simulations of thin disks. Starting
from the averaged hydrodynamic equations and using a vertically isothermal disk
model, we calculate the force. We compare our results to the often used Plummer
form of the potential which runs as \propto 1/(r^2+\epsilon^2)^{1/2}. For that
purpose we compute the required smoothing length \epsilon as a function of
distance r to the planet or to a disk element within a self-gravitating disk.
We find that for larger distances \epsilon is determined solely by the vertical
disk thickness H. For the planet case we find that outside r\simH a value of
\epsilon = 0.7H describes the averaged force very well, while in the
self-gravitating disk the value needs to be larger, \epsilon = 1.2H. For
smaller distances the smoothing needs to be reduced significantly. Comparing
torque densities of 3D and 2D simulations we show that the modification to the
vertical density stratification as induced by an embedded planet needs to be
taken into account to obtain agreeing results. In disk fragmentation
simulations the choice of \epsilon can determine whether a disk will fragment
or not. Because a wrong smoothing length can change even the direction of
migration, it is very important to include the effect of the planet on the
local scale height in 2D planet-disk simulations. We provide an approximate and
fast method for this purpose which gives very good agreement to full 3D
simulations.

successfully applied to describe cascades in a large variety of contexts. Over
the last decades, many efforts have been devoted to understand the typical
behaviour of the cascades arising from initial conditions extracted at random
from some given ensemble. However, the problem of optimizing the trajectory of

practically intractable, with the only exception of models that satisfy a sort
of diminishing returns property called submodularity. Submodular models can be
approximately solved by means of greedy strategies, but by definition they lack
cooperative characteristics which are fundamental in many real systems. Here we
introduce an efficient algorithm based on statistical physics for the
optimization of trajectories in cascade processes on graphs. We show that for a
wide class of irreversible dynamics, even in the absence of submodularity, the
spread optimization problem can be solved efficiently on large networks.
Analytic and algorithmic results on random graphs are complemented by the
solution of the spread maximization problem on a real-world network (the
Epinions consumer reviews network).

assumptions about the measurement error, and provides estimates that have

main limitation of such deterministic bounds lies on their potential
conservatism, thus leading to estimates of restricted use.
  In this paper, we propose a rapprochement between the stochastic and

combine elements from information-based complexity with recent developments in
the theory of randomized algorithms. The main idea in this line of research is
to ""discard"" sets of measure at most \epsilon, where \epsilon is a

are decreasing the so-called worst-case radius of information at the expense of
a given probabilistic ``risk.""
  In this setting, we compute a trade-off curve, called violation function,
which shows how the radius of information decreases as a function of the
accuracy. To this end, we construct randomized and deterministic algorithms
which provide approximations of this function. We report extensive simulations

designed for capturing at a macroscopic level some effects, due to the
microscopic granularity of the flow of cars, which would be lost with a purely
continuous approach. The starting point is a multiscale method for pedestrian
modeling, recently introduced in Cristiani et al., Multiscale Model. Simul.,
2011, in which measure-theoretic tools are used to manage the microscopic and
the macroscopic scales under a unique framework. In the resulting coupled model
the two scales coexist and share information, in the sense that the same system
is simultaneously described from both a discrete (microscopic) and a continuous
(macroscopic) perspective. This way it is possible to perform numerical
simulations in which the single trajectories and the average density of the
moving agents affect each other. Such a method is here revisited in order to
deal with multi-population traffic flow on networks. For illustrative purposes,
we focus on the simple case of the intersection of two roads. By exploiting one
of the main features of the multiscale method, namely its
dimension-independence, we treat one-dimensional roads and two-dimensional
junctions in a natural way, without referring to classical network theory.
Furthermore, thanks to the coupling between the microscopic and the macroscopic
scales, we model the continuous flow of cars without losing the right amount of
granularity, which characterizes the real physical system and triggers
self-organization effects, such as, for example, the oscillatory patterns
visible at jammed uncontrolled crossroads.

distributions agree with previous results, supporting the idea that
internetwork fields are weak and very inclined, at least in about one quarter
of the area occupied by the internetwork. These properties differ from those of
network fields. The average magnetic flux density and the mean field strength
derived from the 27.4% of the field of view with clear linear polarization
signals are 16.3 Mx cm-2 and 220 G, respectively. The ratio between the average
horizontal and vertical components of the field is approximately 3.1. The

in the beginning of cycle no.24. We analyze a sample of 183 sunspots observed
from 1999 until 2011 with the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter at the German
Vacuum Tower Telescope. The magnetic field strength is derived from the Zeeman
splitting of the Stokes-V signal in one near-infrared spectral line, either Fe
I 1564.8 nm, Fe I 1089.6 nm, or Si I 1082.7 nm. This avoids the effects of the
unpolarized stray light from the field-free quiet Sun surroundings. The minimum
umbral continuum intensity and umbral area are also measured. We find that
there is a systematic trend for sunspots in the late stage of the solar cycle
no.23 to be weaker, i.e., to have a smaller maximum magnetic field strength
than those at the start of the cycle. The decrease in the field strength with
time of about 94 G/yr is well beyond the statistical fluctuations that would be
expected because of the larger number of sunspots close to cycle maximum (14
G/yr). In the same time interval, the continuum intensity of the umbra
increases with a rate of 1.3 (+- 0.4)% of Ic/yr, while the umbral area does not
show any trend above the statistical variance. Sunspots in the new cycle no.24
show higher field strengths and lower continuum intensities than those at the
end of cycle no.23, interrupting the trend. Sunspots have an intrinsically
weaker field strength and brighter umbrae at the late stages of solar cycles
compared to their initial stages, without any significant change in their area.
The abrupt increase in field strength in sunspots of the new cycle suggests
that the cyclic variations are dominating over any long-term trend that
continues across cycles. We find a slight decrease in field strength and an
increase in intensity as a long-term trend across the cycles.

revealed that perturbative quantum field theory (pQFT) displays an astonishing
interplay between analysis (Riemann zeta functions), topology (Knot theory),
combinatorial graph theory (Feynman diagrams) and algebra (Hopf structure).
Since pQFT is an inherently complicated study, so far not exactly solvable and
replete with divergences, the essential simplicity of the relationships between
these areas can be somewhat obscured. The intention here is to display some of
the above-mentioned structures in the context of a simple bosonic quantum
theory, i.e. a quantum theory of non-commuting operators that do not depend on
space-time. The combinatorial properties of these boson creation and
annihilation operators, which is our chosen example, may be described by
graphs, analogous to the Feynman diagrams of pQFT, which we show possess a Hopf
algebra structure. Our approach is based on the quantum canonical partition
function for a boson gas.

their huge luminosities, has not been clarified yet. While a strong interaction
between SN ejecta and dense circumstellar media (CSM) is a leading scenario,
alternative models have been proposed. In this Letter, we suggest new
diagnostics to discriminate the strong SN-CSM interaction scenario from the
others: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the light
curve. This dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense CSM within
which the shock breakout occurs. If a dense CSM shell is located far at large
radii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the SN ejecta to reach it
and the early light curve can be powered by the SN ejecta before the collision.
Once the SN ejecta collides with the dense CSM, the electron density and thus
the Thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. Photons become unable to go
out of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results in
the dip in the light curve. This dip is a solid prediction from the strong
interaction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission.
Eventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense CSM, and the
luminosity increases by the continuous strong SN-CSM interaction, resulting in
an SLSN. The possible dip observed in the hydrogen-poor SLSN, 2006oz, could be
the first example of this signature and give support to the SN-CSM interaction
as the power source of SLSN 2006oz.

  Generals, Universal composability, Unique session identifiers",,,,"cs.CR cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of Authenticated Byzantine Generals (ABG) aims to simulate a
virtual reliable broadcast channel from the General to all the players via a
protocol over a real (point-to-point) network in the presence of faults. We
propose a new model to study the self-composition of ABG protocols. The central
dogma of our approach can be phrased as follows: Consider a player who
diligently executes (only) the delegated protocol but the adversary steals some
private information from him. Should such a player be considered faulty? With
respect to ABG protocols, we argue that the answer has to be no.
  In the new model we show that in spite of using unique session identifiers,
if $n < 2t$, there cannot exist any ABG protocol that composes in parallel even
twice. Further, for $n \geq 2t$, we design ABG protocols that compose for any
number of parallel executions. Besides investigating the composition of ABG
under a new light, our work also brings out several new insights into Canetti's
Universal Composability framework. Specifically, we show that there are several
undesirable effects if one deviates from our dogma. This provides further
evidence as to why our dogma is the right framework to study the composition of
ABG protocols.

asymmetric reflection and thermal re-radiation of absorbed sunlight are,
together with collisions and gravitational forces, primary mechanisms governing
the dynamical and physical evolution of asteroids. The Yarkovsky effect causes
orbital semi-major axis drift and the YORP effect causes changes in the
rotation rate and pole orientation. We present an adaptation of the Advanced
Thermophysical Model (ATPM) to simultaneously predict the Yarkovsky and YORP
effects in the presence of thermal-infrared beaming caused by surface
roughness, which has been neglected or dismissed in all previous models. Tests
on Gaussian random sphere shaped asteroids, and on the real shapes of asteroids
(1620) Geographos and (6489) Golevka, show that rough surface thermal-infrared
beaming enhances the Yarkovsky orbital drift by typically tens of percent but
it can be as much as a factor of two. The YORP rotational acceleration is on
average dampened by up to a third typically but can be as much as one half. We
find that the Yarkovsky orbital drift is only sensitive to the average degree,
and not to the spatial distribution, of roughness across an asteroid surface.
However, the YORP rotational acceleration is sensitive to the surface roughness
spatial distribution, and can add significant uncertainties to the predictions
for asteroids with relatively weak YORP effects. To accurately predict either
effect the degree and spatial distribution of roughness across an asteroid
surface must be known.

137 galaxies acquired at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, only four of which
have redshifts previously listed in the literature. We also used photometric
data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and from the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope archive. We combined galaxy velocities and positions to select 92
cluster galaxies and analyzed the internal cluster dynamics. We estimate a
cluster redshift of <z>=0.2782 and quite a high line-of-sight (LOS) velocity
dispersion of ~ 1300 km/s. Our 2D analysis confirms the presence of a bimodal
structure along the NW-SE direction. We add several pieces of information to
the previous merging scenario: the two subclusters (here A1758N(NW) and
A1758N(SE)) cannot be separated in the velocity analyses and we deduce a small
LOS velocity difference of ~300 km/s in the cluster rest-frame. The velocity
information successfully shows that A1758N is surrounded by two small groups
and active galaxies infalling onto, or escaping from, the cluster. Removing the
two groups, we estimate ~1000 km/s and ~800 km/s for the velocity dispertions
of A1758N(NW) and A1758N(SE), respectively. We find that Abell 1758N is a very
massive cluster with a range of M=2-3 10^15 solar masses, depending on the

radio emissions, Abell 1758N is a major cluster merger just forming a massive

models in close binary systems, such slow pulsations require a neutron star
magnetic field strength larger that the quantum critical value, suggesting the
presence of a magnetar. We present the first XMM-Newton observations of 4U

of 4U 2206+54 to search for the previously suggested cyclotron resonance
scattering feature at ~30 keV. We do not find a clear indication of the
presence of the line, although certain spectra display shallow dips, not always
at 30 keV. The association of these dips with a cyclotron line is very dubious
because of its apparent transient nature. We also investigate the energy
spectrum of 4U 2206+54 in the energy range 0.3-10 keV with unprecedented detail
and report for the first time the detection of very weak 6.5 keV fluorescence
iron lines. The photoelectric absorption is consistent with the interstellar
value, indicating very small amount of local matter, which would explain the
weakness of the florescence lines. The lack of matter locally to the source may
be the consequence of the relatively large orbital separation of the two
components of the binary. The wind would be too tenuous in the vicinity of the

Due to thermal fluctuations this barrier may be crossed. It turns out that the

analyzing infinite-state systems in which states are represented by terms, and
sets of states by Tree Automata (TA). The central problem in TRMC is to decide
whether a set of bad states is reachable. The problem of computing a TA
representing (an over- approximation of) the set of reachable states is
undecidable, but efficient solutions based on completion or iteration of tree
transducers exist. Unfortunately, the TRMC framework is unable to efficiently
capture both the complex structure of a system and of some of its features. As
an example, for JAVA programs, the structure of a term is mainly exploited to
capture the structure of a state of the system. On the counter part, integers
of the java programs have to be encoded with Peano numbers, which means that
any algebraic operation is potentially represented by thousands of applications
of rewriting rules. In this paper, we propose Lattice Tree Automata (LTAs), an
extended version of tree automata whose leaves are equipped with lattices. LTAs
allow us to represent possibly infinite sets of interpreted terms. Such terms
are capable to represent complex domains and related operations in an efficient
manner. We also extend classical Boolean operations to LTAs. Finally, as a
major contribution, we introduce a new completion-based algorithm for computing
the possibly infinite set of reachable interpreted terms in a finite amount of
time.

pancreas, liver and glands, are heavily branched structures. The branching
process during lung development has been studied in great detail and is
remarkably stereotyped. The branched tree is generated by the sequential,
non-random use of three geometrically simple modes of branching (domain
branching, planar and orthogonal bifurcation). While many regulatory components
and local interactions have been defined an integrated understanding of the
regulatory network that controls the branching process is lacking. We have
developed a deterministic, spatio-temporal differential-equation based model of
the core signaling network that governs lung branching morphogenesis. The model
focuses on the two key signaling factors that have been identified in
experiments, fibroblast growth factor (FGF10) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as well
as the SHH receptor patched (Ptc). We show that the reported biochemical
interactions give rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing patterning mechanisms that
allows us to reproduce experimental observations in wildtype and mutant mice.
The kinetic parameters as well as the domain shape are based on experimental
data where available. The developed model is robust to small absolute and large
relative changes in the parameter values. At the same time there is a strong
regulatory potential in that the switching between branching modes can be
achieved by targeted changes in the parameter values. We note that the sequence
of different branching events may also be the result of different growth
speeds: fast growth triggers lateral branching while slow growth favours
bifurcations in our model. We conclude that the FGF10-SHH-Ptc1 module is
sufficient to generate pattern that correspond to the observed branching modes

Applications of such algorithms include decentralized estimation, optimization,
control or computing. The algorithm consists in two steps: a local step, where
each node in a network updates a local estimate using a stochastic
approximation algorithm with decreasing step size, and a gossip step, where a
node computes a local weighted average between its estimates and those of its
neighbors. Convergence of the estimates toward a consensus is established under
weak assumptions. The approach relies on two main ingredients: the existence of
a Lyapunov function for the mean field in the agreement subspace, and a
contraction property of the random matrices of weights in the subspace
orthogonal to the agreement subspace. A second order analysis of the algorithm
is also performed under the form of a Central Limit Theorem. The

neighbors. The average left degree $\Delta$ is fixed, $\Delta \geq 2$. We ask
whether for the probability that $G$ has a left-perfect matching it is
advantageous not to fix $d_x$ for each left node $x$ but rather choose it at
random according to some (cleverly chosen) distribution. We show the following,
provided that the degrees of the left nodes are independent: If $\Delta$ is an
integer then it is optimal to use a fixed degree of $\Delta$ for all left
nodes. If $\Delta$ is non-integral then an optimal degree-distribution has the
property that each left node $x$ has two possible degrees, $\floor{\Delta}$ and
$\ceil{\Delta}$, with probability $p_x$ and $1-p_x$, respectively, where $p_x$
is from the closed interval $[0,1]$ and the average over all $p_x$ equals
$\ceil{\Delta}-\Delta$. Furthermore, if $n=c\cdot m$ and $\Delta>2$ is
constant, then each distribution of the left degrees that meets the conditions
above determines the same threshold $c^*(\Delta)$ that has the following
property as $n$ goes to infinity: If $c<c^*(\Delta)$ then there exists a
left-perfect matching with high probability. If $c>c^*(\Delta)$ then there
exists no left-perfect matching with high probability. The threshold
$c^*(\Delta)$ is the same as the known threshold for offline $k$-ary cuckoo
hashing for integral or non-integral $k=\Delta$.

Ions are not drawn to the walls and electrons are not repelled. Hence the
plasma electrons travel unobstructed to the walls, causing extreme particle and
energy fluxes. Each wall has a positive charge, forming a small potential
barrier or ""inverse sheath"" that pulls some secondaries back to the wall to
maintain the zero current condition.

causes strong correlations between velocity and phase for particles passing

allows us to tune the resulting velocity distributions at distinguished points
in the superlattice by means of local variations of the applied driving force.
As an intriguing application we present a scheme how initially diffusive
particles can be transformed into a monoenergetic pulsed particle beam whose
parameters such as its energy can be varied.

The dynamic spectrum was featured by a sudden break at about 43 MHz on the
well-observed harmonic branch. Before the break, the spectrum drifted gradually
with a mean rate of about -0.05 MHz/s. Following the break, the spectrum jumped
to lower frequencies. The post-break emission lasted for about three minutes.
It consisted of an overall slow drift which appeared to have a few fast drift
sub-bands. Simultaneous observations from the Solar TErrestrial RElations
Observatory (STEREO) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) were also
available and are examined for this event. We suggest that the slow-drift
period before the break was generated inside a streamer by a coronal eruption
driven shock, and the spectral break as well as the relatively wide spectrum
after the break is a consequence of the shock crossing the streamer boundary
where density drops abruptly. It is suggested that this type of radio bursts
can be taken as a unique diagnostic tool for inferring the coronal density
structure, as well as the radio emitting source region.

  Growing Sandpiles","51 p., low resolution figs",,,,"math.AP math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Existence of a solution to the quasi-variational inequality problem arising
in a model for sand surface evolution has been an open problem for a long time.
Another long-standing open problem concerns determining the dual variable, the
flux of sand pouring down the evolving sand surface, which is also of practical
interest in a variety of applications of this model. Previously, these problems
were solved for the special case in which the inequality is simply variational.
Here, we introduce a regularized mixed formulation involving both the primal
(sand surface) and dual (sand flux) variables. We derive, analyse and compare
two methods for the approximation, and numerical solution, of this mixed
problem. We prove subsequence convergence of both approximations, as the mesh
discretization parameters tend to zero; and hence prove existence of a solution
to this mixed model and the associated regularized quasi-variational inequality
problem. One of these numerical approximations, in which the flux is
approximated by the divergence-conforming lowest order Raviart-Thomas element,
leads to an efficient algorithm to compute not only the evolving pile surface,
but also the flux of pouring sand. Results of our numerical experiments confirm
the validity of the regularization employed.

as vertices of the Paley graph. Two vertices are connected by an edge if their
difference is a square in the field. We will study some important properties of
the Paley graphs. In particular, we will show that the Paley graphs are
connected, symmetric, and self-complementary. Also we will show that the Paley
graph of order q is (q-1)/2 -regular, and every two adjacent vertices have
(q-5)/4 common neighbors, and every two non-adjacent vertices have q-1/4 common
neighbors, which means that the Paley graphs are strongly regular with
parameters(q,q-1/2,q-5/4, q-1/4). Paley graphs are generalized by many
mathematicians. In the first section of Chapter 3 we will see three examples of
these generalizations and some of their basic properties. In the second section
of Chapter 3 we will define a new generalization of the Paley graphs, in which
pairs of elements of a finite field are connected by an edge if and only if
there difference belongs to the m-th power of the multiplicative group of the
field, for any odd integer m > 1, and we call them the m-Paley graphs. In the
third section we will show that the m-Paley graph of order q is complete if and
only if gcd(m, q - 1) = 1 and when d = gcd(m, q - 1) > 1, the m-Paley graph is
q-1/d -regular. Also we will prove that the m-Paley graphs are symmetric but
not self-complementary. We will show also that the m-Paley graphs of prime
order are connected but the m-Paley graphs of order p^n, n > 1 are not
necessary connected, for example they are disconnected if gcd(m, p^n - 1)
=(p^n-1)/ 2.

on the type of environment a firm faces, where environments are distinguished
in terms of their systems properties not their context. Particular emphasis is
given to turbulent environments in which outcomes are not a priori predictable
and are not traceable to individual firm actions and we show that, in these
conditions, the relevant unit of competitive response and understanding is no
longer the individual firm but the network of relations comprising
interdependent, interacting firms. Networks of relations are complex adaptive
systems that are more 'intelligent' than the individual firms that comprise
them and are capable of comprehending and responding to more complex and
turbulent environments. Yet they are co-produced by the patterns of actions and
interactions of the firms involved. The creation and accessing of such
distributed intelligence cannot be centrally directed, as this necessarily
limits it. Instead managers and firms are involved in a kind of participatory
planning and adaptation process through which the network self-organises and
adapts. Drawing on research in systems theory, complexity, biology and
cognitive science, extensions to the resource-based theory of the firm are
proposed that include how resources are linked across relations and network in
a dynamic and evolutionary way. The concept of an extended firm and soft
assembled strategies are introduced to describe the nature of the strategy
development process. This results in a more theoretically grounded basis for
understanding the nature and role of relationship and network strategies in
marketing and management. We finish by considering the research implications of
our analysis and the role of agent based models as a means of sensitising and
informing management action.
