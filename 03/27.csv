estimation of galaxy cluster masses. We use the publicly available galaxy
catalog produced using the semi-analytic model of De Lucia & Blaizot (2007) on
the Millenium Simulation (Springel et al. 2005). We explore the impacts on
selection using galaxy color, projected separation from the cluster center, and
galaxy luminosity. We study the relationship between cluster mass and velocity
dispersion and identify and characterize the following sources of bias and
scatter: halo triaxiality, dynamical friction of red luminous galaxies and
interlopers. We show that due to halo triaxiality the intrinsic scatter of
estimated line of sight dynamical mass is about three times larger (30-40%)
than the one estimated using the 3D velocity dispersion (~12%) and a small bias
(~1%) is induced. We find evidence of increasing scatter as a function of
redshift and provide a fitting formula to account for it. We characterize the
amount of bias and scatter introduced by dynamical friction when using
subsamples of red-luminous galaxies to estimate the velocity dispersion. We
study the presence of interlopers in spectroscopic samples and their effect on
the estimated cluster dynamical mass. Our results show that while cluster
velocity dispersions extracted from a few dozen red sequence selected galaxies
do not provide precise masses on a single cluster basis, an ensemble of cluster
velocity dispersions can be combined to produce a precise calibration of a
cluster survey mass observable relation. Currently, disagreements in the
literature on simulated subhalo velocity dispersion mass relations place a
systematic floor on velocity dispersion mass calibration at the 15% level in
mass. We show that the selection related uncertainties are small by comparison,
providing hope that with further improvements this systematic floor can be
reduced.

interpretation of Cartan geometry in terms of the mathematics of idealized
waywisers. Waywisers, also called hodometers, are instruments traditionally
used to measure distances. The mathematical representation of an idealized
waywiser consists of a choice of symmetric space called a {\em model space} and
represents the `wheel' of the idealized waywiser. The geometry of a manifold is
then completely characterized by a pair of variables $\{V^A(x),A^{AB}(x)\}$,
each of which admit simple interpretations: $V^A$ is the point of contact
between the waywiser's idealized wheel and the manifold whose geometry one
wishes to characterize, and $A^{AB}=A_\mu^{\phantom{\mu} AB}dx^\mu$ is a
connection one-form dictating how much the idealized wheel of the waywiser has
rotated when rolled along the manifold. The familiar objects from differential
geometry (e.g. metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, affine connection $\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\nu}$,
co-tetrad $e^I$, torsion $T^I$, spin-connection $\omega^{IJ}$, Riemannian
curvature $R^{IJ}$) can be seen as compound objects made out of the waywiser
variables $\{V^A,A^{AB}\}$. We then generalize this waywiser approach to
relativistic spacetimes and exhibit action principles for General Relativity in
terms of the waywiser variables for two choices of model spacetimes: De Sitter
and anti-De Sitter spacetimes.

supersymmetry with different states belonging to the same multiplet having the
same non-trivial part of the energy. We suggest, in particular, that a rational
coefficient (found by Basso for the folded string using Bethe Ansatz
considerations and which, in general, is yet to be determined by a direct
two-loop string calculation) should, in fact, be universal.

models; yet, it usually gets excessively concentrated around the single most
probable model, therefore achieving only sub-optimal classification
performance. The compression-based approach (Boulle, 2007) overcomes this
problem, averaging over the different models by applying a logarithmic
smoothing over the models' posterior probabilities. This approach has shown
excellent performances when applied to ensembles of naive Bayes classifiers.
AODE is another ensemble of models with high performance (Webb, 2005), based on
a collection of non-naive classifiers (called SPODE) whose probabilistic
predictions are aggregated by simple arithmetic mean. Aggregating the SPODEs
via BMA rather than by arithmetic mean deteriorates the performance; instead,
we aggregate the SPODEs via the compression coefficients and we show that the
resulting classifier obtains a slight but consistent improvement over AODE.
However, an important issue in any Bayesian ensemble of models is the
arbitrariness in the choice of the prior over the models. We address this
problem by the paradigm of credal classification, namely by substituting the
unique prior with a set of priors. Credal classifier automatically recognize
the prior-dependent instances, namely the instances whose most probable class
varies, when different priors are considered; in these cases, credal
classifiers remain reliable by returning a set of classes rather than a single
class. We thus develop the credal version of both the BMA-based and the
compression-based ensemble of SPODEs, substituting the single prior over the
models by a set of priors. Experiments show that both credal classifiers
provide higher classification reliability than their determinate counterparts;
moreover the compression-based credal classifier compares favorably to previous
credal classifiers.

instrumental to our understanding of star formation triggered by HII regions.
With the far-infrared (FIR) spectral coverage of the Herschel satellite, we can
access the wavelengths where these regions emit the majority of their energy
through their dust emission. At Herschel wavelengths 70 micron to 500 micron,
the emission associated with HII regions is dominated by the cool dust in their
photodissociation regions (PDRs). We find average dust temperatures of 26K
along the PDRs, with little variation between the HII regions in the sample,
while local filaments and infrared dark clouds average 19K and 15K
respectively. Higher temperatures lead to higher values of the Jeans mass,
which may affect future star formation. The mass of the material in the PDR,
collected through the expansion of the HII region, is between ~300 and ~10,000
Solar masses for the HII regions studied here. These masses are in rough
agreement with the expected masses swept up during the expansion of the \hii\
regions. Approximately 20% of the total FIR emission is from the direction of
the bubble central regions. This suggests that we are detecting emission from
the ""near-side"" and ""far-side"" PDRs along the line of sight and that bubbles
are three-dimensional structures. We find only weak support for a relationship
between dust temperature and beta, of a form similar to that caused by noise

Spectrum datasets may conform to a standard data model defined by SSA, or may
be native spectra with custom project-defined content. Spectra may be returned
in any of a number of standard data formats. Spectral data is generally stored
externally to the VO in a format specific to each spectral data collection;
currently there is no standard way to represent astronomical spectra, and
virtually every project does it differently. Hence spectra may be actively

energy to the free electron Dirac equation. When Dirac added potentials to his
free electron equation, there were two alternatives (here called D1 and D2). He
chose D1 and lost charge conjugation symmetry, found Ehrenfest equations that
depended on the sign of the energy of the state determining the expectation
value, encountered Klein tunneling, zitterbewegung and the Klein paradox. The
D1 alternative also predicted that deep potentials should pull positive energy
states down into the negative energy continuum, possibly creating an unstable
vacuum. Extensive experiments (1975-1997) found no evidence for this
instability, but did find low energy electron-positron pairs with sharply
defined energies and unusually low counting statistics. These pairs tended to
disappear with higher beam currents. This paper explores the other alternative,
here called D2 and finds charge conjugation symmetry preserved, Ehrenfest
equations are classical, Klein tunneling is not present, unstable vacuua are
forbidden, zitterbewegung is absent in the charge current density, new
excitations of bound electron-positron pairs are possible in atoms, and the
energies at which low energy electron-positron pair production in heavy ion
scattering occurs is well described. Also all of the positive energy
calculations, including those with the Coulomb potential, the hydrogen-like
atom, are retained exactly the same as found in alternative D1. It might have
been better if Dirac had chosen alternative D2.

As a consequence of the bulk outflow of the jet plasma, the pressure is likely
to be anisotropic, with the parallel pressure $P_{||}$ in the forward jet
direction exceeding the perpendicular pressure $P_{\perp}$. Under these
circumstances, the jet is susceptible to the firehose instability, which can
cause disruptions in the large scale jet structure and result in variability of
the observed radiation. For a realistic range of parameters, we find that the
growth timescale of the firehose instability is $\approx$ a few minutes, in
good agreement with the observed TeV variability timescales for Mrk 501 (Albert

perturbations along the magnetic field are considered. The induced return
current of the background plasma and back-reaction of cosmic rays are taken
into account. It is shown that the cosmic ray back-reaction results in the
streaming instability having considerably larger growth rates than that due to
the return current of the background plasma. This increase is by a factor of
the square root of the ratio of the background plasma mass density to the
cosmic ray mass density. The maximal growth rates and corresponding wave

action of cosmic rays in the model under consideration. The dispersion relation
for the thermal instability includes ion inertia. In the limit of fast thermal
energy exchange between electrons and ions, the isobaric and isochoric growth
rates are derived. The results obtained can be useful for the investigation of

results to set partitions whose arcs are labeled by an $r$-element set (which
we call \emph{$r$-colored set partitions}). In this context, a $k$-crossing or
$k$-nesting is a sequence of arcs, all with the same color, which form a

proof that the sequence counting noncrossing 2-colored set partitions is
P-recursive. We also discuss how our methods extend to several variations of

6\sqrt{n}. The original proof of Spencer was existential in nature, and did not

put the software into an unstable state. For such self-healing software
application, finding fix for a previously unseen fault is a grand challenge.
Asking the user to provide fixes for every fault is bad for productivity,
especially when the users are non-savvy in technical aspect of computing. If
failure scenarios come into existence, the user wants the runtime environment
to handle those situations autonomically. This paper presents a new technique
of finding self-healing actions by matching a fault scenario to already
established fault models. By profiling and capturing runtime parameters and
execution pathWays, stable execution models are established and later are used
to match with an unstable execution scenario. Experimentation and results are
presented that showed that even with additional overheads; this technique can
prove beneficial for autonomically healing faults and reliving system
administrators from mundane troubleshooting situations.

investigate its structure via classical methods of particle scattering. To
learn about its quark wave function, one studies those decay processes of this
meson in which a pair of photons is produced, where at least one of them is
virtual. The virtual photons have a non-zero mass and convert into
lepton-antilepton pairs. Therefore, information about the quarks' spatial
distribution inside the meson can be extracted from the lepton-antilepton
invariant mass distributions by comparing the empirical results with QED
predictions, which are based on the assumption that the meson is a point-like
particle. The deviation from the expected behavior in the leptonic mass
spectrum exposes the inner structure of the meson. This deviation is
characterized by a form factor. The corresponding data were collected for the
pd --> 3He eta reaction at a proton beam momentum of 1.69 GeV/c. The experiment
was performed using the WASA-at-COSY detector in November 2008. 525 +/- 26

step a new vertex is introduced, which can be connected to at most one existing
vertex. If it is disconnected, it becomes a pioneer vertex. Given that it is
not disconnected, it joins an existing pioneer vertex with probability
proportional to a function of the degree of that vertex. This function is
allowed to be vertex-dependent, and is called the reinforcement function. We
prove that there can be at most three phases in this model, depending on the
behavior of the reinforcement function. Consider the set whose elements are the
vertices with cardinality tending a.s. to infinity. We prove that this set
either is empty, or it has exactly one element, or it contains all the pioneer
vertices. Moreover, we describe the phase transition in the case where the
reinforcement function is the same for all vertices. Our results are general,
and in particular we are not assuming monotonicity of the reinforcement
function. Finally, consider the regime where exactly one vertex has a degree
diverging to infinity. We give a lower bound for the probability that a given
vertex ends up being the leading one, that is, its degree diverges to infinity.
Our proofs rely on a generalization of the Rubin construction given for
edge-reinforced random walks, and on a Brownian motion embedding.

matrices with noncommutative entries. They have applications in representation
theory and integrable systems. We propose new examples of these identities,
constructed according to the following principle. For several known identities
for $n$ by $n$ matrices we construct new identity for $2n$ by $2n$ matrices
where each element $z$ of the original matrix is substituted by 2x2 matrix of
the form $[real(z) ~imag(z); ~ -imag(z) ~ real(z)]$, i.e. we view the original
identity as complex valued, while the new identity is its real form
(decomplexification). It appears that ""decomplexification"" affects
non-trivially the ""correction term"". It becomes tridiagonal matrix, in contrast
to the diagonal in the classical case. The key result is an extension to the
non-commutative setting of the fact that the determinant of the decomplexified
matrix is equal to the square module of the determinant of the original matrix
(in non-commutative setting the corrections are necessary). The decomplexified
Capelli's identities are corollaries of this fact and standard Capelli
identities. We also discuss analogs of the Cayley identity; observe that the
Capelli determinant coincides with the Duflo image of the standard determinant;
give short proof of the Cayley identity via Harish-Chandra's radial part
calculation.
  The main motivation for us is a recent paper by An Huang (arXiv:1102.2657).
From our viewpoint his result is a ""dequaternionification"" of 1 by 1 Capelli
identity. Apparently it can be extended to $n$ by $n$ case, but our approach
should be somehow modified for this.
  The paper aims to be accessible and interesting not only for experts. It
gives brief review of Capelli identities, applications, their relation with
Wick quantization, Duflo map, some open issues, etc.

$f^*$ and $n$ random polarizations of an essentially bounded function $f$ with
support in a ball of radius $L$ is bounded by
$2dm(B_{2L})||f||_{\infty}n^{-1}$. The purpose of this note is to expand on
that result. The expected $L^1$ distance is bounded by $c_nn^{-1}$ with
$\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty}c_n \leq 2^{d+1}||\nabla f||_1$ for every $f \in
W_{1,1}(B_L) \cap L^{\infty}(B_L)$. Furthermore, the expected $L^1$ distance is
$O(n^{-1/q})$ for $f \in L^p(B_L)$ with $p>1$ and $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} =
1$. The rate $n^{-1}$ is best possible: $n$ times the measure of the symmetric
difference between the random polarization of a ball and its corresponding
Schwarz symmetrization converges in distribution. A new sequence of random
polarizations is introduced such that the transition probability depends on the
state of the underlying Markov chain. For a general measurable set $A$
contained in $B_L$, the rate of convergence to $A^*$ matches the rate for the
aforementioned random sequence first introduced by Buchard and Fortier.
However, the rate of convergence is $O(n^{-3/2})$ for compact sets in
$\mathbb{R}$ with finite perimeter and is exponential for balls in
$\mathbb{R}^d$. To conclude, it is shown that there exists a family of
measurable sets in $\mathbb{R}$ admitting a sequence of polarizations
converging exponentially to the corresponding Schwarz symmetrization.

adaptively changing the network coding map used at the relay according to the
channel conditions greatly reduces the impact of multiple access interference
which occurs at the relay during the MA phase. Depending on the signal set used
at the end nodes, deep fades occur for a finite number of channel fade states
referred as the singular fade states. The singular fade states fall into the
following two classes: The ones which are caused due to channel outage and
whose harmful effect cannot be mitigated by adaptive network coding are
referred as the \textit{non-removable singular fade states}. The ones which
occur due to the choice of the signal set and whose harmful effects can be
removed by a proper choice of the adaptive network coding map are referred as
the \textit{removable} singular fade states. In this paper, we derive an upper
bound on the average end-to-end Symbol Error Rate (SER), with and without
adaptive network coding at the relay, for a Rician fading scenario. It is shown
that without adaptive network coding, at high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), the
contribution to the end-to-end SER comes from the following error events which
fall as $\text{SNR}^{-1}$: the error events associated with the removable
singular fade states, the error events associated with the non-removable
singular fade states and the error event during the BC phase. In contrast, for
the adaptive network coding scheme, the error events associated with the
removable singular fade states contributing to the average end-to-end SER fall
as $\text{SNR}^{-2}$ and as a result the adaptive network coding scheme
provides a coding gain over the case when adaptive network coding is not used.

These performance characteristics, close to those of an ideal transducer, make
quartz transducers superior to ceramic piezoelectric actuators. Furthermore,
quartz actuators in the form of a tuning fork have the advantage of yielding
static displacements comparable to those of local probe microscope scanners. We
use the static displacement of a quartz tuning fork as a reference to calibrate
the three axis displacement of a ceramic piezoelectric scanner. Although this
calibration technique is a non-traceable method, it can be more versatile than
using calibration grids because it enables to characterize the linear and
non-linear response of a piezoelectric scanner in a broad range of

the signal to be reconstructed is composed of moving images or volumes, it is
challenging to form such regularization constraints with traditional transforms

Proposed regularization method can be used in a wide variety of applications

2009 austral winters to a depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz; 550 deg2 of it was
also mapped to 44 uK-arcmin at 95 GHz. Based on optical imaging of all
candidates and near-infrared imaging of the majority of candidates, we have
found optical and/or infrared counterparts for 158 clusters. Of these, 135 were
first identified as clusters in SPT data, including 117 new discoveries
reported in this work. This catalog triples the number of confirmed galaxy
clusters discovered through the SZ effect. We report photometrically derived
(and in some cases spectroscopic) redshifts for confirmed clusters and redshift
lower limits for the remaining candidates. The catalog extends to high redshift
with a median redshift of z = 0.55 and maximum redshift of z = 1.37. Based on
simulations, we expect the catalog to be nearly 100% complete above M500 ~ 5e14
Msun h_{70}^-1 at z > 0.6. There are 121 candidates detected at signal-to-noise
greater than five, at which the catalog purity is measured to be 95%. From this
high-purity subsample, we exclude the z < 0.3 clusters and use the remaining
100 candidates to improve cosmological constraints following the method
presented by Benson et al., 2011. Adding the cluster data to CMB+BAO+H0 data
leads to a preference for non-zero neutrino masses while only slightly reducing
the upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses to sum mnu < 0.38 eV (95% CL).
For a spatially flat wCDM cosmological model, the addition of this catalog to
the CMB+BAO+H0+SNe results yields sigma8=0.807+-0.027 and w = -1.010+-0.058,
improving the constraints on these parameters by a factor of 1.4 and 1.3,
respectively. [abbrev]

region identified in the radio, several young stellar objects visible in the
MIR, a bright diffuse nebulosity at 8\mu m coming from PAHs and sub-mm
continuum emission revealing the presence of cold dust. Given its position on
the sky (l=0.58, b=-0.85) and its kinematic distance of ~7.5 kpc, the region
was thought to be a very massive site of star formation in proximity of the
CMZ. The cluster DB11 was estimated to be as massive as 10^4 M_sun. However the
region's properties were known only through photometry and its kinematic
distance was very uncertain given its location at the tangential point. We
aimed at better characterizing the region and assess whether it could be a site
of massive star formation located close to the Galactic Center. We have
obtained NTT/SofI JHKs photometry and long slit K band spectroscopy of the
brightest members. We have additionally collected data in the radio, sub-mm and
mid infrared, resulting in a quite different picture of the region. We have
confirmed the presence of massive early B type stars and have derived a
spectro-photometric distance of ~1.2 kpc, much smaller than the kinematic
distance. Adopting this distance we obtain clusters masses of M(DB10) ~ 170
M_sun and M(DB11) ~ 275 M_sun. This is consistent with the absence of any O
star, confirmed by the excitation/ionization status of the nebula. No HeI
diffuse emission is detected in our spectroscopic observations at 2.113\mu m,
which would be expected if the region was hosting more massive stars. Radio
continuum measurements are also consistent with the region hosting at most
early B stars.

High-resolution and high-S/N spectra of early B-type stars are analysed in
NLTE. Atmospheric parameters are derived from the simultaneous establishment of
independent indicators, from multiple ionization equilibria and the hydrogen
Balmer lines. Results. Teff is constrained to 1-2% and logg to less than 15%
uncertainty. Absolute values for metal abundances are determined to better than
25% uncertainty. The synthetic spectra match the observations reliably over
almost the entire visual spectral range. Conclusions. A present-day cosmic
abundance standard is established. Our results i) resolve the discrepancy
between a chemical homogeneous local gas-phase ISM and a chemically
inhomogeneous young stellar component, ii) facilitate the amount of heavy
elements locked up in the interstellar dust to be constrained precisely:
carbonaceous dust is largely destroyed inside the Orion HII region, unlike the
silicates, and that graphite is only a minority species in interstellar dust -,
iii) show that the mixing of CNO-burning products in the course of massive star
evolution follows tightly the predicted nuclear path, iv) provide reliable
present-day reference points for anchoring Galactic chemical evolution models
to observation, and v) imply that the Sun has migrated outwards from the inner
Galactic disk over its lifetime from a birthplace at a distance around 5-6 kpc

evolution and abundance gradients leads to the similarity of solar and

to angular momentum exchange between them which can result in gap opening by
planets in protoplanetary disks and clearing of gas by binary supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) embedded in accretion disks. Understanding the co-evolution
of the disk and the orbit of the perturber in these circumstances requires
knowledge of the spatial distribution of the torque exerted by the latter on a
highly nonuniform disk. Here we explore disk-satellite interaction in disks
with gaps in linear approximation both in Fourier and in physical space,
explicitly incorporating the disk non-uniformity in the fluid equations.
Density gradients strongly displace the positions of Lindblad resonances in the
disk (which often occur at multiple locations), and the waveforms of modes
excited close to the gap edge get modified compared to the uniform disk case.
The spatial distribution of the excitation torque density is found to be quite
different from the existing prescriptions: most of the torque is exerted in a
rather narrow region near the gap edge where Lindblad resonances accumulate,
followed by an exponential fall-off with the distance from the perturber.
Despite these differences, for a given gap profile the full integrated torque
exerted on the disk agrees with the conventional uniform disk theory prediction
at the level of ~10%. The nonlinearity of the density wave excited by the
perturber is shown to decrease as the wave travels out of the gap, slowing down
its nonlinear evolution and damping. Our results suggest that gap opening in
protoplanetary disks and gas clearing around SMBH binaries can be more
efficient than the existing theories predict. They pave the way for
self-consistent calculations of the gap structure and the orbital evolution of
the perturber using accurate prescription for the torque density behavior.

ionization equilibrium, i.e., the ionization temperature is lower than or equal

remnants, i.e., supernova remnants with the ionization temperature higher than

recombining plasma in a supernova remnant is to have a dense circumstellar
medium at the time of the supernova explosion. If the circumstellar medium is
dense enough, collisional ionization equilibrium can be established in the
early stage of the evolution of the supernova remnant and subsequent adiabatic
cooling which occurs after the shock wave gets out of the dense circumstellar
medium makes the electron temperature lower than the ionization temperature. We
study the circumstellar medium around several supernova progenitors and show
which supernova progenitors can have a circumstellar medium which is dense
enough to establish collisional ionization equilibrium soon after the
explosion. We find that the circumstellar medium around red supergiants
(especially massive ones) and the circumstellar medium which is dense enough to
make Type IIn supernovae can establish collisional ionization equilibrium soon
after the explosion and can evolve to recombining supernova remnants.
Wolf-Rayet stars and white dwarfs have possibility to be recombining supernova
remnants but the fraction is expected to be very small. As the occurrence rate
of the explosions of red supergiants is much higher than that of Type IIn
supernovae, the major progenitors of recombining supernova remnants are likely
to be red supergiants.

hat (the place where it enters the bulk geometry) is the seat of the FRW/CFT
duality. In this paper we discuss the perturbative and non-perturbative fixed
points of FRW/CFT as seen from the three regions which share this boundary.
  Perturbatively, there is nothing universal about the FRW duality; there is a
separate construction for each possible initial vacuum. We explain how bubble
collisions induce a non-perturbative flow to a universal fixed point which
contains information about the entire landscape. We also argue that there is a
duality between the landscape of de Sitter vacua and a discretuum of very
low-dimension relevant operators in the FRW/CFT spectrum. In principle this
provides us with a precise definition of unstable de Sitter vacua.
  Along the way we show that BPS domain walls play a special role in
reinforcing the ""persistence of memory"" and breaking the symmetries of the hat.

mechanism and generally related, thus predicting DM masses around 5 GeV in
order to obtain the correct density. The main challenge for successful models
is to ensure efficient annihilation of the thermally produced symmetric
component of such a light DM candidate without violating constraints from
collider or direct searches. A common way to overcome this involves a light
mediator, into which DM can efficiently annihilate and which subsequently
decays into Standard Model particles. Here we explore the scenario where the
light mediator decays instead into lighter degrees of freedom in the dark
sector that act as radiation in the early Universe. While this assumption makes
indirect DM searches challenging, it leads to signals of extra radiation at BBN

extend Haglund's result to complements of skew Young diagrams, and we apply
this result to the case when the set of entries is the Rothe diagram of a

considered consists of (i) the effective on-site interaction U and (ii) the
intersite charge exchange interactions I, determining the hopping of electron
pairs between nearest-neighbour sites. The model can be treated as a simple
effective model of a superconductor with very short coherence length in which
electrons are localized and only electron pairs have possibility of
transferring. The phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties of this model
have been determined within the variational approach, which treats the on-site
interaction term exactly and the intersite interactions within the mean-field
approximation. We have also obtained rigorous results for a linear chain (d=1)
in the ground state. Moreover, at T=0 some results derived within the random
phase approximation (and the spin-wave approximation) for d=2 and d=3 lattices
and within the low density expansions for d=3 lattices are presented. Our
investigation of the general case (as a function of the electron concentration
and as a function of the chemical potential) shows that, depending on the
values of interaction parameters, the system can exhibit not only the
homogeneous phases: superconducting (SS) and nonordered (NO), but also the
phase separated states (PS: SS-NO). The system considered exhibits interesting
multicritical behaviour including tricritical points.

to constrain the chemical composition of the neutron star atmosphere and the
equation of state of dense matter. We fit the spectrum with different neutron
star atmosphere models composed of hydrogen, helium or carbon. The parameter
values obtained with the carbon model are unphysical and such a model can be
ruled out. Hydrogen and helium models give realistic parameter values for a
neutron star, and the derived mass and radius are clearly distinct depending on
the composition of the atmosphere. The hydrogen model gives masses/radii
consistent with the canonical values of 1.4 Msun and 10 km, and would allow for
the presence of exotic matter inside neutron stars. On the other hand, the
helium model provides solutions with higher masses/radii, consistent with the
stiffest equations of state. Measurements of neutron star masses/radii by
spectral fitting should consider the possibility of heavier element
atmospheres, which produce larger masses/radii for the same data, unless the
composition of the accretor is known independently.

develops a general theory based on rare events for studying integrability
properties such as moment bounds for discrete-time stochastic processes. Using
this approach, we establish moment bounds for fully and partially

are companions to the giant elliptical CenA. We aim at deriving their physical
properties over their lifetime and compare them to those of dwarfs located in
different environments. We use archival HST/ACS data and apply synthetic
color-magnitude diagram fitting in order to reconstruct the past star formation
activity of the target galaxies. The average star formation rate for the
studied galaxies ranges from 10^{-3} up to \sim 7x10^{-2} M_odot/yr, and their
mean metallicities correlate with their luminosities (from [Fe/H]\sim -1.4 up
to \sim -1.0). The form of the star formation histories varies across the
sample, with quiescent periods alternating with intermittent enhancements in
the star formation (from a few up to several times the average lifetime value).
The dwarfs in this sample formed ~35% to ~60% of their stellar content prior to
~5 Gyr ago. The resulting star formation histories for the CenA companions are
similar to those found for comparable Local Group and M81 group dwarfs. We
consider this sample of dwarfs together with 5 previously studied M83 dwarf
irregular companions. We find no trend of the average star formation rate with
tidal index or distance from the main galaxy of the group. However, dwarfs with
higher baryonic masses do show higher average star formation rates, underlining
the importance of intrinsic properties in governing the evolution of these
galaxies. On the other hand, there is also a clear trend when looking at the
recent (~0.5-1 Gyr) level of activity. Namely, dwarfs within a denser region of
the group appear to have had their star formation quenched while dwarfs located
in the group outskirts show a wide range of possible star formation rates, thus
indicating that external processes play a fundamental role, complementary to
mass, in shaping the star formation histories of dwarf galaxies.

function (ICMF) has a fundamental limit (or truncation) at high masses. The
shape of the ICMF at high masses can be studied using the most massive young
(<10 Myr) clusters, however this has proven difficult due to low-number
statistics. In this contribution we use an alternative method based on the
luminosities of the brightest clusters, combined with their ages. If a
truncation is present, a generic prediction (nearly independent of the cluster
disruption law adopted) is that the median age of bright clusters should be
younger than that of fainter clusters. In the case of an non-truncated ICMF,
the median age should be independent of cluster luminosity. Here, we present
optical spectroscopy of twelve young stellar clusters in the face-on spiral
galaxy NGC 2997. The spectra are used to estimate the age of each cluster, and
the brightness of the clusters is taken from the literature. The observations
are compared with the model expectations of Larsen (2009) for various ICMF
forms and both mass dependent and mass independent cluster disruption. While
there exists some degeneracy between the truncation mass and the amount of mass
independent disruption, the observations favour a truncated ICMF. For low or
modest amounts of mass independent disruption, a truncation mass of 5-6*10^5
Msun is estimated, consistent with previous determinations. Additionally, we
investigate possible truncations in the ICMF in the spiral galaxy M83, the
interacting Antennae galaxies, and the collection of spiral and dwarf galaxies
present in Larsen (2009) based on photometric catalogues taken from the
literature, and find that all catalogues are consistent with having a
(environmentally dependent) truncation in the cluster mass functions.

invariably forms a structure with a low volume fraction but high resistance to
further compression. Being a far-from-equilibrium process, forced crumpling is
not necessarily amenable to a statistical description in which the parameters
of the initially flat sheet and the final confinement fully specify the
resulting crumpled state. Instead, the internal geometry and mechanical
properties of the crumpled ball may reflect the history of its preparation. Our
X-ray microtomography experiments reveal that the internal 3-dimensional
geometry of a crumpled ball is in many respects isotropic and homogeneous. In
these respects, crumpling recapitulates other classic nonequilibrium problems
such as turbulence, where a system driven by long-wavelength, low-symmetry,
forcing shows only rather subtle fingerprints of the forcing mechanism.
However, we find local nematic ordering of the sheet into parallel stacks. The
layering proceeds radially inwards from the outer surface. The extent of this
layering increases with the volume fraction, or degree of compression.

information has received much attention in the statistics and information
theory communities. A large class of estimators of functionals of the
probability density suffer from the curse of dimensionality, wherein the mean
squared error (MSE) decays increasingly slowly as a function of the sample size
$T$ as the dimension $d$ of the samples increases. In particular, the rate is
often glacially slow of order $O(T^{-{\gamma}/{d}})$, where $\gamma>0$ is a
rate parameter. Examples of such estimators include kernel density estimators,
$k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) density estimators, $k$-NN entropy estimators,
intrinsic dimension estimators and other examples. In this paper, we propose a
weighted affine combination of an ensemble of such estimators, where optimal
weights can be chosen such that the weighted estimator converges at a much
faster dimension invariant rate of $O(T^{-1})$. Furthermore, we show that these
optimal weights can be determined by solving a convex optimization problem
which can be performed offline and does not require training data. We
illustrate the superior performance of our weighted estimator for two important
applications: (i) estimating the Panter-Dite distortion-rate factor and (ii)
estimating the Shannon entropy for testing the probability distribution of a
random sample.

quality of VDMs in the software life cycles.
  The experiment result shows that the ""confirmed-by-vendors' advisories"" data

performance of the s-shape logistic model (AML) seems to be superior
performance in overall. Meanwhile, Anderson thermodynamic model (AT) is indeed
not suitable for modeling the vulnerability discovery process. This means that
the discovery process of vulnerabilities and normal bugs are different because
the interests of people in finding security vulnerabilities are more than

treated separately. The case $p = 1$ generalizes an elegant result of Elsner,
Han, Koltracht, Neumann and Zippin.
  Another reason for studying non-trivial $p$-polygonal equalities in
$L_{p}(\Omega, \mu)$ is due to the fact that they preclude the existence of
certain types of isometry. For example, our techniques show that if $(X,d)$ is
a metric space that has strict $q$-negative type for some $q \geq p$, then: (1)
$(X,d)$ is not isometric to any linear subspace $W$ of $L_{p}(\Omega, \mu)$
that contains a pair of disjointly supported non-zero vectors, and (2) $(X,d)$
is not isometric to any subset of $L_{p}(\Omega, \mu)$ that has non-empty

with each series implementation accessible to you:
  Compare the value of (z^2 + z^3)^(3/2) with that of its truncated series

simulations with input quark masses from $m_q=0.003$ to $m_q=0.008$. We have
observed a metastable, first order, bulk transition that occurs at small input
quark masses. As the quark mass increases, this first order bulk transition
ends at a second order critical point, and, for still heavier quark masses,
becomes the cross-over we have previously reported. We present measurements of
hadron masses, decay constants and other low energy observables in the small
quark mass region on the weak coupling side of the bulk transition. Our results
show that the behavior of the system is still consistent with spontaneously
broken chiral symmetry. We also discuss a preliminary investigation into the
behavior of the bulk transition itself. We have found that, as the system
approaches the second order critical end point, the scalar singlet meson
becomes lighter. Thus it appears that the critical endpoint corresponds to a
continuum limit theory only involving scalars and, following known triviality
arguments, this is likely a free field theory. The presence of this critical
endpoint could influence scaling of lattice observables in the conventional
continuum limit.

description of Levy flights developed previously and their equivalent
representation in terms of discrete steps of a wandering particle, a certain
generalization of continuous time random walks. Our consideration is confined
to the one-dimensional model for continuous random motion of a particle with
inertia. Its dynamics governed by stochastic self-acceleration is described as
motion on the phase plane {x,v} comprising the position x and velocity v=dx/dt
of the given particle. A notion of random walks inside a certain neighbourhood
L of the line v=0 (the x-axis) and outside it is developed. It enables us to
represent a continuous trajectory of particle motion on the plane {x,v} as a
collection of the corresponding discrete steps. Each of these steps matches one
complete fragment of the velocity fluctuations originating and terminating at
the ""boundary"" of L. As demonstrated, the characteristic length of particle
spatial displacement is mainly determined by velocity fluctuations with large
amplitude, which endows the derived random walks along the x-axis with the
characteristic properties of Levy flights. Using the developed classification
of random trajectories a certain parameter-free core stochastic process is
constructed. Its peculiarity is that all the characteristics of Levy flights
similar to the exponent of the Levy scaling law are no more than the parameters
of the corresponding transformation from the particle velocity v to the related

capable of counting single photons and measuring their energy in the UV,

(FDM) at microwave frequencies, allowing the construction and readout of large
arrays. Due to the microwave FDM, MKIDs do not require the complex cryogenic
multiplexing electronics used for similar detectors, such as Transition Edge

electronics where they present a formidable signal processing challenge. In
this paper we describe the first successful effort to build a readout for a
photon counting optical/near-IR astronomical instrument, the ARray Camera for
Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry (ARCONS). This readout is based on
open source hardware developed by the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal

risk of being exploited by free-riders. However, the precise ecological factors
supporting cooperation are still puzzling. Following recent experiments, we
consider the role of population growth and the repetitive fragmentation of
populations into new colonies mimicking simple microbial life-cycles.
Individual-based modeling reveals that demographic fluctuations, which lead to
a large variance in the composition of colonies, promote cooperation. Biased by
population dynamics these fluctuations result in two qualitatively distinct
regimes of robust cooperation under repetitive fragmentation into groups.
First, if the level of cooperation exceeds a threshold, cooperators will take
over the whole population. Second, cooperators can also emerge from a single
mutant leading to a robust coexistence between cooperators and free-riders. We
find frequency and size of population bottlenecks, and growth dynamics to be
the major ecological factors determining the regimes and thereby the
evolutionary pathway towards cooperation.

Broadly
speaking, super-resolution is the problem of recovering the fine details of an
object---the high end of its spectrum---from coarse scale information
only---from samples at the low end of the spectrum. Suppose we have many point
sources at unknown locations in $[0,1]$ and with unknown complex-valued
amplitudes. We only observe Fourier samples of this object up until a frequency
cut-off $f_c$. We show that one can super-resolve these point sources with
infinite precision---i.e. recover the exact locations and amplitudes---by
solving a simple convex optimization problem, which can essentially be
reformulated as a semidefinite program. This holds provided that the distance
between sources is at least $2/f_c$. This result extends to higher dimensions
and other models. In one dimension for instance, it is possible to recover a
piecewise smooth function by resolving the discontinuity points with infinite
precision as well. We also show that the theory and methods are robust to
noise. In particular, in the discrete setting we develop some theoretical
results explaining how the accuracy of the super-resolved signal is expected to
degrade when both the noise level and the {\em super-resolution factor} vary.

Methods. Combining the sensitivity of the international Pulsar Timing Array
(PTA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) detectors, we used a binary
population synthesis (BPS) approach to determine GW radiation from close galaxy
pairs under the assumption that SMBHs formed at the core of merged galaxies. We
also performed second post-Newtonian approximation methods to estimate the
variation of the strain amplitude with time. Results. We find that the value of
the strain amplitude \emph{h} varies from about $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-17}$ using
the observations of 20 years, and we estimate that about 100 SMBH sources can
be detected with the SKA detector.

interference-limited cellular networks. We consider systems employing multiple
antennas and are interested in both the finite and large-scale antenna number
regimes (so-called ""massive MIMO""). Such systems deal with the multi-cell
interference by way of per-cell beamforming applied at each base station.
Channel estimation in such networks, which is known to be hampered by the pilot
contamination effect, constitute a major bottleneck for overall performance. We
present a novel approach which tackles this problem by enabling a low-rate
coordination between cells during the channel estimation phase itself. The
coordination makes use of the additional second-order statistical information
about the user channels, which are shown to offer a powerful way of
discriminating across interfering users with even strongly correlated pilot
sequences. Importantly, we demonstrate analytically that in the
large-number-of-antennas regime, the pilot contamination effect is made to
vanish completely under certain conditions on the channel covariance. Gains
over the conventional channel estimation framework are confirmed by our
simulations for even small antenna array sizes.

temporal and spatial correlations is introduced. When the environment has a
finite correlation length, individual particle trajectories are found to
diffuse at large times with a displacement distribution that approaches a
Gaussian. The collective dynamics of diffusing particles reaches a
statistically stationary state, which is characterized in terms of a
fluctuating mass density field. The probability distribution of density is
studied numerically for both smooth and non-smooth scale-invariant random
environments. A competition between trapping in the regions where the ejection
rate of the environment vanishes and mixing due to its temporal dependence
leads to large fluctuations of mass. These mechanisms are found to result in
the presence of intermediate power-law tails in the probability distribution of
the mass density. For spatially differentiable environments, the exponent of
the right tail is shown to be universal and equal to -3/2. However, at small
values, it is found to depend on the environment. Finally, spatial scaling
properties of the mass distribution are investigated. The distribution of the
coarse-grained density is shown to posses some rescaling properties that depend
on the scale, the amplitude of the ejection rate, and the H\""older exponent of

sub-class. AGNs are characterized by an extremely bright and compact emission
region, powered by a super-massive black hole (SMBH) and an accretion disk, and
relativistic outflows (jets) detected all across the electro-magnetic spectrum.
In BL Lac sources the jet axis is oriented close to the line of sight, giving
rise to a relativistic boosting of the emission. In radio galaxies, on the
other hand, the jet makes a larger angle to the line of sight allowing to
resolve the central core and the jet in great details. The giant radio galaxy M
87 with its proximity (1 6Mpc) and its very massive black hole ((3-6) x 10^9
M_solar) provides a unique laboratory to investigate VHE emission in such
objects and thereby probe particle acceleration to relativistic energies near
SMBH and in jets. M 87 has been established as a VHE emitter since 2005. The
VHE emission displays strong variability on time-scales as short as a day. It
has been subject of a large joint VHE and multi-wavelength (MWL) monitoring
campaign in 2008, where a rise in the 43 GHz VLBA radio emission of the
innermost region (core) was found to coincide with a flaring activity at VHE.
This had been interpreted as a strong indication that the VHE emission is
produced in the direct vicinity of the SMBH black hole. In 2010 again a flare
at VHE was detected triggering further MWL observations with the VLBA, Chandra,
and other instruments. At the same time M 87 was also observed with the

systems. This work investigated the single photon sensitivity of the Adaptive
Gain Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD) and its dependence on possible detector
noise values. Due to special requirements at the European X-ray Free Electron
Laser (XFEL) the AGIPD finds the number of photons absorbed in each pixel by
integrating the total signal. Photon counting is done off line on a thresholded
data set.
  It was shown that AGIPD will be sensitive to single photons of 8 keV energy
or more (detection efficiency $\gg$ 50%, less than 1 count due to noise per
10$^6$ pixels). Should the final noise be at the lower end of the possible
range (200 - 400 electrons) single photon sensitivity can also be achieved at 5
keV beam energy.
  It was shown that charge summing schemes are beneficial when the noise is
sufficiently low. The total detection rate of events is increased and the
probability to count a single event multiple times in adjacent pixels is
reduced by a factor of up to 40.
  The entry window of AGIPD allows 3 keV photons to reach the sensitive volume
with approximately 70% probability. Therefore the low energy performance of
AGIPD was explored, finding a maximum noise floor below 0.035 hits/pixel/frame
at 3 keV beam energy. Depending on the noise level and selected threshold this
value can be reduced by a factor of approximately 10. Even though single photon
sensitivity, as defined in this work, is not given, imaging at this energy is
still possible, allowing Poisson noise limited performance for signals
significantly above the noise floor.

intervals for a linear functional based on right censored lifetime data. Many
of the results in literature show that log EL has a limiting scaled chi-square
distribution, where the scale parameter is a function of the unknown asymptotic
variance. The scale parameter has to be estimated for the construction.
Additional estimation would reduce the coverage accuracy for the parameter.
This diminishes a main advantage of the EL method for censored data. By
utilizing certain influence functions in an estimating equation, it is shown
that under very general conditions, log EL converges weakly to a standard
chi-square distribution and thereby eliminates the need for estimating the
scale parameter. Moreover, a special way of employing influence functions eases
the otherwise very demanding computations of the EL method. Our approach yields
smaller asymptotic variance of the influence function than those comparable
ones considered by Wang and Jing (2001) and Qin and Zhao (2007). Thus it is not
surprising that confidence intervals using influence functions give a better
coverage accuracy as demonstrated by simulations.

present a first model for a complete average isotopic decomposition as a
function of metallicity. Our model is based on the underlying nuclear
astrophysics processes, and is fitted to observational data, rather than
traditional forward galactic chemical evolution modeling which integrates
stellar yields beginning from big bang nucleosynthesis. We first decompose the
isotopic solar abundance pattern into contributions from astrophysical sources.
Each contribution is then assumed to scale as a function of metallicity. The
resulting total isotopic abundances are summed into elemental abundances and
fitted to available halo and disk stellar data to constrain the model's free
parameter values. This procedure allows us to use available elemental
observational data to reconstruct and constrain both the much needed complete
isotopic evolution that is not accessible to current observations, and the
underlying astrophysical processes. Our model finds a best fit for Type Ia
contributing \simeq 0.7 to the solar Fe abundance, and and Type Ia onset
occurring at [Fe/H]\simeq -1.2.

versal holomorphic family for every fixed Bernstein polynomial. We construct
also several holomorphic parameters (a holomorphic parameter is a function
defined on a set of isomorphism classes of frescos) which are quasi-invariant
by changes of variable. This is motivated by the fact that a fresco is
associated to a relative de Rham cohomology class on a one parameter
degeneration of compact complex manifolds, up to a change of variable in the
parameter. Then the value of a quasi-invariant holomorphic parameter on such
data produces a holomorphic (quasi-)invariant of such a situation.

streaming along magnetic field lines and co-rotating with pulsar magnetosphere.
The co-rotation affects the trajectories of the particles and hence the
emission properties, especially the polarization. We consider the modification
of the particle velocity and acceleration due to the co-rotation. Curvature
radiation from a single particle is calculated using the approximation of a
circular path to the particle trajectory. Curvature radiation from particles at
a given height actually contains the contributions from particles streaming
along all the nearby field lines around the tangential point, forming the
emission cone of 1/{\gamma}. The polarization patterns from the emission cone
are distorted by the additional rotation, more serious for emission from a
larger height. Net circular polarization can be generated by the density
gradient in the emission cone. For three typical density models in the form of
core, cone and patches, we calculate the polarization profiles for emission
generated at a given height. We find that the circular polarization could have
a single sign or sign reversal, depending on the density gradient along the
rotation phase. The polarization profiles of the total curvature radiation from
the whole open field line region, calculated by adding the emission from all
possible heights, are similar to that from a dominating emission height. The
circular polarization of curvature radiation has sign reversals in the patchy
emission, while it has a single sign for the core emission, and is negligible
for the cone emission.
