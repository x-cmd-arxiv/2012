calibrated emission line maps of extended objects such as galactic nebulae and
nearby galaxies, using the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4-m GTC. Despite a
relatively large field of view of OSIRIS (8'x8'), the change in the wavelength
across the field (~80 Ang) and the long-tail of Tunable Filter (TF) spectral
response function, are hindrances for obtaining accurate flux calibrated
emission-line maps of extended sources. The purpose of this article is to
demonstrate that emission-line maps useful for diagnostics of nebula can be
generated over the entire field of view of OSIRIS, if we make use of
theoretically well-understood characteristics of TFs. We have successfully
generated the flux-calibrated images of the nearby, large late-type spiral
galaxy M101 in the emission lines of Halpha, [NII]6583, [SII]6716 and
[SII]6731. We find that the present uncertainty in setting the central
wavelength of TFs (~1 Ang), is the biggest source of error in the emission-line
fluxes. By comparing the Halpha fluxes of HII regions in our images with the
fluxes derived from Halpha images obtained using narrow-band filters, we
estimate an error of ~11% in our fluxes. The flux calibration of the images was
carried out by fitting the SDSS griz magnitudes of in-frame stars with the
stellar spectra from the SDSS spectral database. This method resulted in an
accuracy of 3% in flux calibration of any narrow-band image, which is as good
as, if not better, to that is feasible using the observations of
spectrophotometric standard stars. Thus time-consuming calibration images need
not be taken. A user-friendly script under the IRAF environment was developed

background described by an Expanding Locally Anisotropic (ELA) metric ansatz.
This metric interpolates between the Schwarzschild metric near the central mass
and the Robertson-Walker metric describing the expanding cosmological
background far from the central mass allowing for a fine-tuneable covariant
parameterization of gravitational interactions corrections in between these two
asymptotic limits. In particular it is shown that the decrease of the Sun's
mass by radiation emission plus the General Relativity corrections due to the
ELA metric background with respect to Schwarzschild backgrounds can be mapped
to the reported yearly variation of the gravitational constant $\dot{G}$
through Kepler's third law. Based on the value of the heuristic fit
corresponding to the more recent heliocentric ephemerides of the Solar System
are derived bounds for the value of a constant parameter $\alpha_0$ for the ELA
metric as well as the maximal corrections to perihelion advance and orbital
radii variation within this framework. Hence it is shown that employing the ELA
metric as a functional covariant parameterization to model gravitational
interactions corrections within the Solar System allows to maintain the
measurement projection standards constant over time, specifically both the
Astronomical Unit ($AU$) and the Gravitational constant ($G$). Also it is noted
that the effect obtained is not homogeneous for all planetary orbits

Collective excitations and collisional processes are discussed. Since the
Keldysh-Schwinger approach is used, the collective excitations in both
equilibrium and non-equilibrium plasma are under consideration. The dispersion
equations of gluon, fermion, and scalar modes are written down and the
self-energies, which enter the equations, are computed in the Hard Loop
Approximation. The self-energies are discussed in the context of effective
action which is also given. The gluon modes and fermion ones appear to be the
same as those in the QCD plasma of gluons and massless quarks. The scalar modes
are as of a free relativistic massive particle. The binary collisional
processes, which occur at the lowest nontrivial order of the coupling constant,
are reviewed and then the transport properties of the plasma are discussed. The
N=4 super Yang-Mills plasma is finally concluded to be very similar the QCD
plasma of gluons and light quarks. The differences mostly reflect different
numbers of degrees of freedom in the two systems.

localization-delocalization transition. The concept is based on an array of
superconducting flux qubits which are coupled to a diamond crystal containing
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. The underlying description is a
Jaynes-Cummings-lattice in the strong-coupling regime. However, in contrast to
well-studied coupled cavity arrays the interaction between lattice sites is
mediated here by the qubit rather than by the oscillator degrees of freedom.
Nevertheless, we point out that a transition between a localized and a
delocalized phase occurs in this system as well. We demonstrate the possibility
of monitoring this transition in a non-equilibrium scenario, including
decoherence effects. The proposed scheme allows the monitoring of
localization-delocalization transitions in Jaynes-Cummings-lattices by use of
currently available experimental technology. Contrary to cavity-coupled
lattices, our proposed recourse to stylized qubit networks facilitates (i) to
investigate localization-delocalization transitions in arbitrary dimensions and
(ii) to tune the inter-site coupling in-situ.

Therefore, this paper presents a detailed study of distributional measures.
Particular attention is paid to flesh out the strengths and limitations of both

  In the broadband double power-law fits, for a typical Fermi spectrum of a

exponential cut-off gives an acceptable fit for the underlying double power-law

insensitive to the underlying Fermi photon spectrum.

game-theoretic results, such as Borel determinacy, were developed by
mathematicians for mathematics in a broad sense. These results usually state
determinacy, i.e. the existence of a winning strategy in games that involve two
players and two outcomes saying who wins. In a multi-outcome setting, the
notion of winning strategy is irrelevant yet usually replaced faithfully with
the notion of (pure) Nash equilibrium. This article shows that every
determinacy result over an arbitrary game structure, e.g. a tree, is
transferable into existence of multi-outcome (pure) Nash equilibrium over the
same game structure. The equilibrium-transfer theorem requires cardinal or
order-theoretic conditions on the strategy sets and the preferences,
respectively, whereas counter-examples show that every requirement is relevant,
albeit possibly improvable. When the outcomes are finitely many, the proof
provides an algorithm computing a Nash equilibrium without significant
complexity loss compared to the two-outcome case. As examples of application,
this article generalises Borel determinacy, positional determinacy of parity

black holes in General Relativity. However, the interaction between black holes
and their environment is where complexity lies, as the relevant physical
processes occur over a large range of scales. That is particularly relevant in
the case of super-massive black holes (SMBHs), hosted in galaxy centers, and
surrounded by swirling gas and various generations of stars. These compete with
the SMBH for gas consumption and affect both dynamics and thermodynamics of the
gas itself. How the behavior of such fiery environment influence the angular
momentum of the gas accreted onto SMBHs, and, hence, black-hole spins is
uncertain. We explore the interaction between SMBHs and their environment via
first 3D sub-parsec resolution simulations (ranging from 0.1 pc to 1 kpc
scales) that study the evolution of the SMBH spin by including the effects of
star formation, stellar feedback, radiative transfer, and metal pollution
according to the proper stellar yields and lifetimes. This approach is crucial
to investigate the impact of star formation processes and feedback effects on
the angular momentum of the material that could accrete on the central hole. We
find that star formation and feedback mechanisms can locally inject significant
amounts of entropy in the surrounding medium, and impact on the inflow
inclination angles and Eddington fractions. As a consequence, the resulting
trends show upper-intermediate equilibrium values for the spin parameter, a, of
about 0.6 - 0.9, corresponding to radiative efficiencies \epsilon = 9% - 15%.
These results suggest that star formation feedback taking place in the
circum-nuclear disk during the in-fall cannot induce alone very strong chaotic
trends in the gas flow, quite independently from the different numerical
parameters.

1316. The color distribution of the entire sample is unimodal, but the color
distribution of bright subsamples in the bulge shows two peaks that, by
comparison with theoretical Washington colors with solar metallicity,
correspond to ages of about 2 Gyr and 0.8 Gyr, respectively. We also find a
significant population of clusters in the color range 0.8 < C-R < 1.1 which
must be populated by clusters younger than 0.8 Gyr, unless they are very
metal-poor. The color interval 1.3 < C-R < 1.6 hosts the bulk of
intermediate-age clusters which show a surface density profile with a sharp
decline at about 4 arcmin. The outer cluster population shows an unimodal color
distribution with a peak at C-R=1.1, indicating a larger contribution of old,
metal-poor clusters. Their luminosity function does not show the expected
turn-over, so the fraction of younger clusters is still significant. Cluster
formation in NGC 1316 has continued after an initial burst, presumably related
to the main merger. A toy model with two bursts of ages 2 Gyr and 0.8 Gyr is
consistent with photometric properties and dynamical M/L-values.

perfect scaling on four orders of magnitude in the rank for all the studied
years. The obtained Pareto exponents are quite stable with values around
$\alpha \approx 2.5$, in spite of the fact that during this period the economy
developed rapidly and also a financial-economic crisis hit Romania in

exponential-type income distribution. Following the income of employees in

advantage of estimating the radial slope of a wavefront using a HSF Placido

enables a plethora of ensemble analysis of the architecture and properties of
exoplanetary systems. We compare the observed transit durations of KOIs to a
synthetic distribution generated from the known eccentricities of radial
velocity (RV) discovered exoplanets. We find that the Kepler and RV
distributions differ at a statistically significant level. We identify three
related systematic trends that are likely due to errors in stellar radii, which
in turn affect the inferred exoplanet radii and the distribution thereof, and
prevent a valid analysis of the underlying ensemble eccentricity distribution.
First, 15% of KOIs have transit durations >20% longer than the transit duration
expected for an edge-on circular orbit, including 92 KOIs with transit
durations >50% longer, when only a handful of such systems are expected.
Second, the median transit duration is too long by up to ~25%. Random errors of
<50% in the stellar radius are not adequate to account for these two trends,
and they are present for all spectral types in the Kepler sample. We identify
that incorrect estimates of stellar metallicity and extinction could account
for these anomalies, rather than astrophysical effects such as eccentric
exoplanets improbably transiting near apastron. Third, we find that the median
transit duration is correlated with stellar radius, when no such trend is
expected. All three effects are still present, although less pronounced, when
considering only multiple transiting KOI systems which are thought to have a
low false positive rate. Improved stellar parameters for KOIs are necessary for
the validity of future ensemble tests of exoplanetary systems found by Kepler.

Byzantine consensus (IABC) algorithm for directed graphs. The iterative
algorithm allows fault- free nodes to reach approximate conensus despite the
presence of up to f Byzantine faults. Necessary conditions on the underlying
network graph for the existence of a correct IABC algorithm were shown in our
recent work [15, 16]. [15] also analyzed a specific IABC algorithm and showed
that it performs correctly in any network graph that satisfies the necessary
condition, proving that the necessary condition is also sufficient. In this
paper, we present an alternate proof of correctness of the IABC algorithm,
using a familiar technique based on transition matrices [9, 3, 17, 19].
  The key contribution of this paper is to exploit the following observation:
for a given evolution of the state vector corresponding to the state of the
fault-free nodes, many alternate state transition matrices may be chosen to
model that evolution cor- rectly. For a given state evolution, we identify one
approach to suitably ""design"" the transition matrices so that the standard
tools for proving convergence can be applied to the Byzantine fault-tolerant
algorithm as well. In particular, the transition matrix for each iteration is
designed such that each row of the matrix contains a large enough number of
elements that are bounded away from 0.

extremely high velocities (~ 100 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity).
We divide the line profiles into three velocity ranges that each have
interesting spectral features: standard, intermediate, and extremely

on the kinetic temperature and volume density of the emitting gas, >~ 100 K and

the longitude-dependent east-west travel times, obtained along the equatorial

reducing distortion would make the ear a better detector, we sought mechanisms
with that effect. Mimicking in vivo stimulation, we used stiff probes to
displace individual hair bundles at physiological amplitudes and measured the
coherence and phase of the relative stereociliary motions with a dual-beam
differential interferometer. Although stereocilia moved coherently and in phase
at the stimulus frequencies, large phase lags at the frequencies of the
internally generated distortion products indicated dissipative relative
motions. Tip links engaged these relative modes and decreased the coherence in
both stimulated and free hair bundles. These results show that a hair bundle
breaks into a highly dissipative serial arrangement of stereocilia at
distortion frequencies, precluding their amplification.

be solved in terms of a certain boundary reflection matrix. We determine this

The cusp is introduced through a relative rotation between the two boundaries.
Then the TBA trick of exchanging space and time leads to an exact equation for
all values of L. The L=0 case corresponds to the cusped Wilson loop with no
operators inserted. We then derive a slightly simplified integral equation

models, with controllable errors, is a central challenge in quantum many-body
physics, where these models find applications ranging from nano-science to the
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Here we describe how configuration
interaction (CI) approximations to exact diagonalization (ED) may be used as
solvers in DMFT. CI approximations retain the main advantages of ED, such as
the ability to treat general interactions and off-diagonal hybridizations and
to obtain real spectral information, but are of polynomial cost. Furthermore,
their errors can be controlled by monitoring the convergence of physical
quantities as a function of the CI hierarchy. Using benchmark DMFT
applications, such as single-site DMFT of the 1D Hubbard model and $2\times 2$
cluster DMFT of the 2D Hubbard model, we show that CI approximations allow us
to obtain near-exact ED results for a tiny fraction of the cost. This is true
over the entire range of interaction strengths including ""difficult"" regimes,
such as in the pseudogap phase of the 2D Hubbard model. We use the ability of
CI approximations to treat large numbers of orbitals to demonstrate convergence
of the bath representation in the $2\times 2$ cluster DMFT using a 24 bath
orbital representation. CI approximations thus form a promising route to extend
ED to problems that are currently difficult to study using other solvers such
as continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo, including impurity models with large

of the amplitude itself, rather than its logarithm, and verify that it holds
for two- and three-loop MHV integrands for n>4. We investigate the extent to
which this collinear constraint and a constraint on the soft behavior of
integrands can be used to determine integrands. We find an interesting
complementarity whereby the soft constraint becomes stronger while the
collinear constraint becomes weaker at larger n. For certain reasonable choices

suggestion from 5 additional CMS&ATLAS search strategies targeting the
production of light stops & gluinos at lower jet counts, which variously depend
on heavy flavor tagging and the inclusion or exclusion of associated leptons.
The current operating phase of the 7TeV LHC is highly conducive to the
production of gluinos & light stops, given the supersymmetric particle mass
hierarchy M_t_1<M_g<M_q that naturally evolves from the dynamics of the model
named No-Scale FSU5 that we presently study. Moreover, some tension persists
against the SM data-driven and MC generated background predictions in certain
LHC searches of this variety. We demonstrate that the 1-sigma overlap of the
allowed supersymmetric event production for these seven search methodologies
roundly envelops the most favorable phenomenological subspace of FSU5, while
handily generating a 125GeV Higgs boson mass. In order to test the statistical
significance of any correlations across the simulated FSU5 collider response in
these seven search strategies, we implement a multi-axis chi^2 fitting
procedure, yielding a best overall match in the vicinity of M1/2=610GeV,
corresponding to light stop & gluino masses of approximately 665GeV and 830GeV.
Consequently, we suggest that FSU5 is a better global fit to the studied LHC
data than the SM alone, and moreover that its predictions appear to be
meaningfully correlated with observed low-statistics excesses across a wide
variety of specialized search strategies. We suspect the already collected 5/fb
will be sufficient to either condense or disperse the delicate aroma of stops

of VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy to measure the metallicity, electron density,
star-formation rate (SFR), and reddening of the host. Specifically, we use
different strong-line diagnostics based on [N II] to robustly measure the
gas-phase metallicity for the first time for a GRB host at this redshift. The
host of the energetic (E_iso ~ 2 x 10^53 erg) GRB 080605 is a morphologically
complex, vigorously star-forming galaxy with an H\alpha-derived SFR of 31
M_sun/yr. Its ISM is significantly enriched with metals with an oxygen
abundance between 8.3 and 8.6 depending on the adopted strong-line calibrator.
This corresponds to values in the range of 0.4-0.8 times the solar value. For
its measured stellar mass of 8 x 10^9 M_sun and SFR this value is consistent
with the fundamental metallicity relation defined by star-forming field
galaxies. Our observations directly illustrate that GRB hosts are not
necessarily metal-poor, both on absolute scales as well as relative to their
stellar mass and SFR. GRB hosts could thus be fair tracers of the population of
ordinary star-forming galaxies as a whole at high redshift.

are well described in terms of a log-parabolic shape with a considerable
curvature, and widely interpreted as synchrotron emission from
ultrarelativistic electrons outflowing in a relativistic jet; these are
expected to radiate also in gamma-rays by the inverse Compton process. Recently
we have compared the X-ray spectral parameter distributions of TeV detected

individually-detected sources. Our goal is to produce deep galaxy number counts
and redshift distributions below the confusion limit, which we then use to
place strong constraints on the origins of the cosmic infrared background and
on models of galaxy evolution.
  We individually extracted the bright SPIRE with a method using the positions,
the flux densities, and the redshifts of the 24um sources as a prior, and
derived the number counts and redshift distributions of the bright SPIRE
sources. For fainter SPIRE sources, we reconstructed the number counts and the
redshift distribution below the confusion limit using the deep 24um catalogs
associated with photometric redshift and information provided by the stacking
of these sources into the deep SPIRE maps. Finally, by integrating all these
counts, we studied the contribution of the galaxies to the CIB as a function of
their flux density and redshift.
  Through stacking, we managed to reconstruct the source counts per redshift
slice down to ~2 mJy in the three SPIRE bands, which lies about a factor 10
below the 5sigma confusion limit. None of the pre-existing population models
are able to reproduce our results at better than 3sigma. Finally, we
extrapolate our counts to zero flux density in order to derive an estimate of
the total contribution of galaxies to the CIB, finding 10.1, 6.5, and 2.8
nW/m2/sr at 250, 350, and 500um, respectively. These values agree well with
FIRAS absolute measurements, suggesting our number counts and their
extrapolation are sufficient to explain the CIB. Finally, combining our results

massive stars evolved at low-metallicity, objects that are proposed as likely
progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). We perform 1D+rotation
stellar-collapse simulations on the progenitor models of Woosley & Heger (2006)
and critically assess their potential for the formation of a black hole and a
Keplerian disk (namely a collapsar) or a proto-magnetar. We note that
theoretical uncertainties in the treatment of magnetic fields and the
approximate handling of rotation compromises the accuracy of stellar-evolution
models. We find that only the fastest rotating progenitors achieve sufficient
compactness for black-hole formation while the bulk of models possess a core
density structure typical of garden-variety core-collapse supernova (SN)
progenitors evolved without rotation and at solar metallicity. Of the models
that do have sufficient compactness for black-hole formation, most of them also
retain a large amount of angular momentum in the core, making them prone to a
magneto-rotational explosion, therefore preferentially leaving behind a
proto-magnetar. A large progenitor angular-momentum budget is often the sole
criterion invoked in the community today to assess the suitability for
producing a collapsar. This simplification ignores equally important
considerations such as the core compactness, which conditions black-hole
formation, the core angular momentum, which may foster a magneto-rotational
explosion preventing black-hole formation, or the metallicity and the residual
envelope mass which must be compatible with inferences from observed LGRB/SNe.
Our study suggests that black-hole formation is non trivial, that there is room
for accommodating both collapsars and proto-magnetars as LGRB progenitors,
although proto-magnetars seem much more easily produced by current
stellar-evolutionary models.

that there is a temperature range (typically 2 K$<T<$10 K) in which the
calculated resistivity becomes independent of temperature due to a subtle
cancellation between the temperature dependent resistive scattering
contributions arising from impurities and phonons. This resistivity saturation
regime appears at low carrier densities when the increasing resistivity due to

According to the previous criteria,the present post-coalescence systems would

in deep surveys at infrared wavelengths. We specifically need a method to
separate galaxies from stars using only the infrared information to study the
properties of galaxies, e.g., to estimate the angular correlation function,

galaxies in the data from the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Deep survey
collected in nine AKARI / IRC bands from 2 to 24 {\mu}m that cover the near-
and mid-infrared wavelengths (hereafter NIR and MIR). We plan to estimate the
correlation function for NIR and MIR galaxies from a sample selected according
to our criteria in future research. Methods: We used support vector machines
(SVM) to study the distribution of stars and galaxies in the AKARIs multicolor
space. We defined the training samples of these objects by calculating their
infrared stellarity parameter (sgc). We created the most efficient classifier
and then tested it on the whole sample. We confirmed the developed separation
with auxiliary optical data obtained by the Subaru telescope and by creating
Euclidean normalized number count plots. Results: We obtain a 90% accuracy in
pinpointing galaxies and 98% accuracy for stars in infrared multicolor space
with the infrared SVM classifier. The source counts and comparison with the
optical data (with a consistency of 65% for selecting stars and 96% for

Conclusions: The infrared classifier derived with the SVM method based on
infrared sgc- selected training samples proves to be very efficient and
accurate in selecting stars and galaxies in deep surveys at infrared

period of about one year. The data establish that SN 2011bm is a
spectroscopically normal SN Ic with moderately low ejecta velocities and with a
very slow spectroscopic and photometric evolution (more than twice as slow as
SN 1998bw). The Pan-STARRS1 retrospective detection shows that the rise time
from explosion to peak was 40 days in the R band. Through an analysis of the
light curve and the spectral sequence, we estimate a kinetic energy of 7-17 foe
and a total ejected mass of 7-17 Mo, 5-10 Mo of which is oxygen and 0.6-0.7 Mo
is 56Ni. The physical parameters obtained for SN 2011bm suggest that its
progenitor was a massive star of initial mass 30-50 Mo. The profile of the
forbidden oxygen lines in the nebular spectra show no evidence of a bi-polar
geometry in the ejected material.

parallel-propagating ion cyclotron waves. Ion cyclotron waves propagating
through this marginally stable plasma will neither grow nor damp. The
dispersion relation of these waves, {\omega} (k), smoothly rises from the usual
MHD behavior at small |k| to reach {\omega} = {\Omega}p as k \rightarrow
\pm\infty. The proton distribution function has constant phase-space density
along the characteristic resonant surfaces defined by this dispersion relation.
Our equation contains a free function describing the variation of the proton
phase-space density across these surfaces. Taking this free function to be a
simple ""box function"", we obtain specific solutions of the marginally stable
state for a range of proton parallel betas. The phase speeds of these waves are
larger than those given by the cold plasma dispersion relation, and the
characteristic surfaces are more sharply peaked in the v\bot direction. The

represented by nodes in a graph. There are $m$ consumers, each has a budget and
wants to buy two products. Consumers are represented by weighted edges. Given
the prices of products, each consumer will buy both products she wants, at the
given price, if she can afford to. Our objective is to help the seller price
the products to maximize her profit.
  This problem is called {\em graph vertex pricing} ({\sf GVP}) problem and has
resisted several recent attempts despite its current simple solution. This
motivates the study of this problem on special classes of graphs. In this
paper, we study this problem on a large class of graphs such as graphs with
bounded treewidth, bounded genus and $k$-partite graphs.
  We show that there exists an {\sf FPTAS} for {\sf GVP} on graphs with bounded
treewidth. This result is also extended to an {\sf FPTAS} for the more general
{\em single-minded pricing} problem. On bounded genus graphs we present a {\sf
PTAS} and show that {\sf GVP} is {\sf NP}-hard even on planar graphs.
  We study the Sherali-Adams hierarchy applied to a natural Integer Program
formulation that $(1+\epsilon)$-approximates the optimal solution of {\sf GVP}.
Sherali-Adams hierarchy has gained much interest recently as a possible
approach to develop new approximation algorithms. We show that, when the input
graph has bounded treewidth or bounded genus, applying a constant number of
rounds of Sherali-Adams hierarchy makes the integrality gap of this natural
{\sf LP} arbitrarily small, thus giving a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution
to the original {\sf GVP} instance.
  On $k$-partite graphs, we present a constant-factor approximation algorithm.
We further improve the approximation factors for paths, cycles and graphs with
degree at most three.

magnitude of the spin moment is found to vary significantly among different

rely on Shearer's entropy inequality which is information-theoretic. Thus, the
previous results leave open the question of whether there exist algorithms
whose running time achieve these optimal bounds. An answer to this question may
be interesting to database practice, as it is known that any algorithm based on
the traditional select-project-join style plans typically employed in an RDBMS
are asymptotically slower than the optimal for some queries. We construct an
algorithm whose running time is worst-case optimal for all natural join
queries. Our result may be of independent interest, as our algorithm also
yields a constructive proof of the general fractional cover bound by Atserias,
Grohe, and Marx without using Shearer's inequality. This bound implies two
famous inequalities in geometry: the Loomis-Whitney inequality and the

is comparable to that of the background ions. Under such conditions, the local
electrical conductivity is significantly altered in the sample zone making the
electric field, and therefore, the ion migration velocity concentration
dependent. The resulting nonlinear wave exhibits shock like features, and,
under certain simplifying assumptions, is described by Burgers' equation (S.
Ghosal and Z. Chen Bull. Math. Biol. 2010, vol.72, pg. 2047).In this paper, we
consider the more general situation where the walls of the separation channel
may have a non-zero zeta potential and are therefore able to sustain an
electro-osmotic bulk flow. The main result is a one dimensional nonlinear
advection diffusion equation for the area averaged concentration. This
homogenized equation accounts for the Taylor-Aris dispersion resulting from the
variation in the electro-osmotic slip velocity along the wall. It is shown that
in a certain range of parameters, the electro-osmotic flow can actually reduce
the total dispersion by delaying the formation of a concentration shock.
However, if the electro-osmotic flow is sufficiently high, the total dispersion
is increased because of the Taylor-Aris contribution.

proved that finiteness of the dimension of the full subcategory consisting of
maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules which are locally free on the punctured spectrum

the celebrated theorem of Auslander, Huneke, Leuschke and Wiegand is not only

Cohen-Macaulay modules as triangulated categories are also investigated in the

of interest in cell biomechanics. One way of quantifying this force is to allow
the cell to crawl against a measurable and adjustable restraining force until
the cell is no longer able to move in a direction opposite to the applied
force. Fukui et al.[1] reported on an experiment where amoeboid cells were
imaged while they crawled against an artificial gravity field created by a
centrifuge. An unexpected observation was that the net applied force on the
amoeba did not seem to be the primary factor that limited its ability to climb.
Instead, it appeared that the amoeba stalled when it was no longer able to
support a pseudopodium against the applied gravity field. The high g-load bend
the pseudopodium thereby preventing its attachment to the target point directly
ahead of the cell. In this paper we further refine this idea by identifying the
bending of the pseudopodium with the onset of elastic instability of a beam
under its own weight. It is shown that the principal features of the experiment
may be understood through this model and an estimate for the limiting g-load in
reasonable accord with the experimental measurements is recovered.

the system's behavior at high strain rates is controlled primarily by

occurs at the lower strain rates for temperatures near the glass transition. We

interference of squeezed states. In many of optical systems, such as parametric
down conversion or interference of optical squeezed states, production of two
perfectly symmetric subsystems is usually used for demonstrating the existence
of entanglement. This symmetry simplifies the description of the concept of
entanglement. However, asymmetry in entanglement may arise naturally in a real
experiment, or be intentionally introduced in a given quantum information
protocol. These asymmetries can emerge from having the output beams experience
different losses and environmental contamination, or from the availability of
non-identical input quantum states in quantum communication protocols. In this
paper, we present a visualisation of entanglement using quadrature amplitude
plots of the twin beams. We quantitatively discuss the strength of asymmetric
entanglement using EPR and inseparability criteria and theoretically show that
the optimal beamsplitter ratio for entanglement is dependent on the asymmetries
and may not be 50/50. To support this theory, we present experimental results
showing one particular asymmetric entanglement where a 0.78/0.22 beamsplitter
is optimal for observing entanglement.

  2012. The full version is submitted to IEEE TON",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Greedy Maximal Scheduling (GMS) is an attractive low-complexity scheme for
scheduling in wireless networks. Recent work has characterized its throughput
for the case when there is no fading/channel variations. This paper aims to
understand the effect of channel variations on the relative throughput
performance of GMS vis-a-vis that of an optimal scheduler facing the same
fading. The effect is not a-priori obvious because, on the one hand, fading
could help by decoupling/precluding global states that lead to poor GMS
performance, while on the other hand fading adds another degree of freedom in
which an event unfavourable to GMS could occur.
  We show that both these situations can occur when fading is adversarial. In
particular, we first define the notion of a {\em Fading Local Pooling factor
(F-LPF)}, and show that it exactly characterizes the throughput of GMS in this
setting. We also derive general upper and lower bounds on F-LPF. Using these
bounds, we provide two example networks - one where the relative performance of
GMS is worse than if there were no fading, and one where it is better.

a quantum walk model on a quasi-1-dimensional ladder filled with stationary
anyons. The model includes loss of information of the coin and nonlocal fusion
degrees of freedom on every second time step, such that the entanglement
between the position states and the exponentially growing auxiliary degrees of
freedom is lost. The computational complexity of numerical calculations reduces
drastically from the fully coherent anyonic quantum walk model, allowing for
relatively long simulations for anyons which are spin-1/2 irreps of SU(2)_k
Chern-Simons theory. We find that for Abelian anyons, the walk retains the
ballistic spreading velocity just like particles with trivial braiding
statistics. For non-Abelian anyons, the numerical results indicate that the
spreading velocity is linearly dependent on the number of time steps. By
approximating the Kraus generators of the time evolution map by circulant

favor the former while others favor the latter. ClassiMap switches between such

wavelength range between 300 and 400 nm, the interstellar extinction curve does
not display any of the sharp electronic absorption bands that are
characteristic for large polyatomic molecules, such as polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), which belong to the most abundant interstellar molecules.
Aims. We aim to verify whether the absorption curves of mixtures of
medium-sized PAHs produced in the laboratory can explain the astronomical
observations. Methods. The PAH mixtures were synthesized by infrared laser
pyrolysis and subsequent chemical extraction and size separation. The matrix
isolation technique was used to study the absorption spectra of isolated
molecules at low temperature. Results. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the UV-visible absorption curves of PAH mixtures can be very smooth,
displaying no sharp bands, if the molecular diversity is sufficiently high.
Conclusions. In view of the absence of sharp electronic features on the
interstellar extinction curve for 300 < {\lambda} < 400 nm, we conclude from
our experimental findings that the interstellar PAH population must be very
diverse. The low fractional abundances of individual species prevent their
detection on the basis of spectral fingerprints in the UV.

supersymmetry breaking when the Chern-Simons level is less than a certain
number. The mechanism of the supersymmetry breaking is, however, not clear from
the field theory viewpoint. In this paper, we discuss vacuum states of ${\cal
N}=2$ pure Chern-Simons theory and ${\cal N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter theories of
quiver type using related theories in which Chern-Simons terms are replaced
with (anti-)fundamental chiral multiplets. In the latter theories,
supersymmetry breaking can be shown to occur by examining that the vacuum
energy is non-zero.

networks that exploits the broadcast nature of the wireless medium. OR combines
frames from multiple receivers and therefore creates a form of Spatial
Diversity, called MAC Diversity. The gain from OR is especially high in
networks where the majority of links has a high packet loss probability. The
updated IEEE 802.11n standard improves the physical layer with the ability to
use multiple transmit and receive antennas, i.e. Multiple-Input and
Multiple-Output (MIMO), and therefore already offers spatial diversity on the
physical layer, i.e. called Physical Diversity, which improves the reliability
of a wireless link by reducing its error rate. In this paper we quantify the
gain from MAC diversity as utilized by OR in the presence of PHY diversity as
provided by a MIMO system like 802.11n. We experimented with an IEEE 802.11n
indoor testbed and analyzed the nature of packet losses. Our experiment results
show negligible MAC diversity gains for both interference-prone 2.4 GHz and
interference-free 5 GHz channels when using 802.11n. This is different to the
observations made with single antenna systems based on 802.11b/g, as well as in

sufficiently far apart to create a preferential direction in azimuth. A re-tune

shown that this model belongs to the B1-type and the same time-scaling exponent
of 1/5 for N, terrace width and bunch width is obtained. An extended set of
scaling exponents is obtained from the model of S.Stoyanov of diffusion-limited
evaporation affected by electromigration of the adatoms. This model is of

not necessarily driven by inter-particle interactions but can occur in an ideal
gas as a result of a purely statistical saturation of excited states. However,
interactions are necessary for any system to reach thermal equilibrium and so
are required for condensation to occur in finite time. In this Chapter we
review the role of interactions in Bose-Einstein condensation, covering both
theory and experiment. We focus on measurements performed on harmonically
trapped ultracold atomic gases, but also discuss how these results relate to
the uniform-system case, which is more theoretically studied and also more
relevant for other experimental systems.
  We first consider interaction strengths for which the system can be
considered sufficiently close to equilibrium to measure thermodynamic
behaviour. In particular we discuss the effects of interactions both on the
mechanism of condensation (namely the saturation of the excited states) and on
the critical temperature at which condensation occurs. We then discuss in more
detail the conditions for the equilibrium thermodynamic measurements to be
possible, and the non-equilibrium phenomena that occur when these conditions
are controllably violated by tuning the strength of interactions in the gas.

commonly achieved by numerical integration of the Bloch-McConnell equations. We
derive an analytical solution of the Bloch-McConnell equations that describes
the magnetization of coupled spin populations under radiofrequency
irradiation.As CEST and off-resonant SL are equivalent, their steady-state
magnetization and dynamics can be predicted by the same single eigenvalue: the
longitudinal relaxation rate in the rotating frame R1rho. For the case of
slowly exchanging systems, e.g. amide protons, the saturation of the small
proton pool is affected by transverse relaxation (R2b). It turns out, that R2b
is also significant for intermediate exchange, such as amine- or
hydroxyl-exchange or paramagnetic CEST agents, if pools are only partially
saturated. We propose a solution for R1rho that includes R2 of the exchanging
pool by extending existing approaches, and verify it by numerical simulations.
With the appropriate projection factors, we obtain an analytical solution for
CEST and SL for nonzero R2 of the exchanging pool, whilst considering the
dilution by direct water saturation across the entire Z-spectra. This allows
the optimization of irradiation parameters and the quantification of
pH-dependent exchange rates and metabolite concentrations. In addition, we
propose evaluation methods that correct for concomitant direct saturation
effects. It is shown that existing theoretical treatments for CEST are special

Brownian motion in $E := [0;\infty)^n$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, where the behavior on
the boundary is determined by the competing effects of reflection from and
pinning at the boundary. The problem is formulated in an $L^2$-setting with
underlying measure $\mu=\varrho m$. Here $\varrho$ is a positive density,
integrable with respect to the measure $m$ and fulfilling the Hamza condition.
The measure $m$ is such that the boundary of $E$ is not of $m$-measure zero. A
reference measure of this type is needed in order to give meaning to the
so-called Wentzell boundary condition which is in literature typical for
modeling such kind of boundary behavior. In providing a Skorokhod decomposition
of the constructed process we are able to justify that the stochastic process
is solving the underlying stochastic differential equation weakly in the sense
of N. Ikeda and Sh. Watanabe for quasi every starting point. At the boundary
the constructed process indeed is governed by the competing effects of
reflection and pinning. In order to obtain the Skorokhod decomposition we need
$\varrho$ to be continuously differentiable on $E$, which is equivalent to
continuity of the logarithmic derivative of $\varrho$. Furthermore, we assume
that the logarithmic derivative of $\varrho$ is square integrable with respect
to $\mu$. We do not need that the logarithmic derivative of $\varrho$ is
Lipschitz continuous. In particular, our considerations enable us to construct
a dynamical wetting model (also known as Ginzburg-Landau dynamics) on a bounded
set $D_N\subset\mathbb{Z}^d$ under mild assumptions on the underlying pair
interaction potentials in all dimensions $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In dimension $d=2$

Monte-Carlo simulation of the random time series to check the effect of our

with those obtained by random subset selection (RSS) method of Peterson et al.
(1998). The lag in the high-velocity wings are shorter than in the line core in
accordance with the virial motions. However, the lag is slightly larger in the
blue wing than in the red wing. This is a signature of the infall gas motion.
Probably the BLR kinematic in the Mrk 6 nucleus is a combination of the
Keplerian and infall motions. The velocity-delay dependence is similar for
individual observational seasons. The measurements of the Hbeta line width in
combination with the reverberation lag permits us to determine the black hole

by the passage of helical magnetic field lines from sub-photosphere and the
shuffling motions of foot-points of preexisting coronal field lines separately.
It is well known that only the velocity component which is perpendicular to the
magnetic field ($\upsilon_{\perp B}$) has contribution to the helicity
accumulation. Here, we demonstrate that $\upsilon_{\perp B}$ can be deduced
from horizontal motion and vector magnetograms, under a simple relation of
$\upsilon_t = \mu_t + \frac{\upsilon_n}{B_n} B_t$ as suggested by
D$\acute{e}$moulin & Berger (2003). Then after dividing $\upsilon_{\perp B}$
into two components, as one is tangential and the other is normal to the solar
surface, we can determine both terms of helicity transport. Active region (AR)
NOAA 10930 is analyzed as an example during its solar disk center passage by
using data obtained by the Spectro-Polarimeter and the Narrowband Filter Imager
of Solar Optical Telescope on board Hinode. We find that in our calculation,
the helicity injection by flux emergence and shuffling motions have the same
sign. During the period we studied, the main contribution of helicity
accumulation comes from the flux emergence effect, while the dynamic transient
evolution comes from the shuffling motions effect. Our observational results
further indicate that for this AR, the apparent rotational motion in the
following sunspot is the real shuffling motions on solar surface.

We obtain classical solutions of Yang-Mills fields up to the first subleading
order correction by using small amplitude expansion of the gauge field without
considering gravitational back reaction. We also consider SU(2) Yang-Mills
instanton solution in $AdS_4$ bulk, and propose a boundary action. It turns out
that the boundary theory is the Chern Simons theory with a non-local
deformation which has the form similar to the Wilson line. In the limit of the
deformation parameter $\rho \rightarrow \infty$, this non-local deformation is
suppressed and the boundary theory becomes pure Chern Simons. For large but
finite values of $\rho$, this non-local deformation can be treated
perturbatively within the Chern-Simon theory.

transport calculations. First the dependence of the transmission function on
the size of the nanoribbon has been studied. Two regimes are highlighted: for
small applied bias transport takes place via tunneling and the length of the
ribbon is the key parameter that determines the junction conductance; at higher
applied bias resonant transport through HOMO and LUMO starts to play a more
determinant role, and the transport properties depend on the details of the
geometry (width and length) of the carbon nanoribbon. In the case of the
thinnest ribbon it has been verified that a tilted geometry of the central
phenyl ring is the most stable configuration. As a consequence of this rotation
the conductance decreases due to the misalignment of the $pi$ orbitals between
the phenyl ring and the remaining part of the junction. All the computed
transmission functions have shown a negligible dependence on different
saturations and reconstructions of the edges of the graphene leads, suggesting
a general validity of the reported results.

field in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. Perturbative
calculations suggest that the mass of this elementary scalar field is protected
against power divergences, and is controlled by the size of the extra dimension
R. As a first step in the study of this phenomenon beyond perturbation theory,
we investigate the phase diagram of a SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in five

the relevant physical scales. The lattice system shows a dimensionally reduced
phase where the four-dimensional correlation length is much larger than the
size of the extra dimension, but still smaller than the four-dimensional
volume. In this region of the bare parameter space, at energies below 1/R, the
non-perturbative spectrum contains a \emph{light} scalar state. This state has
a mass that is independent of the cut-off, and a small overlap with glueball
operators. Our results suggest that light scalar fields can be introduced in a
lattice theory using compactified extra dimensions, rather than fine tuning the
bare mass parameter.

  Isothermal, magnetised gas","10 pages, 5 figures. MNRAS accepted",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is widely accepted that supersonic, magnetised turbulence plays a
fundamental role for star formation in molecular clouds. It produces the
initial dense gas seeds out of which new stars can form. However, the exact
relation between gas compression, turbulent Mach number, and magnetic field
strength is still poorly understood. Here, we introduce and test an analytical
prediction for the relation between the density variance and the
root-mean-square Mach number in supersonic, isothermal, magnetised turbulent
flows. We approximate the density and velocity structure of the interstellar
medium as a superposition of shock waves. We obtain the density contrast
considering the momentum equation for a single magnetised shock and extrapolate
this result to the entire cloud. Depending on the field geometry, we then make
three different assumptions based on observational and theoretical constraints:
B independent of density, B proportional to the root square of the density and
B proportional to the density. We test the analytically derived density
variance--Mach number relation with numerical simulations, and find that for B
proportional to the root square of the density, the variance in the logarithmic
density contrast, $\sigma_{\ln
\rho/\rho_0}^2=\ln[1+b^2\mathscr{M}^2\beta_0/(\beta_0+1)]$, fits very well to
simulated data with turbulent forcing parameter b=0.4, when the gas is
super-Alfv\'enic. However, this result breaks down when the turbulence becomes
trans-Alfv\'enic or sub-Alfv\'enic, because in this regime the turbulence
becomes highly anisotropic. Our density variance--Mach number relations
simplify to the purely hydrodynamic relation as the ratio of thermal to
magnetic pressure $\beta_0$ approaches infinite.

upon the relative speeds of the moving observers. This has been proved by
unifying theories of chemical kinetics, which are transition state theory,
collision theory, RRKM and Marcus theory, with the special theory of
relativity. Boltzmann constant and energy spacing between permitted quantum
levels of molecules are quantum mechanically proved to be Lorentz variant. The
relativistic statistical thermodynamics has been developed to explain
quasiequilibrium existing between reactants and activated complex. The newly
formulated Lorentz transformation of the rate constant from Arrhenius Equation,
of the collision frequency and of the Eyring and Marcus equations renders the
rate law also Lorentz variant. For a moving observer moving at fractions of the
speed of light along the reaction coordinate the transition state possess less
kinetic energy to sweep translation over it. This results in the slower
transformation of reactants into products and in a stretched time frame for the
chemical reaction. Lorentz transformation of the half-life equation explains
time dilation of the half life period of chemical reactions and proves special
theory of relativity and presents theory of relativistic chemical kinetics in
accord with each other. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the present theory,
the enzymatic reaction of methylamine dehydrogenase and radioactive
disintegration of Astatine are considered as numerical examples.

to the energy consumed by sensor nodes. In that regard, modulated
