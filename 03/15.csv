thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) and homogeneity in the atmospheres of red
giant stars in Galactic globular cluster NGC 6752, to assess their influence on
the formation of Ba II lines. Methods: One-dimensional (1D) local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) and 1D NLTE barium abundances were derived using classical 1D
ATLAS stellar model atmospheres. The three-dimensional (3D) LTE abundances were
obtained for 8 red giants on the lower RGB, by adjusting their 1D LTE
abundances using 3D-1D abundance corrections, i.e., the differences between the
abundances obtained from the same spectral line using the 3D hydrodynamical
(CO5BOLD) and classical 1D (LHD) stellar model atmospheres. Results: The mean
1D barium-to-iron abundance ratios derived for 20 giants are <[Ba/Fe]>_{1D
NLTE} = 0.05 \pm0.06 (stat.) \pm0.08 (sys.). The 3D-1D abundance correction
obtained for 8 giants is small (~+0.05 dex), thus leads to only minor
adjustment when applied to the mean 1D NLTE barium-to-iron abundance ratio for
the 20 giants, <[Ba/Fe]>_{3D+NLTE} = 0.10 \pm0.06(stat.) \pm0.10(sys.). The
intrinsic abundance spread between the individual cluster stars is small and
can be explained in terms of uncertainties in the abundance determinations.
Conclusions: Deviations from LTE play an important role in the formation of
barium lines in the atmospheres of red giants studied here. The role of 3D
hydrodynamical effects should not be dismissed either, even if the obtained
3D-1D abundance corrections are small. This result is a consequence of subtle
fine-tuning of individual contributions from horizontal temperature
fluctuations and differences between the average temperature profiles in the 3D
and 1D model atmospheres: owing to the comparable size and opposite sign, their
contributions nearly cancel each other.

adaptively changing the network coding map used at the relay greatly reduces
the impact of Multiple Access interference at the relay. The harmful effect of
the deep channel fade conditions can be effectively mitigated by proper choice
of these network coding maps at the relay. Alternatively, in this paper we
propose a Distributed Space Time Coding (DSTC) scheme, which effectively
removes most of the deep fade channel conditions at the transmitting nodes
itself without any CSIT and without any need to adaptively change the network
coding map used at the relay. It is shown that the deep fades occur when the

design criterion referred to as the \textit{singularity minimization criterion}
under which the number of such vector subspaces are minimized is obtained.
Also, a criterion to maximize the coding gain of the DSTC is obtained. Explicit
low decoding complexity DSTC designs which satisfy the singularity minimization
criterion and maximize the coding gain for QAM and PSK signal sets are
provided. Simulation results show that at high Signal to Noise Ratio, the DSTC

enough to start studying the fine structure of the observed p-mode spectra.
Aims: In this paper, we aim to study the signature of stellar evolution on the
radial and p-dominated l=2 modes in an ensemble of red giants that show
solar-type oscillations. Results: We find that the phase shift of the central
radial mode (eps_c) is significantly different for red giants at a given large
frequency separation (Dnu_c) but which burn only H in a shell (RGB) than those
that have already ignited core He burning. Even though not directly probing the
stellar core the pair of local seismic observables (Dnu_c, eps_c) can be used
as an evolutionary stage discriminator that turned out to be as reliable as the
period spacing of the mixed dipole modes. We find a tight correlation between
eps_c and Dnu_c for RGB stars and no indication that eps_c depends on other
properties of these stars. It appears that the difference in eps_c between the
two populations becomes if we use an average of several radial orders, instead
of a local, i.e. only around the central radial mode, Dnu to determine the
phase shift. This indicates that the information on the evolutionary stage is
encoded locally, in the shape of the radial mode sequence. This shape turns out
to be approximately symmetric around the central radial mode for RGB stars but
asymmetric for core He burning stars. We computed radial modes for a sequence
of RG models and find them to qualitatively confirm our findings. We also find
that, at least in our models, the local Dnu is an at least as good and mostly
better proxy for both the asymptotic spacing and the large separation scaled
from the model density than the average Dnu. Finally, we investigate the
signature of the evolutionary stage on the small frequency separation and
quantify the mass dependency of this seismic parameter.

milli-arc-seconds and axial ratios between 1.5 to 3. The image position angles
oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane are interpreted in terms of
elongation of electron-density irregularities parallel to the galactic plane,
due to a similarly aligned local magnetic field. However, we find the apparent
angular sizes on the average a factor of 2.5 less than those reported by Desai
et al., indicating significantly less scattering than inferred earlier. The
average position angle of the scattered broadened images is also seen to
deviate significantly (by about 10 degrees) from that implied by the magnetic

GJ581. This region,for this system, is very attractive of the dynamical point
of view due to several resonances of two and three bodies present there. In
this work, we investigate the conditions under which the planet g may exist. We
stress the fact that the planet g is intimately related with the orbital
elements of the planet d; more precisely, we conclude that it is not possible
to disconnect its existence from the determination of the eccentricity of the
planet d. Concerning the planet f, we have found one solution with period
$\approx 450$ days, but we are judicious about any affirmation concernig this
body because its signal is in the threshold of detection and the high period is
in a spectral region where the ocorruence of aliases is very common. Besides,
we outline some dynamical features of the habitable zone with the dynamical map
and point out the role played by some resonances laying there.

variety of extensions beyond the MSSM with which it shares the same field
content. The lightest Higgs mass can be much heavier than in the MSSM without
creating a tension with naturalness or requiring superheavy stops. The
phenomenology of the Higgs sector is at the same time much richer. We
critically review the properties of a Higgs with mass around 125GeV in this
model. In particular, we investigate how the rates in the important inclusive 2
photons channel, the 2 photons + 2 jets and the ZZ to 4 leptons (and/or WW) can
be enhanced or reduced compared to the standard model and what kind of
correlations between these rates are possible. We consider both a vanilla model
where stops have moderate masses and do not mix and a model with large mixing
and a light stop. We show that in both cases there are scenarios that lead to
enhancements in these rates at a mass of 125GeV corresponding either to the
lightest Higgs or the heaviest CP-even Higgs of the model. In all of these
scenarios we study the prospects of finding other signatures either of the
125GeV Higgs or those of the heavier Higgses. In most cases the $\oo{\tau}\tau$
channels are the most promising. Exclusion limits from the recent LHC Higgs
searches are folded in our analyses while the tantalising hints for a Higgs
signal at 125GeV are used as an example of how to constrain the BMSSM and/or
direct future searches.

applications to various fields such as environmental and structural health
monitoring. A distinguishing feature of wireless sensors is the need to perform
both source coding tasks, such as measurement and compression, and transmission
tasks. It is known that the overall energy consumption for source coding is
generally comparable to that of transmission, and that a joint design of the
two classes of tasks can lead to relevant performance gains. Moreover, the
efficiency of source coding in a sensor network can be potentially improved via
distributed techniques by leveraging the fact that signals measured by
different nodes are correlated.
  In this paper, a data gathering protocol for multihop wireless sensor
networks with energy harvesting capabilities is studied whereby the sources
measured by the sensors are correlated. Both the energy consumptions of source
coding and transmission are modeled, and distributed source coding is assumed.
The problem of dynamically and jointly optimizing the source coding and
transmission strategies is formulated for time-varying channels and sources.
The problem consists in the minimization of a cost function of the distortions
in the source reconstructions at the sink under queue stability constraints. By
adopting perturbation-based Lyapunov techniques, a close-to-optimal online
scheme is proposed that has an explicit and controllable trade-off between
optimality gap and queue sizes. The role of side information available at the
sink is also discussed under the assumption that acquiring the side information
entails an energy cost. It is shown that the presence of side information can
improve the network performance both in terms of overall network cost function
and queue sizes.

many measures have been introduced to quantify them. Some hierarchical
orderings of these measures have been established, e.g., discord is bigger than

states, for which several of these hierarchies collapse to a single value.
Because premeasurement states are the kind of states produced when a system
interacts with a measurement device, the hierarchy collapse implies that the
uncertainty of an observable is quantitatively connected to the quantum
correlations (entanglement, discord, etc.) produced when that observable is
measured. This fascinating connection between uncertainty and quantum
correlations leads to a reinterpretation of entropic formulations of the
uncertainty principle, so-called entropic uncertainty relations, including ones
that allow for quantum memory. These relations can be thought of as
lower-bounds on the entanglement created when incompatible observables are

The sample extends over a broad H-alpha luminosity L_bHa of 10^40 - 10^44 erg

of black hole mass 10^6<M_BH/M_Sun<10^9.5 and luminosity in Eddington units
10^-3 < L/L_Edd < 1. We combine ROSAT, GALEX and 2MASS observations to form the
SED from 2.2 mic to 2 keV. We find the following: 1. The distribution of the
H-alpha FWHM values is independent of luminosity. 2. The observed mean
optical-UV SED is well matched by a fixed shape SED of luminous quasars, which
scales linearly with L_bHa, and a host galaxy contribution. 3. The host galaxy
r-band (fibre) luminosity function follows well the luminosity function of
inactive non-emission line galaxies (NEG), consistent with a fixed fraction of
~3% of NEG hosting an AGN, regardless of the host luminosity. 4. The hosts of
lower luminosity AGN have a mean z band luminosity and u-z colour which are
identical to NEG with the same redshift distribution. With increasing L_bHa the
AGN hosts become bluer and less luminous than NEG. The implied increasing star
formation rate with L_bHa is consistent with the relation for SDSS type 2 AGN
of similar bolometric luminosity. 5. The optical-UV SED of the more luminous
AGN shows a small dispersion, consistent with dust reddening of a blue SED, as
expected for thermal thin accretion disc emission. 6. There is a rather tight
relation of nuL_nu(2 keV) and L_bHa, which provides a useful probe for
unobscured (true) type 2 AGN. 7. The primary parameter which drives the X-ray
to UV emission ratio is the luminosity, rather than M_BH or L/L_Edd.

different classes of models. The first class contains the prototypical models
described --at the mean-field level-- by the Random First Order Transition
(RFOT) theory of the glass transition, called either ""random XORSAT problem""
(in the information theory community) or ""diluted $p$-spin model"" (in the spin
glass community), undergoing a single-spin flip Glauber dynamics. The models in
the second class are Kinetically Constrained Models (KCM): their Hamiltonian is
that of independent spins in a constant magnetic field, hence their
thermodynamics is completely trivial, but the dynamics is such that only groups
of spin can flip together, thus implementing a kinetic constraint that induces
a non-trivial dynamical behavior. A mapping between some representatives of
these two classes has been known for long. Here we formally prove this mapping
at the level of the master equation, and we apply it to the particular case of
Bethe lattice models. This allows us to show that a RFOT model can be mapped
exactly into a KCM. However, the natural order parameter for the RFOT model,
namely the spin overlap, is mapped into a very complicated non-local function
in the KCM. Therefore, if one were to study the KCM without knowing of the
mapping onto the RFOT model, one would guess that its physics is quite
different from the RFOT one. Our results instead suggest that these two
apparently different descriptions of the glass transition are, at least in some
case, closely related.

evolution. Above 50 K, the low frequency optical conductivity is rather flat
without a clear Drude-like response, indicating a very short transport life
time of the free carriers. Well below the coherence temperature, there appears
an abrupt spectral weight suppression below 400 cm$^{-1}$, yielding evidence
for the formation of a hybridization energy gap arising from the mixing of the
conduction electron and narrow f-electron bands. A small part of the suppressed
spectral weight was transferred to the low frequency side, leading to a narrow
Drude component, while the majority of the suppressed spectral weight was
transferred to the high frequency side centered near 4000 cm$^{-1}$. Below the
hidden order temperature, another very prominent energy gap structure was
observed, which leads to the removal of a large part of the Drude component and
a sharp reduction of the carrier scattering rate. The study revealed that the

database by repeatedly applying canonical Grover's quantum rotation transform
to reach near the vicinity of the target entity. Thus, upon measurement, there
is a high probability of finding the target entity. However, the number of
times quantum rotation transform is to be applied for reaching near the
vicinity of the target is a function of the number of target entities present
in an unsorted database, which is generally unknown. A wrong estimate of the
number of target entities can lead to overshooting or undershooting the
targets, thus reducing the success probability. Some proposals have been made
to overcome this limitation. These proposals either employ quantum counting to
estimate the number of solutions or fixed-point schemes. This paper proposes a
new scheme for stopping the application of quantum rotation transformation on
reaching near the targets by disentanglement, measurement and subsequent
processing to estimate the distance of the state vector from the target states.
It ensures a success probability, which is greater than half for all
practically significant ratios of the number of target entities to the total
number of entities in a database. The search problem is trivial for remaining
possible ratios. The proposed scheme is simpler than quantum counting and more
efficient than the known fixed-point schemes. It has same order of
computational complexity as canonical Grover`s search algorithm but is slow by
a factor of two and requires two additional ancilla qubits.

absolute magnitude M_B = -20 at z ~ 1 via ~90 nights of observation on the
DEIMOS spectrograph at Keck Observatory. DEEP2 covers an area of 2.8 deg^2
divided into four separate fields, observed to a limiting apparent magnitude of
R_AB=24.1. Objects with z < 0.7 are rejected based on BRI photometry in three
of the four DEEP2 fields, allowing galaxies with z > 0.7 to be targeted ~2.5
times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. Approximately
sixty percent of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly
53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. Most of the
targets which fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z
~ 1.45. The DEIMOS 1200-line/mm grating used for the survey delivers high
spectral resolution (R~6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and unique
internal kinematic information. Extensive ancillary data are available in the
DEEP2 fields, particularly in the Extended Groth Strip, which has evolved into
one of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. DEEP2 surpasses other
deep precision-redshift surveys at z ~ 1 in terms of galaxy numbers, redshift
accuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. We also
provide an overview of the scientific highlights of the DEEP2 survey thus far.

optically-faint ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, e.g. L_{IR} > 10^{12}
Lsun). We present new far-infrared photometry, at 250, 350, and 500 um
(observed-frame), from the Herschel Space Telescope for a large sample of 113
DOGs with spectroscopically measured redshifts. Approximately 60% of the sample
are detected in the far-IR, confirming their high IR luminosities, which range
from 10^{11.6} Lsun < L_{IR} (8-1000 um) <10^{13.6} Lsun. 90% of the Herschel
detected DOGs in this sample are ULIRGs and 30% have L_{IR} > 10^{13} Lsun. The
rest-frame near-IR (1 - 3 um) SEDs of the Herschel detected DOGs are predictors
of their SEDs at longer wavelengths. DOGs with ""power-law"" SEDs in the
rest-frame near-IR show observed-frame 250/24 um flux density ratios similar to
the QSO-like local ULIRG, Mrk 231. DOGs with a stellar ""bump"" in their
rest-frame near-IR show observed-frame 250/24 um flux density ratios similar to
local star-bursting ULIRGs like NGC 6240. For the Herschel detected DOGs,
accurate estimates (within \approx 25%) of total IR luminosity can be predicted
from their rest-frame mid-IR data alone (e.g. from Spitzer observed-frame 24 um
luminosities). Herschel detected DOGs tend to have a high ratio of infrared
luminosity to rest-frame 8 um luminosity (the IR8= L_{IR}(8-1000 um)/v L_{v}(8
um) parameter of Elbaz et al. 2011). Instead of lying on the z=1-2 ""infrared
main-sequence"" of star forming galaxies (like typical LIRGs and ULIRGs at those
epochs) the DOGs, especially large fractions of the bump sources, tend to lie
in the starburst sequence. While, Herschel detected DOGs are similar to scaled
up versions of local ULIRGs in terms of 250/24 um flux density ratio, and IR8,
they tend to have cooler far-IR dust temperatures (20-40 K for DOGs vs. 40-50 K
for local ULIRGs). Abridged.

Fermi-liquid (FL) theory can experience a rearrangement of its Fermi surface if
the correlations grow sufficiently strong, as occurs at a quantum critical
point where the effective mass diverges. As yet, this phenomenon defies full
understanding, but salient aspects of the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior
observed beyond the quantum critical point are still accessible within the
general framework of the Landau quasiparticle picture. Self-consistent
solutions of the coupled Landau equations for the quasiparticle momentum
distribution $n(p)$ and quasiparticle energy spectrum $\epsilon(p)$ are shown
to exist in two distinct classes, depending on coupling strength and on whether
the quasiparticle interaction is regular or singular at zero momentum transfer.
One class of solutions maintains the idempotency condition $n^2(p)=n(p)$ of
standard FL theory at zero temperature $T$ while adding pockets to the Fermi
surface. The other solutions are characterized by a swelling of the Fermi
surface and a flattening of the spectrum $\epsilon(p)$ over a range of momenta
in which the quasiparticle occupancies lie between 0 and 1 even at T=0. The
latter, non-idempotent solution is revealed by analysis of a Poincar\'e mapping
associated with the fundamental Landau equation connecting $n(p)$ and
$\epsilon(p)$ and validated by solution of a variational condition that yields
the symmetry-preserving ground state. Paradoxically, this extraordinary
solution carries the burden of a large temperature-dependent excess entropy
down to very low temperatures, threatening violation of the Nernst Theorem. It
is argued that certain low-temperature phase transitions offer effective
mechanisms for shedding the entropy excess. Available measurements in
heavy-fermion compounds provide concrete support for such a scenario.

in the Minimal Supersymmetric (SUSY) Standard Model (MSSM) Higgs sector: (a)
the lighter CP-even Higgs boson SM-like and the non-SM-like Higgs bosons all
heavy and nearly degenerate above 300GeV; (b) the heavier CP-even Higgs boson
being SM-like and the neutral non-SM-like Higgs bosons all nearly degenerate
around 100GeV (a non-decoupling region). Due to the strong correlation between
the Higgs decays to W+W- and to ga,ga predicted in the MSSM, the deficit of a
W+W- final state signal would be in direct conflict with the ga,ga peak. If we
consider W+W- on its own, the absence of the W+W- signal would imply that the
SM-like Higgs boson has reduced coupling to W+-, and that the other non-SM-like
Higgs bosons should not be too heavy and do not decouple. If both the ga,ga
excess and the absence of W+W- continue, new physics beyond the MSSM will be
required. A similar correlation exists between the W+W- and tau+tau- channels:
a reduced W+W- channel would force the tau+tau- channel to be larger. Future
searches for the SM-like Higgs boson at the LHC will provide critical tests for
the MSSM prediction. We emphasize the potential importance of the electroweak
processes pp->H+H-, H+-A0, which are independent of the SUSY parameters except
for their masses. In addition, there may be sizable contributions from
pp->H+-h0, A0h0 and W+-H0, ZH0 in the non-decoupling region, which may serve to

current is typically much smaller than the drive current owing to the heavy
screening of the Coulomb interaction. There are, however, rare situations in
which strong electronic correlations exist between the two conductors. For
example, bilayer two-dimensional electron systems can support an exciton
condensate consisting of electrons in one layer tightly bound to holes in the
other. One thus expects ""perfect"" drag; a transport current of electrons driven
through one layer is accompanied by an equal one of holes in the other. (The
electrical currents are therefore opposite in sign.) Here we demonstrate just
this effect, taking care to ensure that the electron-hole pairs dominate the
transport and that tunneling of charge between the layers is negligible.

benefits from deep exposure (40 h) of the neighboring open cluster Westerlund
2. The observations have revealed a new extended region of VHE gamma-ray
emission. The new VHE source HESS J1018-589 shows a bright, point-like emission
region positionally coincident with SNR G284.3-1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6 - 5856 and
a diffuse extension towards the direction of PSR J1016-5857. A soft
Gamma=2.7+-0.5 photon index, with a differential flux at 1TeV of
N0=(4.2+-1.1)10^-13 TeV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1 is found for the point-like source,
whereas the total emission region including the diffuse emission region is well
fit by a power-law function with spectral index Gamma=2.9+-0.4 and differential
flux at 1TeV of N0=(6.8+-1.6) 10^-13 TeV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1. This H.E.S.S. detection
motivated follow-up X-ray observations with the XMM-Newton satellite to
investigate the origin of the VHE emission. The analysis of the XMM-Newton data
resulted in the discovery of a bright, non-thermal point-like source (XMMU
J101855.4-58564) with a photon index of Gamma=1.65+-0.08 in the center of
SNRG284.3-1.8, and a thermal, extended emission region coincident with its
bright northern filament. The characteristics of this thermal emission are used
to estimate the plasma density in the region as n~0.5 cm^-3(2.9kpc/d)^2. The
position of XMMUJ101855.4-58564 is compatible with the position reported by the
Fermi-LAT collaboration for the binary system 1FGL J1018.6-5856 and the

alongside archival multi-wavelength data to investigate the relationship
between the VHE gamma-ray emission from HESSJ1018-589 and the various potential

Millennium-XXL or MXXL, which uses 303 billion particles to represent the
formation of dark matter structures throughout a 4.1Gpc box in a LambdaCDM
cosmology. We create sky maps and identify large samples of galaxy clusters
using surrogates for four different observables: richness estimated from galaxy
surveys, X-ray luminosity, integrated Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal, and lensing
mass. The unprecedented combination of volume and resolution allows us to
explore in detail how these observables scale with each other and with cluster
mass. The scatter correlates between different mass-observable relations
because of common sensitivities to the internal structure, orientation and
environment of clusters, as well as to line-of-sight superposition of
uncorrelated structure. We show that this can account for the apparent
discrepancies uncovered recently between the mean thermal SZ signals measured
for optically and X-ray selected clusters by stacking data from the Planck
satellite. Related systematics can also affect inferences from extreme clusters
detected at high redshift. Our results illustrate that cosmological conclusions
from galaxy cluster surveys depend critically on proper modelling, not only of
the relevant physics, but also of the full distribution of the observables and
of the selection biases induced by cluster identification procedures.

disentangle the role of the environmental processes affecting galaxies in

sample of star-forming galaxies in clusters spanning more than four absolute
magnitudes. The galaxies inhabit three distinct environmental regions: virial
regions, cluster infall regions and field environment. We have applied rigorous
statistical tests in order to analyze both, the complete NUV-r' distributions
and their averages for three different bins of r'-band galaxy luminosity down
to M_r' ~ -18, throughout the three environmental regions considered. We have
identified the environmental processes that significantly affect the
star-forming galaxies in a given luminosity bin by using criteria based on the
characteristics of these processes: their typical time-scales, the regions
where they operate and the galaxy luminosity range for which their effects are
more intense. We have found that the high-luminosity (M_r'<=-20) star-forming
galaxies do not show significant signs in their star formation activity neither
of being affected by the environment in the last ~10^8 yr nor of a sudden
quenching in the last 1.5 Gyr. The intermediate-luminosity (-20<M_r'<=-19)
star-forming galaxies appear to be affected by starvation in the virial regions
and by the harassment both, in the virial and infall regions. Low-luminosity
(-19<M_r'<=-18.2) star-forming galaxies seem to be affected by the same
environmental processes as intermediate-luminosity star-forming galaxies in a
stronger way, as it would be expected for their lower luminosities.

GALEX to derive stellar masses (M_*) and star formation rates (SFRs) by fitting
their UV-optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In optical images, many
of the ALFALFA dwarfs are faint and of low surface brightness; only 56% of
those within the SDSS footprint have a counterpart in the SDSS spectroscopic
survey. A large fraction of the dwarfs have high specific star formation rates
(SSFRs) and estimates of their SFRs and M_* obtained by SED fitting are
systematically smaller than ones derived via standard formulae assuming a
constant SFR. The increased dispersion of the SSFR distribution at M_* < 10^8
M_sun is driven by a set of dwarf galaxies that have low gas fractions and
SSFRs; some of these are dE/dSphs in the Virgo cluster. The imposition of an
upper HI mass limit yields the selection of a sample with lower gas fractions
for their M_* than found for the overall ALFALFA population. Many of the
ALFALFA dwarfs, particularly the Virgo members, have HI depletion timescales
shorter than a Hubble time. An examination of the dwarf galaxies within the
full ALFALFA population in the context of global star formation laws is
consistent with the general assumptions that gas-rich galaxies have lower star
formation efficiencies than do optically selected populations and that HI disks
are more extended than stellar ones.

two-dimensional, while the component corresponding to the last type is
generically four-dimensional. The attraction to the set of solitary waves is
caused by the nonlinear energy transfer from lower harmonics to the continuous
spectrum and subsequent radiation.
  For the proof, we develop the well-posedness for the nonlinear wave equation
in discrete space-time, apply the technique of quasimeasures, and also obtain
the version of the Titchmarsh convolution theorem for distributions on the
circle.

metamaterials with inhomogeneous anisotropic shear moduli and density. Waves in
the pre-stressed medium are bent around the cloaked region by inducing
inhomogeneous stress fields via pre-stress. The equation governing antiplane
waves in the pre-stressed medium is equivalent to the antiplane equation in an
unstressed medium with inhomogeneous and anisotropic shear modulus and

fitting reconstruction method using coronagraph images from three viewpoints
has been described and applied to the CME ejected on August 7, 2010. The CME's
3D localisation, real shape and morphological evolution are presented. Due to
its interaction with the ambient solar wind, the morphology of this CME changed
significantly in the early phase of evolution. Two hours after its initiation,
it was expanding almost self-similarly. CME's 3D localisation is quite helpful
to link remote sensing observations to in situ measurements. The investigated
CME was propagating to Venus with its flank just touching STEREO B. Its
corresponding ICME in the interplanetary space shows a possible signature of a
magnetic cloud with a preceding shock in VEX observations, while from STEREO B
only a shock is observed. We have calculated three principle axes for the
reconstructed 3D CME cloud. The orientation of the major axis is in general
consistent with the orientation of a filament (polarity inversion line)
observed by SDO/AIA and SDO/HMI. The flux rope axis derived by the MVA analysis
from VEX indicates a radial-directed axis orientation. It might be that locally
only the leg of the flux rope passed through VEX. The height and speed profiles
from the Sun to Venus are obtained. We find that the CME speed possibly had
been adjusted to the speed of the ambient solar wind flow after leaving COR2
field of view and before arriving Venus. A southward deflection of the CME from
the source region is found from the trajectory of the CME geometric center. We
attribute it to the influence of the coronal hole where the fast solar wind
emanated from.

originator usage control, paying particular attention to enterprise-level
dynamic business federations. Rather than 'pre-defining' the information
re-dissemination paths, our business process slicing method 'capture' the asset
derivation pattern, allowing to maintain originators' policies during the full
lifecycle of assets in a collaborative context. First, we propose Service Call
Graph (SCG), based on extending the System Dependency Graph, to describe
dependencies among partners. When SCG (and corresponding 'service call tuple'
list) is built for a business process, it is analyzed to group partners into
sub-contexts, according to their dependency relations. Originator usage control
can be achieved focusing on each sub-context, by examining downstream
consumers' security profiles with upstream asset providers' policies. Second,
for analyzing SCG, we propose two 'slicing' strategies, namely 'asset-based'
and 'request-based' slicing, to deal with the scenarios of both
'pre-processing' a business process scripts and 'on-the-fly' analyzing service
compositions. Last, our implementation work involves a 'context manager'
service for processing business processes defined in WS-BPEL. It can be
composed with our former proposed policy negotiation and aggregation services
to provide policy-based end-to-end security management. We also make

observed by Koike-Akino et al. that adaptively changing the network coding map
used at the relay according to the channel conditions greatly reduces the
impact of multiple access interference which occurs at the relay during the MA
Phase and all these network coding maps should satisfy a requirement called the
exclusive law. Only the scenario in which the end nodes use M-PSK signal sets
is extensively studied in \cite{NVR} using Latin Sqaures. In this paper, we
address the case in which the end nodes use M-QAM signal sets (where M is of
the form $2^{2\lambda}$, $\lambda$ being any positive integer). In a fading
scenario, for certain channel conditions $\gamma e^{j \theta}$, termed singular
fade states, the MA phase performance is greatly reduced. We show that the
square QAM signal sets give lesser number of singular fade states compared to
PSK signal sets. Because of this, the complexity at the relay is enormously
reduced. Moreover, lesser number of overhead bits are required in the BC phase.
The fade state $\gamma e^{j \theta}=1$ is singular for all constellations of
arbitrary size including PSK and QAM. For arbitrary PSK constellation it is
well known that the Latin Square obtained by bit-wise XOR mapping removes this
singularity. We show that XOR mapping fails to remove this singularity for QAM
of size more greater than 4 and show that a doubly block circulant Latin Square
removes this singularity. Simulation results are presented to show the
superiority of QAM over PSK.

activation strategy for a large wireless network with multiple transmitters. In
this framework, some nodes cooperate with a nearby node that acts as a relay,

network is modeled as an independently marked Poisson point process and the
source nodes may choose their relays from the set of inactive nodes. Although
cooperation can potentially lead to significant improvements in the performance
of a communication pair, relaying causes additional interference in the
network, increasing the average noise that other nodes see. We investigate how
source nodes should balance cooperation vs. interference to obtain reliable
transmissions, and for this purpose we study and optimize a relay activation
strategy with respect to the outage probability. Surprisingly, in the high
reliability regime, the optimized strategy consists on the activation of all
the relays or none at all, depending on network parameters. We provide a simple
closed-form expression that indicates when the relays should be active, and we
introduce closed form expressions that quantify the performance gains of this
scheme with respect to a network that only uses direct transmission.

can be used to investigate the limits of computability. In this paper, they are
considered from several points of view that emphasize the importance and the
relativity of mathematical languages used to describe the Turing machines. A
deep investigation is performed on the interrelations between mechanical
computations and their mathematical descriptions emerging when a human (the
researcher) starts to describe a Turing machine (the object of the study) by
different mathematical languages (the instruments of investigation). Together
with traditional mathematical languages using such concepts as 'enumerable
sets' and 'continuum' a new computational methodology allowing one to measure
the number of elements of different infinite sets is used in this paper. It is
shown how mathematical languages used to describe the machines limit our
possibilities to observe them. In particular, notions of observable
deterministic and non-deterministic Turing machines are introduced and
conditions ensuring that the latter can be simulated by the former are
established.

planetary nebula (PN) that mimics the helium- and nitrogen-rich WN sequence of
massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. The central star of IC 4663 (PN G346.2-08.2) is
dominated by broad He II and N V emission lines which correspond to a [WN3]
spectral type. Unlike previous [WN] candidates, the surrounding nebula is
unambiguously a PN. At an assumed distance of 3.5 kpc, corresponding to a
stellar luminosity of 4000 Lsun, the V=16.9 mag central star remains 4-6 mag
fainter than the average luminosity of massive WN3 stars even out to an
improbable d=8 kpc. The nebula is typical of PNe with an elliptical morphology,
a newly discovered Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) halo, a relatively low
expansion velocity (v_exp=30 km/s) and a highly ionised spectrum with an
approximately Solar chemical abundance pattern. The [WN3] star is hot enough to
show Ne VII emission (T_*=140+/-20 kK) and exhibits a fast wind (v_infty=1900
km/s), which at d=3.5 kpc would yield a clumped mass loss rate of Mdot = 1.8 x
10^-8 Msun/yr with a small stellar radius (R_*=0.11 Rsun). Its atmosphere
consists of helium (95%), hydrogen (<2%), nitrogen (0.8%), neon (0.2%) and
oxygen (0.05%) by mass. Such an unusual helium-dominated composition cannot be
produced by any extant scenario used to explain the H-deficiency of post-AGB
stars. The O(He) central stars share a similar composition and the discovery of
IC 4663 provides the first evidence for a second He-rich/H-deficient post-AGB
evolutionary sequence [WN]->O(He). This suggests there is an alternative
mechanism responsible for producing the majority of H-deficient post-AGB stars
that may possibly be expanded to include other He-rich/H-deficient stars such
as R Coronae Borealis stars and AM Canum Venaticorum stars. The origin of the
unusual composition of [WN] and O(He) central stars remains unexplained.

bring for fluid-structure interaction, i.e. huge numerical problems and strong

fact that finite elements are well known by a large majority of researchers and
are easy to manipulate. The method we describe in this paper, called the camera
method, is well adapted to the study of a single particle in a network and most
particularly when the study focuses on the particle behaviour. The camera
method is based on two principles: 1/ the fluid structure interaction problem
is restricted to a neighbourhood of the particle, thus reducing drastically the
number of degrees of freedom of the problem; 2/ the neighbourhood mesh moves
and rotates with the particle, thus avoiding most of the mesh distortions that
occur in a standard ALE method. In this article, we present the camera method
and the conditions under which it can be used. Then we apply it to several
examples from the literature in 2D axi-symmetry, 2D and 3D.

service for buyers as it provides accessibility and reliability options for
users and scalable sales for providers. In spite of being attractive, Cloud
feature poses various new security threats and challenges when it comes to
deploying Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in Cloud environments. Most
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are designed to handle specific types of
attacks. It is evident that no single technique can guarantee protection
against future attacks. Hence, there is a need for an integrated scheme which
can provide robust protection against a complete spectrum of threats. On the
other hand, there is great need for technology that enables the network and its
hosts to defend themselves with some level of intelligence in order to
accurately identify and block malicious traffic and activities. In this case,
it is called Intrusion prevention system (IPS). Therefore, in this paper, we
emphasize on recent implementations of IDS on Cloud Computing environments in
terms of security and privacy. We propose an effective and efficient model
termed as the Integrated Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) which
combines both IDS and IPS in a single mechanism. Our mechanism also integrates
two techniques namely, Anomaly Detection (AD) and Signature Detection (SD) that
can work in cooperation to detect various numbers of attacks and stop them
through the capability of IPS.

problems has been developed in a series of papers. However, the embedding
approach, which advantageously converts the hybrid optimal control problem to a
classical nonlinear optimization, has not been extensively compared to
alternative solution approaches. The goal of this paper is thus to compare the
embedding approach to multi-parametric programming, mixed-integer programming
(e.g., CPLEX), and gradient-descent based methods in the context of five
recently published examples: a spring-mass system, moving-target tracking for a
mobile robot, two-tank filling, DC-DC boost converter, and skid-steered
vehicle. A sixth example, an autonomous switched 11-region linear system, is
used to compare a hybrid minimum principle method and traditional numerical
programming. For a given performance index for each case, cost and solution
times are presented. It is shown that there are numerical advantages of the
embedding approach: lower performance index cost (except in some instances when
autonomous switches are present), generally faster solution time, and
convergence to a solution when other methods may fail. In addition, the
embedding method requires no ad hoc assumptions (e.g., predetermined mode
sequences) or specialized control models. Theoretical advantages of the
embedding approach over the other methods are also described: guaranteed
existence of a solution under mild conditions, convexity of the embedded hybrid
optimization problem (under the customary conditions on the performance index),
solvability with traditional techniques (e.g., sequential quadratic
programming) avoiding the combinatorial complexity in the number of
modes/discrete variables of mixed-integer programming, applicability to affine
nonlinear systems, and no need to explicitly assign discrete/mode variables to
autonomous switches.

compressed together, can and do produce packings which are unstable to shear -
and that the probability of generating such packings reaches one near jamming.
We introduce a new protocol that, by allowing the system to explore different
box shapes as it equilibrates, generates truly jammed packings with strictly
positive shear moduli G. For these packings, the scaling of the average of G is
consistent with earlier results, while the probability distribution P(G)
exhibits novel and rich scaling

arbitrary number of types in finite populations based on stochastic

include demographic noise without requiring explicit simulations. Instead, the
population size only rescales the amplitude of the noise. Moreover, this
framework admits the inclusion of mutations between different types, provided
that mutation rates, $\mu$, are not too small compared to the inverse
population size 1/N. This ensures that all types are almost always represented
in the population and that the occasional extinction of one type does not
result in an extended absence of that type. For $\mu N\ll1$ this limits the use
of SDE's, but in this case there are well established alternative
approximations based on time scale separation. We illustrate our approach by a
Rock-Scissors-Paper game with mutations, where we demonstrate excellent
agreement with simulation based results for sufficiently large populations. In
the absence of mutations the excellent agreement extends to small population
sizes.

the form of adaption to the human conversation partner. It is a macro-level
post-hoc test in contrast to the definition of a Turing Machine (TM), which is
a prior micro-level definition. This raises the question of whether learning is
just another computational process, i.e. can be implemented as a TM. Here we
argue that learning or adaption is fundamentally different from computation,
though it does involve processes that can be seen as computations. To
illustrate this difference we compare (a) designing a TM and (b) learning a TM,
defining them for the purpose of the argument. We show that there is a
well-defined sequence of problems which are not effectively designable but are
learnable, in the form of the bounded halting problem. Some characteristics of
human intelligence are reviewed including it's: interactive nature, learning
abilities, imitative tendencies, linguistic ability and context-dependency. A
story that explains some of these is the Social Intelligence Hypothesis. If
this is broadly correct, this points to the necessity of a considerable period
of acculturation (social learning in context) if an artificial intelligence is
to pass the TT. Whilst it is always possible to 'compile' the results of
learning into a TM, this would not be a designed TM and would not be able to
continually adapt (pass future TTs). We conclude three things, namely that: a
purely ""designed"" TM will never pass the TT; that there is no such thing as a
general intelligence since it necessary involves learning; and that
learning/adaption and computation should be clearly distinguished.

galaxies may be grossly described as a luminous component embedded in a dark
matter halo. The density profile of these mass dominating haloes may be
determined by N - body simulations which mimic the evolution of the tiny
initial density perturbations during the process leading to the structures we
observe today. Unfortunately, when the effect of baryons is taken into account,
the situation gets much more complicated due to the difficulties in simulating
their physics. As a consequence, a definitive prediction of how dark matter
haloes should presently look like is still missing. We revisit here this issue
from an observational point of view devoting our attention to dwarf galaxies.
Being likely dark matter dominated, these systems are ideal candidates to
investigate the present day halo density profiles and check whether dark matter
related quantities correlate with the stellar ones or the environment. By
fitting a large sample of well measured rotation curves, we infer constraints
on both halo structural parameters (such as the logarithmic slope of the
density profile and its concentration) and derived quantities (e.g., the mass
fraction and the Newtonian acceleration) which could then be used to constrain
galaxy formation scenarios. Moreover, we investigate whether the halo
properties correlates with the environment the galaxy lives in thus offering a
new tool to deepen our understanding of galaxy formation.

post-bounce supernova environment. Upon perturbation and nonlinear SASI
development, shear flows associated with the spiral SASI mode contributes to a
widespread and turbulent field amplification mechanism. While the SASI may
contribute to neutron star magnetization, these simulations do not show
qualitatively new features in the global evolution of the shock as a result of
SASI-induced magnetic field amplification.

dielectric spacer has recently attracted considerable theoretical interest. We
first review, for the sake of completeness, the main analytical results which
have been obtained by other authors. We then illustrate pedagogically the
minimal theory of Coulomb drag between two spatially-separated two-dimensional
systems of massless Dirac fermions which are both away from the
charge-neutrality point. This relies on second-order perturbation theory in the
screened interlayer interaction and on Boltzmann transport theory. In this
theoretical framework and in the low-temperature limit, we demonstrate that, to
leading (i.e. quadratic) order in temperature, the drag transresistivity is
completely insensitive to the precise intralayer momentum-relaxation mechanism
(i.e. to the functional dependence of the scattering time on energy). We also
provide analytical results for the low-temperature drag transresistivity for
both cases of ""thick"" and ""thin"" spacers and for arbitrary values of the
dielectric constants of the media surrounding the two Dirac-fermion layers.
Finally, we present numerical results for the low-temperature drag
transresistivity in the case in which one of the media surrounding the
Dirac-fermion layers has a frequency-dependent dielectric constant. We conclude
by suggesting an experiment that can potentially allow for the observation of
departures from the canonical Fermi-liquid quadratic-in-temperature behavior of
the transresistivity.

recent theoretical progress regarding the understanding of relevant correlation
length scales in liquids approaching the glass transition. We obtain
predictions both from general theoretical arguments and from a variety of
specific perspectives: mode-coupling theory, kinetically constrained and defect
models, and random first order transition theory. In the latter approach, we
predict in particular a non-monotonic evolution of finite size effects across
the mode-coupling crossover due to the competition between mode-coupling and
activated relaxation. We study the role of competing relaxation mechanisms in
giving rise to non-monotonic finite size effects by devising a kinetically
constrained model where the proximity to the mode-coupling singularity can be
continuously tuned by changing the lattice topology. We use our theoretical
findings to interpret the results of extensive molecular dynamics studies of
four model liquids with distinct structures and kinetic fragilities. While the
less fragile model only displays modest finite size effects, we find a more
significant size dependence evolving with temperature for more fragile models,
such as Lennard-Jones particles and soft spheres. Finally, for a binary mixture
of harmonic spheres we observe the predicted non-monotonic temperature
evolution of finite size effects near the fitted mode-coupling singularity,
suggesting that the crossover from mode-coupling to activated dynamics is more
pronounced for this model. Finally, we discuss the close connection between our
results and the recent report of a non-monotonic temperature evolution of a
dynamic length scale near the mode-coupling crossover in harmonic spheres.

methods are sparse pseudo-input Gaussian process (SPGP) (Snelson and

generalizes SPGP and allows each basis point to have its own length scale.
However, VSGP was only derived for regression. In this paper, we propose a new

general GP likelihoods using a sparse and smooth basis. It includes both SPGP

as a result, we can summarize local data manifold information with a small set

manner, we propose a two-layer model, in which the sources are conditionally
uncorrelated from each other, but not independent; the dependence is caused by
the causality in their time-varying variances (envelopes). The model is
identified in two steps. We first propose a new source separation technique
which takes into account the autocorrelations (which may be time-varying) and
time-varying variances of the sources. The causality in the envelopes is then
discovered by exploiting a special kind of multivariate GARCH (generalized
autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity) model. The resulting causal
diagram gives the effective connectivity between the separated sources; in our
experimental results on MEG data, sources with similar functions are grouped
together, with negative influences between groups, and the groups are connected
via some interesting sources.

latent variables as confounders (common causes), the noise dependencies imply
further relations between the observed variables. Such models are then closely
related to causal discovery in the presence of nonlinear confounders, which is
a challenging problem. However, generally in such models the observation noise
is assumed to be independent across data dimensions, and consequently the noise
dependencies are ignored. In this paper we focus on the Gaussian process latent
variable model (GPLVM), from which we develop an extended model called
invariant GPLVM (IGPLVM), which can adapt to arbitrary noise covariances. With
the Gaussian process prior put on a particular transformation of the latent
nonlinear functions, instead of the original ones, the algorithm for IGPLVM
involves almost the same computational loads as that for the original GPLVM.
Besides its potential application in causal discovery, IGPLVM has the advantage
that its estimated latent nonlinear manifold is invariant to any nonsingular
linear transformation of the data. Experimental results on both synthetic and
realworld data show its encouraging performance in nonlinear manifold learning
and causal discovery.

preference of a user on an item is predicted based on the preferences of other
users with similar interests. A big challenge in using collaborative filtering
methods is the data sparsity problem which often arises because each user
typically only rates very few items and hence the rating matrix is extremely
sparse. In this paper, we address this problem by considering multiple
collaborative filtering tasks in different domains simultaneously and
exploiting the relationships between domains. We refer to it as a multi-domain
collaborative filtering (MCF) problem. To solve the MCF problem, we propose a
probabilistic framework which uses probabilistic matrix factorization to model
the rating problem in each domain and allows the knowledge to be adaptively
transferred across different domains by automatically learning the correlation
between domains. We also introduce the link function for different domains to
correct their biases. Experiments conducted on several real-world applications
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods when compared with some
representative methods.

generalization performance of a learning task with the help of some other
related tasks. In this paper, we propose a regularization formulation for
learning the relationships between tasks in multi-task learning. This
formulation can be viewed as a novel generalization of the regularization
framework for single-task learning. Besides modeling positive task correlation,
our method, called multi-task relationship learning (MTRL), can also describe
negative task correlation and identify outlier tasks based on the same
underlying principle. Under this regularization framework, the objective
function of MTRL is convex. For efficiency, we use an alternating method to
learn the optimal model parameters for each task as well as the relationships
between tasks. We study MTRL in the symmetric multi-task learning setting and
then generalize it to the asymmetric setting as well. We also study the
relationships between MTRL and some existing multi-task learning methods.
Experiments conducted on a toy problem as well as several benchmark data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of MTRL.

tuning that learns application characteristics and effects of tunable

a given latency constraint. The paper shows that accurate latency models can be

90% of the optimal fidelity by exploring the parameter space only 3% of the

Schr\""odinger equation with disorder is shown to be a critical phenomenon $-$
similar to a percolation transition on a disordered lattice, with the

critical point the spreading of the wave field is subdiffusive in the limit
$t\rightarrow+\infty$. The second moment grows with time as a powerlaw $\propto
t^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ exactly 1/3. This critical spreading finds its
significance in some connection with the general problem of transport along
separatrices of dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom and is
mathematically related with a description in terms fractional derivative
equations. Above the delocalization point, with the criticality effects
stepping aside, we find that the transport is subdiffusive with $\alpha = 2/5$
consistently with the results from previous investigations. A threshold for
unlimited spreading is calculated exactly by mapping the transport problem on a
Cayley tree.
