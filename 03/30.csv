  Numerical simulations of freely evolving three-dimensional reduced
magnetohydrodynamics (RHMHD) are performed, for different values of the Hall
parameter (the ratio of the ion skin depth to the macroscopic scale of the
turbulence) controlling the impact of the Hall term. The Hall effect modifies
the transfer of energy across scales, slowing down the transfer of energy from
the large scales up to the Hall scale (ion skin depth) and carrying faster the
energy from the Hall scale to smaller scales. The final outcome is an effective
shift of the dissipation scale to larger scales but also a development of
smaller scales. Current sheets (fundamental structures for energy dissipation)
are affected in two ways by increasing the Hall effect, with a widening but at
the same time generating an internal structure within them. In the case where
the Hall term is sufficiently intense, the current sheet is fully delocalized.
The effect appears to reduce impulsive effects in the flow, making it less
intermittent.

(`active') and MRI quiescent (`dead') zones plays an important role in models
of the disk evolution and in some planet formation scenarios. In reality, this
boundary is not well-defined: thermal heating from the star in a passive disk
yields a transition radius close to the star (<0.1 au), whereas if the disk is
already MRI active, it can self-consistently maintain the requisite
temperatures out to a transition radius of roughly 1 au. Moreover, the
interface may not be static; it may be highly fluctuating or else unstable. In
this paper, we study a reduced model of the dynamics of the active/dead zone
interface that mimics several important aspects of a real disk system. We find
that MRI-transition fronts propagate inward (a `dead front' suppressing the
MRI) if they are initially at the larger transition radius, or propagate
outward (an `active front' igniting the MRI) if starting from the smaller
transition radius. In both cases, the front stalls at a well-defined
intermediate radius, where it remains in a quasi-static equilibrium. We propose
that it is this new, intermediate stalling radius that functions as the true
boundary between the active and dead zones in protoplanetary disks. These
dynamics are likely implicated in observations of variable accretion, such as
FU Ori outbursts, as well as in those planet formation theories that require
the accumulation of solid material at the dead/active interface.

solutions behave as solutions of the corresponding parabolic equation, and in
particular they decay to 0 as t -> +infinity.
  In this paper we consider the nondegenerate and coercive case, and we prove
optimal decay estimates for the hyperbolic problem, and optimal decay-error

vacuum energy for a static device is larger compared to the energy of the

However, the harmonic oscillator also has negative eigenvalues $E_n=-2n-1$

analytically from these eigenvalues. It is shown in this paper that for
appropriate PT-symmetric boundary conditions the Hamiltonian
$H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\epsilon$ also has real and {\it negative} discrete eigenvalues.
The negative eigenvalues fall into classes labeled by the integer N (N=1, 2, 3,

$(4N-6)/3<\epsilon<4N-2$. At the low and high ends of this range, the
eigenvalues are all infinite. At the special intermediate value $\epsilon=2N-2$
the eigenvalues are the negatives of those of the conventional Hermitian

infinitely many complex eigenvalues. Thus, while the positive-spectrum sector
of the Hamiltonian $H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\epsilon$ has an unbroken PT symmetry (the
eigenvalues are all real), the negative-spectrum sector of
$H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\epsilon$ has a broken PT symmetry (only some of the eigenvalues

redshift z=0.57 and redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7. Assuming a concordance
Lambda-CDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2
Gpc^3, and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this
density, n = 3 x 10^-4 h^-3 Mpc^3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy
correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction
of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are
detected at a significance of 5\sigma in both the correlation function and
power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II Luminous Red Galaxy Sample, the
detection significance increases to 6.7\sigma. Fitting for the position of the
acoustic features measures the distance to z=0.57 relative to the sound horizon
DV /rs = 13.67 +/- 0.22 at z=0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19
Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to
a distance DV(z=0.57) = 2094 +/- 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most
precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this
result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder
and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use
these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding
continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.

transformation from the usual Langevin equation to a form that contains a

underlying symplectic structure. The framework has a direct physical meaning

to compute covariance matrices of large-scale clustering measurements and test
the methods of analysis. Our method populates a 2nd-order Lagrangian
Perturbation Theory (2LPT) matter field, where we calibrate masses of dark
matter halos by detailed comparisons with N-body simulations. We demonstrate
the clustering of halos is recovered at ~10 per cent accuracy. We populate
halos with mock galaxies using a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)
prescription, which has been calibrated to reproduce the clustering
measurements on scales between 30 and 80 Mpc/h. We compare the sample
covariance matrix from our mocks with analytic estimates, and discuss
differences. We have used this method to make catalogues corresponding to Data
Release 9 of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS),producing 600
mock catalogues of the ""CMASS"" galaxy sample. These mocks enabled detailed
tests of methods and errors that formed an integral part of companion analyses

All sellers are
a-priori identical and strategically signal buyers about the product they sell.
In a setting motivated by on-line advertising in display ad exchanges, where
firms use second price auctions, a firm's strategy is a decision about its
signaling scheme for a stream of goods (e.g. user impressions), and a buyer's
strategy is a selection among the firms. In this setting, a single seller will
typically provide partial information and consequently a product may be
allocated inefficiently. Intuitively, competition among sellers may induce
sellers to provide more information in order to attract buyers and thus
increase efficiency. Surprisingly, we show that such a competition among firms
may yield significant loss in consumers' social welfare with respect to the
monopolistic setting. Although we also show that in some cases the competitive
setting yields gain in social welfare, we provide a tight bound on that gain,
which is shown to be small in respect to the above possible loss.
  Our model is tightly connected with the literature on bundling in auctions.

ongoing disruption of the Sagittarius dwarf satellite to study the effect of
Sagittarius tidal debris on dark matter detection experiments. In agreement
with significant previous work, we reiterate that the standard halo model is
insufficient to describe the non-Maxwellian velocity distribution of the Milky
Way halo in our equilibrium halo-only and halo/galaxy models, and offer
suggestions for correcting for this discrepancy. More importantly, we emphasize
that the dark matter component of the leading tidal arm of the Sagittarius
dwarf is significantly more extended than the stellar component of the arm,
since the dark matter and stellar streams are not necessarily coaxial and may
be offset by several kpc at the point at which they impact the Galactic disk.
This suggests that the dark matter component of the Sagittarius debris is
likely to have a non-negligible influence on dark matter detection experiments
even when the stellar debris is centered several kpc from the solar
neighborhood. Relative to models without an infalling Sagittarius dwarf, the
Sagittarius dark matter debris in our models induces an energy-dependent
enhancement of direct search event rates of as much as ~20 - 45%, an
energy-dependent reduction in the amplitude of the annual modulation of the
event rate by as much as a factor of two, a shift in the phase of the annual
modulation by as much as ~20 days, and a shift in the recoil energy at which
the modulation reverses phase. These influences of Sagittarius are of general
interest in the interpretation of dark matter searches, but may be particularly
important in the case of relatively light (m_X < 20 GeV) dark matter because
the Sagittarius stream impacts the solar system at high speed compared to the
primary halo dark matter.

solitons such as center vortices, yielding confinement and chiral symmetry
breaking. The third is entanglement entropy, which is entropy associated with a
pure state, such as the QCD vacuum, when the state is partially unobserved and
unknown. Typically, entanglement entropy of an unobserved three-volume scales
not with the volume but with the area of its bounding surface. The fourth
manifestation of entropy in QCD is the configurational entropy of
light-particle world-lines and flux tubes; we argue that this entropy is
critical for understanding how confinement produces chiral symmetry breakdown,
as manifested by a dynamically-massive quark, a massless pion, and a $<

We propose a geometric construction of H. We argue that H should contain the
set C of causal curves with both endpoints on b. Yet H should not reach so far
from the boundary that the CFT has insufficient degrees of freedom to describe
it. This can be guaranteed by constructing a superset of H from light-sheets
off boundary slices and invoking the covariant entropy bound in the bulk. The
simplest covariant choice is L, the intersection of L^+ and L^-, where L^+
(L^-) is the union of all future-directed (past-directed) light-sheets. We
prove that C=L, so the holographic domain is completely determined by our
assumptions: H=C=L. In situations where local bulk operators can be constructed
on b, H is closely related to the set of bulk points where this construction
remains unambiguous under modifications of the CFT Hamiltonian outside of b.
Our construction leads to a covariant geometric RG flow. We comment on the
description of black hole interiors and cosmological regions via AdS/CFT.

for fixed charges there exist three possible black hole configurations
according to the pattern of symmetry breaking of the (scalars sector of the)
Lagrangian. Namely a black hole without scalar fields, a black hole with a
primary hair and a black hole with a secondary hair respectively. This is the
first, exact, example of a black hole with a primary scalar hair, where both
the black hole and the scalar fields are regular on and outside the horizon.
The configurations with secondary and primary hair can be interpreted as a
spontaneous symmetry breaking of discrete permutation and reflection symmetries
of the action. It is shown that there exist a triple point in the thermodynamic
phase space where the three solution coexist. The corresponding phase
transitions are discussed and the free energies are written explicitly as
function of the thermodynamic coordinates in the uncharged case. In the charged
case the free energies of the primary hair and the hairless black hole are also

of bits transmitted over an infinite time horizon. This is achieved by choosing
among three possible strategies: (1) betting on channel 1 by allocating all the
power to this channel, which results in high data rate if channel 1 happens to
be in good state, and zero bits transmitted if channel 1 is in bad state (even
if channel 2 is in good state) (2) betting on channel 2 by allocating all the

is allocated half the total power, with the effect that each channel can
transmit a low data rate if it is in good state. We assume that each channel's
state is only revealed upon transmission of data on that channel. We model this

key threshold properties of the optimal policy. Further, we show that by

processes can clearly influence each other, and chemotaxis can play an
important role in sustaining and speeding up the reaction. In continuation of
our earlier work, we consider a model with a single density function involving
diffusion, advection, chemotaxis, and absorbing reaction. The model is
motivated, in particular, by the studies of coral broadcast spawning, where
experimental observations of the efficiency of fertilization rates
significantly exceed the data obtained from numerical models that do not take
chemotaxis (attraction of sperm gametes by a chemical secreted by egg gametes)
into account. We consider the case of the weakly coupled quadratic reaction
term, which is the most natural from the biological point of view and was left
open. The result is that similarly to higher power coupling, the chemotaxis
plays a crucial role in ensuring efficiency of reaction. However,
mathematically, the picture is quite different in the quadratic reaction case
and is more subtle. The reaction is now complete even in the absence of
chemotaxis, but the timescales are very different. Without chemotaxis, the
reaction is very slow, especially for the weak reaction coupling coefficient.
With chemotaxis, the timescale and efficiency of reaction are independent of
the coupling parameter.

factor A(\phi,X), where X is the canonical kinetic term for \phi. The
associated phenomenology is investigated and we show that such theories have a
new generic mass-altering mechanism, potentially assisting the generation of a
sufficiently large chameleon mass in dense environments. The most general
effective potential is derived for such derivative chameleon setups and
explicit examples are given. Interestingly this points us to the existence of a
purely derivative chameleon protected by a shift symmetry for \phi. We also
discuss potential ghost-like instabilities associated with mass-lifting
mechanisms and find another, mass-lowering and instability-free, branch of
solutions. This suggests that, barring fine-tuning, stable derivative models
are in fact typically anti-chameleons that suppress the field's mass in dense

and can modify our expectations for hidden sector phenomenology and detection.
In this work we extend a minimal model of secluded dark matter, comprised of a
U(1)'-charged dark matter candidate, to include a confining hidden-sector CFT.
This provides a technically natural explanation for the hierarchically small
mediator-scale, with hidden-sector confinement generating m_{gamma'}>0.
Furthermore, the thermal history of the universe can differ markedly from the
WIMP picture due to (i) new annihilation channels, (ii) a (potentially) large
number of hidden-sector degrees of freedom, and (iii) a hidden-sector phase
transition at temperatures T << M_{dm} after freeze out. The mediator allows
both the dark matter and the Standard Model to communicate with the CFT, thus

emphasis on infrared factors, is important to understand the consistency of the
inflationary theory, its predictivity and to establish the existence of the
slow-roll eternal inflation phenomena and its recently found volume bound. In
this paper we prove that the zeta correlation function is time-independent at
one-loop level in single clock inflation. While many of the one-loop diagrams
lead to a time-dependence when considered individually, the time-dependence
beautifully cancels out in the overall sum. We identify two subsets of diagrams
that cancel separately due to different physical reasons. The first
cancellation is related to the change of the background cosmology due to the
renormalization of the stress tensor. It results in a cancellation between the
non-1PI diagrams and some of the diagrams made with quartic vertices. The
second subset of diagrams that cancel is made up of cubic operators, plus the
remaining quartic ones. We are able to write the sum of these diagrams as the
integral over a specific three-point function between two very short
wavelengths and one very long one. We then apply the consistency condition for
this three-point function in the squeezed limit to show that the sum of these
diagrams cannot give rise to a time dependence. This second cancellation is
thus a consequence of the fact that in single clock inflation the attractor
nature of the solution implies that a long wavelength zeta perturbation is
indistinguishable from a trivial rescaling of the background, and so results in
no physical effect on short wavelength modes.

for the null-hypothesis (i.e., for Gaussian maps with tau_nl = 0) and for maps
with a non-vanishing trispectrum (|tau_nl|>0). We find these PDFs to be highly
non-Gaussian in both cases. We also evaluate the variance with which the
trispectrum amplitude can be measured, <tau_nle^2>, as a function of its
underlying value, tau_nl. We find a strong dependence of this variance on
tau_nl. We also find that the variance does not, given the highly non-Gaussian
nature of the PDF, effectively characterize the distribution. Detailed
knowledge of these PDFs will therefore be imperative in order to properly
interpret the implications of any given trispectrum measurement. For example,
if a CMB experiment with a maximum multipole of lmax = 1500 (such as the Planck
satellite) measures tau_nle = 0 then at the 95% confidence our calculations
show that we can conclude tau_nl < 1005; assuming a Gaussian PDF but with the

rolling scalar is radiatively stable and couples to Standard Model matter with
weaker-than- Planckian strength. The model is embedded in an anisotropic type
IIB compactification with two exponentially large extra dimensions and
TeV-scale gravity. The bulk turns out to be nearly supersymmetric since the
scale of the gravitino mass is of the order of the observed value of the
cosmological constant. The quintessence field is a modulus parameterising the
size of an internal four-cycle which naturally develops a potential of the
order (gravitino mass)^4, leading to a small dark energy scale without tunings.
The mass of the quintessence field is also radiatively stable since it is
protected by supersymmetry in the bulk. Moreover, this light scalar couples to
ordinary matter via its mixing with the volume mode. Due to the fact that the
quintessence field is a flat direction at leading order, this mixing is very
small, resulting in a suppressed coupling to Standard Model particles which
avoids stringent fifth-force constraints. On the other hand, if dark matter is
realised in terms of Kaluza-Klein states, unsuppressed couplings between dark
energy and dark matter can emerge, leading to a scenario of coupled
quintessence within string theory. We study the dynamics of quintessence in our
set-up, showing that its main features make it compatible with observations.

fitted using a grid of theoretical models including detailed treatments of
physical processes accepted for higher mass stars, such as dust sublimation,
and a simple treatment of the accretion flux. This grid of models has been
designed to test the validity of the adopted physical mechanisms, but we have
also constructed models using parameterisation, for example semi-empirical dust
sublimation radii, for users solely interested in parameter derivation and the
quality of the fit. The parameters derived for the naked and disc brown dwarf
systems are largely consistent with literature observations. However, our inner
disc edge locations are consistently closer to the star than previous results
and we also derive elevated accretion rates over non-SED based accretion rate
derivations. For inner edge locations we attribute these differences to the
detailed modelling we have performed of the disc structure, particularly at the
crucial inner edge where departures in geometry from the often adopted vertical
wall due to dust sublimation (and therefore accretion flux) can compensate for
temperature (and therefore distance) changes to the inner edge of the dust
disc. In the case of the elevated derived accretion rates, in some cases, this

Gaussian and the normalization is the square root of the size of the system. In

galaxies. Despite their importance, key physical properties of outflows remain
poorly unconstrained; this severely limits study of the acceleration process.
It is especially difficult to constrain the column density since most of the
lines are saturated. However, column densities can be measured using ions that
are expected to be relatively rare in the gas, since they are least likely to
be saturated. Phosphorus, specifically the PV doublet at 1118 and 1128A, is
generally regarded as a useful probe of high column densities because of its
low abundance. We have found that the metastable neutral helium triplet is an
equally valuable probe of high column densities in BALQSOs. The significant
advantage is that it can be observed in the infrared (HeI*10830) and the
optical (HeI*3889) bands from the ground in low-redshift (z<1.2) objects.
  We report the discovery of the first HeI*10830 BALQSO FBQS J1151+3822, and
discuss constraints on the column density obtained from the optical and IR HeI*
lines. In addition, a new observation revealing MgII and FeII absorption
provides further constraints, and Cloudy modeling of HeI*, MgII, and FeII
suggests that the difference between LoBALs and FeLoBALs is column density
along the line of sight.

choices of estimators and importance sampling schemes are crucial to the

population-normalized estimator for the reduced density matrix, an efficient

nonadiabatic phonon probability density is obtained as a byproduct during the

Langevin algorithm. The analytic expression for the gradient of the target
probability density function associated with the population-normalized

better computational scaling and efficiency. Application to a simple
one-dimensional model system from the previous literature confirms the
correctness of the method developed in this manuscript. The displaced harmonic
model system within the single exciton manifold shows the numerically exact
temperature dependence of the coherence and population of the excitonic system.
The sampling scheme can be applied to an arbitrary anharmonic environment, such

timestep driven hard sphere method, and apply a mean-field theoretical approach
to connect the macroscopic flow with the microscopic material parameters of the
grains. We observe that the flow separates into a cone with an interior cone
angle determined by the conservation of momentum and the dissipation of energy.
From the cone angle we extract a dimensionless quantity $A-B$ that
characterizes the flow. We find that this quantity depends both on whether or
not a deadzone --- a stationary region near the target --- is present, and on
the value of the coefficient of dynamic friction. We present a theory for the
scaling of $A-B$ with the coefficient of friction that suggests that
dissipation is primarily a perturbative effect in this flow, rather than the
source of qualitatively different behavior.

the inverse of the number of quanta of action per one unit motion of an

unit motion. This lowest action state is the attractor for the continuous
self-organization and evolution of a dynamical complex system. Constraints
increase this average action and constraint minimization by the elements is a
basic mechanism for action minimization. Increase of quantity of elements in a

various warm gas phases. In a two-component approach, our large velocity

irrevocably when they arrive. Such problems are online problems. A common
method of solving online problems is to first solve the corresponding linear
program, and then round the fractional solution online to obtain an integral
solution.
  We give algorithms for solving linear programs with mixed packing and
covering constraints online. We first consider mixed packing and covering
linear programs, where packing constraints are given offline and covering
constraints are received online. The objective is to minimize the maximum
multiplicative factor by which any packing constraint is violated, while
satisfying the covering constraints. No prior sublinear competitive algorithms
are known for this problem. We give the first such --- a
polylogarithmic-competitive algorithm for solving mixed packing and covering
linear programs online. We also show a nearly tight lower bound.
  Our techniques for the upper bound use an exponential penalty function in
conjunction with multiplicative updates. While exponential penalty functions
are used previously to solve linear programs offline approximately, offline
algorithms know the constraints beforehand and can optimize greedily. In
contrast, when constraints arrive online, updates need to be more complex.
  We apply our techniques to solve two online fixed-charge problems with
congestion. These problems are motivated by applications in machine scheduling
and facility location. The linear program for these problems is more
complicated than mixed packing and covering, and presents unique challenges. We
show that our techniques combined with a randomized rounding procedure give
polylogarithmic-competitive integral solutions. These problems generalize
online set-cover, for which there is a polylogarithmic lower bound. Hence, our
results are close to tight.

various water interfaces and may unravel many puzzles, especially the nature
and the high stability of so-called nanobubbles at solid/water interfaces and
in bulk water. Based on the hydrophobic effect, we propose that gas molecules
dissolved in water may aggregate into clusters in bulk water as well as at

a transition into a gas bubble, which can explain formation or nucleation of

oxygenated - organic carbon burial, hydrogen escape to space, and changes in
the redox state of volcanic gases - are examined and a more biologically-based
hypothesis is offered in response. It is argued that organic carbon burial is
of minor importance to the accumulation of oxygen in a mainly anoxic world
where aerobic respiration is not globally significant. Thus, for the Great
Oxidation Event (GOE) ~ 2.4 Gyr ago, an increasing flux of O2 due to its
production by an expanding population of cyanobacteria is parameterized as the
primary source of O2. Various factors would have constrained cyanobacterial
proliferation and O2 production during most of the Archean and therefore a long
delay between the appearance of cyanobacteria and oxygenation of the atmosphere
is to be expected. Destruction of O2 via CH4 oxidation in the atmosphere was a
major O2 sink during the Archean, and the GOE is explained to a significant
extent by a large decline in the methanogen population and corresponding CH4
flux which, in turn, was caused primarily by partial oxygenation of the surface
ocean. The partially oxygenated state of these waters also made it possible for
an aerobic methanotroph population to become established. This further
contributed to the large reduction in the CH4 flux to the atmosphere by
increasing the consumption of CH4 diffusing upwards from the deeper anoxic
depths of the water column as well as any CH4 still being produced in the upper
layer. The reduction in the CH4 flux lowered the CH4 oxidation sink for O2 at
about the same time the metamorphic and volcanic gas sinks for O2 also
declined. As the O2 source increased from an expanding population of
cyanobacteria - triggered by a burst of continent formation ~ 2.7-2.4 Gyr ago -
the atmosphere flipped and became permanently oxygenated.

the principal curvatures, we use GHF's to get a lower bound on the index of $L$

like the \LambdaCDM model. In the asymptotic future, it reaches a stable
de-Sitter spacetime. It is a cosmologically viable model and can evade the
local gravity constraints easily. This model share many features with other
f(R) dark energy models like Hu-Sawicki model and Exponential gravity model. In
it the dark energy equation of state is of an oscillating form and can cross

For instance, when n=4, \lambda=1, the dark energy equation of state will cross
-1 in the earlier future and has a stronger oscillating form than the other

Lagrangians written within the hidden local symmetry which, in addition to

Kroll-Ruderman theorem by replacing the photon by the vector mesons. In
addition to the low-lying $\Lambda(1405)$, $\Lambda(1670)$ found in previous

$\Sigma(1750) S_{11}$, $\Sigma(1940) D_{13}$, $\Sigma(2000) S_{11}$ and predict
three $\Lambda^*$'s with $J^\pi = 3/2^-$ and masses: $1754 - i2$ MeV, $1862 -

turbulence and speed at various levels of solar activity between solar cycles

that (i) on the average, there was a downward trend in density turbulence from
the maximum of cycle 22 to the deep minimum phase of cycle 23; (2) the
scattering diameter of the corona around the Sun shrunk steadily towards the
Sun, starting from 2003 to the smallest size at the deepest minimum, and it
corresponded to a reduction of ~50% in density turbulence between maximum and
minimum phases of cycle 23; (3) The latitudinal distribution of solar wind
speed was significantly different between minima of cycles 22 and 23. At the
minimum phase of solar cycle 22, when the underlying solar magnetic field was
simple and nearly dipole in nature, the high-speed streams were observed from
poles to ~30 deg. latitudes in both hemispheres. In contrast, in the long-decay
phase of cycle 23, the sources of high-speed wind at both poles, in accordance
with the weak polar fields, occupied narrow latitude belts from poles to ~60
deg. latitudes. Moreover, in agreement with the large amplitude of heliospheric
current sheet, the low-speed wind prevailed the low- and mid-latitude regions
of the heliosphere. (4) At the transition phase between cycles 23 and 24, the
high levels of density and density turbulence were observed close to the
heliospheric equator and the low-speed speed wind extended from equatorial- to
mid-latitude regions. Results are consistent with the onset of the current
cycle 24, from middle of 2009 and it has almost reached near to the maximum
phase at the northern hemisphere of the Sun, but activity not yet developed in
the southern hemisphere.

yield-to-maturity is driven not only by the default probability and recovery
rate of the bond but also by other contractual characteristics of the bond that
are not commonly associated with default risk, such as the maturity and coupon
rate of the bond. In particular, for given default probability and recovery
rate, both the level and slope of the yield-to-maturity term structure depend
on the coupon rate, as the higher the coupon rate the higher the
yield-to-maturity term structure. In addition, the yield-to-maturity term
structure is upward or downward sloping depending on whether the coupon rate is
high or low enough. Similar qualitative results also holds for CDS spreads.
Consequently, the yield-to-maturity is an indicator that must be used
cautiously as a proxy for default risk.

observations show a very long plateau at around $y$ = 10.5 for more than 1000
days until April 2011 ($\sim$ 1500 days after the maximum light). The nova had
taken a very long time ($\sim$ 50 months) before entering the nebular phase
(clear detection of both [\ion{O}{iii}] 4959 and 5007) and is still continuing
to generate the wind caused by H-burning. The finding suggests that V1280 Sco
is going through the historically slowest evolution. The interval from the
maximum light (2007 February 16) to the beginning of the nebular phase is
longer than any previously known slow novae: V723 Cas (18 months), RR Pic (10
months), or HR Del (8 months). It suggests that the mass of a white dwarf in
the V1280 Sco system might be 0.6 $M_\mathrm{\sun}$ or smaller. The distance,
based on our measurements of the expansion velocity combined with the directly
measured size of the dust shell, is estimated to be 1.1 $\pm$ 0.5 kpc.

with the half-integer values $e^2/h$ can be obtained in the gap induced by

building and system dynamics for climate control design. The main problem
regarding the simulation of the dynamic response of a building using building
simulation software is that (1) the simulation of a large complex building is
time consuming, and (2) simulation results often lack information regarding
fast dynamic behaviour (in the order of seconds), since most software uses a
discrete time step, usually fixed to one hour. The first objective is to study
the applicability of system identification to reduce computing time for the
simulation of large complex buildings. The second objective is to research the
applicability of system identification to identify building dynamics based on
discrete time data (one hour) for climate control design. The study illustrates
that system identification is applicable for the identification of building
dynamics with a frequency that is smaller as the maximum sample frequency as
used for identification. The research shows that system identification offers
good perspectives for the modelling of heat, air and moisture processes in a
building. The main advantages of system identification models compared to the
modelling of building dynamics using building simulation software are, that (1)
the computing time is reduced significantly, and (2) system identification

result in reconstructions, often creating new functionalities at the interface.
However, for a significant number of materials these reconstructions are

Therefore, a strategy to eliminate this reconstruction of the polar

category rep(Q,W) of (finite-dimensional) representations of the Jacobian
algebra $\mathbb{C} Q/(\partial W)$ should enjoy what we call the Ringel
property of type G; in particular, rep(Q,W) should contain a universal
`generic' subcategory, which depends only on the gauge group G, capturing the
universality of the gauge sector. There is a family of 'light' subcategories
$\mathscr{L}_\lambda\subset rep(Q,W)$, indexed by points $\lambda\in N$, where
$N$ is a projective variety whose irreducible components are copies of
$\mathbb{P}^1$ in one--to--one correspondence with the simple factors of G.
  In particular, for a Gaiotto theory there is one such family of
subcategories, $\mathscr{L}_{\lambda\in N}$, for each maximal degeneration of
the corresponding surface $\Sigma$, and the index variety $N$ may be identified
with the degenerate Gaiotto surface itself: generic light subcategories
correspond to cylinders, while closed-point subcategories to `fixtures'
(spheres with three punctures of various kinds) and higher-order
generalizations. The rules for `gluing' categories are more general that the
geometric gluing of surfaces, allowing for a few additional exceptional N=2

mixture filter based on statistical linearization is proposed. Depending on the

increases the number of components via splitting. For this purpose, a measure
is introduced that allows for quantifying the locally induced linearization

the standing acoustic (i.e. longitudinal) modes generated in a hot coronal
loop. A theoretical model of 1D geometry describing the coronal loop is
applied. The background temperature is allowed to change as a function of time
and undergoes an exponential decay with characteristic cooling times typical
for coronal loops. The magnetic field is assumed to be uniform. Thermal
conduction is the dominant mechanism of cooling the hot background plasma in
the presence of an unspecified thermodynamic source that maintains the initial
equilibrium. The influence of the rapidly cooling background plasma on the
behaviour of standing acoustic (longitudinal) waves is investigated
analytically. The temporally evolving dispersion relation and wave amplitude
are derived by using the WKB theory. An analytic solution for the
time-dependent amplitude that describes the influence of thermal conduction on
the standing longitudinal (acoustic) wave is obtained by exploiting the
properties of Sturm-Liouville problems. Next, numerical evaluations further
illustrate the behaviour of the standing acoustic waves in a system with
variable, time dependent background. The results are applied to a number of
detected loop oscillations. We find a remarkable agreement between the
theoretical predictions and the observations. The cooling of the background
plasma due to thermal conduction is found to cause a strong damping for the
slow standing magneto-acoustic waves in hot coronal loops in general. Further
to this, the increase in the value of thermal conductivity leads to a strong
decay in the amplitude of the longitudinal standing slow MHD waves.

In the parent compound Ca10(FeAs)10(Pt3As8), no excess charge dopes the
FeAs-layer, and superconductivity has to be induced by Pt-substitution, albeit
below 15 K. In contrast, the additional Pt-atom in the Pt4As8layer shifts the
charge balance between the layers equivalent to charge doping by 0.2 electrons
per FeAs. Only in this case Tc raises to 38 K, but decreases again if
additionally platinum is substituted for iron. This charge doping scenario is
supported by our discovery of superconductivity at 30 K in the electron-doped
La-1038 compound (Ca0.8La0.2)10(FeAs)10(Pt3As8) without significant
Pt-substitution.

spherical alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticles in the size range of ~10-100nm were

By monitoring the SAXS intensity, it was further possible to record the

representing individual banks; associated with each node is a balance sheet
consisting of assets and liabilities. Initial node failures are triggered by
external correlated shocks applied to the asset sides of the balance sheets.
These defaults lead to further reductions in asset values of all nodes which in
turn produce additional failures, and so on. This mechanism induces indirect
interactions between the nodes and leads to a cascade of defaults. There are no
interbank links, and therefore no direct interactions, between the nodes. The
resulting probability distribution for the total (direct plus systemic) network

199260), HIP 107350 (HN Peg, HD206860), and HIP 114948 (HD 219482), obtained in
the context of our Herschel Open Time Key Program DUNES (DUst around NEarby
Stars). Methods. We used Herschel/PACS to detect the thermal emission of the
three debris disks with a 3 sigma sensitivity of a few mJy at 100 um and 160
um. In addition, we obtained Herschel/PACS photometric data at 70 um for HIP
103389. Two different approaches are applied to reduce the Herschel data to
investigate the impact of data reduction on the photometry. We fit analytical
models to the available spectral energy distribution (SED) data. Results. The
SEDs of the three disks potentially exhibit an unusually steep decrease at
wavelengths > 70 um. We investigate the significance of the peculiar shape of
these SEDs and the impact on models of the disks provided it is real. Our
modeling reveals that such a steep decrease of the SEDs in the long wavelength
regime is inconsistent with a power-law exponent of the grain size distribution
-3.5 expected from a standard equilibrium collisional cascade. In contrast, a
very distinct range of grain sizes is implied to dominate the thermal emission
of such disks. However, we demonstrate that the understanding of the data of
faint sources obtained with Herschel is still incomplete and that the
significance of our results depends on the version of the data reduction
pipeline used. Conclusions. A new mechanism to produce the dust in the
presented debris disks, deviations from the conditions required for a standard
equilibrium collisional cascade (grain size exponent of -3.5), and/or
significantly different dust properties would be necessary to explain the
potentially steep SED shape of the three debris disks presented. (abridged)

analysis. It is a sequence of simplicial complexes built on a metric space to
add topological structure to an otherwise disconnected set of points. It is
widely used because it encodes useful information about the topology of the
underlying metric space. This information is often extracted from its so-called
persistence diagram. Unfortunately, this filtration is often too large to
construct in full. We show how to construct an O(n)-size filtered simplicial
complex on an $n$-point metric space such that its persistence diagram is a
good approximation to that of the Vietoris-Rips filtration. This new filtration
can be constructed in $O(n\log n)$ time. The constant factors in both the size
and the running time depend only on the doubling dimension of the metric space
and the desired tightness of the approximation. For the first time, this makes
it computationally tractable to approximate the persistence diagram of the
Vietoris-Rips filtration across all scales for large data sets.
  We describe two different sparse filtrations. The first is a zigzag
filtration that removes points as the scale increases. The second is a
(non-zigzag) filtration that yields the same persistence diagram. Both methods
are based on a hierarchical net-tree and yield the same guarantees.

increasingly compelling due to the progressive penetration of distributed
energy resources in this specific layer of the electrical infrastructure.
Distribution systems are, indeed, experiencing significant changes in terms of
operation philosophies that are often based on optimal control strategies
relying on the computation of linearized dependencies between controlled (e.g.
voltages, frequency in case of islanding operation) and control variables (e.g.
power injections, transformers tap positions). As the implementation of these
strategies in real-time controllers imposes stringent time constraints, the
derivation of analytical dependency between controlled and control variables
becomes a non-trivial task to be solved. With reference to optimal voltage and
power flow controls, this paper aims at providing an analytical derivation of
node voltage and line current flows as a function of the nodal power injections
and transformers tap-changers positions. Compared to other approaches presented
in the literature, the one proposed here is based on the use of the [Y]
compound matrix of a generic multi-phase radial unbalanced network. In order to
estimate the computational benefits of the proposed approach, the relevant
improvements are also quantified versus traditional methods. The validation of
the proposed method is carried out by using both IEEE 13 and 34 node test
feeders. The paper finally shows the use of the proposed method for the problem
of optimal voltage control applied to the IEEE 34 node test feeder.

discovered the [Ca II] {\lambda}{\lambda}7291, 7324 lines that can be used as a

high-density regions, located closer to the star than the [O I] {\lambda}5577

clouds where stars and planets are forming. The low temperatures and high

to large abundances of H2D+ and D2H+ which are very useful probes of the early
stages of star and planet formation. Maps of H2D+ and D2H+ pure rotational line
emission toward star-forming regions show that the strong deuteration of H3+ is
the result of near-complete molecular depletion of CNO-bearing molecules onto
grain surfaces, which quickly disappears as cores warm up after stars have
formed.
  In the warmer parts of interstellar gas clouds, H3+ transfers its proton to
other neutrals such as CO and N2, leading to a rich ionic chemistry. The
abundances of such species are useful tracers of physical conditions such as
the radiation field and the electron fraction. Recent observations of HF line
emission toward the Orion Bar imply a high electron fraction, and we suggest
that observations of OH+ and H2O+ emission may be used to probe the electron

Recent literature has cast doubts on the reliability of most of these
detections. We revisit data previously published in the literature, and we
present new observations to clarify the question of how common magnetic fields
are in subdwarf stars. We consider a sample of about 40 hot subdwarf stars.
About 30 of them have been observed with the FORS1 and FORS2 instruments of the
ESO VLT. Here we present new FORS1 field measurements for 17 stars, 14 of which
have never been observed for magnetic fields before. We also critically review
the measurements already published in the literature, and in particular we try
to explain why previous papers based on the same FORS1 data have reported
contradictory results. All new and re-reduced measurements obtained with FORS1
are shown to be consistent with non-detection of magnetic fields. We explain
previous spurious field detections from data obtained with FORS1 as due to a
non-optimal method of wavelength calibration. Field detections in other surveys
are found to be uncertain or doubtful, and certainly in need of confirmation.
There is presently no strong evidence for the occurrence of a magnetic field in
any sdB or sdO star, with typical longitudinal field uncertainties of the order
of 2-400 G. It appears that globally simple fields of more than about 1 or 2 kG
in strength occur in at most a few percent of hot subdwarfs, and may be

excess and significant far-IR excess, implying inner opacity holes in their
disks. Here we present a multifrequency study of transition disk candidates
located in Lupus I, III, IV, V, VI, Corona Australis, and Scorpius.
Complementing the information provided by Spitzer with adaptive optics (AO)
imaging (NaCo, VLT), submillimeter photometry (APEX), and echelle spectroscopy
(Magellan, Du Pont Telescopes), we estimate the multiplicity, disk mass, and
accretion rate for each object in our sample in order to identify the mechanism
potentially responsible for its inner hole. We find that our transition disks
show a rich diversity in their spectral energy distribution morphology, have
disk masses ranging from lsim1 to 10 M JUP, and accretion rates ranging from
lsim10-11 to 10-7.7 M \odot yr-1. Of the 17 bona fide transition disks in our
sample, three, nine, three, and two objects are consistent with giant planet
formation, grain growth, photoevaporation, and debris disks, respectively. Two
disks could be circumbinary, which offers tidal truncation as an alternative
origin of the inner hole. We find the same heterogeneity of the transition disk
population in Lupus III, IV, and Corona Australis as in our previous analysis
of transition disks in Ophiuchus while all transition disk candidates selected
in Lupus V, VI turned out to be contaminating background asymptotic giant
branch stars. All transition disks classified as photoevaporating disks have
small disk masses, which indicates that photoevaporation must be less efficient
than predicted by most recent models. The three systems that are excellent
candidates for harboring giant planets potentially represent invaluable
laboratories to study planet formation with the Atacama Large

kernel made up of a ""cool kernel"", which is fully regular (and contains the
long-range -GM/r asymptotic behavior), and the gradient of a ""hyperkernel"",

matter-nucleon interactions, excluding dark matter candidates with masses down
to 6 GeV if the corresponding cross section is larger than 10^{-39} cm^2. The
dependence of the exclusion limit in terms of the scintillation efficiency
(Leff) has been debated at length. To overcome possible criticisms XENON100
performed an analysis in which Leff was considered as a nuisance parameter and
its uncertainties were profiled out by using a Gaussian likelihood in which the
mean value corresponds to the best fit Leff value smoothly extrapolated to zero
below 3 keVnr. Although such a method seems fairly robust, it does not account
for more extreme types of extrapolation nor does it enable to anticipate on how
much the exclusion limit would vary if new data were to support a flat
behaviour for Leff below 3 keVnr, for example. Yet, such a question is crucial
for light dark matter models which are close to the published XENON100 limit.
To answer this issue, we use a maximum Likelihood ratio analysis, as done by
the XENON100 collaboration, but do not consider Leff as a nuisance parameter.
Instead, Leff is obtained directly from the fits to the data. This enables us
to define frequentist confidence intervals by marginalising over Leff.

hcp 4He since their discovery is discussed. Special attention is given to
evidence for the vortex state as the vortex fluid (VF) state and its transition
into the supersolid (SS) state. Its features are described. The historical
expla- nations for the SS state in quantum solids such as solid 4He were based
on the idea of Bose Einstein Condensation (BEC) of the imperfections such as
va- cancies, interstitials and other possible excitations in the quantum solids
which are expected because of the large zero-point motions. The SS state was
proposed as a new state of matter in which real space ordering of the lattice
structure of the solid coexists with the momentum space ordering of
superfluidity. A new type of superconductors, since the discovery of the
cuprate high Tc superconductors, HTSCs, has been shown to share a feature with
the vortex state, involving the VF and vortex solid states. The high Tcs of
these materials are being discussed in connection to the large fluctuations
associated with some other phase transitions like the antiferromagnetic
transition in addition to that of the low dimensionality. The supersolidity in
the hcp solid 4He, in contrast to the new superconductors which have multiple
degrees of freedom of the Cooper pairs with spin as well as angular momentum
freedom, has a unique feature of possessing possibly only the momentum
fluctuations and vortex ring excitations associated with the possible low
dimensional fluctuations of the subsystem(s). The high onset temperature of the
VF state can be understood by considering thermally excited low D quantized
vortices and it may be necessary to seek low dimensional sub-systems in hcp He
which are hosts for vortices.

for effects of point spread function smearing, spurious image distortions, and

evidence for redshift evolution, while the ellipticity dispersion for late-type
galaxies scales strongly with absolute magnitude at the bright end. The

Chiral Effective Field Theory (ChiEFT) describes nucleon, deuteron and 3-He

neutron amplitude from Compton scattering on light nuclei. We summarise past

first principles Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are
becoming increasingly popular for the study of a wide range of problems in
materials science, chemistry and biology. Nevertheless, the computational cost
still remains prohibitively large in many cases, particularly in comparison to
classical MD simulations using empirical force fields. Here we show how to
circumvent the major computational bottleneck in Born-Oppenheimer MD
simulations arising from the self-consistent-charge optimization. The
optimization-free quantum mechanical MD method is demonstrated for density
functional tight-binding theory. The molecular trajectories are almost
indistinguishable from an ""exact"" microcanonical Born-Oppenheimer MD simulation
even when linear scaling sparse matrix algebra is used. Our findings
drastically reduce the computational gap between classical and quantum
mechanical MD simulations.

band taken as an independent system. For sufficiently small interband coupling
$\gamma$ the coherence length of the weaker band exhibits a remarkable
deviation from the conventional monotonic increase with temperature, namely, a
pronounced peak close to the hidden critical point. The magnitude of the peak
scales proportionally to \gamma^(-\mu), with the Landau critical exponent \mu =
1/3, the same as found for the mean-field critical behavior with respect to the
source field in ferromagnets and ferroelectrics. Here reported hidden
criticality of multi-band superconductors can be experimentally observed by,
e.g., imaging of the variations of the vortex core in a broader temperature
range. Similar effects are expected for the superconducting multilayers.

supersymmetry-breaking, and a U(1) symmetry which solves the tachyonic slepton
problem, and introduces both the see-saw mechanism for neutrino masses, and the
Higgs mu-term. We compare its spectra with those from so-called minimal anomaly
mediated supersymmetry breaking. We find a Standard Model-like Higgs of mass
125 GeV with a gravitino mass of 140 TeV and tan(beta)=16. However, the muon
anomalous magnetic moment is 3 sigma away from the experimental value.
  The model naturally produces a period of hybrid inflation, which can exit to
a false vacuum characterised by large Higgs vevs, reaching the true ground
state after a period of thermal inflation. The scalar spectral index is reduced
to approximately 0.975, and the correct abundance of neutralino dark matter can
be produced by decays of thermally-produced gravitinos, provided the gravitino
mass (and hence the Higgs mass) is high. Naturally light cosmic strings are
produced, satisfying bounds from the Cosmic Microwave Background. The
complementary pulsar timing and cosmic ray bounds require that strings decay
primarily via loops into gravitational waves. Unless the loops are extremely
small, the next generation pulsar timing array will rule out or detect the
string-derived gravitational radiation background in this model.

predicts an initial mass function (IMF) dominated by high-mass stars, in
contrast to the present-day IMF, which tends to yield mostly stars with masses
less than 1 M_Sol. The leading theory for the transition in the characteristic
stellar mass predicts that the cause is the extra cooling provided by
increasing metallicity. In particular, dust can overtake H_2 as the leading
coolant at very high densities. The aim of this work is to determine the
influence of dust cooling on the fragmentation of very low metallicity gas. To
investigate this, we make use of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations with
sink particles to replace contracting protostars, and analyze the collapse and
further fragmentation of star-forming clouds. We follow the thermodynamic
response of the gas by solving the full thermal energy equation, and also track
the behavior of the dust temperature and the chemical evolution of the gas. We
model four clouds with different metallicities (10^{-4}, 10^{-5}, 10^{-6}
Z_Sol, and 0), and determine the properties of each cloud at the point at which
it undergoes gravitational fragmentation. We find evidence for fragmentation in
all four cases, and hence conclude that there is no critical metallicity below
which fragmentation is impossible. Nevertheless, there is a clear change in the
behavior of the clouds at Z = 10^{-5} Z_Sol, caused by the fact that at this
metallicity, fragmentation takes longer to occur than accretion, leading to a
flat mass function at lower metallicities.

the macroscopic VCR theory of Tamm-Frank and quantum VCR theory of Ginzburg, we
establish the new VCR parametric resonance mechanism and the new threshold of
VCR effect, which is better corresponding to the VCR observations. We show that
counting of the, known from Abraham's electrodynamics, force density
F_A=0.5rot[PE] (P is the polarization vector of the medium in locally
non-equilibrium anisotropic state, arising due to the non-stationary electric
field E of particle, moving with the constant speed v) defines the possibility
of parametric resonance excitation of the transversal to E polarization waves

where c is the light speed in vacuum, (n_*)>n>1, and n_* is the refraction

the decidability of PCTL satisfiability, as well as its finite model property,

challenge from a purely theoretical point of view, we argue that general
solutions would not be of interest to practitioners: such solutions could be
too big to be implementable or even infinite. Inspired by bounded synthesis
techniques, we turn to the more applied problem of seeking models of a bounded
size: we restrict our search to implementable -- and therefore reasonably
simple -- models. We propose a procedure to decide whether or not a given PCTL
formula has an implementable model by reducing it to an SMT problem. We have
implemented our techniques and found that they can be applied to the practical
problem of sanity checking -- a procedure that allows a system designer to
check whether their formula has an unexpectedly small model.

similarities to the well-studied pathway in Escherichia coli. It exhibits
robust adaptation and has several homologues of the latter's chemotaxis
proteins. Recent theoretical results have been able to correctly predict that
the chemotactic response of Escherichia coli exhibits the same output behavior
in response to scaled ligand inputs, a dynamic property known as fold-change
detection (FCD), or input-scale invariance. In this paper, we present
theoretical assumptions on the R. sphaeroides chemotaxis sensing dynamics that
can be analytically shown to yield FCD behavior in a specific ligand
concentration range. Based on these assumptions, we construct two models of the
full chemotaxis pathway that are able to reproduce experimental time-series
data from earlier studies. To test the validity of our assumptions, we propose
a series of experiments in which our models predict robust FCD behavior where
earlier models do not. In this way, we illustrate how a dynamic phenotype such
as FCD can be used for the purposes of discriminating between two models that
reproduce the same experimental time-series data.
