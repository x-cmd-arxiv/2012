[NWX11] studied various voting systems empirically and showed that they can
often be manipulated effectively, despite their manipulation problems being
NP-hard. Such an experimental approach is sorely missing for NP-hard control
problems, where control refers to attempts to tamper with the outcome of
elections by adding/deleting/partitioning either voters or candidates. We
experimentally tackle NP-hard control problems for Bucklin and fallback voting.
Among natural voting systems with efficient winner determination, fallback
voting is currently known to display the broadest resistance to control in
terms of NP-hardness, and Bucklin voting has been shown to behave almost as
well in terms of control resistance [ER10, EPR11, EFPR11]. We also investigate
control resistance experimentally for plurality voting, one of the first voting
systems analyzed with respect to electoral control [BTT92, HHR07]. Our findings
indicate that NP-hard control problems can often be solved effectively in
practice. Moreover, our experiments allow a more fine-grained analysis and
comparison-across various control scenarios, vote distribution models, and
voting systems-than merely stating NP-hardness for all these control problems.

the Cantor primes > 3 are exactly the prime-valued cyclotomic polynomials of

the infinitude of these, making Cantor primes perhaps more interesting than

propagating in an elastic solid with microstructures subject to antiplane
loading applied on the crack surfaces. The loading is moving with the same
constant velocity as that of the crack tip. We assume subsonic regime, that is
the crack velocity is smaller than the shear wave velocity. The material
behaviour is described by the indeterminate theory of couple stress elasticity
developed by Koiter. This constitutive model includes the characteristic
lengths in bending and torsion and thus it is able to account for the
underlying microstructure of the material as well as for the strong size
effects arising at small scales and observed when the representative scale of
the deformation field becomes comparable with the length scale of the
microstructure, such as the grain size in a polycrystalline or granular
aggregate.
  The present analysis confirms and extends earlier results on the static case
by including the effects of crack velocity and rotational inertia. By adopting
the criterion of maximum total shear stress, we discuss the effects of
microstructural parameters on the stability of crack propagation.

crossroads between mechanics, optics and electronics, with significant
potential for actuation and sensing applications. The reduction of dimensions
compared to their micronic counterparts brings new effects including
sensitivity to very low mass, resonant frequencies in the radiofrequency range,
mechanical non-linearities and observation of quantum mechanical effects. An
important issue of NEMS is the understanding of fundamental physical properties
conditioning dissipation mechanisms, known to limit mechanical quality factors
and to induce aging due to material degradation. There is a need for detection
methods tailored for these systems which allow probing motion and stress at the
nanometer scale. Here, we show a non-invasive local optical probe for the
quantitative measurement of motion and stress within a multilayer graphene NEMS
provided by a combination of Fizeau interferences, Raman spectroscopy and
electrostatically actuated mirror. Interferometry provides a calibrated
measurement of the motion, resulting from an actuation ranging from a
quasi-static load up to the mechanical resonance while Raman spectroscopy
allows a purely spectral detection of mechanical resonance at the nanoscale.
Such spectroscopic detection reveals the coupling between a strained
nano-resonator and the energy of an inelastically scattered photon, and thus
offers a new approach for optomechanics.

Web applications to Cloud services and integrating Cloud services into existing

require innovation of paradigms and practices at all levels: technical,
cultural, legal, regulatory, and social. The key problem in mapping Web
applications to virtualized Cloud services is selecting the best and compatible
mix of software images (e.g., Web server image) and infrastructure services to
ensure that Quality of Service (QoS) targets of an application are achieved.
The fact that, when selecting Cloud services, engineers must consider
heterogeneous sets of criteria and complex dependencies between infrastructure
services and software images, which are impossible to resolve manually, is a
critical issue. To overcome these challenges, we present a framework (called
CloudGenius) which automates the decision-making process based on a model and
factors specifically for Web server migration to the Cloud. CloudGenius
leverages a well known multi-criteria decision making technique, called
Analytic Hierarchy Process, to automate the selection process based on a model,

demonstrates the applicability of the theoretical CloudGenius approach.

processes are studied. These processes take values in the non-negative quadrant

rates of jumps towards the axes (jump down) depend on the position of the
process -- the higher the position, the greater the rate. The rates of jumps
going in the same direction as the axes (jump up) are constants. Therefore the
processes are ergodic. The large deviations are studied under equal scalings of
both space and time. The scaled versions of the processes converge to 0. The
main result is that the probabilities of long excursions out of 0 tend to 0
exponentially fast with an exponent proportional to the square of the scaling

This conjecture has been used in the literature in several occasions, and

remarkable satisfied for several classes of minimal surfaces but we find
counterexamples corresponding to more complicated geometries. We develop some

single-hop wireless network. To meet the hard deadlines of real-time traffic,
it is critical to strike a balance between maximizing the throughput and
minimizing the risk that the entire block of coded packets may not be decodable
by the deadline. Thus motivated, we explore adaptive NC, where the block size
is adapted based on the remaining time to the deadline, by casting this
sequential block size adaptation problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision
process. One interesting finding is that the optimal block size and its
corresponding action space monotonically decrease as the deadline approaches,
and the optimal block size is bounded by the ""greedy"" block size. These unique
structures make it possible to narrow down the search space of dynamic
programming, building on which we develop a monotonicity-based backward
induction algorithm (MBIA) that can solve for the optimal block size in
polynomial time. Since channel erasure probabilities would be time-varying in a
mobile network, we further develop a joint real-time scheduling and channel
learning scheme with adaptive NC that can adapt to channel dynamics. We also
generalize the analysis to multiple flows with hard deadlines and long-term
delivery ratio constraints, devise a low-complexity online scheduling algorithm
integrated with the MBIA, and then establish its asymptotical
throughput-optimality. In addition to analysis and simulation results, we
perform high fidelity wireless emulation tests with real radio transmissions to

events because of the high efficiency of planet detection. However, central
perturbations of high-magnification events caused by a planet can also be
produced by a very close or a very wide binary companion, and the two kinds of
central perturbations are not generally distinguished without time consuming
detailed modeling (a planet-binary degeneracy). Hence, it is important to
resolve the planet-binary degeneracy that occurs in high-magnification events.
In this paper, we investigate caustic-crossing high-magnification events caused
by a planet and a wide binary companion. From this study, we find that because
of the different magnification excess patterns inside the central caustics
induced by the planet and the binary companion, the light curves of the
caustic-crossing planetary-lensing events exhibit a feature that is
discriminated from those of the caustic-crossing binary-lensing events, and the
feature can be used to immediately distinguish between the planetary and binary
companions. The planetary-lensing feature appears in the interpeak region
between the two peaks of the caustic-crossings. The structure of the interpeak
region for the planetary-lensing events is smooth and convex or boxy, whereas
the structure for the binary-lensing events is smooth and concave. We also
investigate the effect of a finite background source star on the
planetary-lensing feature in the caustic-crossing high-magnification events.
From this, we find that the convex-shaped interpeak structure appears in a
certain range that changes with the mass ratio of the planet to the
planet-hosting star.

atmospheric compositions and surface or cloud-top pressures from transmission
spectra of exoplanets with general compositions. In this study, we identify
what can unambiguously be determined about the atmospheres of exoplanets from
their transmission spectra by applying the retrieval method to synthetic
observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b. Our approach to infer constraints on
atmospheric parameters is to compute their joint and marginal posterior
probability distributions using the MCMC technique in a parallel tempering
scheme. A new atmospheric parameterization is introduced that is applicable to
general atmospheres in which the main constituent is not known a priori and
clouds may be present. Our main finding is that a unique constraint of the
mixing ratios of the absorbers and up to two spectrally inactive gases (such as
N2 and primordial H2+He) is possible if the observations are sufficient to
quantify both (1) the broadband transit depths in at least one absorption
feature for each absorber and (2) the slope and strength of the molecular
Rayleigh scattering signature. The surface or cloud-top pressure can be
quantified if a surface or cloud deck is present. The mean molecular mass can
be constrained from the Rayleigh slope or the shapes of absorption features,
thus enabling to distinguish between cloudy hydrogen-rich atmospheres and high
mean molecular mass atmospheres. We conclude, however, that without the
signature of Rayleigh scattering--even with robustly detected infrared
absorption features--there is no reliable way to tell if the absorber is the
main constituent of the atmosphere or just a minor species with a mixing ratio
of <0.1%. The retrieval method leads us to a conceptual picture of which
details in transmission spectra are essential for unique characterizations of
well-mixed atmospheres.

(PRM) have been proposed as models for many different physical systems, where
they are viewed as a refinement of a corresponding noiseless partial
differential equations (PDE). A systematic framework for the study of
probabilities of deviations of the stochastic PDE from the deterministic PDE is
through the theory of large deviations. The goal of this work is to develop the
large deviation theory for small Poisson noise perturbations of a general class
of deterministic infinite dimensional models. Although the analogous questions
for finite dimensional systems have been well studied, there are currently no
general results in the infinite dimensional setting. This is in part due to the
fact that in this setting solutions may have little spatial regularity, and
thus classical approximation methods for large deviation analysis become
intractable. The approach taken here, which is based on a variational
representation for nonnegative functionals of general PRM, reduces the proof of
the large deviation principle to establishing basic qualitative properties for
controlled analogues of the underlying stochastic system. As an illustration of
the general theory, we consider a particular system that models the spread of a
pollutant in a waterway.

  theory. To appear in Comm. Pure Appl. Math",,,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The soliton resolution conjecture for the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger
equation (NLS) is the vaguely worded claim that a global solution of the NLS,
for generic initial data, will eventually resolve into a radiation component
that disperses like a linear solution, plus a localized component that behaves
like a soliton or multi-soliton solution. Considered to be one of the
fundamental open problems in the area of nonlinear dispersive equations, this
conjecture has eluded a proof or even a precise formulation till date. This
paper proves a ""statistical version"" of this conjecture at mass-subcritical
nonlinearity, in the following sense. The uniform probability distribution on
the set of all functions with a given mass and energy, if such a thing existed,
would be a natural invariant measure for the NLS flow and would reflect the
long-term behavior for ""generic initial data"" with that mass and energy.
Unfortunately, such a probability measure does not exist. We circumvent this
problem by constructing a sequence of discrete measures that, in principle,
approximate this fictitious probability distribution as the grid size goes to
zero. We then show that a continuum limit of this sequence of probability
measures does exist in a certain sense, and in agreement with the soliton
resolution conjecture, the limit measure concentrates on the unique ground
state soliton. Combining this with results from ergodic theory, we present a
tentative formulation and proof of the soliton resolution conjecture in the
discrete setting.

N-body simulations named ""Phantom-GRAPE"" which highly accelerates force
calculations among particles by use of a new SIMD instruction set extension to
the x86 architecture, AVX, an enhanced version of SSE. In our library, not only
the Newton's forces, but also central forces with an arbitrary shape f(r),
which has a finite cutoff radius r_cut (i.e. f(r)=0 at r>r_cut), can be quickly
computed. Using an Intel Core i7--2600 processor, we measure the performance of
our library for both the forces. In the case of Newton's forces, we achieve 2 x
10^9 interactions per second with 1 processor core, which is 20 times higher
than the performance of an implementation without any explicit use of SIMD
instructions, and 2 times than that with the SSE instructions. With 4 processor
cores, we obtain the performance of 8 x 10^9 interactions per second. In the
case of the arbitrarily shaped forces, we can calculate 1 x 10^9 and 4 x 10^9
interactions per second with 1 and 4 processor cores, respectively. The
performance with 1 processor core is 6 times and 2 times higher than those of
the implementations without any use of SIMD instructions and with the SSE
instructions. These performances depend weakly on the number of particles. It
is good contrast with the fact that the performance of force calculations
accelerated by GPUs depends strongly on the number of particles. Substantially
weak dependence of the performance on the number of particles is suitable to
collisionless N-body simulations, since these simulations are usually performed
with sophisticated N-body solvers such as Tree- and TreePM-methods combined
with an individual timestep scheme. Collisionless N-body simulations
accelerated with our library have significant advantage over those accelerated
by GPUs, especially on massively parallel environments.

which consistently includes additional one-jet production. The jet-matching
method developed for initial-state jet production has been extended to the
final state in order to regularize the final-state QED divergence in the $qg

been developed to complete the matching. The PS has the capability of enforcing
hard-photon radiation, and small-$Q^{2}$ photon radiations that are not covered
by the PS are supplemented by using a fragmentation function. The generated
events can be passed to general-purpose event generators in order to perform
the simulations down to the hadron level. Thus, we can simulate the isolation
requirements that must be applied in experiments at the hadron level. The
simulation results are in reasonable agreement with the predictions from RESBOS
and DIPHOX. The simulated hadron-level events can be further fed to detector
simulations in order to investigate the detailed performance of experiments.

array of encapsulated germanium detectors generally known as composite

described considering the absorption and scattering of gamma-rays. Considering
up to triple detector hit events, we have obtained expressions for
peak-to-total and peak-to-background ratios of the cluster detector, which
consists of seven hexagonal closely packed encapsulated HPGe detectors. Results
have been obtained for the miniball detectors comprising of three and four
seven hexagonal closely packed encapsulated HPGe detectors. The formalism has
been extended to the SPI spectrometer which is a telescope of the INTEGRAL

detectors. This spectrometer comprises of twelve detector modules surrounding
the cluster detector. For comparison, we have considered a spectrometer
comprising of nine detector modules surrounding the three detector
configuration of miniball detector. In the present formalism, the operation of
these sophisticated detectors could be described in terms of six probability
amplitudes only. Using experimental data on relative efficiency and fold
distribution of cluster detector as input, the fold distribution and the
peak-to-total, peak-to-background ratios have been calculated for the SPI

  Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2012)",,,,"cs.DM cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a supply graph and $H=(V,F)$ a demand graph defined on the
same set of vertices. An assignment of capacities to the edges of $G$ and
demands to the edges of $H$ is said to satisfy the \emph{cut condition} if for
any cut in the graph, the total demand crossing the cut is no more than the
total capacity crossing it. The pair $(G,H)$ is called \emph{cut-sufficient} if
for any assignment of capacities and demands that satisfy the cut condition,
there is a multiflow routing the demands defined on $H$ within the network with
capacities defined on $G$. We prove a previous conjecture, which states that
when the supply graph $G$ is series-parallel, the pair $(G,H)$ is
cut-sufficient if and only if $(G,H)$ does not contain an \emph{odd spindle} as
a minor; that is, if it is impossible to contract edges of $G$ and delete edges
of $G$ and $H$ so that $G$ becomes the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,p}$, with
$p\geq 3$ odd, and $H$ is composed of a cycle connecting the $p$ vertices of
degree 2, and an edge connecting the two vertices of degree $p$. We further
prove that if the instance is \emph{Eulerian} --- that is, the demands and
capacities are integers and the total of demands and capacities incident to
each vertex is even --- then the multiflow problem has an integral solution. We
provide a polynomial-time algorithm to find an integral solution in this case.
In order to prove these results, we formulate properties of tight cuts (cuts
for which the cut condition inequality is tight) in cut-sufficient pairs. We
believe these properties might be useful in extending our results to planar
graphs.

interfaces (e.g., WiFi and 3G) that attach to new access points as users move.
These mobile, multi-homed computers are a poor match with an Internet
architecture that binds connections to fixed end-points with topology-
dependent addresses. As a result, hosts typically cannot spread a connection
over multiple interfaces or paths, or change locations without breaking
existing connections.
  In this paper, we introduce ECCP, an end-host connection control protocol
that allows hosts to communicate over mul- tiple interfaces with
dynamically-changing IP addresses. Each ECCP connection consists of one or more
flows, each associated with an interface or path. A host can move an existing
flow from one interface to another or change the IP address using in-band
signaling, without any support from the underlying network. We use formal
models to verify that ECCP works correctly in the presence of packet loss,
out-of-order delivery, and frequent mobility, and to identify bugs and design
limitations in earlier mobility protocols.

that once the attacker is a friend of the victim, it is highly probable the

challenging questions in such environments are (1) choosing suitable values for
MapReduce configuration parameters -e.g., number of mappers, number of

a user should lease from the service provider. Currently, the tasks of both
choosing configuration parameters and estimating required resources are solely
the users' responsibilities. In this paper, we present an approach to provision
the total CPU usage in clock cycles of jobs in MapReduce environment. For a
MapReduce job, a profile of total CPU usage in clock cycles is built from the
job past executions with different values of two configuration parameters e.g.,
number of mappers, and number of reducers. Then, a polynomial regression is
used to model the relation between these configuration parameters and total CPU
usage in clock cycles of the job. We also briefly study the influence of input
data scaling on measured total CPU usage in clock cycles. This derived model
along with the scaling result can then be used to provision the total CPU usage
in clock cycles of the same jobs with different input data size. We validate
the accuracy of our models using three realistic applications (WordCount, Exim
MainLog parsing, and TeraSort). Results show that the predicted total CPU usage

is dominated by the co-dimension 1 saddle-node bifurcation in which an
eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix vanishes at $\gamma_P$ like
$\sqrt{\gamma_P-\gamma}$. This square-root singularity determines much of the
statistical physics of elasto-plasticity, and in particular that of the
stress-strain curves under athermal-quasistatic conditions. In this Letter we
discuss the much richer physics that can be expected in magnetic amorphous
solids. Firstly, magnetic amorphous solids exhibit co-dimension 2 plastic
instabilities, when an external strain and an external magnetic field are
applied simultaneously. Secondly, the phase diagrams promise a rich array of
new effects that have been barely studied; this opens up a novel and extremely
rich research program for magnetoplastic materials.

is considered, the scheme for the placement of the sample sites over the domain
is fundamental in order to implement the survey. In real situations, a commonly
adopted scheme is based on partitioning the domain into suitable strata, in
such a way that a single sample site is uniformly placed (i.e., selected with
uniform probability density) in each stratum and sample sites are independently
located. Under mild conditions on the function representing the target
attribute, it is shown that this scheme gives rise to an unbiased spatial total
estimator which is ""superefficient"" with respect to the estimator based on the
uniform placement of independent sample sites over the domain. In addition, the
large-sample normality of the estimator is proven and variance estimation

instabilities in stationary flow, and velocity variations in the flow. We
investigate the structures with different radial velocities in the knots of the

source. Collation of radial velocity data with proper motion measurements of
emission structures in the jet of HL Tau makes it possible to understand the
origin of these structures and decide on the mechanism for the formation of the
knotty structures in Herbig-Haro flows. We present observations obtained with a
6 m telescope (Russia) using the SCORPIO camera with scanning Fabry-Perot
interferometer. Two epochs of the observations of the HL/XZ Tau region in
Halpha emission (2001 and 2007) allowed us to measure proper motions for high
and low radial velocity structures. The structures with low and high radial
velocities in the HL Tau jet show the same proper motion. The point where the
HL Tau jet bents to the north (it coincides with the trailing edge of so-called
knot A) is stationary, i.e. does not have any perceptible proper motion and is
visible in Halpha emission only. We conclude that the high- and low- velocity
structures in the HL Tau jet represent bow-shocks and Mach disks in the
internal working surfaces of episodic outflows. The bend of the jet and the
brightness increase starting some distance from the source coincides with the
observed stationary deflecting shock. The increase of relative surface
brightness of bow-shocks could be the result of the abrupt change of the
physical conditions of the ambient medium as well as the interaction of a
highly collimated flow and the side wind from XZ Tau.

the manifold of the boundary values of the spinless point particle in a
variational approach. Since all known matter, baryons, leptons and gauge bosons
are spinning objects, it means that the manifold, which we call the kinematical
space, where we play the game of the variational formalism of an elementary
particle is greater than spacetime. This manifold for any mechanical system is
a Finsler metric space such that the variational formalism can always be
interpreted as a geodesic problem on this space. This manifold is just the flat
Minkowski space for the free spinless particle. Any interaction modifies its
flat Finsler metric as gravitation does. The same thing happens for the
spinning objects but now the Finsler metric space has more dimensions and its
metric is modified by any interaction, so that to reduce gravity to the
modification only of the spacetime metric is to make a simpler theory, the
gravitational theory of spinless matter. Even the usual assumption that the
modification of the metric only involves dependence of the metric coefficients
on the spacetime variables is also a restriction because in general these
coefficients are dependent on the velocities. In the spirit of unification of
all forces, gravity cannot produce, in principle, a different and simpler
geometrization than any other interaction.

configuration consists of single electrons, confined individually on liquid
helium by the microelectrodes, moving along the surface as the harmonic
oscillators. It has been known that the spin of an electron could be coupled to
its orbit (i.e., the vibrational motion) by properly applying a magnetic field.
Based on this single electron spin-orbit coupling, here we show that a
Jaynes-Cummings (JC) type interaction between the spin of an electron and the
orbit of another electron at a distance could be realized via the strong
Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Consequently, the proposed JC
interaction could be utilized to realize a strong orbit-mediated spin-spin
coupling and implement the desirable quantum information processing between the
distant electrons trapped individually on liquid helium.

functional role, since HET-s in its prion form participates in a recognition
process of different fungal strains. Based on the knowledge of the
high-resolution structure of HET-s(218-289) (the prion forming-domain) in its
fibrillar form, we here present a numerical simulation of the fibril growth
process which emphasizes the role of the topological properties of the
fibrillar structure. An accurate thermodynamic analysis of the way an
intervening HET-s chain is recruited to the tip of the growing fibril suggests
that elongation proceeds through a dock and lock mechanism. First, the chain
docks onto the fibril by forming the longest $\beta$-strands. Then, the
re-arrangement in the fibrillar form of all the rest of molecule takes place.
Interestingly, we predict also that one side of the HET-s fibril is more
suitable for substaining its growth with respect to the other. The resulting
strong polarity of fibril growth is a consequence of the complex topology of
HET-s fibrillar structure, since the central loop of the intervening chain
plays a crucially different role in favouring or not the attachment of the
C-terminus tail to the fibril, depending on the growth side.

permutations; the idea being that if two proofs have the same underlying

counterpart to proofs in the classical sequent calculus is thus an important
step in understanding classical sequent calculus proofs. By convincing, we mean
that (a) there should be a canonical function from sequent proofs to proof
nets, (b) it should be possible to check the correctness of a net in polynomial
time, (c) every correct net should be obtainable from a sequent calculus proof,
and (d) there should be a cut-elimination procedure which preserves
correctness. Previous attempts to give proof-net-like objects for propositional
classical logic have failed at least one of the above conditions. In [23], the
author presented a calculus of proof nets (expansion nets) satisfying (a) and
(b); the paper defined a sequent calculus corresponding to expansion nets but

the gravitational radiation torque. This snow-plough mechanism, as we call it,
would lead to an increase in the bolometric luminosity of the system prior to
the binary merger, which could be detected in conjunction with the
gravitational wave signal. We argue here that the snow-plough mechanism is
unlikely to occur. In two-dimensions, when the binary's hardening timescale
driven by gravitational radiation becomes shorter than the disc's viscous drift
timescale, fluid elements in the inner disc get funneled to the outer disc
through horseshoe trajectories with respect to the secondary. Mass leakage
across the secondary's gap is thus found to be effective and, as a result, the
predicted accretion disc luminosity will remain at roughly the same level prior

observing the off-limb corona the contribution from the nearby Si XI 30.3 nm

contribution of those two lines in the solar corona around the minimum of solar
activity. We combine measurements from CDS taken in August 2008 with
temperature and density profiles from semiempirical models of the corona to
compute the radiances of the two lines, and of other representative coronal
lines (e.g., Mg X 62.5 nm, Si XII 52.1 nm). Considering both diagnosed
quantities from line ratios (temperatures and densities) and line radiances in

up to ~2 R_Sun in streamers, while its contribution to narrowband imaging in

the opportunity to verify the high energy physics phenomena in the condensed
matter system. We study the symmetry properties of 2+1-dimensional Dirac
equation, both in the non-interacting case and in the case with constant
uniform magnetic field included in the model. The maximal symmetry group of the
massless Dirac equation is considered by putting it in the Jordan block form
and determining the algebra of operators leaving invariant the subspace of
solutions. It is shown that the resulting symmetry operators expressed in terms
of Dirac matrices cannot be described exclusively in terms of gamma matrices
(and their products) entering the corresponding Dirac equation. It is a
consequence of the reducibility of the considered representation in contrast to
the 3+1-dimensional case. Symmetry algebra is demonstrated to be a direct sum
of two gl(2,C) algebras plus an eight-dimensional abelian ideal. Since the
matrix structure which determines the rotational symmetry has all required

considering all the available RXTE, Swift and INTEGRAL observations performed
between October and November, 2010.
  By measuring the pulse phase evolution we conclude that the NS spun up at an
average rate of <nu_dot>=1.48(2)E-12 Hz/s, compatible with the accretion of the
Keplerian angular momentum of matter at the inner disc boundary. Similar to
other accreting pulsars, the stability of the pulse phases determined by using
the second harmonic component is higher than that of the phases based on the
fundamental frequency. Under the assumption that the second harmonic is a good
tracer of the neutron star spin frequency, we successfully model its evolution
in terms of a luminosity dependent accretion torque. If the NS accretes the
specific Keplerian angular momentum of the in-flowing matter, we estimate the
inner disc radius to lie between 47 and 93 km when the luminosity attains its
peak value. Smaller values are obtained if the interaction between the magnetic
field lines and the plasma in the disc is considered.
  The phase-averaged spectrum is described by thermal Comptonization of photons
with energy of ~1 keV. A hard to soft state transition is observed during the
outburst rise. The Comptonized spectrum evolves from a Comptonizing cloud at an
electron temperature of ~20 keV towards an optically denser cloud at kT_e~3
keV. At the same time, the pulse amplitude decreases from 27% to few per cent
and becomes strongly energy dependent. We discuss various possibilities to
explain such a behaviour, proposing that at large accretion luminosities a
significant fraction of the in-falling matter is not channelled towards the
magnetic poles, but rather accretes more evenly onto the NS surface.

the Milky Way (MW) inhabit dark matter halos with maximum circular velocity,
V_max, exceeding 30km/s. This is in apparent contradiction with the LCDM
simulations of the Aquarius Project, which suggest that MW-sized halos should
have at least 8 subhalos with V_max>30km/s. The absence of luminous satellites
in such massive subhalos is thus puzzling and may present a challenge to the
LCDM paradigm. We note, however, that the number of massive subhalos depends
sensitively on the (poorly-known) virial mass of the Milky Way, and that their
scarcity makes estimates of their abundance from a small simulation set like
Aquarius uncertain. We use the Millennium Simulation series and the invariance
of the scaled subhalo velocity function (i.e., the number of subhalos as a
function of \nu, the ratio of subhalo V_max to host halo virial velocity,
V_200) to secure improved estimates of the abundance of rare massive
subsystems. In the range 0.1<\nu<0.5, N_sub(>\nu) is approximately
Poisson-distributed about an average given by <N_sub>=10.2x(\nu/0.15)^(-3.11).
This is slightly lower than in Aquarius halos, but consistent with recent
results from the Phoenix Project. The probability that a LCDM halo has 3 or
fewer subhalos with V_max above some threshold value, V_th, is then
straightforward to compute. It decreases steeply both with decreasing V_th and
with increasing halo mass. For V_th=30km/s, ~40% of M_halo=10^12 M_sun halos
pass the test; fewer than 5% do so for M_halo>= 2x10^12 M_sun; and the
probability effectively vanishes for M_halo>= 3x 10^12 M_sun. Rather than a
failure of LCDM, the absence of massive subhalos might simply indicate that the
Milky Way is less massive than is commonly thought.

Any small change of the tritium gas composition will manifest itself in
non-negligible effects on the KATRIN measurements; therefore, Laser Raman
spectroscopy (LARA) is the method of choice for the monitoring of the gas
composition because it is a non-invasive and fast in-line measurement
technique. In these proceedings, the requirements of KATRIN for statistical and

eight extreme luminosity ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) candidates, which
were selected as the brightest ULXs (with L_X > 5x10^40 erg/s) located within
100 Mpc identified in a cross correlation of the 2XMM-DR1 and RC3 catalogues.
These objects are so luminous that they are difficult to describe with current
models of super-Eddington accretion onto all but the most massive stellar
remnants; hence they are amongst the most plausible candidates to host larger,
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Two objects are luminous enough in at
least one observation to be classed as hyperluminous X-ray source (HLX)
candidates, including one persistent HLX in an S0 galaxy that (at 3x10^41
erg/s) is the second most luminous HLX yet detected. The remaining seven
sources are located in spiral galaxies, and several appear to be closely
associated with regions of star formation as is common for many less luminous
ULXs. However, the X-ray characteristics of these extreme ULXs appear to
diverge from the less luminous objects. They are typically harder, possessing
absorbed power-law continuum spectra with photon indexes ~ 1.7, and are
potentially more variable on short timescales, with data consistent with ~
10-20 per cent rms variability on timescales of 0.2-2 ks. These properties
appear consistent with the sub-Eddington hard state, which given the observed
luminosities of these objects suggests the presence of IMBHs with masses in the
range 10^3-10^4 M_Sun. As such, this strengthens the case for these brightest
ULXs as good candidates for the eventual conclusive detection of the highly
elusive IMBHs. However, we caution that a combination of the highest plausible
super-Eddington accretion rates and the largest permitted stellar black hole
remnants cannot be ruled out without future, improved observations.

of electroweak (EW) sectors with light sparticles yielding dark matter (DM)
relic density allowed by the WMAP data. Some of the sparticles may lie just
above the existing lower bounds from LEP and lead to many novel DM producing
mechanisms not common in mSUGRA. This is illustrated by revisiting the above
squark-gluino mass limits obtained by the ATLAS Collaboration, with an
unconstrained EW sector with masses not correlated with the strong sector.
Using their selection criteria and the corresponding cross section limits, we
find at the generator level using Pythia, that the changes in the mass limits,

relaxation of the gluino mass limits are larger ($\approx 20%$). If a subset of

positive feedback $df/dx>0$ or a negative feedback $df/dx<0$. When the delay is
a constant, i.e. $r(x,\ep)=1$, this equation admits metastable rapidly
oscillating solutions that are transients whose duration is of order
$\exp(c/\ep)$, for some $c>0$. In this paper we investigate whether this
metastable behavior persists when the delay $r(x,\ep)$ depends non trivially on
the state variable $x$. Our conclusion is that for negative feedback, the
persistence of the metastable behavior depends only on the way $r(x,\ep)$
depends on $\ep$ and not on the feedback $f$. In contrast, for positive
feedback, for metastable solutions to exist it is further required that the
feedback $f$ is an odd function and the delay $r(x,\ep)$ is an even function.
Our analysis hinges upon the introduction of state dependent transition layer
equations that describe the profiles of the transient oscillations. One novel
result is that state dependent delays may lead to metastable dynamics in
equations that cannot support such regimes when the delay is constant.

for color allowed tree-dominated decays $B\to a_{2}^{0}\pi^{+}$ and $B\to

While other color suppressed tree-dominated decays have very small branching
ratios. In general, the branching ratios of most decays are in the range of
$10^{-5}$ to $10^{-8}$, which are bigger by one or two orders of magnitude than
those predictions obtained in Isgur-Scora-Grinstein-Wise II model and in the
covariant light-front approach, but consistent with the recent experimental

tensor meson emitted from vacuum are prohibited in naive factorization, the
contributions of nonfactorizable and annihilation diagrams are very important
to these decays, which are calculable in our perturbative QCD approach. We also
give predictions to the direct CP asymmetries, some of which are large enough
for the future experiments to measure. Because we considered the mixing between

RGB stars are constructed, and fitted with the dust radiative transfer model
DUSTY. The central stars are modeled by MARCS model atmospheres. In a first
step, the best-fit MARCS model is derived, determining the effective
temperature. In a second step, models with a finite dust optical depth are
fitted and it is determined whether the reduction in chi2 in such models with
one additional free parameter is statistically significant.
  23 stars are found to have a significant infrared excess, which is
interpreted as mass loss. The dust optical depths are translated into mass-loss
rates assuming a typical expansion velocity of 10 km/s and a dust-to-gas ratio
of 0.005.
  The mass-loss rates are compared to those derived for luminous stars in
globular clusters, by fitting both the infrared excess, as in the present
paper, and the chromospheric lines. There is excellent agreement between these
values and the mass-loss rates derived from the chromospheric activity. There
is a systematic difference with the literature mass-loss rates derived from
modeling the infrared excess, and this has been traced to technical details on
how the DUSTY radiative transfer model is run.
  If the present results are combined with those from modeling the
chromospheric emission lines, we obtain the fits Log Mdot = (1.0 +- 0.3) Log L
+ (-12.0 +- 0.9) and Log Mdot = (0.6 +- 0.2) Log (LR/M) + (-11.9 +- 0.9).
  The predictions of these mass-loss rate formula are tested against the RGB
mass loss determination in NGC 6791. Using a scaling factor of (8 +- 5), both
relations can fit this value. That the scaling factor is larger than unity
suggests that the expansion velocity and/or dust-to-gas ratio, or even the dust
opacities, are different from the values adopted.

dark matter by using the Weierstrass $\wp(t)$, $\sigma(t)$ and $\zeta(t)$
functions with two periods being infinite. If the universe can evolve
periodically, a non-singular universe can be realized. Furthermore, we examine
the cosmological evolution and nature of the equation of state (EoS) of dark
energy in the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmology. It is
explicitly illustrated that there exist three type models in which the universe
always stays in the non-phantom (quintessence) phase, whereas it always evolves
in the phantom phase, or the crossing of the phantom divide can be realized.
The scalar fields and the corresponding potentials are also analyzed for
different types of models.

equipped macro cell networks. This is achieved by increasing the cellular
coverage and channel capacity, and reducing power usage and interference
between femto cells and macro cells. In this paper, the optimization approach
for cellular resources with installed femto cells in macro cell networks has
been addressed by deploying smart antennas applications and effect power
adaptation method which significantly optimize the cellular coverage, channel
capacity, power usage, and intra and inter tier interference. The simulation
results also illustrate the outstanding performance of this optimization
methodology.

  Antenna for Significant PL&T Accuracy","7 pages, 12 figures","Wireless Telecommunications Symposium,UK London,April 16-18, 2012",,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Dynamic Position Location and Tracking (PL&T) is proposed deploying the
integrated approach of zone finding and triangulation using two friendly nodes
equipped with Steered Directional Antenna (DA) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks
(MANET). This approach allows the system to use only two references instead of
a typical 3 references for a straight triangulation. Moreover, the performance
of the proposed algorithm with references using directional antennas shows
significant improvement over triangulation using references with
Omnidirectional antennas as the beam power is concentrated. However, dynamic
switching of reference nodes is frequently required as the target moves outside
the predicted zone. This paper presents a better tracking accuracy in using
proposed dynamic PL&T as compared to other PL&T techniques. The multipath
fading is also addressed with the use of KV transform coding technique which
uses forward error correction and sample interleaving achieves greater than 90%
tracking accuracy with BERs of 10-6 or better.

exploited for real time Position Location and Tracking (PL&T) of radios and
sensors (nodes) for Global Positioning System (GPS) denied or GPS-free systems.
This issue is addressed by a novel system of integrated zone finding and
triangulation method for determining the PL&T of nodes when mobile network
fabrics are employed based on using directional antennas for radio
communications. Each mobile node is switched dynamically between being a
reference and a target node in PL&T operation to improve the PL&T accuracy of a
target node. This paper presents the Baseline PL&T with predictive Kalman
filter and Integrated Zone based PL&T algorithm design that integrates zone
finding and triangulation method. The performance of the proposed algorithm is
analysed using Interleaving-KV sample coding & error correction in Rayleigh and
Rician channel using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system
under the severe multipath fading.

distributions of species persistence times in natural ecosystems. Persistence
times, defined as the timespans occurring between species' colonization and
local extinction in a given geographic region, are empirically estimated from
local observations of species' presence/absence. A connected sampling problem
is presented, generalized and solved analytically. Species persistence is shown
to provide a direct connection with key spatial macroecological patterns like
species-area and endemics-area relationships. Our empirical analysis pertains
to two different ecosystems and taxa: a herbaceous plant community and a
estuarine fish database. Despite the substantial differences in ecological
interactions and spatial scales, we confirm earlier evidence on the general
properties of the scaling of persistence times, including the predicted effects
of the structure of the spatial interaction network. The framework tested here
allows to investigate directly nature and extent of spatial effects in the
context of ecosystem dynamics. The notable coherence between spatial and
temporal macroecological patterns, theoretically derived and empirically
verified, is suggested to underlie general features of the dynamic evolution of
ecosystems.

multiple malicious radios or nodes detection using integrated key based strict
friendly scheme and position location and tracking by multi-sectored based
multiple target's PL&T. The friendly and malicious nodes detection is based on
the integrated key consisting of symmetric keys, geographic location and round
trip response time. Two strictly friend references dynamically form the
tracking zone over the detected multiple malicious nodes using the
multi-sectored adaptive beam forming. This PL&T technique is robust, precise,
scalable, and faster than using the single reference, two reference and three
reference nodes based PL&T method in the battlefield oriented Mobile Ad hoc
Networks. The simulation results show that the lower relative speed bound of
any participating node increased the switching overhead, the decreasing
received energy with increasing number of the multi-sectored beams reduced
tracking accuracy and the strict friendly authentication overhead depends upon
the time period between two latest periodic authentication failures.
