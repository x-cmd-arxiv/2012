magnetic fields of any Bp star. A member of the Upper Centaurus Lupus
association, it is a star with a well-determined age of 16 Myr. Twelve new
spectra obtained from the FEROS, ESPaDOnS, and HARPS instruments, provide
sufficient material from which to re-evaluate the magnetic field and obtain a
first approximation to the atmospheric abundance distributions of various
elements. Using the new magnetic field measurements and optical photometry
together with previously published data, we refine the period of HD 133880 to P
= 0.877476 \pm 0.000009 days. The magnetic field structure was characterised by
a colinear multipole expansion from the observed variations of the longitudinal
and surface fields with rotational phase. This simple axisymmetric magnetic
field model is based on a predominantly quadrupolar component that roughly
describes the field variations. Using spectrum synthesis, we derived mean
abundances for O, Mg, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, Nd and Pr. All elements, except Mg (which
has a uniform distribution), are overabundant compared to the Sun and are more
abundant in the negative than in the positive magnetic hemisphere. In contrast
to most Bp stars the abundance of O in HD 133880 is overabundant compared to
the solar abundance ratio. In studying the Halpha and Paschen lines in the
optical spectra we could not unambiguously detect information about the
magnetosphere of HD 133880. However, radio emission data at both 3 and 6 cm
suggests that the magnetospheric plasma is held in rigid rotation with the star
by the magnetic field and further supported against collapse by the rapid
rotation. Subtle differences in the shapes of the optically thick radio light
curves at 3 and 6 cm suggest that the large-scale magnetic field is not fully
axisymmetric at large distances from the star.

small Fermi motion corrections if x>0.05. Thus the difference of the EMC ratio
from one reveals the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclei.
Using exact QCD sum rules we show that the ratio R_A(x_p,Q^2) used in
experimental studies, where x_p = Q^2/2q_0 m_p deviates from one even if a
nucleus consists of nucleons with small momenta only. Use of the Bjorken x
leads to additional decrease of R_A(x,Q^2) as compared to the x_p plots.
Coherent contribution of equivalent photons into photon component of parton
wave function of a nucleus unambiguously follows from Lorentz transformation of
the rest frame nucleus Coulomb field. For A~200 photons carry ~0.0065 fraction
of the light momentum of nucleus almost compensates the difference between data

large and predominantly nucleonic short-range correlations in nuclei pose a
serious challenge for most of the models of the EMC effect for x>0.6. The data
are consistent with a scenario in which the hadronic EMC effect reflects
fluctuations of inter nucleon interaction due to fluctuations of color
distribution in the interacting nucleons. The dynamic realization of this
scenario is the model in which the 3q (3qg) configurations with x > 0.5 parton
have a weaker interaction with nearby nucleons, leading to suppression of such
configurations giving a right magnitude of the EMC effect. The directions for

two different prescriptions based either on gas surface density and

The redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation places strong

B-mode polarization experiments to constrain the primordial tensor-to-scalar
ratio, r. To clean the foreground contributions we use parametric, maximum
likelihood component separation technique, and consider experimental setups
optimized to render a minimal level of the foreground residuals in the
recovered CMB map. We consider nearly full-sky observations, include two
diffuse foreground components, dust and synchrotron, and study cases with and
without calibration errors, spatial variability of the foreground properties,
and partial or complete B-mode lensing signal removal.
  In all these cases we find that in the limit of very low noise level and in
the absence of the intrumental or modeling systematic effects, the foreground
residuals do not lead to a limit on the lowest detectable value of r. But the
need to control the foreground residuals will play a major role in determining
the minimal noise levels necessary to permit a robust detection of r < 0.1 and
therefore in optimizing and forecasting the performance of the future missions.
For current and proposed experiments noise levels, the foreground residuals are
found non-negligible and potentially can affect our ability to set constraints
on r. We also show how the constraints can be significantly improved on by
restricting the post component separation processing to a smaller sky area.
This procedure applied to a case of a COrE-like satellite mission is shown to
result potentially in over an order of magnitude improvement in the detectable
value of r. With sufficient knowledge of the experimental bandpasses as well as
foreground component scaling laws, our conclusions are found to be independent
on the assumed overall normalization of the foregrounds and only quantitatively
depend on specific parametrizations assumed for the foreground components.

redshifts---by far the largest such sample used for clustering measurements at
these redshifts to date. The sample covers 3,600 square degrees, corresponding
to a comoving volume of 9.7(Gpc/h)^3 assuming a fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology,
and it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of -26, k-corrected to z=2. After
accounting for redshift errors we find that the redshift space correlation
function is fit well by a power-law of slope -2 and amplitude s_0=(9.7\pm
0.5)Mpc/h over the range 3<s<25Mpc/h. The projected correlation function, which
integrates out the effects of peculiar velocities and redshift errors, is fit
well by a power-law of slope -1 and r_0=(8.4\pm 0.6)Mpc/h over the range
4<R<16Mpc/h. There is no evidence for strong luminosity or redshift dependence
to the clustering amplitude, in part because of the limited dynamic range in
our sample. Our results are consistent with, but more precise than, previous
measurements at similar redshifts. Our measurement of the quasar clustering
amplitude implies a bias factor of b~3.5 for our quasar sample. We compare the

the renormalization scale and take an arbitrary range to estimate the
uncertainty in the QCD prediction. However, predictions using this procedure
depend on the renormalization scheme, leave a non-convergent renormalon
perturbative series, and moreover, one obtains incorrect results when applied
to QED processes. In contrast, if one fixes the renormalization scale using the
Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), all non-conformal $\{\beta_i\}$-terms
in the perturbative expansion series are summed into the running coupling, and
one obtains a unique, scale-fixed, scheme-independent prediction at any finite
order. The PMC scale $\mu^{\rm PMC}_R$ and the resulting finite-order PMC
prediction are both to high accuracy independent of the choice of initial
renormalization scale $\mu^{\rm init}_R$, consistent with renormalization group
invariance. As an application, we apply the PMC procedure to obtain NNLO
predictions for the $t\bar{t}$-pair production at the Tevatron and LHC
colliders. The PMC prediction for the total cross-section $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$
agrees well with the present Tevatron and LHC data. We also verify that the
initial scale-independence of the PMC prediction is satisfied to high accuracy
at the NNLO level: the total cross-section remains almost unchanged even when
taking very disparate initial scales $\mu^{\rm init}_R$ equal to $m_t$,
$20\,m_t$, $\sqrt{s}$. Moreover, after PMC scale setting, we obtain
$A_{FB}^{t\bar{t}} \simeq 12.5%$, $A_{FB}^{p\bar{p}} \simeq 8.28%$ and
$A_{FB}^{t\bar{t}}(M_{t\bar{t}}>450 \;{\rm GeV}) \simeq 35.0%$. These
predictions have a $1\,\sigma$-deviation from the present CDF and D0

characteristics at and below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition,
both in zero and nonzero magnetic field. The scaling properties are derived by
integrating the renormalization group flow equations up to a scale where they
can be reliably matched to simple analytic expressions. The vortex fugacity
turns out to be dangerously irrelevant for these quantities below Tc, thereby
altering the scaling behavior. We derive the possible crossover effects as the
current, magnetic field, or system size is varied, and find a strong
multiplicative logarithmic correction near Tc, all of which is necessary to
account for when interpreting experiments and simulation data. Our analysis
clarifies a longstanding discrepancy between the finite size dependence found
in many simulations and the current-voltage characteristics of experiments. We
further show that the logarithmic correction can be avoided by approaching the
transition in a magnetic field, thereby simplifying the scaling analysis. We
confirm our results by large-scale numerical simulations, and calculate the
dynamic critical exponent z, for relaxational Langevin dynamics and for
resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction dynamics.

storage regenerating (exact-MBR) codes. Both constructions obtain the encoded
symbols by first treating the message vector over GF(q) as a linearized
polynomial and then evaluating it over an extension field GF(q^m). The
evaluation points are chosen so that the encoded symbols at any node are
conjugates of each other, while corresponding symbols of different nodes are
linearly dependent with respect to GF(q). These properties ensure that data
repair can be carried out over the base field GF(q), instead of matrix
inversion over the extension field required by some existing exact-MBR codes.
To the best of our knowledge, this approach is novel in the construction of
exact-MBR codes. One of our constructions leads to exact-MBR codes with
arbitrary parameters. These exact-MBR codes have higher data reconstruction
complexities but lower data repair complexities than their counterparts based
on the product-matrix approach; hence they may be suitable for applications
that need a small number of data reconstructions but a large number of data
repairs.

barred galaxies with a broad distribution of Hubble types in order to have a
first estimate of the magnitude of their secular mass accretion/excretion rates
in the context of bulge building and morphological evolution along the Hubble
sequence. The stellar surface density maps of the sample galaxies were derived
from the archival data of SINGS and SDSS. The corresponding molecular and
atomic surface densities were derived from archival CO(1-0) and HI
interferometric observations of the BIMA SONG, THINGS, and VIVA surveys. The
method used for determining the radial mass flow rates follows from our
previous work using the potential-density phase shift approach, which utilizes
a volume-type torque integral to calculate the angular momentum exchange rate
between the basic state disk matter and the density wave modes. This approach
yields radial mass flow rates and angular momentum transport rates several
times higher than similar rates estimated using the traditional method of
gravitational torque couple of Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs 1972, and this
difference reflects the dominant role played by collisionless shocks in the
secular evolution of galaxies containing extremely non-linear, quasi-steady
density wave modes. It is shown that these non-linear modes maintains their
quasi-steady state at the expense of a continuous radial mass flow and the
resulting morphological transformation of galaxies throughout their lifetime,
not only for late-type and intermediate-type disk galaxies but, under favorable
conditions, also for earlier types including S0s and disky ellipticals. We show
here for the first time using observational data that stellar mass
accretion/excretion is just as important, and oftentimes much more important,
than the corresponding accretion/excretion processes in the gaseous component.

quantify the importance of these effects by randomizing the angular positions
of satellite galaxies within haloes, either coherently or individually, while
keeping the distance to their respective central galaxies fixed. We find that
the effect of disrupting the alignment with larger scale structure is a ~2 per
cent decrease in the galaxy correlation function around r=1.8 Mpc/h. We find
that sphericalizing the ellipsoidal distributions of galaxies within haloes
decreases the correlation function by up to 20 per cent for r<1 Mpc/h and
increases it slightly at somewhat larger radii. Similar results apply to power
spectra and redshift-space correlation functions. Models based on the Halo
Occupation Distribution, which place galaxies spherically within haloes
according to a mean radial profile, will therefore significantly underestimate
the clustering on sub-Mpc scales. In addition, we find that halo assembly bias,
in particular the dependence of clustering on halo shape, propagates to the
clustering of galaxies. We predict that this aspect of assembly bias should be
observable through the use of extensive group catalogues.

and compared to average background number counts extracted from three
independent control fields in the same observations. A significant full-band
(soft-band) excess of \sim78 (67) X-ray point sources is found in the cluster

level of 4.0 sigma (4.2 sigma), corresponding to an average number of detected

towards a rising radial profile in the cluster region (r<1Mpc) of predominantly
low-luminosity AGN with an average detected excess of about one point source

cosmological parameter dependence of the mass and evolution of haloes in the
extreme high-mass tail of the z=6 distribution. We assume these objects to be
likely hosts for the population of rare but ultraluminous high-redshift quasars
discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Haloes with a similar abundance to
these quasars have a median mass of 9x10^12 Msun in the currently preferred
cosmology, but do not evolve into equally extreme objects at z=0. Rather, their
descendants span the full range conventionally assigned to present-day
clusters, 6x10^13 to 2.5x10^15 Msun for this same cosmology. The masses both at
z=6 and at z=0 shift up or down by factors exceeding two if cosmological
parameters are pushed to the boundaries of the range discussed in published
interpretations of data from the WMAP satellite. The main factor determining
the future growth of a high-mass z=6 halo is the mean overdensity of its
environment on scales of 7 to 14 Mpc, and descendant masses can be predicted 6
to 8 times more accurately if this density is known than if it is not. All
these features are not unique to extreme high-z haloes, but are generic to
hierarchical growth. Finally, we find that extreme haloes at z=6 typically
acquired about half of their total mass in the preceding 100 Myr, implying very
large recent accretion rates which may be related to the large black hole
masses and high luminosities of the SDSS quasars.

strongly-interacting piece of the Standard Model - are dominated by two
emergent phenomena: confinement; namely, the theory's elementary
degrees-of-freedom - quarks and gluons - have never been detected in isolation;
and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB), which is a remarkably effective
mass generating mechanism, responsible for the mass of more than 98% of visible
matter in the Universe. These phenomena are not apparent in the formulae that
define QCD, yet they play a principal role in determining Nature's observable
characteristics. Much remains to be learnt before confinement can properly be
understood. On the other hand,the last decade has seen important progress in
the use of relativistic quantum field theory, so that we can now explain the
origin of DCSB and are beginning to demonstrate its far-reaching consequences.
Dyson-Schwinger equations have played a critical role in these advances. These
lecture notes provide an introduction to Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs), QCD
and hadron physics, and illustrate the use of DSEs to predict phenomena that
are truly observable.

studying the effect of different neutrino hierarchies on the matter power

non-linearities enhance the effect of hierarchy on the matter power spectrum at
mildly non-linear scales. The difference between the different hierarchies is
about 0.5% for a sum of neutrino masses of 0.1eV. Albeit this is a small
effect, it is potentially measurable from upcoming surveys. In combination with
neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments, this opens up the possibility of
using the sky to determine if neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac fermions.

disfavored against a phase with a one-dimensional modulation of the chiral
condensate. On the other hand, we find that square and hexagonal lattices
eventually get favored at higher chemical potentials. Although stretching the

velocities directly from individual diesel spray structures, those features
need to be spatially resolved in the measurement. The distributed structures
measured in a direct shadowgraphy arrangement cannot be reliably analyzed for
this kind of velocity information. However, by utilizing an intense collimated
light source and adding imaging optics which modify the signal collection,
spatially resolved optical information can be retrieved from spray edge regions
within a chosen object plane. This work discusses a set of measurements where a
diesel spray is illuminated in rapid succession by two ultrafast laser pulses
generated by a mode-locked Ti-Sapphire oscillator seeding a matched pair of
regenerative amplifiers. Light from the object plane, located at the center of
the spray, is directed by a set of imaging optics to the detection plane, where
it forms a shadow image on the face of a frame-transfer CCD. In this
configuration the depth-of-field of the imaging optics limit detected light,
effectively increasing the efficiency of signal collection within the object
plane and suppressing out-of-focus contributions. Time-correlated images are
collected in this manner and analyzed to obtain object plane velocity data for
in-focus edge features of the spray.

potential, a time invariant function characterizing the agents' interactions

line-tied asymmetric magnetic reconnection in the context of solar flare and

asymmetric along the inflow direction by allowing the initial upstream magnetic
field strengths and densities to differ, and along the outflow direction by
placing the initial perturbation near a conducting wall boundary that
represents the photosphere. When the upstream magnetic fields are asymmetric,
the post-flare loop structure is distorted into a characteristic skewed candle
flame shape. The simulations can thus be used to provide constraints on the
reconnection asymmetry in post-flare loops. More hard X-ray emission is
expected to occur at the footpoint on the weak magnetic field side because
energetic particles are more likely to escape the magnetic mirror there than at
the strong magnetic field footpoint. The footpoint on the weak magnetic field
side is predicted to move more quickly because of the requirement in two
dimensions that equal amounts of flux must be reconnected from each upstream
region. The X-line drifts away from the conducting wall in all simulations with
asymmetric outflow and into the strong magnetic field region during most of the
simulations with asymmetric inflow. There is net plasma flow across the X-line
for both the inflow and outflow directions. The reconnection exhaust directed
away from the obstructing wall is significantly faster than the exhaust
directed towards it. The asymmetric inflow condition allows net vorticity in
the rising outflow plasmoid which would appear as rolling motions about the

optimal under full knowledge of channel and network conditions. However, these

into account the overhead associated with channel probing and feedback required
to obtain the full channel state information at every slot. We adopt a channel
probing model where $\beta$ fraction of time slot is consumed for acquiring the
channel state information (CSI) of a single channel. In this work, we design a
joint scheduling and channel probing algorithm named SDF by considering the
overhead of obtaining the channel state information. We first analytically
prove SDF algorithm can support $1+\epsilon$ fraction of of the full rate
region achieved when all users are probed where $\epsilon$ depends on the
expected number of users which are not probed. Then, for homogenous channel, we
show that when the number of users in the network is greater than 3, $\epsilon
> 0$, i.e., we guarantee to expand the rate region. In addition, for
heterogenous channels, we prove the conditions under which SDF guarantees to
increase the rate region. We also demonstrate numerically in a realistic
simulation setting that this rate region can be achieved by probing only less
than 50% of all channels in a CDMA based cellular network utilizing high data
rate protocol under normal channel conditions.

cone. Following techniques used by Bezrukavnikov in [5] to establish a
bijection between $\Lambda^+$, the dominant weights for a simple algebraic
group $H$, and $\textbf{O}$, the set of pairs consisting of a nilpotent orbit
and a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of the isotropy group of
the orbit, we prove an analogous statement for the exotic nilpotent cone. First
we prove that dominant line bundles on the exotic Springer resolution
$\widetilde{\mathfrak{N}}$ have vanishing higher cohomology, and compute their
global sections using techniques of Broer. This allows to show that the direct
images of these dominant line bundles constitute a quasi-exceptional set
generating the category $D^b(Coh^G(\mathfrak{N}))$, and deduce that the
resulting $t$-structure on $D^b(Coh^G(\mathfrak{N}))$ coincides with the
perverse coherent $t$-structure. The desired result now follows from the
bijection between costandard objects and simple objects in the heart of this
$t$-structure on $D^b(Coh^G(\mathfrak{N}))$.

unchanged. The energy scale of the anomaly continues to be set by an effective

high-redshift starbursts. The progenitors of the pseudobulges form as
high-redshift discs with small scale lengths by rapid supply of low angular

formation has largely completed in terms of mass. The secular evolution such as
bar instability accounts for about 30 % of the bulge mass for one galaxy and

properties of the pseudobulges.

Lyapunov control in this paper. The first design makes the Lyapunov function
decrease as fast as possible with a constraint on the total power of control
fields, and the second design has the same purpose but with a constraint on
each control field. Examples of a three-level system demonstrate that the
evolution time for Lyapunov control can be significantly shortened, especially
when high control fidelity is required. Besides, this optimal Lyapunov-based
quantum control is robust against uncertainties in the free Hamiltonian and
decoherence in the system compared to conventional Lyapunov control.

characterized by two photons back to back emitted with equal energies. By
irradiation of trigger laser from two target ends, with its frequency tuned at
the half energy between two levels, a macroscopically coherent state of medium
and fields dynamically emerges as time evolves and large signal of amplified
output occurs with a time delay. The basic semi-classical equations in 1+1
spacetime dimensions are derived for the field plus medium system to describe
the spacetime evolution of the entire system, and numerically solved to
demonstrate existence of both explosive and weak PSR phenomena in the presence
of relaxation terms. The explosive PSR event terminates accompanying a sudden
release of most energy stored in the target. Our numerical simulations are
performed using a vibrational transition $X^1\Sigma_g^+ v=1 \rightarrow 0$ of
para-H$_2$ molecule, and taking many different excited atom number densities
and different initial coherences between the metastable and the ground states.
In an example of number density close to $O[10^{21}]$cm$^{-3}$ and of high
initial coherence, the explosive event terminates at several nano seconds after
the trigger irradiation, when the phase relaxation time of $> O[10]$ ns is
taken. After PSR events the system is expected to follow a steady state
solution which is obtained by analytic means, and is made of many objects of
field condensates endowed with a topological stability.

there is a threshold and a large pulse parameter region where the effective
dynamical control can be implemented, in contrast to the perturbative
decoupling schemes where the permissible parameters are represented by a point
or converge to a very small subset in the large parameter region admitted by
our non-perturbative approach. An important implication of the non-perturbative
approach is its flexibility in implementing the dynamical control scheme in a
experimental setup. Our findings have exhibited several interesting features of
the non-perturbative regimes such as the chain-size independence, pulse
strength upper-bound, noncontinuous valid parameter regions, etc. Furthermore,

potential difference (CPD) signals recorded by KPFM on surfaces of insulating

such effects. We attack this problem in two steps. First, the electrostatics of
the macroscopic tip-cantilever-sample system is treated by a finite-difference
method on an adjustable nonuniform mesh. Then the resulting electric field
under the tip apex is inserted into a series of atomistic wavelet-based density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. Results are shown for a realistic neutral
but reactive silicon nano-scale tip interacting with a NaCl(001) sample.
Bias-dependent forces and resulting atomic displacements are computed to within
an unprecedented accuracy. Theoretical expressions for amplitude modulation
(AM) and frequency modulation (FM) KPFM signals and for the corresponding local
contact potential differences (LCPD) are obtained by combining the macroscopic
and atomistic contributions to the electrostatic force component generated at
the voltage modulation frequency, and evaluated for several tip oscillation
amplitudes A up to 10 nm. Being essentially constant over a few Volts, the
slope of atomistic force versus bias is the basic quantity which determines
variations of the atomic-scale LCPD contrast. Already above A = 0.1 nm, the
LCPD contrasts in both modes exhibit almost the same spatial dependence as the
slope. In the AM mode, this contrast is approximately proportional to
$A^{-1/2}$, but remains much weaker than the contrast in the FM mode, which
drops somewhat faster as A is increased. These trends are a consequence of the
macroscopic contributions to the KPFM signal, which are stronger in the AM-mode
and especially important if the sample is an insulator even at sub-nanometer
separations where atomic-scale contrast appears.

measurements, monitoring or direct observations of system performances and can
be used to update the system reliability estimate. In structural reliability
analysis, such information is expressed either by inequalities (e.g. for the
observation that no defect is present) or by equalities (e.g. for quantitative
measurements of system characteristics). When information Z is of the equality
type, the a-priori probability of Z is zero and most structural reliability
methods (SRM) are not directly applicable to the computation of the updated
reliability. Hitherto, the computation of the reliability of engineering
systems conditional on equality information was performed through first- and
second order approximations. In this paper, it is shown how equality
information can be transformed into inequality information, which enables
reliability updating by solving a standard structural system reliability
problem. This approach enables the use of any SRM, including those based on
simulation, for reliability updating with equality information. It is
demonstrated on three numerical examples, including an application to fatigue
reliability.

A simple
example is the classic problem, first considered by Berg and Purcell, of
determining the concentration of a chemical ligand in the surrounding media. On
general theoretical grounds (Landuer's Principle), it is expected that such
computations require cells to consume energy. Here, we explicitly calculate the
energetic costs of computing ligand concentration for a simple two-component
cellular network that implements a noisy version of the Berg-Purcell strategy.
We show that learning about external concentrations necessitates the breaking
of detailed balance and consumption of energy, with greater learning requiring
more energy. Our calculations suggest that the energetic costs of cellular
computation may be an important constraint on networks designed to function in
resource poor environments such as the spore germination networks of bacteria.

energetic particle (SEP) events. They are associated with coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) and solar flares, but we still do not clearly understand the
special conditions that produce these rare events. During Solar Cycle 23, a
total of 16 GLEs were registered, using ground-based neutron monitor data. We
first ask if these GLEs are clearly distinguishable from other SEP events
observed from space. Setting aside possible difficulties in identifying all
GLEs consistently, we then try to find observables which may unmistakably
isolate these GLEs by studying the basic properties of the associated eruptions
and the active regions (ARs) that produced them. It is found that neither the
magnitudes of the CMEs and flares nor the complexities of the ARs give
sufficient conditions for GLEs. It is possible to find CMEs, flares or ARs that
are not associated with GLEs but that have more extreme properties than those
associated with GLEs. We also try to evaluate the importance of magnetic field
connection of the AR with Earth on the detection of GLEs and their onset times.
Using the potential field source surface (PFSS) model, a half of the GLEs are
found to be well-connected. However, the GLE onset time with respect to the
onset of the associated flare and CME does not strongly depend on how
well-connected the AR is. The GLE onset behavior may be largely determined by
when and where the CME-driven shock develops. We could not relate the shocks
responsible for the onsets of past GLEs with features in solar images, but the
combined data from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) and the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) have the potential to change this for GLEs
that may occur in the rising phase of Solar Cycle 24.

observations of a physical system into an underlying model in order to infer
the properties of the state of the system. Filters refer to a class of data
assimilation algorithms designed to update the estimation of the state as data
is acquired sequentially. For linear problems subject to Gaussian noise
filtering can be performed exactly using the Kalman filter. For nonlinear
systems it can be approximated in a systematic way by particle filters. However
in high dimensions these particle filtering methods can break down. Hence, for
the large nonlinear systems arising in applications such as oceanography and
weather forecasting, various ad hoc filters are used, based on Gaussian
approximations. In this work, we study the accuracy and stability of these ad
hoc filters in the context of the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. The
ideas readily generalize to a range of dissipative partial differential
equations (PDEs). By working in this infinite dimensional setting we provide an
analysis which is useful for the understanding of high dimensional filtering,
and is robust to mesh-refinement. We describe theoretical results showing that,
in the small observational noise limit, the filters can be tuned to perform
accurately in tracking the signal itself (filter accuracy), provided the system
is observed in a sufficiently large low dimensional space; roughly speaking
this space should be large enough to contain the unstable modes of the
linearized dynamics. The tuning corresponds to what is known as variance
inflation in the applied literature. Numerical results are given which
illustrate the theory. The positive results herein concerning filter stability
complement recent numerical studies which demonstrate that the ad hoc filters
can perform poorly in reproducing statistical variation about the true signal.

Hamilton-Jacobi velocity. This point is missed in the work of Cohen, Glashow,
""{\it Pair Creation Constrains Superluminal Neutrino Propagation}"" (Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 107}, 181803 (2011)). It then leads to the conclusion of existence
of Cherenkov-like radiation provided one sees superluminal neutrinos. We show
that in the framework of Special Relativity with de Sitter space-time symmetry
(dS-SR) the above Cohen-Glashow argument does not hold and the Cherenkov-like
radiation is forbidden. Our result is consistent with the experimental results
of the ICARUS Collaboration.

supernovae dimness, suggesting a remarkable change in the expansion rate of the
Universe from a decrease since the big bang to an increase, driven by
anti-gravity forces of a mysterious dark energy material comprising 70% of the
Universe mass-energy. Fluid mechanical considerations falsify both the
accelerating expansion and dark energy concepts. Kinematic viscosity is
neglected in current standard models of self-gravitational structure formation,
which rely on cold dark matter CDM condensations and clusterings that are also
falsified by fluid mechanics. Weakly collisional CDM particles do not condense
but diffuse away. Photon viscosity predicts superclustervoid fragmentation
early in the plasma epoch and protogalaxies at the end. At the plasma-gas
transition, the plasma fragments into Earth-mass gas planets in trillion planet
clumps (proto-globular-star-cluster PGCs). The hydrogen planets freeze to form
the dark matter of galaxies and merge to form their stars. Dark energy is a
systematic dimming error for Supernovae Ia caused by dark matter planets near
hot white dwarf stars at the Chandrasekhar carbon limit. Evaporated planet
atmospheres may or may not scatter light from the events depending on the line
of sight.
