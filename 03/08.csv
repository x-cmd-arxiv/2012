learning abilities. The agents interact with each other on a local level and
diffuse information across the network through their collaborations. In this
work, we consider two types of agents: informed agents and uninformed agents.
The former receive new data regularly and perform consultation and in-network
tasks, while the latter do not collect data and only participate in the
consultation tasks. We examine the performance of adaptive networks as a
function of the proportion of informed agents and their distribution in space.
The results reveal some interesting and surprising trade-offs between
convergence rate and mean-square performance. In particular, among other
results, it is shown that the performance of adaptive networks does not
necessarily improve with a larger proportion of informed agents. Instead, it is
established that the larger the proportion of informed agents is, the faster
the convergence rate of the network becomes albeit at the expense of some
deterioration in mean-square performance. The results further establish that
uninformed agents play an important role in determining the steady-state
performance of the network, and that it is preferable to keep some of the
highly connected agents uninformed. The arguments reveal an important interplay
among three factors: the number and distribution of informed agents in the
network, the convergence rate of the learning process, and the estimation
accuracy in steady-state. Expressions that quantify these relations are
derived, and simulations are included to support the theoretical findings. We
further apply the results to two models that are widely used to represent
behavior over complex networks, namely, the Erdos-Renyi and scale-free models.

entanglement based quantum key distribution (QKD) schemes. A realistic
treatment of this general communication problem must take account of the
nonideal nature of the entanglement source and the detectors. The aim of this
paper is to give such a treatment. We obtain analytic expression for the mutual
information in terms of experimental parameters. The results are applied to
communication schemes that rely on spontaneous parametric down conversion to
generate entangled photons. We show that our results can be applied to tasks
such as calculating the optimal rate of bits per photon in high dimensional
time bin encoded QKD protocols (prior to privacy amplification). A key finding
for such protocols is that by using realistic experimental parameters, one can
obtain over 10 bits per photon. We also show how our results can be applied to
characterize the capacity of a fibre array and to quantify entanglement using

adopted tracer. We find that measures of the specific growth rate \beta=f/b
using the Hamilton/Kaiser harmonic expansion of the redshift-space correlation
function \xi(r_p,\pi) on scales larger than 3/h Mpc are typically
under-estimated by up to 10% for galaxy sized halos. This is significantly
larger than the corresponding statistical errors, which amount to a few
percent, indicating the importance of non-linear improvements to the Kaiser
model to obtain accurate measurements of the growth rate. We compare the
statistical errors to predictions obtained with the Fisher information matrix,
based on the usual FKP prescription for the errors on the power spectrum. We
show that this produces parameter errors fairly similar to the standard
deviations from the halo catalogues, but only if applied to strictly linear
scales in Fourier space (k<0.2 h/Mpc). Finally, we present an accurate scaling
formula describing the relative error on {\beta} as a function of the survey
parameters, which closely matches the simulation results in all explored

field $k$. A quasi-hereditary algebra $\wA$ over $\sO$ provides a bridge
between the representation theory of the quasi-hereditary algebra
$\wA_K:=K\otimes \wA$ over the field $K$ and the quasi-hereditary algebra
$A_k:=k\otimes_\sO\wA$ over $k$. In one important example, $\wA_K$--mod is a
full subcategory of the category of modules for a quantum enveloping algebra
while $\wA_k$--mod is a full subcategory of the category of modules for a
reductive group in positive characteristic. This paper considers first the
question of when the positively graded algebra $\gr \wA:= \bigoplus_{n\geq
0}(\wA\cap\rad^n\wA_K)/(\wA\cap\rad^{n+1}\wA_K)$ is quasi-hereditary. A main
result gives sufficient conditions that $\gr\wA$ be quasi-hereditary. The main
requirement is that each graded module $\gr\wDelta(\lambda)$ arising from a
$\wA$-standard (Weyl) module $\wDelta(\lambda)$ have an irreducible head. An
additional hypothesis requires that the graded algebra $\gr \wA_K$ be
quasi-hereditary, a property recently proved by us to hold in some important
cases involving quantum enveloping algebras. In the case where $\wA$ arises
from regular dominant weights for a quantum enveloping algebra at a primitive
$p$th root of unity for a prime $p>2h-2$ (where $h$ is the Coxeter number), a
second main result shows that $\gr\wA$ is quasi-hereditary. The proof depends
on previous work of the authors, including a continuation of the methods there
involving tightly graded subalgebras, and a development of a quantum
deformation theory over $\sO$, worthy of attention in its own right, extending
the work of Andersen-Jantzen-Soergel. As we point out, this work provides an
essential step in our work on $p$-filtrations of Weyl modules for reductive
algebraic groups over fields of positive characteristic.

use the previously published Continuous Period Search (CPS) method to model the
evolution of the light curve of LQ Hya. The CPS fits a Fourier series model to
short overlapping subsets of data. This enables us to monitor the spot
configuration of the star with a higher time resolution. We find seasonal
variability in the mean level and amplitude of the light curve of LQ Hya. The
variability of the light curve amplitude seems not to be cyclic, but the
long-term variations in the mean magnitude could be explained by an
approximately 13 year cycle. Because of the limited length of the observed time
series, it is not yet possible to determine whether this structure really is
periodic and represents an activity cycle. We estimate the differential
rotation of the star to be small, and the star is potentially very close to a
rigid rotator. We search for active longitudes and find that on time scales up
to six months there are typically one or two relatively stable active areas on
the star with limited phase migration. On time scales longer than one year, no
stable active longitudes have been present except for the period between 2003

into a rotating tank filled with linearly-stratified salt water. The vortices
are far from the top and bottom boundaries of the tank, so there is no Ekman

they do, they continue to obey our law for $\alpha$, which decreases over time.
In a second set of experiments, the vortices are sustained by a slow continuous
injection after they form, so they evolve more slowly and have larger |Ro|, but
they also obey our law for $\alpha$. The law for $\alpha$ is not only validated
by our experiments, but is also shown to be consistent with observations of the
aspect ratios of Atlantic meddies and Jupiter's Great Red Spot and Oval BA. The

to leverage the botnet detection work carried out by some organizations to

controlled by a watermarker, who inserts a particular pattern into their
network traffic. This pattern can then be detected at a very low cost by client
organizations and the watermark can be tuned to provide acceptable
false-positive rates. A novel feature of the watermark is that it is inserted
collaboratively into the flows of multiple captured bots at once, in order to
ensure the signal is strong enough to be detected. BotMosaic can also be used
to detect stepping stones and to help trace back to the botmaster. It is
content agnostic and can operate on encrypted traffic. We evaluate BotMosaic

recovery of the low-rank and sparse components is a fundamental task subsuming
compressed sensing, matrix completion, and principal components pursuit. This
paper develops algorithms for distributed sparsity-regularized rank
minimization over networks, when the nuclear- and $\ell_1$-norm are used as
surrogates to the rank and nonzero entry counts of the sought matrices,
respectively. While nuclear-norm minimization has well-documented merits when
centralized processing is viable, non-separability of the singular-value sum
challenges its distributed minimization. To overcome this limitation, an
alternative characterization of the nuclear norm is adopted which leads to a
separable, yet non-convex cost minimized via the alternating-direction method
of multipliers. The novel distributed iterations entail reduced-complexity
per-node tasks, and affordable message passing among single-hop neighbors.
Interestingly, upon convergence the distributed (non-convex) estimator provably
attains the global optimum of its centralized counterpart, regardless of
initialization. Several application domains are outlined to highlight the
generality and impact of the proposed framework. These include unveiling
traffic anomalies in backbone networks, predicting networkwide path latencies,
and mapping the RF ambiance using wireless cognitive radios. Simulations with

electronic devices and for the investigation of the fundamental properties of
graphene's Dirac fermions. It is largely accepted that the mobility-limiting
factor in graphene is the Coulomb scattering off of charged impurities that
reside either on graphene or in the underlying substrate. This is true both for
traditional graphene devices on SiO2 substrates and possibly for the recently
reported high-mobility suspended and supported devices. An attractive approach
to reduce such scattering is to place graphene in an environment with high
static dielectric constant \kappa\ that would effectively screen the electric
field due to the impurities. However, experiments so far report only a modest
effect of high-\kappa\ environment on mobility. Here, we investigate the effect
of the dielectric environment of graphene by studying electrical transport in
multi-terminal graphene devices that are suspended in liquids with \kappa\
ranging from 1.9 to 33. For non-polar liquids (\kappa <5) we observe a rapid
increase of \mu\ with \kappa\ and report a record room-temperature mobility as
large as ~60,000 cm2/Vs for graphene devices in anisole (\kappa=4.3), while in
polar liquids (\kappa >18) we observe a drastic drop in mobility. We
demonstrate that non-polar liquids enhance mobility by screening charged
impurities adsorbed on graphene, while charged ions in polar liquids cause the
observed mobility suppression. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulation
we establish that scattering by out-of-plane flexural phonons, a dominant
scattering mechanism in suspended graphene in vacuum at room temperature, is
suppressed by the presence of liquids. We expect that our findings may provide
avenues to control and reduce carrier scattering in future graphene-based
electronic devices.

high energy component lasting 2 s in the prompt phase of GRB98080923 (Fraija et
al. 2012). The model describes spectral indices, fluxes and the duration of the
high-energy component as well as a long keV tail present in the prompt phase of
GRB980923. Here, we present an extension of this model to describe the
high-energy emission of GRB090926A. We argue that the emission consist of two
components, one with a duration less than 1s during the prompt phase, and a
second, longer-lasting GeV phase lasting hundred of seconds after the prompt
phase. The short high-energy phase can be described as SSC emission from a
reverse shock similar to that observed in GRB980923, while the longer component
arises from the forward shock. The main assumption is that the jet is
magnetized and evolves in the thick-shell case, and the calculated fluxes and
break energies are all consistent with the observed values. A comparison
between the resulting parameters obtained for GRB980923 and GRB090926A suggests
differences in burst tails that could be attributable to the circumburst
medium, and this could account for previous analyses reported in the literature
for other bursts. We find that the density of the surrounding medium inferred
from the observed values associated to the forward shock agrees with standard
values for host galaxies such as the one associated to GRB090926A.

Based on rate splitting and superposition coding, two users transmit
information to a destination over 3 phases, such that the users partially
exchange their information during the first 2 phases and cooperatively transmit
to the destination during the last one. This scheme is near capacity-achieving
when the inter-user links are stronger than each user-destination link; it also
includes partial decode-forward relaying as a special case. We propose
efficient algorithms to find the optimal resource allocation for maximizing
either the individual or the sum rate and identify the corresponding optimal
scheme for each channel configuration. For fixed phase durations, the power
allocation problem is convex and can be solved analytically based on the KKT
conditions. The optimal phase durations can then be obtained numerically using
simple search methods. Results show that as the interuser link qualities
increase, the optimal scheme moves from no cooperation to partial then to full
cooperation, in which the users fully exchange their information and
cooperatively send it to the destination. Therefore, in practical systems with
strong inter-user links, simple decode-forward relaying at both users is
rate-optimal.

only in terms of the flavor symmetry, by changing the charge assignment of
righthanded neutrinos. The PMNS matrix in the first model is obtained from both
mass matrices, charged leptons giving rise to non-zero $\theta^l_{13}$ and
neutrino masses giving rise to tri-bi-maximal mixing. The physical mixing
angles are expressed by a simple relation between $\theta^l_{13}$ and
tri-bi-maximal angles to fit the recent experimental results. The other model
generates PMNS matrix with non-zero $\theta_{13}$, only from the neutrino mass
transformation. The 5 dimensional effective theory of Majorana neutrinos

gene regulatory networks (GRNs) they correspond to stable genes profiles
associated to the various cell types. We use Kauffman's approach to model GRNs
with random Boolean networks (RBNs). We start this paper by proving that, if we
fix the values of the source nodes (nodes with in-degree 0), the expected
number of fixed points of any RBN is one (independently of the topology we
choose). For finding such fixed points we use the {\alpha}-asynchronous
dynamics (where every node is updated independently with probability 0 <
{\alpha} < 1). In fact, it is well-known that asynchrony avoids the cycle
attractors into which parallel dynamics tends to fall. We perform simulations
and we show the remarkable property that, if for a given RBN with scale-free
topology and {\alpha}-asynchronous dynamics an initial configuration reaches a
fixed point, then every configuration also reaches a fixed point. By contrast,
in the parallel regime, the percentage of initial configurations reaching a
fixed point (for the same networks) is dramatically smaller. We contrast the
results of the simulations on scale-free networks with the classical
Erdos-Renyi model of random networks. Everything indicates that scale-free
networks are extremely robust. Finally, we study the mean and maximum time/work

distinctive infrared deficit around 10 microns in their Spectral Energy
Distributions (SED), recently measured by the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph
(IRS), suggesting dust depletion in the inner regions. These disks have been
confirmed to have giant central cavities by imaging of the submillimeter
(sub-mm) continuum emission using the Submillimeter Array (SMA). However, the
polarized near-infrared scattered light images for most objects in a systematic
IRS/SMA cross sample, obtained by HiCIAO on the Subaru telescope, show no
evidence for the cavity, in clear contrast with SMA and Spitzer observations.
Radiative transfer modeling indicates that many of these scattered light images
are consistent with a smooth spatial distribution for micron-sized grains, with
little discontinuity in the surface density of the micron-sized grains at the
cavity edge. Here we present a generic disk model that can simultaneously
account for the general features in IRS, SMA, and Subaru observations.
Particularly, the scattered light images for this model are computed, which
agree with the general trend seen in Subaru data. Decoupling between the
spatial distributions of the micron-sized dust and mm-sized dust inside the
cavity is suggested by the model, which, if confirmed, necessitates a
mechanism, such as dust filtration, for differentiating the small and big dust
in the cavity clearing process. Our model also suggests an inwardly increasing
gas-to-dust-ratio in the inner disk, and different spatial distributions for
the small dust inside and outside the cavity, echoing the predictions in grain
coagulation and growth models.

the ages of field stars, assuming the attendant uncertainties to this technique
can be well characterized. We model stellar angular momentum evolution starting
with a rotation distribution from open cluster M37. Our predicted
rotation-mass-age relationship shows significant zero-point offsets compared to
an alternative angular momentum loss law and published gyrochronology
relations. Systematic errors at the 30 percent level are permitted by current
data, highlighting the need for empirical guidance. We identify two fundamental
sources of uncertainty that limit the precision of rotation-based ages and
quantify their impact. Stars are born with a range of rotation rates, which
leads to an age range at fixed rotation period. We find that the inherent
ambiguity from the initial conditions is important for all young stars, and
remains large for old stars below 0.6 solar masses. Latitudinal surface
differential rotation also introduces a minimum uncertainty into rotation
period measurements and, by extension, rotation-based ages. Both models and the
data from binary star systems 61 Cyg and alpha Cen demonstrate that latitudinal
differential rotation is the limiting factor for rotation-based age precision
among old field stars, inducing uncertainties at the ~2 Gyr level. We also
examine the relationship between variability amplitude, rotation period, and
age. Existing ground-based surveys can detect field populations with ages as
old as 1-2 Gyr, while space missions can detect stars as old as the Galactic
disk. In comparison with other techniques for measuring the ages of lower main
sequence stars, including geometric parallax and asteroseismology,
rotation-based ages have the potential to be the most precise chronometer for

photon interactions has the exponential scaling $\Gamma\sim\Gamma_{CDL}^{2}$,
where $\Gamma_{CDL}$ is the Coleman-de Luccia decay rate neglecting photon
interactions. For the lowest metastable initial state an efficient quantum Zeno
effect occurs due to thermal radiation of temperatures as low as the de Sitter

interactions with light external mode. We argue that efficient decoherence does
not occur for the case of Hawking-Moss decay. This observation is consistent
with requirements set by Poincare recurrence in de Sitter space.

to SM flavor via ""Flavor Mediation"". The SM contains an anomaly-free SU(3)

Third-generation scalar masses are suppressed due to the dominant breaking of
the flavor gauge symmetry in the top direction. More subtly, the
first-two-generation scalars remain highly degenerate due to a custodial U(2)
symmetry, where the SU(2) factor arises because SU(3) is rank two. This
custodial symmetry is broken only at order (m_c/m_t)^2. SUSY gauge coupling
unification predictions are preserved, since no new charged matter is
introduced, the SM gauge structure is unaltered, and the flavor symmetry treats
all matter multiplets equally. Moreover, the uniqueness of the anomaly-free

which has been mostly consumed by star formation in the meantime. We start at
the time when the separation between two SMBHs is ~ 700 pc and the two black
holes are still embedded in their galaxy cusps. We use 3 million particles to
study the formation and evolution of the SMBH binary till it becomes hard.
After a hard binary is formed, we reduce (reselect) the particles to 1.15
million and follow the subsequent shrinking of the SMBH binary due to 3-body
encounters with the stars. We find approximately constant hardening rates and
that the SMBH binary rapidly develops a high eccentricity. Similar hardening
rates and eccentricity values are reported in earlier studies of SMBH binary
evolution in the merging of dissipation-less spherical galaxy models. The
estimated coalescence time is ~ 2.9 Gyr, significantly smaller than a Hubble
time. We discuss why this timescale should be regarded as an upper limit. Since
1:10 mergers are among the most common interaction events for galaxies at all

M*, halo mass Mh, density over the nearest N neighbours deltaN, and distance to
the halo centre D. The fraction of quenched galaxies appears more strongly
correlated with Mh at fixed M* than with M* at fixed Mh, while for satellites
quenching also depends on D. We present the M*-Mh relation for centrals at z~1.
At z~1, the dependence of quenching on M* at fixed Mh is somewhat more
pronounced than at z~0, but the quenched fraction is low (10%) and the haloes
are less massive. For satellites, M*-dependent quenching is noticeable at high
D, suggesting a quenching dependence on sub-halo mass for recently captured
satellites. At small D, where satellites likely fell in more than a few Gyr
ago, quenching strongly depends on Mh, and not on M*. The Mh-dependence of
quenching is consistent with theoretical wisdom where virial shock heating in
massive haloes shuts down accretion and triggers ram-pressure stripping,
causing quenching. The interpretation of deltaN is complicated by the fact that
it depends on the number of observed group members compared to N, motivating
the use of D as a better measure of local environment.

is approximately twice as large as for\sim 3 GeV CR electrons, corresponding to
a spatial diffusion coefficient that is \sim 4 times higher, scaling as
(R/GV)^{\delta} with \delta \approx 0.7-0.8 depending on the smearing kernel
used in the correlation analysis. This value is in agreement with the results
found by extending the correlation analysis to include \sim 70 GeV CR nuclei
traced by the 3-10 GeV gamma-ray data (\delta \approx 0.66+/-0.23). Using the

track. The speed of ejection of this matter, compared to the velocity
dispersion (sigma) of the host galaxy's core, determines whether the ejected

advantages of quantum information processing, including universal quantum
computation, reduction of communication complexity or secret key distribution.
However, computational models have been discovered, which consume very little
or no entanglement and still can efficiently solve certain problems thought to
be classically intractable. The existence of these models suggests that
separable or weakly entangled states could be extremely useful tools for
quantum information processing as they are much easier to prepare and control
even in dissipative environments. It has been proposed that a requirement for
useful quantum states is the generation of so-called quantum discord, a measure
of non-classical correlations that includes entanglement as a subset. Although
a link between quantum discord and few quantum information tasks has been
studied, its role in computation speed-up is still open and its operational
interpretation remains restricted to only few somewhat contrived situations.
Here we show that quantum discord is the optimal resource for the remote
quantum state preparation, a variant of the quantum teleportation protocol.
Using photonic quantum systems, we explicitly show that the geometric measure
of quantum discord is related to the fidelity of this task, which provides an
operational meaning. Moreover, we demonstrate that separable states with
non-zero quantum discord can outperform entangled states. Therefore, the role
of quantum discord might provide fundamental insights for resource-efficient
quantum information processing.

unusually massive black holes relative to their low stellar mass. The observed
black hole-to-bulge mass ratios of NGC4342 and NGC4291 are ~6.9% and ~1.9%,
respectively, which significantly exceed the typical observed ratio of ~0.2%.
As a consequence of the exceedingly large black hole-to-bulge mass ratios,
NGC4342 and NGC4291 are ~5.1 sigma and ~3.4 sigma outliers from the M_BH -
M_bulge scaling relation, respectively. In this paper, we explore the origin of
the unusually high black hole-to-bulge mass ratio. Based on Chandra X-ray
observations of the hot gas content of NGC4342 and NGC4291, we compute
gravitating mass profiles, and conclude that both galaxies reside in massive
dark matter halos, which extend well beyond the stellar light. The presence of
dark matter halos around NGC4342 and NGC4291 and a deep optical image of the
environment of NGC4342 indicate that tidal stripping, in which >90% of the
stellar mass was lost, cannot explain the observed high black hole-to-bulge
mass ratios. Therefore, we conclude that these galaxies formed with low stellar
masses, implying that the bulge and black hole did not grow in tandem. We also
find that the black hole mass correlates well with the properties of the dark
matter halo, suggesting that dark matter halos may play a major role in
regulating the growth of the supermassive black holes.

brightness edge to the northeast and a trailing tail. We identify the edge as a
cold front and conclude that the distorted morphology of the hot gas is
produced by ram pressure as NGC4342 moves through external gas. From the
thermal pressure ratios inside and outside the cold front, we estimate the
velocity of NGC4342 and find that it moves supersonically (M~2.6) towards the

thermal carbon and silicate particles. Using the fact that optical light echo
spectroscopy has established that Cas A originated from a type IIb supernova
explosion showing an optical spectrum remarkably similar to the prototypical
type IIb SN 1993J, we use the latter to construct template data input for our
simulations. We are then able to reproduce the recorded infrared echo spectrum
by combining the emission of dust heated by the UV burst produced at the shock
breakout after the core-collapse and dust heated by optical light emitted near
the visual maximum of the supernova light curve, where the UV burst and optical
light curve characteristics are based on SN 1993J. We find a mean density of
\sim680 H cm^{-3} for the echo region, with a size of a few light years across.
We also find evidence of dust processing in the form of a lack of small PAHs
with less than \sim300 carbon atoms, consistent with a scenario of PAHs
destruction by the UV burst via photodissociation at the estimated distance of
the echo region from Cas A. Furthermore, our simulations suggest that the weak
11 {\mu}m features of our recorded infrared echo spectrum are consistent with a
strong dehydrogenated state of the PAHs. This exploratory study highlights the
potential of investigating dust processing in the interstellar medium through
infrared echoes.

axially applied RF fields are inconsistent with the plasma response being due
to local resonant heating of electrons in the plasma. Instead, our results are

substantial deformations near the contact line. On liquid substrates, this is
captured by Neumann's classic analysis, which provides a geometrical
construction for minimising the interfacial free energy. On soft solids, the
total free energy includes an additional contribution from elasticity. A
linear-elastic model incorporating an out-of-plane restoring force due to solid
surface tension was recently shown to accurately predict the equilibrium shape
of a thin elastic film due to a large sessile droplet. Here, we extend this
model to find substrate deformations due to droplets of arbitrary size. While
the macroscopic contact angle matches Young's law for large droplets, it
matches Neumann's prediction for small droplets. The cross-over droplet size is
roughly given by the ratio of the solid's surface tension and elastic modulus.
At this cross-over, the macroscopic contact angle increases, indicating that
the substrate is effectively less wetting. For droplets of all sizes, the
microscopic behaviour near the contact line follows the Neumann construction
giving local force balance.

GEMINI/GMOS-N and HST/ACS. We measure integrated photometry from the GMOS g'
and r' images (for 531 galaxies) and surface photometry from the HST F625W
image (for 43 galaxies) as well as velocities and velocity dispersions from the
GMOS spectra (for 71 galaxies). We construct the Kormendy relation (KR),
Faber-Jackson relation (FJR) and colour-magnitude relation (CMR) for early-type
galaxies in Abell 1689 using this data and compare them to those of the Coma
cluster. We measure the intrinsic scatter of the CMR in Abell 1689 to be 0.054
\pm 0.004 mag which places degenerate constraints on the ratio of the assembly
timescale to the time available (beta) and the age of the population. Making
the assumption that galaxies in Abell 1689 will evolve into those of Coma over
an interval of 2.26 Gyr breaks this degeneracy and limits beta to be > 0.6 and
the age of the red sequence to be > 5.5 Gyr (formed at z > 0.55). Without
corrections for size evolution but accounting for magnitude cuts and selection
effects, the KR & FJR are inconsistent and disagree at the 2 sigma level
regarding the amount of luminosity evolution in the last 2.26 Gyr. However,
after correcting for size evolution the KR & FJR show similar changes in
luminosity (0.22 \pm 0.11 mag) that are consistent with the passive evolution
of the stellar populations from a single burst of star formation 10.2 \pm 3.3
Gyr ago (z = 1.8+inf-0.9). Thus the changes in the KR, FJR & CMR of Abell 1689
relative to Coma all agree and suggest old galaxy populations with little or no
synchronisation in the star formation histories. Furthermore, the weak evidence
for size evolution in the cluster environment in the last 2.26 Gyr places
interesting constraints on the possible mechanisms at work, favouring
harassment or secular processes over merger scenarios.

are associated with the lepton mass ratios. Some typical patterns of U_0 are
reexamined by constraining their respective perturbations with current
experimental data. We illustrate a few possible ways to minimally correct U_0
in order to fit the observed values of three mixing angles. We point out that
the structure of U may exhibit an approximate \mu-\tau permutation symmetry in
modulus, and reiterate the geometrical description of CP violation in terms of
the leptonic unitarity triangles. The salient features of nine distinct
parametrizations of U are summarized, and its Wolfenstein-like expansion is
presented by taking U_0 to be the democratic mixing pattern.

legitimate users to redirection proxies while preventing censors, posing as
insiders, from discovering their addresses and blocking them. We propose a new
framework for censorship-resistant web browsing called {\it CensorSpoofer} that
addresses this challenge by exploiting the asymmetric nature of web browsing
traffic and making use of IP spoofing. CensorSpoofer de-couples the upstream
and downstream channels, using a low-bandwidth indirect channel for delivering
outbound requests (URLs) and a high-bandwidth direct channel for downloading
web content. The upstream channel hides the request contents using
steganographic encoding within email or instant messages, whereas the
downstream channel uses IP address spoofing so that the real address of the
proxies is not revealed either to legitimate users or censors. We built a
proof-of-concept prototype that uses encrypted VoIP for this downstream channel
and demonstrated the feasibility of using the CensorSpoofer framework in a
realistic environment.

shows erratic dips in its X-ray light curve. The power density spectra and the
corresponding energy spectra were extracted and analyzed for the dip and

changes into type-A QPO in a few tens of seconds along with a flux decrease.
This transient evolution is accompanied with a significant spectral variation.

as the relationships between these parameters. Eight more confirmed GCs in the
halo of M31 were observed, most of which lack the spectroscopic information
before. These star clusters are located far from the galactic center at a
projected radius of ~14 to ~117 kpc. The Lick absorption-line indices and the
radial velocities have been measured and ages, metallicities [Fe/H] and
alpha-element [alpha/Fe] have also been fitted by comparing the observed
spectral feature indices and Thomas et al.SSP model. Our results show that most
of the star clusters of our sample are older than 10 Gyr except B290 ~5.5 Gyr,
and most of them are metal-poor with the metallicity [Fe/H]<-1, suggesting that
these clusters were born at the early stage of the galaxy's formation. We find
that the metallicity gradient for the outer halo clusters with r_p>25 kpc may
not exist with a slope of -0.005+-0.005 dex kpc^-1. We also find that the
metallicity is not a function of age for the GCs with age < 7 Gyr while for the
old GCs with age >7 Gyr there seems to be a trend that the older ones have
lower metallicity. Besides, We plot metallicity distributions with the largest
sample of M31 GCs so far and it shows the bimodality is not significant and the
number of the metal-poor and metal-rich groups becomes comparable. The spatial
distributions shows that the metal-rich group is more centrally concentrated
while the metal-poor group is occupy a more extended halo and the young
population is centrally concentrated while the old population is more extended

astrophysical disks whose mean states are baroclinic. In particular, we seek to
demonstrate the potential existence of traditional baroclinic instabilities of
meteorological studies in a simplified two-layer Philips Disk Model. Each disk
layer is of constant but differing densities. The resulting mean azimuthal
velocity profile shows a variation in the vertical direction implying that the
system is baroclinic in the mean state. The stability of the system is treated
in the context of disk shallow water theory wherein azimuthal disturbances are
much longer than the corresponding radial or vertical scales. The normal-mode
problem is solved numerically using two different methods. The results of a
symmetric single layer barotropic model is considered and it is found that
instability persists for models in which the potential vorticity profiles are
not symmetric, consistent with previous results. The instaiblity is interpreted
in terms of interacting Rossby waves. For a two layer system in which the flow
is fundamentally baroclinic we report here that instability takes on the form
of mixed barotropic-baroclinic type: instability occurs but it qualitatively
follows the pattern of instability found in the barotropic models. Instability
arises because of the phase locking and interaction of the Rossby waves between
the two layers. The strength of the instability weakens as the density contrast
between layers increases. (For full abstract see article.)

two different groups by two characteristic evolution patterns of helicity
injection in their source active regions which appeared for about 0.5-4.5 days

of helicity (Group A; 30 CMEs in 23 active regions) and (2) a pattern of
significant helicity injection followed by its sign reversal (Group B; 17 CMEs
in 5 active regions). We also found that CME speed has a correlation with
average helicity injection rate with linear correlation coefficients of 0.85
and 0.63 for Group A and Group B, respectively. In addition, these two CME
groups show different characteristics as follows: (1) the average CME speed of
Group B (1330km/s) is much faster than that of Group A (870km/s), (2) the CMEs
in Group A tend to be single events, whereas those in Group B mainly consist of
successive events, and (3) flares related to the CMEs in Group B are relatively

these trends are simply caused by the fact that AGN-host galaxies are on
average more massive and redder than non-AGN galaxies because the fraction of
strong-barred galaxies ($\bfrsbo$) increases with $u-r$ color and stellar
velocity dispersion. When $u-r$ color and velocity dispersion (or stellar mass)

redshift z), can provide a worst-case error <=1 per cent (for z<=2) fit to the
non-linear matter power spectrum deduced through N-body simulations, for modes
up to k<=0.7 h/Mpc. Our power spectrum interpolator is accurate over the entire

be an extremely quick and reliable tool in interpreting cosmological

HaloFit and use them as mock observations to train the ANN. This work sets the

compute the non-linear matter power spectra at sub-per cent accuracy, in the

of a medium-size (kT ~3 keV) cluster out to the virial radius. Two observations
were conducted, north-west and north-east offsets, which continue in a filament
direction and a void direction of the large-scale structure of the Universe,
respectively. The X-ray emission and distribution of galaxies elongate in the
filament direction. The temperature profiles in the two directions are mostly
consistent with each other within the error bars and drop to 1.5 keV at 1.5
r_500. As observed by Suzaku in hot clusters, the entropy profile becomes
flatter beyond r_500, in disagreement with the r^1.1 relationship that is
expected from accretion shock heating models. When scaled with the average
intracluster medium (ICM) temperature, the entropy profiles of clusters
observed with Suzaku are universal and do not depend on system mass. The
hydrostatic mass values in the void and filament directions are in good
agreement, and the Navarro, Frenk, and White universal mass profile represents
the hydrostatic mass distribution up to ~ 2 r_500. Beyond r_500, the ratio of
gas mass to hydrostatic mass exceeds the result of the Wilkinson microwave
anisotropy probe, and at r_100, these ratios in the filament and void
directions reach 0.4 and 0.3, respectively. We discuss possible deviations from
hydrostatic equilibrium at cluster outskirts. We derived radial profiles of the
gasmass- to-light ratio and iron-mass-to-light ratio out to the virial radius.
Within r_500, the iron-mass-to-light ratio of the Hydra A cluster was compared

proving explicitly that, in contrast to claims made previously in literature,
Nambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken global color symmetry remain

as a system of point charges (electrons and nuclei) is analyzed. First, in the
historical context, the solutions of different fundamental problems, such as
the divergence of the partition function, elaborated by Herzfeld, Planck,
Brillouin and Rompe - most of the relevant papers published in the Annalen der
Physik, are discussed. Beyond this, the modern state of art is presented and
new results are given which explain, why bound states according to a discrete
part of the spectra occur only in a valley in the temperature-density plane.
Based on the actual state of the quantum statistics of Coulomb systems, virial
expansions within the canonical ensemble and the grand ensemble and
combinations are derived. The following transitions along isotherms are
studied: (i) the formation of bound states occurring by increasing the density
from low to moderate values, (ii) the disappearance of bound state effects at
higher densities due to medium effects. Within the physical picture we
calculate isotherms of pressure for Hydrogen in a broad density region and show
that in the region between $20\, 000$ K and $100\, 000$ K and particle
densities below $10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ the cross-over from full to partial

first-principles modelling of chemisorption of the hydrogen, fluorine, oxygen

compression, chemisorption of the single hydrogen, fluorine or hydroxyl group
is energetically more favourable than those of their pairs on different
sublattices. This behaviour stabilizes the magnetism caused by the
chemisorption being against its destruction by the pair formations. Initially
flat, compressed graphene is shown to buckle spontaneously right after
chemisorption of single adatoms. Unlike hydrogenation or fluorination, the
oxidation process turns from the endothermic to exothermic for all types of the

useful in designing graphene devices utilizing functionalization as well as

as ""short necklace states"". In this work, we define the essential quantities
and then, based on these quantities, we investigate the short necklace states'
properties statistically and quantitatively. Two different approaches are
utilized and the results from them agree with each other very well. In the
first approach, the typical plateau-width and the typical order of short
necklace states are obtained from the correlation function of logarithmic
transmission. In the second approach, we investigate statistical distributions
of the peak/plateau-width measured in logarithmic transmission spectra. A novel
distribution is found, which can be exactly fitted by the summation of two
Gaussian distributions. These two distributions are the results of sharp peaks
of localized states and the high plateaus of short necklace states. The center
of the second distribution also tells us the typical plateau-width of short
necklace states. With increasing the system length, the scaling property of
typical plateau-width is very special since it almost does not decrease. The
methods and the quantities defined in this work can be widely used on Anderson

spin-gap transition arises at $|U_{\rm c}|\sim W$ ($W$: band width) from a
Fermi liquid to a spin-gapped state, which is conductive through hopping of
doublons. In the SC state, we confirm by analysis of various quantities that
the mechanism of superconductivity undergoes a smooth crossover at around
$|U_{\ma{co}}|\sim |U_{\rm c}|$ from a BCS type to a Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) type, as $|U|/t$ increases. For $|U|<|U_{\ma{co}}|$, quantities such as
the condensation energy, a SC correlation function and the condensate fraction
of onsite pairs exhibit behavior of $\sim \exp(-t/|U|)$, as expected from the
BCS theory. For $|U|>|U_{\ma{co}}|$, quantities such as the energy gain in the
SC transition and superfluid stiffness, which is related to the cost of phase
coherence, behave as $\sim t^2/|U|\propto T_{\rm c}$, as expected in a bosonic
scheme. In this regime, the SC transition is induced by a gain in kinetic
energy, in contrast with the BCS theory. We refer to the relevance to the

X-ray Binary (LMXB) EXO 0748-676 simultaneous with the thermonuclear X-ray
bursts. The X-ray and the optical bursts are detected in a long observation of
this source with the XMM-Newton observatory. This has increased the number of
thermonuclear X-ray bursts in the LMXBs with simultaneous optical detection by
several factors. The optical bursts are found to have a linear rise followed by
a slow, somewhat exponential decay. Most of the optical bursts have longer rise
and decay timescale compared to the corresponding X-ray bursts. We have
determined the X-ray and optical excess photon counts in the bursts that allow
us to look at the optical to X-ray burst fluence ratio for each burst and the
ratio as a function of the X-ray burst intensity and as a function of the
orbital phase. The delay between the onset of the X-ray bursts and the onset of
the optical bursts have also been measured and is found to have an average
value of 3.25 seconds. We do not find any convincing evidence of orbital phase
dependence of the following parameters: X-ray to optical delay, rise time of
the optical bursts, and optical to X-ray burst intensity ratio as would be
expected if the optical bursts were produced by reprocessing from the surface
of the secondary star that is facing the compact star. On the other hand, if
the optical bursts are produced by reprocessing of the X-rays in the accretion
disk, the onset of the bursts is not expected to have a sharp, linear shape as
is observed in a few of the bursts in EXO 0748-676. We emphasise the fact that
simultaneous optical observations of the X-ray bursts in multiple wavelength
bands will enable further detailed investigations of the reprocessing
phenomena, including any non-linear effect of the X-ray irradiation.

heterogeneities in a model glass-forming liquid, the Wahnstrom mixture. A novel
cluster-based approach is used to detect local energy minimum polyhedral
clusters and local crystalline environments. A structure-specific time
correlation function is then devised to determine their temporal stability. For
our system, the lifetime correlation function for icosahedral clusters decays
far slower than for those of similarly sized but topologically distinct
clusters. Upon cooling, the icosahedra form domains of increasing size and
their lifetime increases with the size of the domains. Furthermore, these
long-lived domains lower the mobility of neighboring particles. These
structured domains show correlations with the slow regions of the dynamical
heterogeneities that form on cooling towards the glass transition. Although
icosahedral clusters with a particular composition and arrangement of large and
small particles are structural elements of the crystal, we find that most
icosahedral clusters lack such order in composition and arrangement and thus
local crystalline ordering makes only a limited contribution to this process.
Finally, we characterize the spatial correlation of the domains of icosahedra
by two structural correlation lengths and compare them with the four-point
dynamic correlation length. All the length scales increase upon cooling, but in
different ways.

high-quality constraints on solar-like pulsators. Among the seismic parameters,
mode damping rates remains poorly understood and thus barely used to infer
physical properties of stars. Nevertheless, thanks to CoRoT and {\it Kepler}
space-crafts it is now possible to measure damping rates for hundreds of
main-sequence and thousands of red-giant stars with an unprecedented precision.
  By using a non-adiabatic pulsation code including a time-dependent convection
treatment, we compute damping rates for stellar models representative for
solar-like pulsators from the main-sequence to the red-giant phase. This allows
us to reproduce the observations of both CoRoT and {\it Kepler}, which
validates our modeling of mode damping rates and thus the underlying physical
mechanisms included in the modeling. Actually, by considering the perturbations
of turbulent pressure and entropy (including perturbation of the dissipation
rate of turbulent energy into heat) by the oscillation in our computation, we
succeed in reproducing the observed relation between damping rates and
effective temperature.
  Moreover, we discuss the physical reasons for mode damping rates to scale
with effective temperature, as observationally exhibited. Finally, this opens
the way for the use of mode damping rates to probe turbulent convection in
solar-like stars.

control of stabilizing the system towards a desired point. With the proposed

shown to be input-output simulated by the rectangular transition system of the

the controller synthesis of the multi-affine system for LTL specifications is
achieved by designing a nonblocking supervisor for the abstracted transition

with two kinds of non-perturbative effects: (i) standard Kahler
moduli-dependent non-perturbative effects from gaugino condensation on
D7-branes or E3-instantons wrapping four-cycles in the geometric regime; (ii)
dilaton-dependent non-perturbative effects from gaugino condensation on
space-time filling D3-branes or E(-1)-instantons at singularities. For the
LARGE Volume Scenario (LVS), the new dilaton-dependent non-perturbative effects
provide a positive definite contribution to the scalar potential that can be
arbitrarily tuned from fluxes to give rise to de Sitter vacua. Contrary to anti
D3-branes at warped throats, this term arises from a manifestly supersymmetric
effective action. In this new scenario the ""uplifting"" term comes from F-terms
of blow-up modes resolving the singularity of the non-perturbative quiver. We
discuss phenomenological and cosmological implications of this mechanism. This
set-up also allows a realisation of the LVS for manifolds with zero or positive
Euler number.

attributes of the ""optical chirality density"", one of several measures long
known to be conserved quantities for a vacuum electromagnetic field. The
analysis lends insights into some recent interpretations of chiroptical
experiments, in which this measure, and an associated chirality flux, have been
treated as representing physically distinctive ""superchiral"" phenomena. In the
fully quantized formalism the chirality density is promoted to operator status,
whose exploration with reference to an arbitrary polarization basis reveals
relationships to optical angular momentum and helicity operators. Analyzing
multi-mode beams with complex wave-front structures, notably Laguerre-Gaussian
modes, affords a deeper understanding of the interplay between optical
chirality and optical angular momentum. By developing theory with due
cognizance of the photonic character of light, it emerges that only the spin
angular momentum of light is engaged in such observations. Furthermore, it is
shown that these prominent measures of the helicity of chiral electromagnetic
radiation have a common basis, in differences between the populations of
optical modes associated with angular momenta of opposite sign. Using a
calculation of the rate of circular dichroism as an example, with coherent
states to model the electromagnetic field, it is discovered that two terms
contribute to the differential effect. The primary contribution relates to the
difference in left- and right- handed photon populations; the only other
contribution, which displays a sinusoidal distance-dependence, corresponding to
the claim of nodal enhancements, is connected with the quantum photon
number-phase uncertainty relation. From the full analysis, it appears that the
term ""superchiral"" can be considered redundant.

discord in two-qubit systems and then describe the following experimental
studies: (a) We quantitatively measure discord for Werner-like states prepared
using an entangling pulse sequence. An initial thermal state with zero discord
is gradually and periodically transformed into a mixed state with maximum
discord. The experimental and simulated behavior of rise and fall of discord
agree fairly well. (b) We examine the efficiency of dynamical decoupling
sequences in preserving quantum correlations. In our experimental setup, the
dynamical decoupling sequences preserved the traceless parts of the density
matrices at high fidelity. But they could not maintain the purity of the
quantum states and so were unable to keep the discord from decaying. (c) We
observe the evolution of discord for a singlet-triplet mixed state during a
radio-frequency spin-lock. A simple relaxation model describes the evolution of
discord, and the accompanying evolution of fidelity of the long-lived singlet
state, reasonably well.

for K transmitter-receiver pair multiple-input single-output (MISO) and

constraints are relaxed so that some predetermined interference leakage to
undesired receivers is allowed in order to increase the beam design space for
larger rates than those of the zero-forcing (ZF) scheme or to make beam design
feasible when ZF is impossible. In the MISO case, it is shown that the
rate-maximizing beam vector under the RZF framework for a given set of
interference leakage levels can be obtained by sequential orthogonal projection
combining (SOPC). Based on this, exact and approximate closed-form solutions
are provided in two-user and three-user cases, respectively, and an efficient
beam design algorithm for RZF coordinated beamforming is provided in general
cases. Furthermore, the rate control problem under the RZF framework is

proposed to control the position of the designed rate-tuple in the achievable

the three-dimensional space. Areostationary orbits are expected to be used to
establish a future telecommunication network for the exploration of Mars.
However, no artificial satellites have been placed in these orbits thus far. In
this paper, the characteristics of the Martian gravity field are presented, and
areostationary points and their linear stability are calculated. By taking
linearized solutions in the planar case as the initial guesses and utilizing
the Levenberg-Marquardt method, families of periodic orbits around
areostationary points are shown to exist. Short-period orbits and long-period
orbits are found around linearly stable areostationary points, and only
short-period orbits are found around unstable areostationary points. Vertical
periodic orbits around both linearly stable and unstable areostationary points
are also examined. Satellites in these periodic orbits could depart from
areostationary points by a few degrees in longitude, which would facilitate
observation of the Martian topography. Based on the eigenvalues of the
monodromy matrix, the evolution of the stability index of periodic orbits is
determined. Finally, heteroclinic orbits connecting the two unstable
areostationary points are found, providing the possibility for orbital transfer
with minimal energy consumption.

equation is formulated in terms of time-dependent perturbation theory for the
Green's functions and general expressions for the response functions up to
third order in the external field are given. The nonlinear response is
calculated for a model of dipole reorientations in an asymmetric double well
potential, a standard model in the field of dielectric spectroscopy. The static
nonlinear response is finite with the exception of a certain temperature $T_0$
determined by the value of the asymmetry. In a narrow temperature range around
$T_0$, the modulus of the frequency-dependent cubic response shows a peak at a
frequency on the order of the relaxation rate and it vanishes for both, low
frequencies and high frequencies. At temperatures at which the static response
is finite (lower and higher than $T_0$), the modulus is found to decay
monotonously from the static limit to zero at high frequencies. In addition,
results of calculations for a trap model with a Gaussian density of states are
presented. In this case, the cubic response depends on the specific dynamical
variable considered and also on the way the external field is coupled to the
kinetics of the model. In particular, a set of different dynamical variables is
considered that gives rise to identical shapes of the linear susceptibility and
only to different temperature dependencies of the relaxation times. It is found
that the frequency dependence of the nonlinear response functions, however,
strongly depends on the particular choice of the variables. The results are
discussed in the context of recent theoretical and experimental findings
regarding the nonlinear response of supercooled liquids and glasses.

boundaries"" (i.e., ones that impose a periodicity along the slit) is studied by
Monte Carlo simulations. When the distance D between the confining walls is
reduced at constant particle number from an initial value D_0, for which a
crystalline structure commensurate with the imposed periodicity fits, to
smaller values, a succession of phase transitions to imperfectly ordered
structures occur. These structures have a reduced number of rows parallel to
the boundaries (from n to n-1 to n-2 etc.) and are accompanied by an almost
periodic strain pattern, due to ""soliton staircases"" along the boundaries.
Since standard simulation studies of such transitions are hampered by huge
hysteresis effects, we apply the phase switch Monte Carlo method to estimate
the free energy difference between the structures as a function of the misfit
between D and D_0, thereby locating where the transitions occurs in
equilibrium. For comparison, we also obtain this free energy difference from a
thermodynamic integration method: the results agree, but the effort required to
obtain the same accuracy as provided by phase switch Monte Carlo would be at
least three orders of magnitude larger. We also show for a situation where
several ""candidate structures"" exist for a phase, that phase switch Monte Carlo
can clearly distinguish the metastable structures from the stable one. Finally,
applying the method in the conjugate statistical ensemble (where the normal
pressure conjugate to D is taken as an independent control variable) we show
that the standard equivalence between the conjugate ensembles of statistical

three kinds of harmonic mechanical forcing: tides, precession/nutation, and
libration. These forcings can generate flows in internal fluid layers, such as
fluid cores and subsurface oceans, whose dynamics then significantly differ
from solid body rotation. In particular, tides in non-synchronized bodies and
libration in synchronized ones are known to be capable of exciting the
so-called elliptical instability, i.e. a generic instability corresponding to
the destabilization of two-dimensional flows with elliptical streamlines,
leading to three-dimensional turbulence. We aim here at confirming the
relevance of such an elliptical instability in terrestrial bodies by
determining its growth rate, as well as its consequences on energy dissipation,
on magnetic field induction, and on heat flux fluctuations on planetary scales.
Previous studies and theoretical results for the elliptical instability are
re-evaluated and extended to cope with an astrophysical context. In particular,
generic analytical expressions of the elliptical instability growth rate are
obtained using a local WKB approach, simultaneously considering for the first
time (i) a local temperature gradient due to an imposed temperature contrast
across the considered layer or to the presence of a volumic heat source and
(ii) an imposed magnetic field along the rotation axis, coming from an external
source. The theoretical results are applied to the telluric planets and moons
of the solar system as well as to three Super-Earths: 55 CnC e, CoRoT-7b, and
GJ 1214b. For the tide-driven elliptical instability in non-synchronized
bodies, only the Early Earth core is shown to be clearly unstable. For the
libration-driven elliptical instability in synchronized bodies, the core of Io
is shown to be stable, contrary to previously thoughts, whereas Europa, 55 CnC
e, CoRoT-7b and GJ 1214b cores can be unstable. The subsurface ocean of Europa
is slightly unstable}. However, these present states do not preclude more
unstable situations in the past.

not only supposed to host the majority of the baryons at low redshifts in the
form of the WHIM, but also to supply forming galaxies at higher redshifts with
a substantial amount of cold gas via cold steams. In order to get insight into
the hydro- and thermodynamical characteristics of these structures, we
performed a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Instead of analyzing
extensive simulations of cosmological structure formation, we simulate certain
well-defined structures and study the impact of different physical processes as
well as of the scale dependencies. In this paper, we continue our work from
Klar & M\""ucket (2010), and extend our simulations into three dimensions.
Instead of a pancake structure, we now obtain a configuration consisting of
well-defined sheets, filaments, and a gaseous halo. We use a set of
simulations, parametrized by the length of the initial perturbation L, to
obtain detailed information on the state of the gas and its evolution inside
the filament. For L > 4 Mpc, we obtain filaments which are fully confined by an
accretion shock. Additionally, they exhibit an isothermal core, which
temperature is balanced by radiative cooling and heating due to the UV
background. This indicates on a multiphase structure for the medium temperature
WHIM. We obtain scaling relations for the main quantities of this core. In the
vicinity of the halo, the filament's core can be attributed to the cold streams
found in cosmological hydro-simulations. Thermal conduction can lead to a
complete evaporation of the cold stream for L > 6 Mpc/h. This corresponds to
halos more massive than M_halo = 10^13 M_Sun, and implies that star-formation
in more massive galaxies can not be supplied by cold streams. For perturbations
on scales L > 6 Mpc/h the filament does not longer exhibit a cold core.

recently. We studied an analogous particle acceleration process in the Kerr and
Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes without horizon, containing naked singularities.
Further to this, we show here that the particle acceleration and collision
process is in fact independent of blackholes and naked singularities, and can
happen in a fully regular spacetime containing neither of these. We derive the
conditions on the general static spherically symmetric metric for such a
phenomena to happen. We show that in order to have ultra-high energy collisions
it is necessary for the norm of the timelike Killing vector to admit a maximum
with a vanishingly small but a negative value. This is also a condition
implying the presence of a surface with extremely large but nevertheless finite
value of the redshift or blueshift. Conditions to have ultrahigh energy
collisions and regular center imply the violation of strong energy condition
near the center while the weak energy condition is respected in the region
around the center. Thus the central region is surrounded by a dark energy
fluid. Both the energy conditions are respected at the location where the high
energy collisions take place. As a concrete example we then investigate the
acceleration process in the spacetime geometry derived by Bardeen which is

applies SExtractor, while GALFIT is incorporated for modelling Sersic profiles.
It measures the background sky involved in the Sersic fitting by means of a

incorporates a complex sorting mechanism and makes use of modern CPU's

automatically removes multiple entries from identical sources. GALAPAGOS is
programmed in the Interactive Data Language, IDL. We test the stability and the
ability to properly recover structural parameters extensively with artificial

accomplished by building a web platform in which human groups interact to both
respond to questions likely to help predict a behavioral outcome and pose new

carbon-oxygen white dwarf in close binary systems. In the single-degenerate
scenario (SDS), the companion star is non-degenerate and can be significantly
affected by the explosion. We explore this interaction by means of
multi-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations using the FLASH code. We
consider several different companion types, including main-sequence-like stars
(MS), red giants (RG), and helium stars (He). In addition, we include the
symmetry-breaking effects of orbital motion, rotation of the non-degenerate
star, and Roche-lobe overflow. A detailed study of a sub-grid model for Type Ia
supernovae is also presented. We find that the dependence of the unbound
stellar mass and kick velocity on the initial binary separation can be fitted
by power-law relations. By using the tracer particles in FLASH, the process
leading to the unbinding of matter is dominated by ablation, which has usually
been neglected in past analytical studies. The level of Ni/Fe contamination of
the companion that results from the passage of the supernova ejecta is found to
be a $\sim 10^{-5} M_{\odot}$ for the MS star, $\sim 10^{-4} M_{\odot}$ for the
He star, and $\sim 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$ for the RG. The spinning MS companion
star loses about half of its initial angular momentum during the impact,
causing the rotational velocity to drop to a quarter of the original rotational
velocity, suggesting that the Tycho G star is a promising progenitor candidate
in the SDS.

of generalized second law (GSL) of thermodynamics for a system comprising of a
Schwarzschild black accreting a test non-self-gravitating fluid namely phantom
energy in FRW universe, we extend them when the entropy of horizons of black
hole and the cosmological undergo quantum corrections. Two types of such
corrections are relevant here including logarithmic and power-law, while both
are motivated from different theoretical backgrounds. We obtain general
mathematical conditions for the validity of GSL in each case. Further we find
that GSL restricts the mass of black hole for accretion of phantom energy. As
such we obtain upper bounds on the mass of black hole above which the black
hole cannot accrete the phantom fluid, otherwise the GSL is violated.

are \textit{Harmonic, Geometric, Arithmetic, Heronian, Contra-harmonic,
Root-mean square and Centroidal mean}. Some of these means are particular cases
of Gini's (1938) mean of order r and s. In this paper we have established some
proportionality relations having these means. Some inequalities among some of
differences arising due to seven means inequalities are also established.

  thermodynamics",,,,,"physics.gen-ph cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A simple and effective approach to thermodynamics is suggested, which solves
the major difficulties in the traditional presentation of the subject. The
internal energy is introduced from the behavior of deformable bodies, whereas
the importance of keeping in mind the microscopic picture is emphasized. A
straightforward model is used to show that the internal energy depends on the
volume and entropy, from where the relationship between mechanics and
thermodynamics is immediate, mechanics corresponding to isentropic
thermodynamics. The questions of evolution to equilibrium and irreversibility
are studied under the light of the action of the ""dynamic force"", which has a
dissipative character. The present formulation leads to a discussion and
clarification of the physical meaning of various thermodynamic quantities, such
as pressure, temperature, work and heat. The adiabatic piston problem is
analyzed, as a paradigmatic case where the notions of ""adiabatic"" and ""heat
transfer"" are often ill-defined.

implementation of automatic processing is a fascinating field of study, with
various potential applications. The importance of tools for natural language
processing is materialized by the need to have applications that can
effectively treat the vast mass of information available nowadays on electronic
forms. Among these tools, mainly driven by the necessity of a fast writing in
alignment to the actual daily life speed, our interest is on the writing
auditors. The morphological and syntactic properties of Arabic make it a
difficult language to master, and explain the lack in the processing tools for
that language. Among these properties, we can mention: the complex structure of
the Arabic word, the agglutinative nature, lack of vocalization, the
segmentation of the text, the linguistic richness, etc.

applications in reliability analysis and automated reasoning. This paper
represents a method of minimizing Boolean sum of products function with binary
decision diagram and with disjoint sum of product minimization. Due to the
symbolic representation of cubes for large problem instances, the method is
orders of magnitude faster than previous enumerative techniques. But the
quality of the approach largely depends on the variable ordering of the
underlying BDD. The application of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as an
efficient approach for the minimization of Disjoint Sums-of-Products (DSOPs).
DSOPs are a starting point for several applications. The use of BDDs has the
advantage of an implicit representation of terms. Due to this scheme the
algorithm is faster than techniques working on explicit representations and the
application to large circuits that could not be handled so far becomes
possible. Theoretical studies on the influence of the BDDs to the search space
are carried out. In experiments the proposed technique is compared to others.
The results with respect to the size of the resulting DSOP are as good or
better as those of the other techniques.
