nm) and La_0.5Sr_0.5CoO_3 (LSCO) (with size down to 35 nm) in the temperature
range 0.3 K to 5 K and magnetic fields upto 14 T. The transport,
magnetotransport and non-linear conduction (I-V curves) were analysed using the
concept of Spin Polarized Tunnelling in the presence of Coulomb blockade. The
activation energy of transport, \Delta, was used to estimate the tunnelling
distances and the inverse decay length of the tunnelling wave function (\chi)
and the height of the tunnelling barrier (\Phi_B). The magnetotransport data
were used to find out the magnetic field dependences of these tunnelling
parameters. The data taken over a large magnetic field range allowed us to
separate out the MR contributions at low temperatures arising from tunnelling
into two distinct contributions. In LCMO, at low magnetic field, the transport
and the MR are dominated by the spin polarization, while at higher magnetic
field the MR arises from the lowering of the tunnel barrier by the magnetic
field leading to an MR that does not saturate even at 14 T. In contrast, in
LSCO, which does not have substantial spin polarization, the first contribution
at low field is absent, while the second contribution related to the barrier
height persists. The idea of inter-grain tunnelling has been validated by
direct measurements of the non-linear I-V data in this temperature range and
the I-V data was found to be strongly dependent on magnetic field. We made the
important observation that a gap like feature (with magnitude ~ E_C, the
Coulomb charging energy) shows up in the conductance g(V) at low bias for the
systems with smallest nanocrystal size at lowest temperatures (T < 0.7 K). The
gap closes as the magnetic field and the temperature are increased.

from radio to high-energy {\gamma}-rays, we revisit the class of models where
the jet has a uniform conical ballistic structure. We argue that by using
simple developments of these models, in the context of new multi-frequency data
extending to gamma-ray energies, valuable insights may be obtained into the
properties that fully realistic models must ultimately have. In this paper we
consider the synchrotron and synchrotron-self-Compton emission from the jet,
modelling the recent simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of BL Lac. This
is the first time these components have been fitted simultaneously for a blazar
using a conical jet model.
  In the model we evolve the electron population dynamically along the jet
taking into account the synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses. The
inverse-Compton emission is calculated using the Klein-Nishina cross section
and a relativistic transformation into the jet frame, and we explicitly show
the seed photon population. We integrate synchrotron opacity along the line of
sight through the jet plasma, taking into account the emission and opacity of
each section of the jet. In agreement with previous studies of radio emission,
we find that a conical jet model which conserves magnetic energy produces the
characteristic blazar flat radio spectrum, however, we do not require any
fine-tuning of the model to achieve this. Of particular note, in our model fit
to BL Lac--which at ~10^37W is a relatively low jet-power source--we find no
requirement for significant re-acceleration within the jet to explain the
observed spectrum.

landscapes. In this study, we use this framework to model allopatric and
parapatric speciation in networks of communities and focus on the relationship
between speciation, richness, and the spatial structure of communities. We find
a strong opposition between speciation and local richness, with speciation
being more common in isolated communities and local richness being higher in
more connected communities. Unlike previous models, we also find a transition
to a positive relationship between speciation and local richness when dispersal
is low and the number of communities is small. Also, we use several measures of
centrality to characterize the effect of network structure on diversity. The
degree, the simplest measure of centrality, is found to be the best predictor
of local richness and speciation, although it loses some of its predictive
power as connectivity grows. Our framework shows how a simple neutral model can
be combined with network theory to reveal complex relationships between
speciation, richness, and the spatial organization of populations.

disorder to produce charging of some NCs, as electrons are driven to vacate
higher shells of the quantum confinement energy spectrum. This
confinement-driven charging produces a disordered Coulomb landscape throughout
the array and leads to VRH at low temperature. We use a simple computer

fields acquire a mass and a decay width thereby becoming \emph{quasiparticles}.
For bare massless particles non-perturbative infrared radiative corrections
lead to a self-consistent generation of mass, for a quartic self interaction $M
\propto \lambda^{1/4} H$, and for a cubic self-interaction the mass is induced
by the formation of a non-perturbative \emph{condensate} leading to $M \propto
\lambda^{1/3} H^{2/3}$. These radiatively generated masses restore de Sitter
invariance and result in anomalous scaling dimensions of superhorizon
fluctuations. We introduce a generalization of the non-perturbative
Wigner-Weisskopf method to obtain the time evolution of quantum states that
include the self-consistent generation of mass and regulate the infrared
behavior. The infrared divergences are manifest as poles in $\Delta=M^2/3H^2$
in the single particle self-energies, leading to a re-arrangement of the
perturbative series non-analytic in the couplings. A set of simple rules that
yield the leading order infrared contributions to the decay width are obtained
and implemented. The lack of kinematic thresholds entail that all particle
states acquire a decay width, dominated by the emission and absorption of
superhorizon quanta $\propto (\lambda/H)^{4/3}\,[H/k_{ph}(\eta)]^6 ;
\lambda\,[H/k_{ph}(\eta)]^6 $ for cubic and quartic couplings respectively to
leading order in $M/H$. The decay of single particle quantum states hastens as
their wavevectors cross the Hubble radius and their width is related to the
highly squeezed limit of the bi- or tri-spectrum of scalar fluctuations
respectively.

reaches a stationary state with a power law distribution of cluster sizes
having exponent 3/2. The amplitude of this stationary state is determined
exactly as a function of $a$. For $1/2 < a \leq 1$, the cluster size
distribution never reaches a stationary state. Instead a bimodal distribution
is formed in which a narrow population of small clusters near the monomer scale
is separated by a gap (where the cluster size distribution is effectively zero)
from a population of large clusters which continue to grow for all time by
absorbing small clusters. The marginal case, $a=1/2$, is difficult to analyze
definitively, but we argue that the cluster size distribution becomes
stationary and there is a logarithmic correction to the algebraic tail.

an estimate of the work done by the Lorentz-force transient on the photosphere

that Lorentz forces can contribute significantly to the generation of

mode may be further coupled to a dissipative thermal environment. Adopting a
master equation approach, we confirm the charge and heat exchange fluctuation
theorem in the steady-state limit, for both harmonic and anharmonic models.
Using simple analytical expressions, we calculate the charge current and
several measures for the mode effective temperature. At low bias, we observe
the effect of bias-induced cooling of the vibrational mode. At higher bias, the
mode effective temperature is higher than the environmental temperature, yet
the junction is stable. Beyond that, once the vibrational mode (bias-induced)
excitation rate overcomes its relaxation rate, instability occurs. We identify
regimes of instability as a function of voltage bias and coupling to an
additional phononic thermal bath. Interestingly, we observe a reentrant
behavior where an unstable junction can properly behave at a high enough bias.

the case with only the lowest hole subband, which is heavy-hole like in (111)

The subband L\""{o}wdin perturbation method is applied to obtain the effective
Hamiltonian including the Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Under a
proper gate voltage, the total in-plane effective magnetic field in (111)
GaAs/AlAs quantum wells can be strongly suppressed in the whole momentum space,
while the one in (111) GaAs/InP quantum wells can be suppressed only on a
special momentum circle. The hole spin relaxation due to the D'yakonov-Perel'
and Elliott-Yafet mechanisms is calculated by means of the fully microscopic
kinetic spin Bloch equation approach with all the relevant scatterings
explicitly included. For (111) GaAs/AlAs quantum wells, extremely long
heavy-hole spin relaxation time (upto hundreds of nanoseconds) is predicted. In
addition, we predict a pronounced peak in the gate-voltage dependence of the
heavy-hole spin relaxation time due to the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism. This
peak origins from the suppression of the unique inhomogeneous broadening in
(111) GaAs/AlAs quantum wells. Moreover, the Elliott-Yafet mechanism influences
the spin relaxation only around the peak area due to the small spin mixing
between the heavy and light holes in quantum wells with small well width. We
also show the anisotropy of the spin relaxation. In (111) GaAs/InP quantum
wells, a mild peak, similar to the case for electrons in (111) GaAs quantum
wells, is also predicted in the gate-voltage dependence of the light-hole spin
relaxation time. The contribution of the Elliott-Yafet mechanism is always
negligible in this case.

the transport-mean-free path does not significantly depend on the topological

their symmetry groups. If it is assumed that the charged particle count for

be broken if the macroscopic spatial dimension is 2 or higher, 2) there are
infinitely many generations of quarks and leptons, and 3) there exists a 5th

  Entanglement in Solids","4 pages, 4 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.86.104425",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum systems unfold diversified correlations which have no classical
counterparts. These quantum correlations have various different facets. Quantum
entanglement, as the most well known measure of quantum correlations, plays
essential roles in quantum information processing. However, it has recently
been pointed out that quantum entanglement cannot describe all the
nonclassicality in the correlations. Thus the study of quantum correlations in
separable states attracts widely attentions. Herein, we experimentally
investigate the quantum correlations of separable thermal states in terms of
quantum discord. The sudden change of quantum discord is observed, which
captures ambiguously the critical point associated with the behavior of
Hamiltonian. Our results display the potential applications of quantum
correlations in studying the fundamental properties of quantum system, such as
quantum criticality of non-zero temperature.

  The most important, lower bound technique for nonnegative rank is solely

arguments that this may not be correct. Thus in the present paper we make a
first step towards studying the nonradial oscillations of neutron stars with an
anisotropic pressure. We adopt the so-called Cowling approximation where the
spacetime metric is kept fixed and the oscillation spectrum for the first few
fluid modes is obtained. The effect of the anisotropy on the frequencies is
apparent, although with the present results it might be hard to distinguish it
from the changes in the frequencies caused by different equations of state.

patterns in permutations. They shown that essentially all well-known Mahonian
permutation statistics can be written as combinations of such patterns. Also,
they proved and conjectured that other combinations of vincular patterns are
still Mahonian. These conjectures were proved later: by Foata and Zeilberger in
2001, and by Foata and Randrianarivony in 2006.
  In this paper we give an alternative proof of some of these results. Our
approach is based on permutation codes which, like Lehmer's code, map
bijectively permutations onto subexcedant sequences. More precisely, we give
several code transforms (i.e., bijections between subexcedant sequences) which
when applied to Lehmer's code yield new permutation codes which count
occurrences of some vincular patterns.

medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) show a triangular grid pattern, and once
established might be based in part on path-integration mechanisms. Grid axes
are tightly aligned across simultaneously recorded units. Recent experimental
findings have shown that grids can often be better described as elliptical
rather than purely circular and that, beyond the mutual alignment of their grid
axes, ellipses tend to also orient their long axis along preferred directions.
Are grid alignment and ellipse orientation the same phenomenon? Does the grid
alignment result from single-unit mechanisms or does it require network
interactions?
  We address these issues by refining our model, to describe specifically the
spontaneous emergence of conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells in layers
III, V and VI of mEC. We find that tight alignment can be produced by recurrent
collateral interactions, but this requires head-direction modulation. Through a
competitive learning process driven by spatial inputs, grid fields then form
already aligned, and with randomly distributed spatial phases. In addition, we
find that the self-organization process is influenced by the behavior of the
simulated rat. The common grid alignment often orients along preferred running
directions. The shape of individual grids is distorted towards an ellipsoid
arrangement when some speed anisotropy is present in exploration behavior.
Speed anisotropy on its own also tends to align grids, even without
collaterals, but the alignment is seen to be loose. Finally, the alignment of
spatial grid fields in multiple environments shows that the network expresses
the same set of grid fields across environments, modulo a coherent rotation and
translation. Thus, an efficient metric encoding of space may emerge through
spontaneous pattern formation at the single-unit level.

  Large Number of Intervals",,,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A numerical semigroup is said to be ordinary if it has all its gaps in a row.
Indeed, it contains zero and all integers from a given positive one. One can
define a simple operation on a non-ordinary semigroup, which we call here the
ordinarization transform, by removing its smallest non-zero non-gap (the
multiplicity) and adding its largest gap (the Frobenius number). This gives
another numerical semigroup and by repeating this transform several times we
end up with an ordinary semigroup. The genus, that is, the number of gaps, is
kept constant in all the transforms.
  This procedure allows the construction of a tree for each given genus
containing all semigrpoups of that genus and rooted in the unique ordinary
semigroup of that genus. We study here the regularity of these trees and the
number of semigroups at each depth. For some depths it is proved that the
number of semigroups increases with the genus and it is conjectured that this
happens at all given depths. This may give some lights to a former conjecture
saying that the number of semigroups of a given genus increases with the genus.
  We finally give an identification between semigroups at a given depth in the
ordinarization tree and semigroups with a given (large) number of gap intervals
and we give an explicit characterization of those semigroups.
