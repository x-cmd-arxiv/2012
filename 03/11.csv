atomic contrast of an AFM image when a tunneling current is present. We
described this effect with a simple resistive model, in which the tunneling
current causes a voltage drop at the sample area underneath the probe tip.
Because tunneling is a highly local process, the areal current density is quite
high, which leads to an appreciable local voltage drop that in turn changes the
electrostatic attraction between tip and sample. However, Si(111)-7\times7 has
a metallic surface-state and it might be proposed that electrons should instead
propagate along the surface-state, as through a thin metal film on a
semiconducting surface, before propagating into the bulk. In this article, we
investigate the role of the metallic surface-state on the phantom force. First,
we show that the phantom force can be observed on H/Si(100), a surface without
a metallic surface-state. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the
surface-state on our phantom force observations of Si(111)-7\times7 by
analyzing the influence of the macroscopic tip radius R on the strength of the
phantom force, where a noticeable effect would be expected if the local voltage
drop would reach extensions comparable to the tip radius. We conclude that a
metallic surface-state does not suppress the phantom force, but that the local
resistance Rs has a strong effect on the magnitude of the phantom force.

between the spectral index beta_Obs and the colour temperature T_C that is
partly caused by the noise. The (T_C, beta_Obs) confidence regions are
elongated, banana-shaped structures. We studied under which conditions these
exhibit anomalous, strongly non-Gaussian behaviour that could affect the
interpretation of the observed (T_C, beta_Obs) relations. We examined modified
black body spectra and spectra calculated from radiative transfer models of
filamentary clouds at wavelengths 100um-850um. We performed modified black body
fits and examined the structure of the chi^2(T_, beta_Obs) function. We show
cases where, when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, the chi^2 has multiple
local minima in the (T_C, beta_Obs) plane. A small change in the weighting of
the data points can cause the solution to jump to completely different values.
In particular, noise can lead to the appearance of a separate population of
solutions with low colour temperatures and high spectral indices. The anomalies
are caused by the noise but the tendency to show multiple chi^2 minima depends
on the model and the wavelengths analysed. Deviations from the assumed single
modified black body spectrum are not important. The presence of local minima
implies that the results obtained from the chi^2 minimisation depend on the
starting point of the optimisation and may correspond to non-global minima. The
(T_C,beta_Obs) distributions may be contaminated by a few solutions with
unrealistically low colour temperatures and high spectral indices. Proper

These terms contain up to the fourth derivative of the fields including the
scalar field and the metric. The results show the possible shapes of the
interaction terms resulting eventually in non-Gaussianity in a general
formalism. In addition generally the speed of sound is different but almost
unity. Since in this method the adiabatic mode is not discriminated initially
so we define the adiabatic as well as entropy modes for a specific two-field
model. It has been shown that the non-Gaussianity of the adiabatic mode and the
entropy mode are correlated in shape and amplitude. It is shown that even for
speed close to unity large non-Gaussianities are possible in multi-field case.
The amount of the non-Gaussianity depends on the curvature of the classical
path in the phase-space in the Hubble unit such that it is large for the large
curvature. In addition it is emphasized that the time derivative of adiabatic
and entropy perturbations do not transform due to the shift symmetry as well as
the original perturbations. Though two specific combinations of them are
invariant under such a symmetry and these combinations should be employed to
construct an effective field theory of multi-field inflation.

with high-resolution observations. One of the most important findings is the
""uncombed"" penumbral structure, where a more horizontal magnetic component
carrying most of Evershed Flows is embedded in a more vertical magnetic
background (Solanki & Montavon 1993). The penumbral bright grains are locations
of hot upflows and dark fibrils are locations of horizontal flows that are
guided by nearly horizontal magnetic field. On the other hand, it was found
that flares may change the topology of sunspots in $\delta$ configuration: the
structure at the flaring polarity inversion line becomes darkened while
sections of peripheral penumbrae may disappear quickly and permanently
associated with flares (Liu et al. 2005). The high spatial and temporal
resolution observations obtained with Hinode/ SOT provide an excellent
opportunity to study the evolution of penumbral fine structure associated with
major flares. Taking advantage of two near-limb events, we found that in
sections of peripheral penumbrae swept by flare ribbons, the dark fibrils
completely disappear, while the bright grains evolve into faculae that are
signatures of vertical magnetic flux tubes. The corresponding magnetic fluxes
measured in the decaying penumbrae show stepwise changes temporally correlated
with the flares. These observations suggest that the horizontal magnetic field
component of the penumbra could be straightened upward (i.e., turning from
horizontal to vertical) due to magnetic field restructuring associated with
flares, which results in the transition of penumbrae to faculae.

of observation to reduce errors. Active traffic analysis, also known as flow
watermarking, allows for better precision and is more scalable. Previous flow
watermarks introduce significant delays to the traffic flow as a side effect of
using a blind detection scheme; this enables attacks that detect and remove the
watermark, while at the same time slowing down legitimate traffic. We propose
the first non-blind approach for flow watermarking, called RAINBOW, that
improves watermark invisibility by inserting delays hundreds of times smaller
than previous blind watermarks, hence reduces the watermark interference on
network flows. We derive and analyze the optimum detectors for RAINBOW as well
as the passive traffic analysis under different traffic models by using
hypothesis testing. Comparing the detection performance of RAINBOW and the
passive approach we observe that both RAINBOW and passive traffic analysis
perform similarly good in the case of uncorrelated traffic, however, the
RAINBOW detector drastically outperforms the optimum passive detector in the
case of correlated network flows. This justifies the use of non-blind
watermarks over passive traffic analysis even though both approaches have
similar scalability constraints. We confirm our analysis by simulating the
detectors and testing them against large traces of real network flows.

significantly by the wave. We find numerically that the interior contribution
to the Gibbs free energy is entirely gravitational and accumulates in a thin
shell just inside the horizon. The entropy is gravitational in origin and one
observes dynamically that it resides on the horizon. We also compare the
numerical value of the interior Lagrangian to the expected analytical value of
the interior Gibbs free energy for different initial states and we find that
they agree to within 10-13%. The two values are approaching each other so that
their difference decreases with more evolution time.

not clear, however, which frequency of overrides is appropriate for a given

Previously, we established a result that allows us to characterize the optimal
performance of analog network coding in network scenarios beyond those that can
be analyzed using the approaches based on such assumptions.
  The key contribution of this work is a scheme to greedily compute a lower
bound to the optimal rate achievable with analog network coding in the general
layered networks. This scheme allows for exact computation of the optimal
achievable rates in a wider class of layered networks than those that can be
addressed using existing approaches. For the specific case of Gaussian N-relay
diamond network, to the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme provides the
first exact characterization of the optimal rate achievable with analog network
coding. Further, for general layered networks, our scheme allows us to compute
optimal rates within a constant gap from the cut-set upper bound asymptotically

particular attention to the effect of wave obliquity on the dynamics of the
orbits by studying the specific cases of parallel ($\theta=0$) and
perpendicular ($\theta=-\pi/2$) propagations in comparison to the general case
of oblique propagation $\theta=]-\pi/2, 0[$. We found that the fixed points of
the system correspond to Landau resonance, and that the dynamics can evolve
from trapping to surfatron acceleration for propagation angles obeying a Hopf
bifurcations condition. Cyclotron-resonant particles are also studied by the
construction of a pseudo-potential structure in the Lorentz factor $\gamma$. We
derived a condition for which Arnold diffusion results in relativistic
stochastic acceleration. Hence, two general conclusions are drawn : 1) The
propagation angle $\theta$ can significantly alter the dynamics of the orbits
at both Landau and cyclotron-resonances. 2) Considering the short-time scales
upon which the particles are accelerated, these two mechanisms for Landau and
cyclotron resonant orbits could become potential candidates for problems of
particle energization in weakly collisional space and cosmic plasmas.

problem of macroscopically faithful coarse graining is studied. Macroscopic
data is identified; it contains the holonomy evaluation along a discrete set of
loops and the homotopy classes of certain maps. When two configurations share
this data they are related by a local deformation. The interpretation is that
such configurations differ by ""microscopic details"". In many cases the homotopy
type of the relevant maps is trivial for every connection; two important cases
in which the homotopy data is composed by a set of integer numbers are: (i) a
two dimensional base manifold and structure group U(1), (ii) a four dimensional
base manifold and structure group SU(2). These cases are relevant for spin foam
models of two dimensional gravity and four dimensional gravity respectively.
  This result suggests that if spin foam models for two-dimensional and
four-dimensional gravity are modified to include all the relevant macroscopic
degrees of freedom -the complete collection of macroscopic variables necessary
to ensure faithful coarse graining-, then they could provide appropriate
effective theories at a given scale.

as an apparently relatively relaxed system, not having undergone a major merger
in almost 7 Gyr. Despite this characterization and history, the intra-cluster
medium (ICM) contains quite active ""weather"". We explore the effects of this
ICM weather on the morphological evolution of the AGN jets and lobes. The
orientation of the jets is different in the two simulations so that they probe
different aspects of the ICM structure and dynamics. We find that even for this
cluster that can be characterized as relaxed by an observational standard, the
large-scale, bulk ICM motions can significantly distort the jets and lobes.
Synthetic X-ray observations of the simulations show that the jets produce
complex cavity systems, while synthetic radio observations reveal bending of
the jets and lobes similar to wide-angle tail (WAT) radio sources. The jets are
cycled on and off with a 26 Myr period using a 50% duty cycle. This leads to
morphological features similar to those in ""double-double"" radio galaxies.
While the jet and ICM magnetic fields are generally too weak in the simulations
to play a major role in the dynamics, Maxwell stresses can still become locally
significant.

network that is obtained by simply quantizing the received signals and
restricting the transmitted signals to a finite precision. Since signals in the
discrete network are obtained from those of a Gaussian network, the Gaussian
network can be operated on the quantization-based digital interface defined by
the discrete network. We prove that this digital interface is near-optimal for
Gaussian relay networks and the capacities of the Gaussian and the discrete
networks are within a bounded gap of O(M^2) bits, where M is the number of
nodes.
  We prove that any near-optimal coding strategy for the discrete network can
be naturally transformed into a near-optimal coding strategy for the Gaussian
network merely by quantization. We exploit this by designing a linear coding
strategy for the case of layered discrete relay networks. The linear coding
strategy is near-optimal for Gaussian and discrete networks and achieves rates
within O(M^2) bits of the capacity, independent of channel gains or SNR. The
linear code is robust and the relays need not know the channel gains. The
transmit and receive signals at all relays are simply quantized to binary
tuples of the same length $n$ . The linear network code requires all the relay
nodes to collect the received binary tuples into a long binary vector and apply
a linear transformation on the long vector. The resulting binary vector is
split into smaller binary tuples for transmission by the relays. The
quantization requirements of the linear network code are completely defined by
the parameter $n$, which also determines the resolution of the
analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog convertors for operating the network
within a bounded gap of the network's capacity. The linear network code
explicitly connects network coding for wireline networks with codes for
Gaussian networks.

demolishing the widely held belief that QND observables are constants of

information-processing devices in regimes where quantum noise is detrimental,
unifying previous approaches that employ QND observables, back-action evasion,
and quantum noise cancellation. Potential applications include
gravitational-wave detection, optomechanical force sensing, atomic
magnetometry, and classical computing. Demonstrations of dynamical QMFSs

preconditioning. Such criteria have received, however, little attention and
have been treated heuristically in the following manner: If the size of an
entry is below some empirically small positive quantity, then it is set to
zero. The meaning of ""small"" is vague and has not been considered rigorously.
It has not been clear how dropping tolerances affect the quality and
effectiveness of a preconditioner $M$. In this paper, we focus on the adaptive
Power Sparse Approximate Inverse algorithm and establish a mathematical theory
on robust selection criteria for dropping tolerances. Using the theory, we
derive an adaptive dropping criterion that is used to drop entries of small
magnitude dynamically during the setup process of $M$. The proposed criterion
enables us to make $M$ both as sparse as possible as well as to be of
comparable quality to the potentially denser matrix which is obtained without
dropping. As a byproduct, the theory applies to static F-norm minimization
based preconditioning procedures, and a similar dropping criterion is given
that can be used to sparsify a matrix after it has been computed by a static
sparse approximate inverse procedure. In contrast to the adaptive procedure,
dropping in the static procedure does not reduce the setup time of the matrix
but makes the application of the sparser $M$ for Krylov iterations cheaper.
Numerical experiments reported confirm the theory and illustrate the robustness
and effectiveness of the dropping criteria.

X-ray to IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of AGN used for connecting the

torus model based on the radiative transfer and photoionization code CLOUDY.
Four observational determinations of the evolution of 2-10 keV HXLF and six
evolution models of the obscured type-2 AGN fraction ($f_2$) have been
considered. The 8.0 and 15 \micron LFs for the total, unobscured type-1 and
obscured type-2 AGN are predicted from the HXLFs, and then compared with the
measurements currently available. We find that the IRLFs predicted from HXLFs
tend to underestimate the number of the most IR-luminous AGN. This is
independent of the choices of HXLF and $f_2$, and even more obvious for the
HXLFs recently measured. We show that the discrepancy between the HXLFs and
IRLFs can be largely resolved when the anticorrelation between the UV to X-ray
slope $\alpha_{\mathrm{ox}}$ and UV luminosity $L_{\rm UV}$ is appropriately
considered. We also discuss other possible explanations for the discrepancy,
such as the missing population of Compton-thick AGN and possible contribution
of star-formation in the host to the mid-IR. Meanwhile, we find that the HXLFs
and IRLFs of AGN can be more consistent with each other if the obscuration
mechanisms of quasars and Seyferts are assumed to be different, corresponding
to their different triggering and fueling mechanisms. More accurate
measurements of the IRLFs of AGN, especially that determined at smaller
redshift bins and more accurately separated to that for type-1 and type-2, are
very helpful for clarifying these interesting issues.

flare and early shallow-decay components are likely related to long-term
central engine activities. We focus on their statistical properties in this
paper. Twenty-four optical flares are obtained from 19 GRBs. The isotropic
R-band energy is smaller than 1% of $E_{\gamma, \rm iso}$. The relation between
isotropic luminosities of the flares and gamma-rays follows $L^{\rm F}_{\rm R,
iso}\propto L_{{\gamma}, \rm iso}^{1.11\pm 0.27}$. Later flares tend to be
wider and dimmer, i.e., $w^{\rm F}\sim t^{\rm F}_{\rm p}/2$ and $L^{\rm F}_{\rm

probability of the optical flares is much smaller than that of X-ray flares. An
optical shallow decay segment is observed in 39 GRBs. The relation between the
break time and break luminosity is a power-law, with an index of $-0.78\pm
0.08$, similar to that derived from X-ray flares. The X-ray and optical breaks
are usually chromatic, but a tentative correlation is found. We suggest that
similar to the prompt optical emission that tracks $\gamma$-rays, the optical
flares are also related to the erratic behavior of the central engine. The
shallow decay component is likely related to a long-lasting spinning-down
central engine or piling up of flare materials onto the blastwave. Mixing of
different emission components may be the reason of the diverse chromatic
afterglow behaviors.

The spectrum is well fitted by a combination of absorbed power-law and disk
black-body models. While the relative contributions of the models varies with
time, we have seen no evidence for a canonical state transition. The luminosity
and spectral properties are consistent with accretion powered by a black hole
with M_BH ~ 40-100 solar masses. In July 2011 we found a luminous, blue optical
counterpart which had not been seen in deep HST observations obtained in August
2009. These optical observations suggest that the donor star is a low-mass star
undergoing Roche-lobe overflow, and that the blue optical emission seen during
the outburst is coming from an irradiated accretion disk. This source shows
that ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with low-mass companions are an
important component of the ULX population in star-forming galaxies, and
provides further evidence that the blue optical counterparts of some ULXs need
not indicate a young, high-mass companion, but rather that they may indicate

can automatically maintain the minimal flavor violation (MFV). It turns out
that such a Yukawa mediation scenario can give a large -A_t and
-m_{stop_L,R}^2, leading to a maximal stop mixing, and thus can readily give a
light stop (stop_1) below the TeV scale. However, we find that in the minimal
H-YGMSB scenario, m_{H_u}^2 is too large and then the electroweak symmetry
breaking is inconsistent with the large stop mixing. To solve this problem, we
modify the hidden sectors in two ways, adding a new strong gauge dynamics or
introducing the (10,10_bar) messengers. For each case we present some numerical
study.

of metastable states is significantly reduced with respect to the instantaneous
rigidity, namely the Born term, due to non-affine responses caused by
displacements of particles inside cages at all temperatures down to T=0. It
becomes nearly independent of temperature below the Kauzmann temperature T_K.
At higher temperatures in the supercooled liquid state, the non-affine

magnitude of its Fourier transform, also known as phase retrieval. The problem
arises in many areas of astronomy, crystallography, optics, and coherent
diffraction imaging (CDI). Our main goal is to develop an efficient
reconstruction method based on continuous optimization techniques. Unlike
current reconstruction methods, which are based on alternating projections, our
approach leads to a much faster and more robust method. However, all previous
attempts to employ continuous optimization methods, such as Newton-type
algorithms, to the phase retrieval problem failed. In this work we provide an
explanation for this failure, and based on this explanation we devise a
sufficient condition that allows development of new reconstruction
methods---approximately known Fourier phase. We demonstrate that a rough (up to
$\pi/2$ radians) Fourier phase estimate practically guarantees successful
reconstruction by any reasonable method. We also present a new reconstruction
method whose reconstruction time is orders of magnitude faster than that of the
current method-of-choice in phase retrieval---Hybrid Input-Output (HIO).
Moreover, our method is capable of successful reconstruction even in the
situations where HIO is known to fail. We also extended our method to other
applications: Fourier domain holography, and interferometry. Additionally we
developed a new sparsity-based method for sub-wavelength CDI. Using this method
we demonstrated experimental resolution exceeding several times the physical
