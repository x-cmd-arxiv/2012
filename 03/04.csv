the sites of a one-dimensional periodic lattice. The oscillators interact with
a strength that decays as a power law of the separation along the lattice
length and is normalized by a size-dependent constant. The exponent $\alpha$ of
the power law is taken in the range $0 \le \alpha <1$. The oscillator frequency
distribution is symmetric about its mean (taken to be zero), and is
non-increasing on $[0,\infty)$. In the continuum limit, the local density of
oscillators evolves in time following the continuity equation that expresses
the conservation of the number of oscillators of each frequency under the
dynamics. This equation admits as a stationary solution the unsynchronized
state uniform both in phase and over the space of the lattice. We perform a
linear stability analysis of this state to show that when it is unstable,
different spatial Fourier modes of fluctuations have different stability
thresholds beyond which they grow exponentially in time with rates that depend
on the Fourier modes. However, numerical simulations show that at long times,
all the non-zero Fourier modes decay in time, while only the zero Fourier mode
(i.e., the ""mean-field"" mode) grows in time, thereby dominating the instability
process and driving the system to a synchronized state. Our theoretical
analysis is supported by extensive numerical simulations.

$S\subseteq V(G)$. The paper considers the following repetitive process on $G$.
At time step 0 the vertices of $S$ are colored black and the other vertices are
colored white. After that, at each time step $t>0$, the colors of white
vertices (if any) are updated according to the following rule. All white
vertices $v$ that have at least $\theta(v)$ black neighbors at the time step
$t-1$ are colored black, and the colors of the other vertices do not change.
The process runs until no more white vertices can update colors from white to
black. The following optimization problem is called Target Set Selection:
Finding a target set $S$ of smallest possible size such that all vertices in
$G$ are black at the end of the process. Such an $S$ is called an {\em optimal
target set} for $G$ under the threshold function $\theta$. We are interested in
finding an optimal target set for the well-known class of honeycomb networks

graph $G$, a {\em feedback vertex set} is a subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ such that
the subgraph induced by $V(G)\setminus S$ is cycle-free. In this paper we give
exact value on the size of the optimal target set for various kinds of

mixed modes in red giants, which is a powerful tool to identify
gravity-dominated mixed modes. With these modes, which share the
characteristics of pressure and gravity modes, we are able to probe directly
the helium core and the surrounding shell where hydrogen is burning. We propose
two ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the frequencies
of the mixed modes. Firstly, a phenomenological approach is used to describe
the main features of the mode bumping. Alternatively, a quasi-asymptotic
mixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between seismic observations and
the stellar interior structure. We used period \'echelle diagrams to emphasize
the detection of the gravity-dominated mixed modes. The asymptotic relation for
mixed modes is confirmed. It allows us to measure the gravity-mode period
spacings in more than two hundred red giant stars. The identification of the
gravity-dominated mixed modes allows us to complete the identification of all
major peaks in a red giant oscillation spectrum, with significant consequences
for the true identification of \ell = 3 modes, of \ell = 2 mixed modes, for the
mode widths and amplitudes, and for the \ell = 1 rotational splittings. The
accurate measurement of the gravity-mode period spacing provides an effective
probe of the inner, g-mode cavity. The derived value of the coupling
coefficient between the cavities is different for red giant branch and clump
stars. This provides a probe of the hydrogen-shell burning region that
surrounds the helium core. Core contraction as red giants ascend the red giant
branch can be explored using the variation of the gravity-mode spacing as a
function of the mean large separation.

We find in the QAH phase that flat gapless edge modes emerge and that spins
form a momentum-space skyrmion to yield the Chern number. It is remarkable that

Starting from 2H- or 3R-graphite and applying the pressure of 20 GPa, a large

works insisted on the relevance of the underlying Information and Communication
Technologies infrastructure. Through a review of current e-maintenance

predominance of ICT within e-maintenance projects and literature. The review
brings to light the importance of intelligence as a fundamental dimension of
e-maintenance that is to be led in a holistic predefined manner rather than
isolated efforts within ICT driven approaches. As a contribution towards an
intelligence based e-maintenance conceptual framework, a proposal is outlined
in this paper to model e-maintenance system as an intelligent system. The
proposed frame is based on CogAff architecture for intelligent agents. Within
the proposed frame, more importance was reserved to the environment that the
system is to be continuously aware of: Plant Environment, Internal and External
Enterprise Environment and Human Environment. In addition to the abilities
required for internal coherent behavior of the system, requirements for
maintenance activities support are also mapped within the same frame according
to corresponding levels of management. A case study was detailed in this paper
sustaining the applicability of the proposal in relation to the classification
of existing e-maintenance platforms. However, more work is needed to enhance
exhaustiveness of the frame to serve as a comparison tool of existing
e-maintenance systems. At the conceptual level, our future work is to use the
proposed frame in an e-maintenance project.

asymptotic free scalar, Dirac and gauge fields in that theory are canonically
quantized, the Fock spaces of stationary states are constructed and the
gravitational limit - mapping the gravitational energy-momentum onto the

introduced. Next the S-matrix in quantum gravity is defined as the

operators of the interacting theory. Together with the generating functional of
the latter established in an earlier paper [8] any transition amplitude can in

quite remarkably, it becomes accessible in pairs of isospectral shapes, as
recently proposed in the experiment of Christopher R. Moon {\it et al.},
Science {\bf 319}, 782 (2008). The method is based on a special property,
called transplantation, which relates the eigenfunctions of the isospectral
pairs, and allows to extract the phase distributions, if the amplitude
distributions are known. We numerically simulate such a phase extraction
procedure in the presence of disorder, which is introduced both as Anderson
disorder and as roughness at edges. With disorder, the transplantation can no
longer lead to a perfect fit of the wave functions, however we show that a
phase can still be extracted - defined as the phase that minimizes the misfit.
Interestingly, this extracted phase coincides with (or differs negligibly from)
the phase of the disorder-free system, up to a certain disorder amplitude, and
a misfit of the wave functions as high as $\sim 5%$, proving a robustness of
the phase extraction method against disorder. However, if the disorder is
increased further, the extracted phase shows a puzzle structure, no longer
correlated with the phase of the disorder-free system. A discrete model is
used, which is the natural approach for disorder analysis. We provide a proof
that discretization preserves isospectrality and the transplantation can be
adapted to the discrete systems.

30 to 70% (60 to 90%), while CO$_2$ and CO are the next potential sources
contributing 25 to 50% ($<$5%). The ratio of the photo-production rate of
O($^1$S) to O($^1$D) would be around 0.03 ($\pm$ 0.01) if H$_2$O is the main
source of oxygen lines, whereas it is $\sim$0.6 if the parent is CO$_2$. Our
calculations suggest that the yield of O($^1$S) production in the
photodissociation of H$_2$O cannot be larger than 1%. The model calculated
radial brightness profiles of the red and green lines and G/R ratios are in
good agreement with the observations made on comet Hyakutake in March 1996.

makes use of a pion-mass dispersion relation, which is shown to hold in both
frameworks. The dispersion relation allows an ultraviolet cutoff to be
implemented without compromising the symmetries. After renormalization, the
leading-order heavy-baryon loops demonstrate a stronger dependence on the
cutoff scale, which results in weakened convergence of the expansion. This
conclusion is tested against the recent results of lattice quantum
chromodynamics simulations for nucleon mass and isovector magnetic moment. In
the case of the polarizability, the situation is even more dramatic as the

achievability results in \emph{network information theory} (NIT) problems. The
framework uses random binning arguments and is based on a duality between

proving coordination and \emph{strong} secrecy problems where certain
statistical conditions on the distribution of random variables need to be

important feature of the framework is to enable one {to} add an eavesdropper

  We make a case for generality of the framework by studying examples in the
variety of settings containing channel coding, lossy source coding, joint
source-channel coding, coordination, strong secrecy, feedback and relaying. In
particular, by investigating the framework for the lossy source coding problem
over broadcast channel, it is shown that the new framework provides a simple
alternative scheme to \emph{hybrid} coding scheme. Also, new results on secrecy

shown the usefulness of the framework to establish achievability results for

effective approach for optimizing consumption of scarce resources like

processing poses a problem for the privacy of the sensor data since individual
data of sensor nodes need to be known to the aggregator node before the
aggregation process can be carried out. In applications of WSNs,
privacy-preserving data aggregation has become an important requirement due to
sensitive nature of the sensor data. Researchers have proposed a number of
protocols and schemes for this purpose. He et al. (INFOCOM 2007) have proposed
a protocol - called CPDA - for carrying out additive data aggregation in a
privacy-preserving manner for application in WSNs. The scheme has been quite
popular and well-known. In spite of the popularity of this protocol, it has
been found that the protocol is vulnerable to attack and it is also not
energy-efficient. In this paper, we first present a brief state of the art
survey on the current privacy-preserving data aggregation protocols for WSNS.
Then we describe the CPDA protocol and identify its security vulnerability.
Finally, we demonstrate how the protocol can be made secure and energy
efficient.

has a faster decay with the system size (in the short time limit) close to a
MCP and also the scaling obeyed by the quasiperiod of the collapse and revival

even when approached along the gapless critical line, the scaling of the LE is
determined by the MCP where the energy gap shows a faster decay with the system

spin is globally coupled to an environment (E) which is subjected to a small
and sudden quench at $t=0$ so that its state at $t=0^+$, remains the same as
the ground state of the initial environmental Hamiltonian before the quench;
this leads to a non-equilibrium situation. This state now evolves with two
Hamiltonians, the final Hamiltonian following the quench and its modified
version which incorporates an additional term arising due to the coupling of
the central spin to the environment. Using a generic short-time scaling of the
decay rate, we establish that in the early time limit, the rate of decay of the
LE (or the overlap between two states generated from the initial state evolving
through two channels) close to the quantum critical point (QCP) of E is
independent of the quenching. We do also study the temporal evolution of the LE
and establish the presence of a crossover to a situation where the quenching
becomes irrelevant. In the limit of large quench amplitude the non-equilibrium
initial condition is found to result in a drastic increase in decoherence at
large times, even far away from a QCP. These generic results are verified
analytically as well as numerically, choosing E to be a transverse Ising chain

electrodes), monkey motor cortex and premotor cortex and human temporal cortex
(96 electrodes) in epileptic patients. In neuronal avalanches defined from
units (up to 160 single units), the size of avalanches never clearly scaled as
power-law, but rather scaled exponentially or displayed intermediate scaling.
We also analyzed the dynamics of local field potentials (LFPs) and in
particular LFP negative peaks (nLFPs) among the different electrodes (up to 96
sites in temporal cortex or up to 128 sites in adjacent motor and pre-motor
cortices). In this case, the avalanches defined from nLFPs displayed power-law
scaling in double log representations, as reported previously in monkey.
However, avalanche defined as positive LFP (pLFP) peaks, which are less
directly related to neuronal firing, also displayed apparent power-law scaling.
Closer examination of this scaling using more reliable cumulative distribution
functions (CDF) and other rigorous statistical measures, did not confirm
power-law scaling. The same pattern was seen for cats, monkey and human, as
well as for different brain states of wakefulness and sleep. We also tested
other alternative distributions. Multiple exponential fitting yielded optimal
fits of the avalanche dynamics with bi-exponential distributions. Collectively,
these results show no clear evidence for power-law scaling or self-organized

in two way QKD system based on the imperfection of FM. Our analysis shows that,
if the FM is imperfect, the dimension of Hilbert space spanned by the four
states sent by Alice is three instead of two. Thus Eve can distinguish these
states with a set of POVM operators belonging to three dimension space, which
will reduce the QBER induced by her attack. Furthermore, a relationship between
the degree of the imperfection of FM and the transmittance of the practical QKD
system is obtained. The results show that, the probability that Eve loads her

but the QBER induced by Eve's attack changes with the degree of the

signature. We analyze a sample of Tevatron pp-bar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96
TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.7/fb recorded by the CDF II
detector. In events with large missing transverse energy and one energetic jet,
we find good agreement between the standard model prediction and the observed
data. We set 90% confidence level upper limits on the dark matter production
rate. The limits are translated into bounds on nucleon-dark matter scattering
rates which are competitive with current direct detection bounds on
spin-independent interaction below a dark matter candidate mass of 5 GeV/c^2,
and on spin-dependent interactions up to masses of 200 GeV/c^2.

  metamaterials",,,"10.1038/nmat3433",,"physics.optics cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The extraordinary electronic properties of graphene, such as its continuously
gate-variable ambipolar field effect and the resulting steep change in
resistivity, provided the main thrusts for the rapid advance of graphene
electronics. The gate-controllable electronic properties of graphene provide a
route to efficiently manipulate the interaction of low-energy photons with
massless Dirac fermions, which has recently sparked keen interest in graphene
plasmonics. However, the electro-optic tuning capability of unpatterned
graphene alone is still not strong enough for practical optoelectronic
applications due to its nonresonant Drude-like behaviour. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate that substantial gate-induced persistent switching
and linear modulation of terahertz waves can be achieved in a two-dimensional
artificial material, referred to as a metamaterial, into which an atomically
thin, gated two-dimensional graphene layer is integrated. The gate-controllable
light-matter interaction in the graphene layer can be greatly enhanced by the
strong resonances and the corresponding field enhancement in the metamaterial.
Although the thickness of the embedded single-layer graphene is more than 'six'
orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength (< {\lambda}/1,000,000), the
one-atom-thick layer, in conjunction with the metamaterial, can modulate both
the amplitude of the transmitted wave by up to 90 per cent and its phase by
more than 40 degrees at room temperature. More interestingly, the
gate-controlled active graphene metamaterials show hysteretic behaviour in the
transmission of terahertz waves, especially when fabricated with multilayer
graphene, which is indicative of persistent photonic memory effects.

  Data: Visual Classification as An Example",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In practical applications, we often have to deal with high order data, such
as a grayscale image and a video sequence are intrinsically 2nd-order tensor
and 3rd-order tensor, respectively. For doing clustering or classification of
these high order data, it is a conventional way to vectorize these data before
hand, as PCA or FDA does, which often induce the curse of dimensionality
problem. For this reason, experts have developed many methods to deal with the
tensorial data, such as multilinear PCA, multilinear LDA, and so on. In this
paper, we still address the problem of high order data representation and
recognition, and propose to study the result of merging multilinear PCA and
multilinear LDA into one scenario, we name it \textbf{GDA} for the abbreviation
of Generalized Discriminant Analysis. To evaluate GDA, we perform a series of
experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate our GDA outperforms a
selection of competing methods such (2D)$^2$PCA, (2D)$^2$LDA, and MDA.

graphene can be probed with the innovative technique of infrared nanoscopy
where mid-infrared radiation is confined by an atomic force microscope
cantilever tip. In contrast to conventional $q\sim 0$ optical absorption which
primarily involves Dirac fermions with momentum near the Fermi momentum, $k\sim
k_F$, for finite $q$, $\sigma({\boldsymbol{q}},\omega)$ has the potential to
provide information on many body renormalizations and collective phenomena
which have been found at small $k< k_F$ near the Dirac point in electron-doped
graphene. For electron-electron interactions, the low energy excitation
spectrum characterizing the incoherent part of the quasiparticle spectral
function of Dirac electrons with $k\sim k_F$ consists of a flat, small
amplitude background which scales with chemical potential and Fermi momentum.
However, probing of the states with $k$ near $k=0$ will reveal plasmarons, a
collective state of a charge carrier and a plasmon. These collective modes in
graphene have recently been seen in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
and here we describe how they manifest in near field optics.

scattering anomalies associated with the dissolution of an embedded eigenvalue
of a linear scattering system. These sharp peak-dip anomalies in the frequency
domain are often called Fano resonances. We study a simple model that
incorporates the essential features of this kind of resonance. It features a
linear scatterer attached to a transmission line with a point-mass defect and
coupled to a nonlinear oscillator. We prove two power laws in the small
coupling <gamma> \to 0 and small nonlinearity <mu> \to 0 regime. The asymptotic
relation <mu> ~ C<gamma>^4 characterizes the emergence of a small frequency
interval of triple harmonic solutions near the resonant frequency of the
oscillator. As the nonlinearity grows or the coupling diminishes, this interval
widens and, at the relation <mu> ~ C<gamma>^2, merges with another evolving
frequency interval of triple harmonic solutions that extends to infinity. Our
model allows rigorous computation of stability in the small <mu> and <gamma>
limit. In the regime of triple harmonic solutions, those with largest and
smallest response of the oscillator are linearly stable and the solution with
intermediate response is unstable.
