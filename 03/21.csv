features at H-alpha are observed in the transmission spectra of both HD 189733b
and HD 209458b. We attempt to characterize and remove the effects of stellar
variability in HD 189733b, and along with an empirical Monte Carlo test the
results imply a statistically significant transit-dependent feature of
(-8.72+/-1.48)x10^-4 integrated over a 16 Angstrom band relative to the
adjacent continuum. We interpret this as the first detection of this line in an
exoplanetary atmosphere. A previous detection of Ly-alpha in HD 189733b's
atmosphere allows us to calculate an excitation temperature for hydrogen,
T_exc=2.6x10^4 K. This calculation depends significantly on certain simplifying
assumptions. We explore these assumptions and argue that T_exc is very likely
much greater than the radiative equilibrium temperature (the temperature the
planet is assumed to be at based on stellar radiation and the planetary
distance) of HD 189733b. A large T_exc implies a very low density that is not
in thermodynamic equilibrium the planet's lower atmosphere. We argue that the
n=2 hydrogen required to cause H-alpha absorption in the atmosphere is created
as a result of the greater UV flux at HD 189733b, which has the smallest orbit
and most chromospherically active central star in our sample. Though the
overall integration of HD 209458b's transmission spectrum over a wide band is
consistent with zero, it contains a dramatic, statistically significant feature
in the transmission spectrum with reflectional symmetry. We discuss possible
physical processes that could cause this feature. Our remaining two targets (HD
147506b and HD 149026b) do not show any clear features, so we place upper
limits on their H-alpha absorption levels.

the presence of spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field. As the Zeeman field
crosses the critical bulk value B_c of the topological transition, a Majorana
bound state (MBS) is formed, giving rise to a sharp zero-bias anomaly (ZBA) in
the tunneling differential conductance. We identify novel features beyond this
picture in wires with inhomogeneous depletion, like the appearance of two MBSs
inside a long depleted region for B<B_c. The resulting ZBA is in most cases
weakly split and may coexist with Andreev bound states near zero energy. The
ZBA may appear without evidence of a topological gap closing. This latter
aspect is more evident in the multiband case and stems from a smooth pinch-off
barrier. Most of these features are in qualitative agreement with recent
experiments [Mourik et al, Science 336, 1003 (2012)]. We also discuss the rich
phenomenology of the problem in other regimes which remain experimentally
unexplored.

that such a W^prime boson would be produced in association with a top quark at
the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), thus inducing additional tt_bar+j events.
We use measurements of tt_bar+n-jet production from the LHC to constrain the

this W^prime model is constrained at the 95% C.L. using 0.7 fb^{-1} of data

steps towards the study of operators in such theories. We calculate
wavefunctions and their overlaps around a general point of enhancement and

general results to a simple model at a point of E8 enhancement and calculate
some example operators such as Yukawa couplings and dimension-five couplings

structure) for a large number of stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies
Sculptor and Fornax, and for a smaller number in the Carina and Sextans dSph
galaxies. Abundances had already been determined for a number of other elements
in these galaxies, including alpha and iron-peak ones, which allowed us to
build [Mn/Fe] and [Mn/alpha] versus [Fe/H] diagrams. The Mn abundances imply
sub-solar [Mn/Fe] ratios for the stars in all four galaxies examined. In
Sculptor, [Mn/Fe] stays roughly constant between [Fe/H]\sim -1.8 and -1.4 and
decreases at higher iron abundance. In Fornax, [Mn/Fe] does not vary in any
significant way with [Fe/H]. The relation between [Mn/alpha] and [Fe/H] for the
dSph galaxies is clearly systematically offset from that for the Milky Way,
which reflects the different star formation histories of the respective
galaxies. The [Mn/alpha] behavior can be interpreted as a result of the
metal-dependent Mn yields of type II and type Ia supernovae. We also computed
chemical evolution models for star formation histories matching those
determined empirically for Sculptor, Fornax, and Carina, and for the Mn yields
of SNe Ia, which were assumed to be either constant or variable with
metallicity. The observed [Mn/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relation in Sculptor, Fornax,
and Carina can be reproduced only by the chemical evolution models that include
a metallicity-dependent Mn yield from the SNe Ia.

sources typically have very long lifetimes compared to the transit times across
the systems, suggesting confinement in the source region. Particle-in-cell
simulations are carried out to explore the mechanisms of energetic electron
transport from the corona to the chromosphere and possible confinement. We set
up an initial system of pre-accelerated hot electrons in contact with ambient
cold electrons along the local magnetic field, and let it evolve over time.
Suppression of transport by a nonlinear, highly localized electrostatic
electric field (in the form of a double layer) is observed after a short phase
of free-streaming by hot electrons. The double layer (DL) emerges at the
contact of the two electron populations. It is driven by an ion-electron
streaming instability due to the drift of the back-streaming return current
electrons interacting with the ions. The DL grows over time and supports a
significant drop in temperature and hence reduces heat flux between the two
regions that is sustained for the duration of the simulation. This study shows
transport suppression begins when the energetic electrons start to propagate
away from a coronal acceleration site. It also implies confinement of energetic
electrons with kinetic energies less than the electrostatic energy of the DL
for the DL lifetime, which is much longer than the electron transit time
through the source region.

languages. Well-known GP mechanisms, such as type classes and the C++0x
concepts proposal, usually combine two features: 1) a special type of
interfaces; and 2) implicit instantiation of implementations of those
interfaces.
  Scala implicits are a GP language mechanism, inspired by type classes, that
break with the tradition of coupling implicit instantiation with a special type
of interface. Instead, implicits provide only implicit instantiation, which is
generalized to work for any types. This turns out to be quite powerful and
useful to address many limitations that show up in other GP mechanisms.
  This paper synthesizes the key ideas of implicits formally in a minimal and
general core calculus called the implicit calculus, and it shows how to build
source languages supporting implicit instantiation on top of it. A novelty of
the calculus is its support for partial resolution and higher-order rules (a
feature that has been proposed before, but was never formalized or
implemented). Ultimately, the implicit calculus provides a formal model of
implicits, which can be used by language designers to study and inform
implementations of similar mechanisms in their own languages.

controlled dependencies amongst components: This is obtained by replacing the
product of distributions by a product of matrices of distributions. The
statistical properties stemming from this construction are studied
theoretically: The landscape of the attainable dependence structure is
thoroughly depicted and a stationarity condition for time series is notably
obtained. The remapping of this framework onto that of Hidden Markov Models
enables us to devise an efficient and accurate practical synthesis procedure. A

solar masses and radii of <1 pc to ~2 pc. Many of the clumps are coincident
with indicators of current massive star formation, indicating that many of the
clumps are associated with deeply-embedded forming stars and star clusters. We
find that massive YSO-bearing clumps tend to be larger (>1 pc), more massive (M
> 10^3 solar masses), and have higher surface densities (~1 g cm^-2), while
clumps without signs of star formation are smaller (<1 pc), less massive (M <
10^3 solar masses), and have lower surface densities (~0.1 g cm^-2). The dearth
of massive (M >10^3 solar masses) clumps not bearing massive YSOs suggests the
onset of star formation occurs rapidly once the clump has attained physical
properties favorable to massive star formation. Using a large sample of LMC
massive YSO mid-IR spectra, we estimate that ~2/3 of the massive YSOs for which
there are Spitzer mid-IR spectra are no longer located in molecular clumps; we
estimate that these young stars/clusters have destroyed their natal clumps on a

from magnetar outbursts is now calling for a complete theoretical study of
outburst characteristics. In this letter (the first of a series dedicated to
model magnetar outbursts), we tackle the long-standing open issue of whether or
not short bursts and glitches are always connected to long-term radiative
outbursts. We show that the recent detection of short bursts and glitches
seemingly unconnected to outbursts is only misleading our understanding of
these events. We show that, in the framework of the starquake model, neutrino
emission processes in the magnetar crust limit the temperature, and therefore
the luminosity. This natural limit to the maximum luminosity makes outbursts
associated with bright persistent magnetars barely detectable. These events are
simply seen as a small luminosity increase over the already bright quiescent
state, followed by a fast return to quiescence. In particular, this is the case
for 1RXS J1708-4009, 1E 1841-045, SGR 1806-20, and other bright persistent
magnetars. On the other hand, a similar event (with the same energetics) in a
fainter source will drive a more extreme luminosity variation and longer
cooling time, as for sources such as XTE J1810-197, 1E 1547-5408 and SGR
1627-41. We conclude that the non-detection of large radiative outbursts in
connection with glitches and bursts from bright persistent magnetars is not
surprising per se, nor it needs of any revision on the glitches and burst
mechanisms as explained by current theoretical models.

`orientation' or 'evolutionary' - best accounts for the radio properties of BAL
quasars. Observations from 1.4 to 43 GHz have been obtained with the VLA and

  The fractions of candidate GHz-peaked sources are similar in the two samples

non-BAL QSOs. BAL and non-BAL QSOs show a large range of spectral indices,
consistent with a broad range of orientations. There is weak evidence (91%
confidence) that the spectral indices of the BAL QSOs are steeper than those of
non-BAL QSOs, mildly favouring edge-on orientations. At a higher level of
significance (\geq97%), the spectra of BAL QSOs are not flatter than those of
non-BAL QSOs, which suggests that a polar orientation is not preferred.

global states are determined by correlations between local measurements, (ii)

observations, and they provide important diagnostics of solar magnetic fields.
Inversion codes differ by numerical procedures, approximations of the
atmospheric model, and description of radiative transfer. Stokes Inversion
based on Response functions (SIR) is an implementation widely used by the solar
physics community. It allows to work with different atmospheric components,
where gradients of different physical parameters are possible, e.g., magnetic
field strength and velocities. The spectropolarimetric full-disk observations
were carried out with the Stokesmeter of the Solar Telescope for Operative
Predictions (STOP) at the Sayan Observatory on 3 February 2009, when neither an
active region nor any other extended flux concentration was present on the Sun.
In this study of quiet Sun magnetic fields, we apply the SIR code
simultaneously to 15 spectral lines. A tendency is found that weaker magnetic
field strengths occur closer to the limb. We explain this finding by the fact
that close to the limb, we are more sensitive to higher altitudes in an
expanding flux tube, where the field strength should be smaller since the
magnetic flux is conserved with height. Typically, the inversions deliver two
populations of magnetic elements: (1) high magnetic field strengths (1500-2000
G) and high temperatures (5500-6500 K) and (2) weak magnetic fields (50-150 G)
and low temperatures (5000-5300 K).

Entanglement preserves short range symmetry correlations after separation into

tree diagram final state. $\pi \pi$ isospin state with I=2 already is flavor
symmetric and suffers no symmetry constraint. Strange flavor-symmetric state
with V spin V=2 is linear combination of $K\pi$ and $K \eta$ with probability

neutral decays explains negligible tree-penguin interference and CP violation
in charged decays. Detailed full symmetry analysis shows constraints from
space-inversion, charge conjugation, Pauli antisymmetrization and flavor
symmetry. Two antiquarks produced at same space point by tree diagram have even
parity. Even parity final state requires even parity, even space symmetry and
color-spin antisymmetry for two $u$ quarks. Color-singlet spin-singlet final

for the propagation of a fracture in the caprock driven by the outflow of fluid
from a low-permeability aquifer. We show that to describe the fracture
propagation, it is necessary to solve the pressure diffusion problem in the
aquifer. We solve the problem numerically for the two-dimensional domain and
show that, after a relatively short time, the solution is close to that of
one-dimensional problem, which can be solved analytically. We use the relations
derived in the hydraulic fracture literature to relate the the width of the
fracture to its length and the flux into it, which allows us to obtain an
analytical expression for the fracture length as a function of time. Using
these results we predict the propagation of a hypothetical fracture at the In
Salah CO2 injection site to be as fast as a typical hydraulic fracture. We also
show that the hydrostatic and geostatic effects cause the increase of the
driving force for the fracture propagation and, therefore, our solution serves
as an estimate from below. Numerical estimates show that if a fracture appears,
it is likely that it will become a pathway for CO2 leakage.

creates not only an effective dipole moment allowing free-to-bound transitions
near the ^1S + ^3P_1 intercombination line but also facilitates bound-to-bound
transitions via resonantly coupled excited state rovibrational levels to deeply
bound rovibrational levels of the ground X^1\Sigma_g^+ potential, with v"" as
low as v""=6. The spin-orbit interaction is responsible for both optical
pathways. Therefore, those excited state levels that have the largest
bound-to-bound transition moments to deeply bound ground state levels also
exhibit a sufficient photoassociation probability, comparable to that of the
lowest weakly bound excited state level previously observed by Zelevinsky et

events are determined to be microlensing events, while the fourth is most
likely caused by stellar variability. For each of the three microlensing
events, the signal is almost entirely due to a brief caustic feature with
little or no lensing attributable mainly to the lens primary. One of these
events, MOA-bin-1, is due to a planet, and it is the first example of a
planetary event in which stellar host is only detected through binary
microlensing effects. The mass ratio and separation are q = 4.9 +- 1.4 x

standard Galactic model indicates that the planet, MOA-bin-1Lb, has a mass of

separation planets also has implications for interpretation of the isolated
planetary mass objects found by this analysis. If we assume that we have been
able to detect wide separation planets with a efficiency at least as high as
that for isolated planets, then we can set limits on the distribution on
planets in wide orbits. In particular, if the entire isolated planet sample

features. Our sample contains 67 members. The average radial velocity is <v_r>
= -29.1 +/- 1.3 km/s, in agreement with the previous radio measurements of HI
gas. The velocity distribution is Gaussian, indicating that VV124 is supported
primarily by velocity dispersion inside a radius of 1.5 kpc. Outside that
radius, our measurements provide only an upper limit of 8.6 km/s on any
rotation in the photometric disk-like feature. The velocity dispersion is
sigma_v = 9.4 +/- 1.0 km/s, from which we inferred a mass of M_1/2 = (2.1 +/-

M_sun/L_sun, both measured within the half-light radius. Thus, VV124 contains
dark matter. We also measured the metallicity distribution from neutral iron
lines. The average metallicity, <[Fe/H]> = -1.58 +/- 0.06, is consistent with
the mass-metallicity relation defined by dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The

unconventional criticality. This work studies the behavior at nonzero monopole

Determining the magnetic field morphology around an increasing number of
massive protostars at milliarcsecond resolution by observing 6.7-GHz methanol
masers is crucial to better understand the role of magnetic fields in massive
star formation.The First EVN Group consists of 4 massive star-forming

\hii ~regions from some of which molecular bipolar outflows were also detected
(W51-e2, G35.20-0.74N). Nine of the European VLBI Network antennas were used to
measure the linear polarization and Zeeman-splitting of the 6.7-GHz methanol
masers in the star-forming regions of the First EVN Group. We detected a total
of 154 CH3OH masers, one third of these towards W3(OH). Fractional linear
polarization (1.2-11.5%) was detected towards 55 masers. The linear
polarization vectors are well-ordered in all the massive star-forming regions.
We measured significant Zeeman-splitting in 3 massive star-forming regions
(W51, W48, and W3(OH)) revealing a range of separations -3.5 m/s<\Delta
V_{z}<3.8 m/s with the smallest |\Delta V_{z}|=0.4m/s. We were also able to

of quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over the full range of one-
and two-halo scales, 0.02-120 Mpc/h. This was achieved by combining data from
SDSS DR7 on large scales and Hennawi et al. (2006; with appropriate statistical
corrections) on small scales. Our combined clustering sample is the largest
spectroscopic quasar clustering sample to date, containing ~48,000 quasars in
the redshift range 0.4<z<2.5 with median redshift 1.4. We interpret these
precise 2PCF measurements within the halo occupation distribution (HOD)
framework and constrain the occupation functions of central and satellite
quasars in dark matter halos. In order to explain the small-scale clustering,
the HOD modeling requires that a small fraction of z~1.4 quasars,
fsat=(7.4+/-1.4) 10^(-4), be satellites in dark matter halos. At z~1.4, the
median masses of the host halos of central and satellite quasars are
constrained to be Mcen=(4.1+0.3/-0.4) 10^12 Msun/h and Msat=(3.6+0.8/-1.0)
10^14 Msun/h, respectively. To investigate the redshift evolution of the
quasar-halo relationship, we also perform HOD modeling of the projected 2PCF
measured by Shen et al. (2007) for SDSS quasars with median redshift 3.2. We
find tentative evidence for an increase in the mass scale of quasar host
halos---the inferred median mass of halos hosting central quasars at z~3.2 is
Mcen=(14.1+5.8/-6.9) 10^12 Msun/h. The cutoff profiles of the mean occupation
functions of central quasars reveal that quasar luminosity is more tightly
correlated with halo mass at higher redshifts. The average quasar duty cycle
around the median host halo mass is inferred to be fq=(7.3+0.6/-1.5) 10^(-4) at

terms of minimax problems over highly symmetric parameter spaces. In this
paper, we study minimax problems over l2-balls for high-dimensional linear
models with Gaussian predictors. We obtain sharp asymptotics for the minimax
risk that are applicable in any asymptotic setting where the number of
predictors diverges and prove that ridge regression is asymptotically minimax.
Adaptive asymptotic minimax ridge estimators are also identified. Orthogonal
invariance is heavily exploited throughout the paper and, beyond serving as a
technical tool, provides additional insight into the problems considered here.
Most of our results follow from an apparently novel analysis of an equivalent
non-Gaussian sequence model with orthogonally invariant errors. As with many
dense estimation and prediction problems, the minimax risk studied here has
rate d/n, where d is the number of predictors and n is the number of
observations; however, when d is roughly proportional to n the minimax risk is
influenced by the spectral distribution of the predictors and is notably
different from the linear minimax risk for the Gaussian sequence model
(Pinsker, 1980) that often appears in other dense estimation and prediction
problems.

communication systems when perfect channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT) is given while the equivalent channel state information at the receiver
(CSIR) is not available. Such an assumption is valid for the downlink
multi-user MIMO systems with linear precoders that depend on channels to all
receivers. We propose a concept called dual systems with zero-forcing designs
based on the duality principle, originally proposed to relate Gaussian
multi-access channels (MACs) and Gaussian broadcast channels (BCs). For the
two-user N*2 MIMO BC with N antennas at the transmitter and two antennas at
each of the receivers, we design a downlink interference cancellation (IC)
transmission scheme using the dual of uplink MAC systems employing IC methods.
The transmitter simultaneously sends two precoded Alamouti codes, one for each
user. Each receiver can zero-force the unintended user's Alamouti codes and
decouple its own data streams using two simple linear operations independent of
CSIR. Analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves a diversity gain of
2(N-1) for equal energy constellations with short-term power and rate
constraints. Power allocation between two users can also be performed, and it
improves the array gain but not the diversity gain. Numerical results
demonstrate that the bit error rate of the downlink IC scheme has a substantial
gain compared to the block diagonalization method, which requires global
channel information at each node.

three-dimensional 121-waveguide fan-out device capable of reformatting the
output of a 120 core multicore fiber (MCF) into a one-dimensional linear array.
When used in conjunction with an actual MCF, we demonstrate that the
reformatting function using this prototype would result in an overall
throughput loss of approximately 7.0 dB. However, if perfect coupling from the
MCF into the fan-out could be achieved, the reformatting function would result
in an overall loss of only approximately 1.7 dB. With adequate development,
similar devices could efficiently reformat the output of so-called ""photonic

which the ground state of the fractionalized excitations (fermionic spinons) is
topologically non-trivial. The spinons in topological Mott insulators are
coupled to an emergent compact U(1) gauge field with a so-called ""axion"" term.
We study the confinement transitions from the topological Mott insulator to
broken symmetry phases, which may occur via the condensation of dyons. Dyons
carry both ""electric"" and ""magnetic"" charges, and arise naturally in this
system because the monopoles of the emergent U(1) gauge theory acquires gauge
charge due to the axion term. It is shown that the dyon condensate, in general,
induces simultaneous current and bond orders. To demonstrate this, we study the
confined phase of the topological Mott insulator on the cubic lattice. When the
magnetic transition is driven by dyon condensation, we identify the bond order
as valence bond solid order and the current order as scalar spin chirality
order. Hence, the confined phase of the topological Mott insulator is an exotic
phase where the scalar spin chirality and the valence bond order coexist and
appear via a single transition. We discuss implications of our results for
generic models of topological Mott insulators.

leading term in the squeezed limit---going as 1/q^3, where q is the small
wavevector---but also the subleading one, going as 1/q^2. This term, for an
(n+1)-point function, is fixed in terms of the variation of the n-point
function under a special conformal transformation; this parallels the fact that
the 1/q^3 term is related with the scale dependence of the n-point function.
For the squeezed limit of the 3-point function, this conformal consistency
relation implies that there are no terms going as 1/q^2. We verify that the
squeezed limit of the 4-point function is related to the conformal variation of
the 3-point function both in the case of canonical slow-roll inflation and in
models with reduced speed of sound. In the second case the conformal
consistency conditions capture, at the level of observables, the relation among
operators induced by the non-linear realization of Lorentz invariance in the
Lagrangian. These results mean that, in any single-field model, primordial
correlation functions of \zeta are endowed with an SO(4,1) symmetry, with
dilations and special conformal transformations non-linearly realized by \zeta.
We also verify the conformal consistency relations for any n-point function in
models with a modulation of the inflaton potential, where the scale dependence
is not negligible. Finally, we generalize (some of) the consistency relations

neighboring bonds. As the bond occupation probability, $p$, is increased from
zero to unity, the system undergoes a transition from an insulating phase to a
metallic phase. When the lengthscale for the disorder, $l_d$, is much greater
than the coherence length, $l_c$, earlier analytical calculations of quantum
conduction on the Bethe lattice demonstrate that for $k=3$ the metal-insulator

disorder-driven quantum MITs. Here, we numerically compute the level spacing
distribution as a function of bond occupation probability $p$ and system size
on a Bethe-like lattice. The level spacing analysis suggests that for $k=0$,
$p_q$, the quantum percolation critical probability, is greater than $p_c$, the
geometrical percolation critical probability, and the transition is continuous.
In contrast, for $k=3$, $p_q=p_c$ and the transition is discontinuous such that

of the literature on host-pathogen coevolution focuses on this phenomenon, and
looks for consequent evidence of coevolutionary arms races. An alternative
strategy, less often considered in the literature, is to deter rapid
evolutionary change by the opponent. To study how this can be done, we
construct an evolutionary game between a controller that must process
information, and an adversary that can tamper with this information processing.
In this game, a species can foil its antagonist by processing information in a
way that is hard for the antagonist to manipulate. We show that the structure
of the information processing system induces a fitness landscape on which the
adversary population evolves, and that complex processing logic is required to
make that landscape rugged. Drawing on the rich literature concerning rates of
evolution on rugged landscapes, we show how a species can slow adaptive
evolution in the adversary population. We suggest that this type of defensive
complexity on the part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system may be an
important element of coevolutionary dynamics between pathogens and their

the Coulomb interaction. It is found that a small e-ph coupling constant
($\lambda ~ 0.2$) is enough to produce large orbital (=charge quadrupole
$O_{xz/yz}$) fluctuations, which causes the s-wave superconductivity without
sign reversal ($s_{++}$-wave state). The derived orbital fluctuations also
cause the instability toward the structure transition due to the bound state
formation of two orbitons with opposite momenta, which is called the
""two-orbiton process"". Moreover, impurity-induced non-local orbital order with
$C_2$-symmetry is obtained when the orbital fluctuations are strong. This
""impurity-induced nematic state"" explains the in-plane anisotropy of
resistivity in detwinned samples. We stress that (i)-(iii) are reproducible

Arabic corpus is used to extract the required lexical features of the document
words. The knowledge also includes syntactic rules based on part of speech tags
and allowed word sequences to extract the candidate keyphrases. In this work,
the abstract form of Arabic words is used instead of its stem form to represent
the candidate terms. The Abstract form hides most of the inflections found in
Arabic words. The paper introduces new features of keyphrases based on
linguistic knowledge, to capture titles and subtitles of a document. A simple
ANOVA test is used to evaluate the validity of selected features. Then, the
learning model is built using the LDA - Linear Discriminant Analysis - and
training documents. Although, the presented system is trained using documents
in the IT domain, experiments carried out show that it has a significantly
better performance than the existing Arabic extractor systems, where precision
and recall values reach double their corresponding values in the other systems
especially for lengthy and non-scientific articles.

is a (simple) graph G with degree sequence \pi. In this case, G is said to
realize or be a realization of \pi. Degree sequence results in the literature
generally fall into two classes: forcible problems, in which all realizations
of a graphic sequence must have a given property, and potential problems, in
which at least one realization of \pi must have the given property.
  Given a graph H, a graphic sequence \pi is potentially H-graphic if there is
some realization of \pi that contains H as a subgraph. In 1991, Erd\H{o}s,
Jacobson and Lehel posed the following question: Determine the minimum integer
\sigma(H,n) such that every n-term graphic sequence with sum at least
\sigma(H,n) is potentially H-graphic. As the sum of the terms of \pi is twice
the number of edges in any realization of \pi, the Erd\H{o}s-Jacobson-Lehel
problem can be viewed as a potential degree sequence relaxation of the
(forcible) Tur\'{a}n problem, wherein one wishes to determine the maximum
number of edges in a graph that contains no copy of H.
  While the exact value of \sigma(H,n) has been determined for a number of
specific classes of graphs (including cliques, cycles, complete bigraphs and
others), very little is known about the parameter for arbitrary H. In this
paper, we determine \sigma(H,n) asymptotically for all H, thereby providing an
Erd\H{o}s-Stone-Simonovits-type theorem for the Erd\H{o}s-Jacobson-Lehel

true for our human life, even for example entering a house needs legitimacy of

Khuller, Li, and Saha introduced the {\em machine activation} problem as a
generalization of the classical optimization problems of set cover and load
balancing on unrelated machines. In this problem, a set of $n$ jobs have to be
distributed among a set of $m$ (unrelated) machines, given the processing time
of each job on each machine, where each machine has a startup cost. The goal is
to produce a schedule of minimum total startup cost subject to a constraint
$\bf L$ on its makespan. While Khuller {\em et al} considered the offline
version of this problem, a typical scenario in scheduling is one where jobs
arrive online and have to be assigned to a machine immediately on arrival. We
give an $(O(\log (mn)\log m), O(\log m))$-competitive randomized online
algorithm for this problem, i.e. the schedule produced by our algorithm has a
makespan of $O({\bf L} \log m)$ with high probability, and a total expected
startup cost of $O(\log (mn)\log m)$ times that of an optimal offline schedule
with makespan $\bf L$. The competitive ratios of our algorithm are (almost)
optimal.
  Our algorithms use the online primal dual framework introduced by Alon {\em
et al} for the online set cover problem, and subsequently developed further by
Buchbinder, Naor, and co-authors. To the best of our knowledge, all previous
applications of this framework have been to linear programs (LPs) with either
packing or covering constraints. One novelty of our application is that we use
this framework for a mixed LP that has both covering and packing constraints.
We hope that the algorithmic techniques developed in this paper to
simultaneously handle packing and covering constraints will be useful for
solving other online optimization problems as well.

system LSI+61303 suggested that it is a precessing microquasar. In 2006, a set
of VLBA observations performed throughout the entire orbit of the system were
not used to study its precession because the changes in radio morphology could
tentatively be explained by the alternative pulsar model. However, a recent
radio spectral index data analysis has confirmed the predictions of the
two-peak microquasar model, which therefore does apply in LSI+61303. Aims: We
revisit the set of VLBA observations performed throughout the orbit to
determine the precession period and improve our understanding of the physical
mechanism behind the precession. Methods: By reanalyzing the VLBA data set, we
improve the dynamic range of images by a factor of four, using
self-calibration. Different fitting techniques are used and compared to
determine the peak positions in phase-referenced maps. Results: The improved
dynamic range shows that in addition to the images with a one-sided structure,
there are several images with a double-sided structure. The astrometry
indicates that the peak in consecutive images for the whole set of observations
describes a well-defined ellipse, 6-7 times larger than the orbit, with a
period of about 28 d. Conclusions: A double-sided structure is not expected to
be formed from the expanding shocked wind predicted in the pulsar scenario. In
contrast, a precessing microquasar model can explain the double- and one-sided
structures in terms of variable Doppler boosting. The ellipse defined by the
astrometry could be the cross-section of the precession cone, at the distance
of the 8.4 GHz-core of the steady jet, and 28d the precession period.

in the perception of relativity theory in Argentina, characterized by the
publication of a series of strictly scientific studies on this theory, in
parallel with presentations aimed at the general culture. In this work, we
attempt to relate this fracture with the advances made by Anti-Positivist ideas
in the higher echelons of Argentine culture. The new philosophical approach
configured a new vision of science that questioned the traditional methodology
of the experimental sciences and attributed to the theoretical sciences a more
prominent role than they had in the past. In this work, we present a detailed
account of a 1923 paper by Jos\'e B. Collo and Te\'ofilo Isnardi, two young
Argentine physicists trained in Germany, which is a representative contribution
to this new trend.

evolution can drive the refinement of a preexisting enzyme, such as the
evolution of efficient replicase activity. Here we present a model for what
was, arguably, an even earlier stage of chemical evolution, when polymer
sequence diversity was generated and sustained before, and during, the onset of
functional selection. The model includes regular environmental cycles (e.g.
hydration-dehydration cycles) that drive polymers between times of replication
and functional activity, which coincide with times of different monomer and
polymer diffusivity. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that this
proposed prebiotic scenario provides a robust mechanism for the exploration of
sequence space. Introduction of a polymer sequence with monomer synthetase
activity illustrates that functional sequences can become established in a
preexisting pool of otherwise non-functional sequences. Functional selection
does not dominate system dynamics and sequence diversity remains high,
permitting the emergence and spread of more than one functional sequence. It is
also observed that polymers spontaneously form clusters in simulations where
polymers diffuse more slowly than monomers, a feature that is reminiscent of a
previous proposal that the earliest stages of life could have been defined by
the collective evolution of a system-wide cooperation of polymer aggregates.
Overall, the results presented demonstrate the merits of considering plausible
prebiotic polymer chemistries and environments that would have allowed for the
rapid turnover of monomer resources and for regularly varying monomer/polymer
diffusivities.

relies on his current information state to adaptively select the most
``informative'' sensing action among the available ones. In this paper, using
results in dynamic programming, lower bounds for the optimal total cost are
established. The lower bounds characterize the fundamental limits on the
maximum achievable information acquisition rate and the optimal reliability.
Moreover, upper bounds are obtained via an analysis of two heuristic policies
for dynamic selection of actions. It is shown that the first proposed heuristic
achieves asymptotic optimality, where the notion of asymptotic optimality, due
to Chernoff, implies that the relative difference between the total cost
achieved by the proposed policy and the optimal total cost approaches zero as
the penalty of wrong declaration (hence the number of collected samples)
increases. The second heuristic is shown to achieve asymptotic optimality only
in a limited setting such as the problem of a noisy dynamic search. However, by
considering the dependency on the number of hypotheses, under a technical
condition, this second heuristic is shown to achieve a nonzero information
acquisition rate, establishing a lower bound for the maximum achievable rate

noise, the obtained nonzero rate and error exponent are shown to be maximum.

in a fair and efficient manner without using money? For in many scenarios it is
not feasible to use money to compensate agents for otherwise unsatisfactory
outcomes. This paper studies this question, looking at both fairness and
efficiency measures.
  We employ the proportionally fair solution, which is a well-known fairness
concept for money-free settings. But although finding a proportionally fair
solution is computationally tractable, it cannot be implemented in a truthful
fashion. Consequently, we seek approximate solutions. We give several truthful
mechanisms which achieve proportional fairness in an approximate sense. We use
a strong notion of approximation, requiring the mechanism to give each agent a
good approximation of its proportionally fair utility. In particular, one of
our mechanisms provides a better and better approximation factor as the minimum
demand for every good increases. A motivating example is provided by the
massive privatization auction in the Czech republic in the early 90s.
  With regard to efficiency, prior work has shown a lower bound of 0.5 on the
approximation factor of any swap-dictatorial mechanism approximating a social
welfare measure even for the two agents and multiple goods case. We surpass
this lower bound by designing a non-swap-dictatorial mechanism for this case.
Interestingly, the new mechanism builds on the notion of proportional fairness.

friction that is akin to the Coulombic dry fiction. No motion occurs when the
external field is weaker than the frictional resistance. However, with the
intervention of an external noise, a viscous friction like property emerges;
thus the sphere rolls with an uniform drift velocity that is proportional to
the applied field. As the sphere rolls, it rocks forward and backward resulting
in substantial fluctuation of displacement opposite to the net drift. The ratio
of the integrated probabilities of the negative to positive work fluctuations
decreases monotonically with the time of observation, from which a temperature
like intensive parameter can be estimated. This parameter conforms to the
Einstein's ratio of diffusivity and mobility that increases almost linearly,
even though the diffusivity increases super-linearly, with the strength of the
noise. A new barrier crossing experiment is introduced that can be performed
either with a hard (e.g. a steel ball) or with a soft (e.g. a water drop)
sphere in contact with a periodically undulated substrate. The frequency of
barrier crossing follows the classical transition state equation allowing a
direct estimation of the effective temperature. These experiments as well as
certain numerical simulations suggest that the effective temperature of a
system controlled by a non-linear friction may not have a unique value.

However, the largest source of error, systematics in the adopted isochrones, is
usually ignored and very rarely explicitly incorporated into the uncertainties.
I propose a process by which estimates of the uncertainties due to evolutionary
models can be incorporated into the SFH uncertainties. This process relies on
application of shifts in temperature and luminosity, the sizes of which must be
calibrated for the data being analyzed. While there are inherent limitations,
the ability to estimate the effect of systematic errors and include them in the
overall uncertainty is significant. Effects of this are most notable in the
case of shallow photometry, with which SFH measurements rely on evolved stars.

feed-back relationship between black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies.
Previous VLA observations have shown that the kpc-scale radio emission from
LBAs is dominated by starbursts. The main targets of this VLBI experiment were
selected because they possessed emission-line properties between starbursts and
Type 2 (obscured) AGN. Eight targets (three star-forming LBAs, four composite
LBAs, and one Type 1 AGN) were observed at 5 GHz, four of which were also
observed at 1.7 GHz. One star-forming LBA and one composite LBA were detected
above 5 \sigma at 1.7 GHz (only), while the AGN was detected at 5 GHz. In both
LBAs, the radio luminosity (LR) exceeds that expected from supernovae
(remnants) based on a comparison with Arp220, Arp229A and Mrk273, by factors of
2 - 8. The composite LBA exhibits a compact core emitting around 10% of the VLA
flux density. The high Tb of 3.5E7 K and excess core L_R with respect to the
L_R/L_X relation of radio-quiet AGN indicate that this LBA possesses an
obscured AGN (MBH ~ E5-E7 M_sun). While weak AGN may co-exist with the
starbursts as shown in at least one of the LBAs, their contribution to the
total radio flux is fairly minimal. Our results show that the detection of such
weak AGN presents a challenge at radio, X-ray and optical emission-line
wavelengths at z ~ 0.2, indicating the great difficulties that need to be
overcome in order to study similar processes at high redshift when these types
of galaxies were common.

and its determination through the angle resolved photo-emission spectroscopy
(ARPES) is discussed in detail. There are two schools of thoughts about the
pairing glue question: One argues that superconductivity in the cuprates
emerges out of doping the spin singlet resonating valence bond (RVB) state.
Since singlet pairs are already formed in the RVB state there is no need for
additional boson glue to pair the electrons. The other instead suggests that
the d-wave pairs are mediated by the collective bosons like the conventional
low $T_c$ SC with the alteration that the phonons are replaced by another kind
of bosons ranging from the antiferromagnetic (AF) to loop current fluctuations.
An approach to resolve this dispute is to determine the frequency and momentum
dependences of the diagonal and off-diagonal self-energies directly from
experiments like the McMillan-Rowell procedure for the conventional SC. In that
a simple d-wave BCS theory describes superconducting properties of the cuprates
well, the Eliashberg analysis of well designed high resolution experimental
data will yield the crucial frequency and momentum dependences of the
self-energies. This line of approach using ARPES are discussed in more detail
in this review, and some remaining problems are commented.

inflation model building, yet constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background
measurements alone are insufficient to place bounds stringent enough to be
appreciably effective. For the very small scale spectrum, those which subtend
angles of less than 0.3 degrees on the sky, an upper bound can be extracted
from the astrophysical constraints on the possible production of primordial
black holes in the early universe. A recently discovered observational
by-product of an enhanced power spectrum on small scales, induced gravitational
waves, have been shown to be within the range of proposed space based
gravitational wave detectors; such as NASA's LISA and BBO detectors, and the
Japanese DECIGO detector. In this paper we explore the impact such a detection
would have on models of inflation known to lead to an enhanced power spectrum
on small scales, namely the Hilltop-type and running mass models. We find that
the Hilltop-type model can produce observable induced gravitational waves
within the range of BBO and DECIGO for integral and fractional powers of the
potential within a reasonable number of e-folds. We also find that the running
mass model can produce a spectrum within the range of these detectors, but
require that inflation terminates after an unreasonably small number of
e-folds. Finally, we argue that if the thermal history of the Universe were to
accomodate such a small number of e-folds the Running Mass Model can produce
Primordial Black Holes within a mass range compatible with Dark Matter, i.e.
within a mass range 10^{20}g< M_{BH}<10^{27}g.

sliding. Using computer simulations we examine how the concentration and
susceptibility of motors contribute to their collective behavior and interplay
with the network connectivity to regulate macroscopic contractility. Our model

model which captures the notion of algorithm is computationally equivalent to
the Turing machine. This equivalence usually holds both at a computability

However, the situation is less clear in what concerns models of computation
using real numbers, and no analog of the Church-Turing thesis exists for this
case. Recently it was shown that some models of computation with real numbers
were equivalent from a computability perspective. In particular it was shown
that Shannon's General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) is equivalent to
Computable Analysis. However, little is known about what happens at a
computational complexity level. In this paper we shed some light on the
connections between this two models, from a computational complexity level, by
showing that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can
be simulated by GPACs, without the need of using more (space) resources than
those used in the original Turing computation, as long as we are talking about
bounded computations. In other words, computations done by the GPAC are as
space-efficient as computations done in the context of Computable Analysis.

distributions for ground and excited states of $^{57}$Zn are calculated in the
domain of proton-neutron Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (pn-QRPA)
theory. No experimental insertions were made (as usually made in other pn-QRPA
calculations of B(GT) strength function) to check the performance of the model
for proton-rich nuclei. The calculated ground-state B(GT) strength distribution
is in good agreement with measurements and shows differences with the earlier
reported shell model calculation. The pn-QRPA model reproduced the measured
low-lying strength for $^{57}$Zn better in comparison to the KB3G interaction
used in the large-scale shell model calculation. The stellar weak rates are
sensitive to the location and structure of these low-lying states in daughter
$^{57}$Cu. The primary mechanism for producing such nuclei is the rp-process
and is believed to be important in the dynamics of the collapsing supermassive
stars. Small changes in the binding and excitation energies can lead to
significant modifications of the predictions for the synthesis of proton rich
isotopes. The $\beta^{+}$-decay and electron capture (EC) rates on $^{57}$Zn
are compared to the seminal work of Fuller, Fowler and Newman (FFN). The
pn-QRPA calculated $\beta^{+}$-decay rates are generally in good agreement with
the FFN calculation. However at high stellar temperatures the calculated
$\beta^{+}$-decay rates are almost half of FFN rates. On the other hand, for
rp-process conditions, the calculated electron capture ($\beta^{+}$-decay)
rates are bigger than FFN rates by more than a factor 2 (1.5) and may have

states Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions, both in the electron capture
and electron decay direction, for $^{54,55,56}$Fe. The associated electron and
positron capture rates for these isotopes of iron are also calculated in
stellar matter. These calculations were recently introduced and this paper is a
follow-up which discusses in detail the GT strength distributions and stellar
capture rates of key iron isotopes. The calculations are performed within the
framework of the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation
(pn-QRPA) theory. The pn-QRPA theory allows a microscopic
\textit{state-by-state} calculation of GT strength functions and stellar
capture rates which greatly increases the reliability of the results. For the
first time experimental deformation of nuclei are taken into account. In the
core of massive stars isotopes of iron, $^{54,55,56}$Fe, are considered to be
key players in decreasing the electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{e}$) mainly via
electron capture on these nuclide. The structure of the presupernova star is
altered both by the changes in $Y_{e}$ and the entropy of the core material.
Results are encouraging and are compared against measurements (where possible)
and other calculations. The calculated electron capture rates are in overall
good agreement with the shell model results. During the presupernova evolution
of massive stars, from oxygen shell burning stages till around end of
convective core silicon burning, the calculated electron capture rates on
$^{54}$Fe are around three times bigger than the corresponding shell model
rates. The calculated positron capture rates, however, are suppressed by two to
five orders of magnitude.

determine the density of the resulting free magnetic moments in the zero
temperature limit. While it is finite on the insulating side of the AMIT, it
vanishes at the AMIT, and decays with a power law as function of the distance

rate as function of temperature. We find a phase diagram with finite

be of class $L^p(\Sigma)$ for $p>m$ if and only if the local graph
representations of $\Sigma$ have second order derivatives in $L^p$ and $\Sigma$
is embedded. There are two ingredients behind this result. One of them is an
equivalent definition of Sobolev spaces, widely used nowadays in analysis on
metric spaces. The second one is a careful analysis of local Reifenberg
flatness (and of the decay of functions measuring that flatness) for sets with
finite curvature energies. In addition, for the geometric curvature energy
involving tangent spheres we provide a nontrivial lower bound that is attained
if and only if the admissible set $\Sigma$ is a round sphere.

critical; due to the criticality of the resources in the sensor nodes as well
as due to their ubiquitous and pervasive deployment, with varying attributes
and degrees of security required. The proliferation of the next generation
sensor nodes, has not solved this problem, because of the greater emphasis on
low-cost deployment. In addition, the WSNs use data-centric multi-hop
communication that in turn, necessitates the security support to be devised at
the link layer (increasing the cost of security related operations), instead of
being at the application layer, as in general networks. Therefore, an
energy-efficient link layer security framework is necessitated. There do exists
a number of link layer security architectures that offer some combinations of
the security attributes desired by different WSN applications. However, as we
show in this paper, none of them is responsive to the actual security demands
of the applications. Therefore, we believe that there is a need for

in-network processing, which aims at reducing effectively, the total number of

largely employs data aggregation operations that aggregate the data into a
compact representation for further transmission. However, due to the ubiquitous

due to the stringent resource constraints in WSN nodes, the security concerns
in WSNs are even otherwise critical. These concerns assume alarming proportions
when using data aggregation in which the output of the data aggregator nodes
depends on that of various other nodes. Hence, the protocols for data
aggregation have to carefully devised with a constant vigil on ensuring

applications ranging from medicine to paleoclimatology, a solid theoretical
foundation of the method has still been missing so far. Here, we interpret an
$\varepsilon$-recurrence network as a discrete subnetwork of a ""continuous""
graph with uncountably many vertices and edges corresponding to the system's
attractor. This step allows us to show that various statistical measures
commonly used in complex network analysis can be seen as discrete estimators of
newly defined continuous measures of certain complex geometric properties of
the attractor on the scale given by $\varepsilon$.} In particular, we introduce
local measures such as the $\varepsilon$-clustering coefficient, mesoscopic
measures such as $\varepsilon$-motif density, path-based measures such as
$\varepsilon$-betweennesses, and global measures such as
$\varepsilon$-efficiency. This new analytical basis for the so far
heuristically motivated network measures also provides an objective criterion
for the choice of $\varepsilon$ via a percolation threshold, and it shows that
estimation can be improved by so-called node splitting invariant versions of
the measures. We finally illustrate the framework for a number of archetypical
chaotic attractors such as those of the Bernoulli and logistic maps, periodic
and two-dimensional quasi-periodic motions, and for hyperballs and hypercubes,
by deriving analytical expressions for the novel measures and comparing them
with data from numerical experiments. More generally, the theoretical framework
put forward in this work describes random geometric graphs and other networks

Translation has recently been put forward as an important mode of convection of
the inner core. Combined with a simple diffusive grain growth model, this
mechanism is able to explain the observed seismic asymmetry, but not the bulk
anisotropy. The source of anisotropy has therefore to be sought in the shear
motions caused by higher modes of convection. Using a hybrid finite-difference
spherical harmonics Navier-Stokes solver, we investigate the interplay between
translation and convection in a 3D spherical model with permeable boundary
conditions at the inner core boundary. Three parameters act independently:
viscosity, internal heating and convection velocity in the outer core. Our
numerical simulations show the dominance of pure translation for viscosities of
the inner core higher than $10^{20}$ Pas. Translation is almost completely
hampered by convective motions for viscosities lower than $10^{18}$ Pas.
Between these values, translation and convection develop, but convective
downwellings are restricted to the coldest hemisphere where crystallization
occurs. On the opposite side, shear is almost absent, thereby allowing grain
growth. We propose that the coexistence of translation and convection observed
in our numerical models leads to a seismic asymmetry but localizes deformation
only in one hemisphere.

different multiple scale perturbation methods are applied to derive a

smaller than the front width. Then, a second order averaging method must be
applied. These analytical results are capable to predict propagation failure,
velocity overshoot, and the asymptotic value for the front velocity in the

  We examined the properties of growth efficiency using a metabolic model for
Eschericia coli. We found that the maximal growth efficiency is obtained at a
finite nutrient uptake rate. The rate is substrate-dependent and it typically
does not exceed 20 mmol/h/gDW. We further examined whether the maximal growth
efficiency could serve as a cellular objective function in metabolic network
analysis, and found that cellular growth in batch cultivation can be predicted
reasonably well under this assumption. The fit to experimental data was found
slightly better than with the commonly used objective function of maximal
growth rate.
  Based on our results, we suggest that the maximal growth efficiency can be
considered as a plausible optimization criterion in metabolic modeling for E.
coli. In the future, it would be interesting to study growth efficiency as a
cellular objective also in other cellular systems and under different

detectable in external galaxies, and may ideally serve as kinematic tracers of
Galactic structure. Some RSGs are surrounded by circumstellar envelopes
detectable by their dust and molecular and, in particular, maser emission. This
study consists of a search for maser emission from silicon monoxide (SiO)
toward a significant number of RSGs that are members of massive stellar
clusters, many of which have only recently been discovered. Further, we aim to
relate the occurrence of maser action to properties of the host stars.
  Methods. Using the IRAM 30 meter telescope, we searched for maser emission in
the J = 2 - 1 rotational transition within the first vibrationally excited
state of SiO toward a sample of 88 RSGs.
  Results. With an average rms noise level of 0.25 Jy, we detected maser
emission in 15% of the sample, toward most of the sources for the first time in
this transition. The peak of the emission provides accurate radial velocities

We, furthermore, study particle distributions in the strongly interacting

distributions, abundances of the different parton species and their
fluctuations (scaled variance, skewness, and kurtosis) in equilibrium. We also
compare the results of the microscopic calculations with the ansatz of the

spectral function shows a slightly different shape due to the explicit

observables are found to be shorter than those for the average values.
Furthermore, in the local subsystem, a strong change of the fluctuation
observables with the size of the local volume is observed. These fluctuations
no longer correspond to those of the full system and are reduced to Poissonian

yielding a proof of inadmissibility, even when the dimension, $p$, is much
larger than $p=3$. We then extend the geometric idea to yield increasingly
persuasive arguments for inadmissibility when $p\geq3$, albeit at the cost of
increased geometric and computational detail.

euclidean spaces. Motivated by the analysis of flows on manifolds and
homogeneous spaces, we investigate algebras arising from flat connections with

associated with euclidean geometry, post-Lie algebras occur naturally in the
differential geometry of homogeneous spaces, and are also closely related to
Cartan's method of moving frames. Lie--Butcher series combine Butcher series
with Lie series and are used to analyze flows on manifolds. In this paper we
show that Lie--Butcher series are founded on post-Lie algebras. The functorial
relations between post-Lie algebras and their enveloping algebras, called
D-algebras, are explored. Furthermore, we develop new formulas for computations

striking possibility of money that cannot be counterfeited according to the
laws of physics. We propose the first quantum money scheme that is (1)
public-key, meaning that anyone can verify a banknote as genuine, not only the
bank that printed it, and (2) cryptographically secure, under a ""classical""
hardness assumption that has nothing to do with quantum money. Our scheme is
based on hidden subspaces, encoded as the zero-sets of random multivariate
polynomials. A main technical advance is to show that the ""black-box"" version
of our scheme, where the polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is
unconditionally secure. Previously, such a result had only been known relative
to a quantum oracle (and even there, the proof was never published). Even in
Wiesner's original setting -- quantum money that can only be verified by the
bank -- we are able to use our techniques to patch a major security hole in
Wiesner's scheme. We give the first private-key quantum money scheme that
allows unlimited verifications and that remains unconditionally secure, even if
the counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank. Our money scheme is
simpler than previous public-key quantum money schemes, including a knot-based
scheme of Farhi et al. The verifier needs to perform only two tests, one in the
standard basis and one in the Hadamard basis -- matching the original intuition
for quantum money, based on the existence of complementary observables. Our
security proofs use a new variant of Ambainis's quantum adversary method, and
several other tools that might be of independent interest.

synchronization techniques. These include conventional pessimistic locking, as
well as optimistic techniques based on conditional synchronization primitives
or transactional memory. Yet, it is unclear which of these approaches better
leverage the concurrency inherent to multi-cores.
  In this paper, we compare the level of concurrency one can obtain by
converting a sequential program into a concurrent one using optimistic or
pessimistic techniques. To establish fair comparison of such implementations,
we introduce a new correctness criterion for concurrent programs, defined
independently of the synchronization techniques they use.
  We treat a program's concurrency as its ability to accept a concurrent
schedule, a metric inspired by the theories of both databases and transactional
memory. We show that pessimistic locking can provide strictly higher
concurrency than transactions for some applications whereas transactions can
provide strictly higher concurrency than pessimistic locks for others. Finally,
we show that combining the benefits of the two synchronization techniques can
provide strictly more concurrency than any of them individually. We propose a
list-based set algorithm that is optimal in the sense that it accepts all
correct concurrent schedules. As we show via experimentation, the optimality in
terms of concurrency is reflected by scalability gains.

300K to 930K. These experimental results provide a first evidence of the role
of thermal fluctuation in XANES at the Al K-edge especially in the pre-edge
region. The study is carried out by polarized XANES measurements of single
crystals. For any orientation of the sample with respect to the x-ray beam, the
pre-edge peak grows and shifts to lower energy with temperature. In addition
temperature induces modifications in the position and intensities of the main
XANES features. First-principles DFT calculations are performed for both
compounds. They show that the pre-edge peak originates from forbidden 1s to 3s
transitions induced by vibrations. Three existing theoretical models are used
to take vibrations into account in the absorption cross section calculations:
i) an average of the XANES spectra over the thermal displacements of the
absorbing atom around its equilibrium position, ii) a method based on the crude
Born-Oppenheimer approximation where only the initial state is averaged over
thermal displacements, iii) a convolution of the spectra obtained for the atoms
at the equilibrium positions with an approximate phonon spectral function. The
theoretical spectra so obtained permit to qualitatively understand the origin
of the spectral modifications induced by temperature. However the correct
treatment of thermal fluctuation in XANES spectroscopy requires more

theory of $\mathfrak{S}_{n}$ motivated me to think about the notebook, too.
This article summarizes these ideas.

functional dependencies of the large-$t$ elastic scattering suggested by the
recent data from the TOTEM experiment. It is shown that Orear exponent is in a
better agreement with the data than the power-like dependence used by the
TOTEM. This implies that the collective dynamics is dominating over the
point-like mechanism related to the scattering of the proton constituents.

"1203.5247","Boris Zilbergleyt","B. Zilbergleyt","Thermodynamic Branch in the Chemical System Response to External Impact","6 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  The paper gives an account of a detailed investigation of the thermodynamic
branch as a path of the chemical system deviation from its isolated
thermodynamic equilibrium under an external impact. For a combination of direct
and reverse reactions in the same chemical system, full thermodynamic branch is
presented by an S-shaped curve, whose ends asymptotically achieve appropriate
initial states, which, in turn, are logistic ends of the opposite reactions.
The slope tangents of the steepest parts of the curves, the areas of the
maximum rate of the shift growth vs. the external thermodynamic force, occurred
to be directly proportional to the force and, simultaneously, linearly
proportional to the thermodynamic equivalent of chemical reaction, which is the
ratio between the amount in moles of any reaction participant, transformed in
an isolated system, along the reaction way from its initial state to
thermodynamic equilibrium, to its stoichiometric coefficient. The found
linearity is valid for arbitrary combination of the stoichiometric coefficients
in a reaction of compound synthesis from chemical elements like aA+bB=AaBb, and
confirms the exclusive role of the thermodynamic equivalent of transformation
as the chemical system characteristic of robustness and irreversibility.
Results of this work allow for quantitative evaluation of the chemical system
shift from thermodynamic equilibrium along thermodynamic branch and its rate
vs. the shifting force. Such an investigation became possible due to the
development of discrete thermodynamics of chemical equilibria.
