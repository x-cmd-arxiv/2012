Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, that is, the calculation of averages of functions
of the position coordinates of a molecular $N$-body system modelled at constant
temperature. We show how a formal series expansion of the invariant measure of
a Langevin dynamics numerical method can be obtained in a straightforward way
using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff lemma. We then compare Langevin dynamics
integrators in terms of their invariant distributions and demonstrate a
superconvergence property (4th order accuracy where only 2nd order would be
expected) of one method in the high friction limit; this method, moreover, can
be reduced to a simple modification of the Euler-Maruyama method for Brownian
dynamics involving a non-Markovian (coloured noise) random process. In the
Brownian dynamics case, 2nd order accuracy of the invariant density is
achieved. All methods considered are efficient for molecular applications
(requiring one force evaluation per timestep) and of a simple form. In fully
resolved (long run) molecular dynamics simulations, for our favoured method, we
observe up to two orders of magnitude improvement in configurational sampling
accuracy for given stepsize with no evident reduction in the size of the
largest usable timestep compared to common alternative methods.

of isotropic turbulence. There, the analytical expression of the structure
function of the longitudinal velocity difference $\Delta u_r$ is derived
through a statistical analysis of the Fourier transformed Navier-Stokes
equations, and by means of considerations regarding the scales of the velocity
fluctuations, which arise from the Kolmogorov theory. Due to these latter
considerations, this Lyapunov analysis seems to need some of the results of the
Kolmogorov theory.
  This work proposes a more rigorous demonstration which leads to the same
structure function, without using the Kolmogorov scale. This proof assumes that
pair and triple longitudinal correlations are sufficient to determine the
statistics of $\Delta u_r$, and adopts a reasonable canonical decomposition of
the velocity difference in terms of proper stochastic variables which are
adequate to describe the mechanism of kinetic energy cascade.

We analyze the surroundings of HD 97300, one of two intermediate-mass
stars in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. The star is known to be
surrounded by a conspicuous ring of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
  Methods. We present infrared images taken with Herschel and Spitzer using 11
different broad-band filters between 3.6 um and 500 um. We compare the
morphology of the emission using cuts along different position angles. We
construct spectral energy distributions, which we compare to different dust
models, and calculate dust temperatures. We also derive opacity maps and
analyze the density structure of the environment of HD 97300.
  Results. We find that HD 97300 has no infrared excess at or below 24 um,
confirming its zero-age main-sequence nature. The morphology of the ring is
very similar between 3.6 um and 24 um. The emission at these wavelengths is
dominated by either PAH features or PAH continuum. At longer wavelengths, only
the northwestern part of the ring is visible. A fit to the 100-500 um
observations suggests that the emission is due to relatively warm (~26 K) dust.
The temperature gradually decreases with increasing distance from the ring. We
find a general decrease in the density from north to south, and an approximate
10% density increase in the northeastern part of the ring.
  Conclusions. Our results are consistent with the theory that the ring around
HD 97300 is essentially a bubble blown into the surrounding interstellar matter
and heated by the star.

counting for different range spaces is a central problem in Computational

  We study $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithms for range
counting. Our main results are for the range space given by hyperplanes, that
is, the halfspace counting problem. We present an $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differentially private algorithm for halfspace counting in $d$
dimensions which achieves $O(n^{1-1/d})$ average squared error. This contrasts
with the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound established by the classical result of Dinur
and Nissim [PODS 2003] for arbitrary subset counting queries. We also show a
matching lower bound on average squared error for any $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differentially private algorithm for halfspace counting. Both bounds
are obtained using discrepancy theory. For the lower bound, we use a modified
discrepancy measure and bound approximation of $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differentially private algorithms for range counting queries in terms
of this discrepancy. We also relate the modified discrepancy measure to
classical combinatorial discrepancy, which allows us to exploit known
discrepancy lower bounds. This approach also yields a lower bound of
$\Omega((\log n)^{d-1})$ for $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private
orthogonal range counting in $d$ dimensions, the first known superconstant
lower bound for this problem. For the upper bound, we use an approach inspired
by partial coloring methods for proving discrepancy upper bounds, and obtain
$(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithms for range counting with

calculated as function of the electron energy or the wire length by adopting
the spinresolved lattice Green function method. For a single disordered Rashba
wire, it is found that the charge conductance quantization is destroyed by the
edge disorder. However, a nonzero spin conductance can be generated and its
amplitude can be manipulated by the wire length, which is attributed to the
broken structure symmetries and the spin-dependent quantum interference induced
by the rough boundaries. For a large ensemble of disordered Rashba wires, the
average charge conductance decreases monotonically, however, the average spin
conductance increases to a maximum value and then decreases, with increasing
wire length. Further study shows that the influence of the rough edges on the
charge and spin conductances can be eliminated by applying a perpendicular
magnetic field to the wire. In addition, a very large magnitude of the spin
conductance can be achieved when the electron energy lies between the two
thresholds of each pair of subbands. These findings may not only benefit to
further apprehend the transport properties of the Rashba low-dimensional

  Models for the Web Graph (WAW 2012)",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many social networks, e.g., Slashdot and Twitter, can be represented as
directed graphs (digraphs) with two types of links between entities: mutual
(bi-directional) and one-way (uni-directional) connections. Social science
theories reveal that mutual connections are more stable than one-way
connections, and one-way connections exhibit various tendencies to become
mutual connections. It is therefore important to take such tendencies into
account when performing clustering of social networks with both mutual and
one-way connections.
  In this paper, we utilize the dyadic methods to analyze social networks, and
develop a generalized mutuality tendency theory to capture the tendencies of
those node pairs which tend to establish mutual connections more frequently
than those occur by chance. Using these results, we develop a
mutuality-tendency-aware spectral clustering algorithm to identify more stable
clusters by maximizing the within-cluster mutuality tendency and minimizing the
cross-cluster mutuality tendency. Extensive simulation results on synthetic
datasets as well as real online social network datasets such as Slashdot,
demonstrate that our proposed mutuality-tendency-aware spectral clustering
algorithm extracts more stable social community structures than traditional
spectral clustering methods.

an important but challenging task, which can be facilitated by exploiting
structural properties of the process. In certain applications, the observed
processes are underspread, i.e., their time and frequency correlations exhibit
a reasonably fast decay, and approximately time-frequency sparse, i.e., a
reasonably large percentage of the spectral values is small. For this class of
processes, we propose a compressive estimator of the discrete Rihaczek spectrum
(RS). This estimator combines a minimum variance unbiased estimator of the RS
(which is a smoothed Rihaczek distribution using an appropriately designed
smoothing kernel) with a compressed sensing technique that exploits the
approximate time-frequency sparsity. As a result of the compression stage, the
number of measurements required for good estimation performance can be
significantly reduced. The measurements are values of the discrete ambiguity
function of the observed signal at randomly chosen time and frequency lag
positions. We provide bounds on the mean-square estimation error of both the
minimum variance unbiased RS estimator and the compressive RS estimator, and we
demonstrate the performance of the compressive estimator by means of simulation
results. The proposed compressive RS estimator can also be used for estimating
other time-dependent spectra (e.g., the Wigner-Ville spectrum) since for an
underspread process most spectra are almost equal.

ion-loading conditions with a significant space-charge effect, ions form a ring
profile with a maximum at the outer region of the trap, whereas they are
localized near the center axis region at low loading of the ions. These results
are explained quantitatively by a model calculation based on equilibrium
between the space-charge-induced potential and the effective potential of the
multipole rf field. The maximum adiabaticity parameter \eta_max is estimated to
be about 0.13 for the high ion-density condition in the present octopole ion

is probably due to additional instability caused by the space charge.

make reasonable decisions in the absence of perfect answers. For example,
reliably detecting a malfunctioning server using a distributed collection of
system logs does not require analyzing every request processed by the system.
Based on this insight, BlinkDB allows one to trade-off query accuracy for
response time, enabling interactive queries over massive data by running
queries on data samples and presenting results annotated with meaningful error
bars. To achieve this, BlinkDB uses two key ideas that differentiate it from
previous work in this area: (1) an adaptive optimization framework that builds
and maintains a set of multi-dimensional, multi-resolution samples from
original data over time, and (2) a dynamic sample selection strategy that
selects an appropriately sized sample based on a query's accuracy and/or
response time requirements. We have built an open-source version of BlinkDB and
validated its effectiveness using the well-known TPC-H benchmark as well as a
real-world analytic workload derived from Conviva Inc. Our experiments on a 100
node cluster show that BlinkDB can answer a wide range of queries from a
real-world query trace on up to 17 TBs of data in less than 2 seconds (over

statistically significant overdensity of massive young sources emerges in the
region of the bubble rims, possibly indicating the occurrence of triggered star
formation. Based on numbers of bubble-associated RMS sources we find that
67+/-3% of MYSOs and (ultra)compact H II regions appear associated with a

formed as a result of feedback from expanding H II regions. Using MYSO-bubble
correlations, we serendipitously recovered the location of the recently
discovered massive cluster Mercer 81, suggesting the potential of such analyses

most energetic shocks. A survey of many southern masers at 36 and 44 GHz
suggests that these two transitions are highly complementary. The 23.4 GHz
maser is a new type of rare class I methanol maser, detected only in two

behaviour similar to 9.9, 25 and 104 GHz masers. Interferometric positions
suggest that shocks responsible for class I masers could arise from a range of
phenomena, not merely an outflow scenario. For example, some masers might be
caused by interaction of an expanding HII region with its surrounding molecular
cloud. This has implications for evolutionary sequences incorporating class I
methanol masers if they appear more than once during the evolution of the

concentrations and vortices play an important role for the dissipation of
energy in space and astrophysical plasma. Within this work we investigate the
relation between current sheets and vortex sheets in incompressible, stationary
equilibria. For this approach it is helpful that the similar mathematical
structure of magnetohydrostatics and stationary incompressible hydrodynamics
allows us to transform static equilibria into stationary ones. The main control
function for such a transformation is the profile of the Alfven-Mach number
M_A, which is always constant along magnetic field lines, but can change from
one field line to another. In the case of a global constant M_A, vortices and
electric current concentrations are parallel. More interesting is the nonlinear
case, where M_A varies perpendicular to the field lines. This is a typical
situation at boundary layers like the magnetopause, heliopause, the solar wind
flowing around helmet streamers and at the boundary of solar coronal holes. The
corresponding current and vortex sheets show in some cases also an alignment,
but not in every case. For special density distributions in 2D it is possible

aligned-flows can also exist without strong current sheets, taking the limit of
small Alfven Mach numbers into account. The current sheet can vanish if the
Alfven Mach number is (almost) constant and the density gradient is large
across some boundary layer. It should be emphasized that the used theory is not
only valid for small Alfven Mach numbers M_A<<1, but also for M_A~1. Connection
to other theoretical approaches and observations and physical effects in space

investigations of current sheets and vortex sheets are given.

Accepted by PRD",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.85.083507",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stable massive neutral particles emitted by astrophysical sources undergo
deflection under the gravitational potential of our own galaxy. The deflection
angle depends on the particle velocity and therefore non-relativistic particles
will be deflected more than relativistic ones. If these particles can be
detected through neutrino telescopes, cosmic ray detectors or directional dark
matter detectors, their arrival directions would appear aligned on the sky
along the source-lens direction. On top of this deflection, the arrival
direction of non-relativistic particles is displaced with respect to the
relativistic counterpart also due to the relative motion of the source with
respect to the observer; this induces an alignment of detections along the sky
projection of the source trajectory. The final alignment will be given by a
combination of the directions induced by lensing and source proper motion. We
derive the deflection-velocity relation for the Milky Way halo and suggest that
searching for alignments on detection maps of particle telescopes could be a
way to find new particles or new astrophysical phenomena.

a super-Alfvenic tail flow. An example is our own heliosphere and its
heliotail. We present an analytical method of calculating stationary,
incompressible, and field-aligned plasma flows in the astrotail of a star. We
present a recipe for constructing an astrosphere with the help of only a few
parameters, like the inner Alfven Mach number and the outer Alfven Mach number,
the magnetic field strength within and outside the stellar wind cavity, and the
distribution of singular points of the magnetic field within these flows.
Within the framework of a one-fluid approximation, it is possible to obtain
solutions of the MHD equations for stationary flows from corresponding static
MHD equilibria, by using noncanonical mappings of the canonical variables. The
canonical variables are the Euler potentials of the magnetic field of
magnetohydrostatic equilibria. Thus we start from static equilibria determined
by the distribution of magnetic neutral points, and assume that the Alfven Mach
number for the corresponding stationary equilibria is finite. The topological
structure determines the geometrical structure of the interstellar gas -
stellar wind interface. Additional boundary conditions like the outer magnetic
field and the jump of the magnetic field across the astropause allow
determination of the noncanonical transformations. This delivers the strength
of the magnetic field at every point in the astrotail region beyond the reverse
shock. The mathematical technique for describing such a scenario is applied to
astrospheres in general, but is also relevant for the heliosphere. It shows the
restrictions of the outer and the inner magnetic field strength in comparison
with the corresponding Alfven Mach numbers in the case of subalfvenic flows.

twofold, on one hand, we give the right setting for doing the calculus of
variations (including min max methods) of such functionals for immersions into
manifolds and, on the other hand, we prove existence results for possibly
branched Willmore spheres under various constraints (prescribed homotopy class,
prescribed area) or under curvature assumptions for M^m. To this aim, using the
integrability by compensation, we develop first the regularity theory for the
critical points of such functionals. We then prove a rigidity theorem
concerning the relation between CMC and Willmore spheres. Then we prove that,
for every non null 2-homotopy class, there exists a representative given by a
Lipschitz map from the 2-sphere into M^m realizing a connected family of
conformal smooth (possibly branched) area constrained Willmore spheres (as
explained in the introduction, this comes as a natural extension of the minimal
immersed spheres in homotopy class constructed by Sacks and Uhlembeck in
\cite{SaU}, in situations when they do not exist). Moreover, for every A>0 we
minimize the Willmore functional among connected families of weak, possibly
branched, immersions of the 2-sphere having prescribed total area equal to A
and we prove full regularity for the minimizer. Finally, under a mild curvature
condition on (M^m,h), we minimize the sum of the area with the square of the
L^2 norm of the second fundamental form, among weak possibly branched
immersions of the two sphere and we prove the regularity of the minimizer.

$\omega_{p}$ is the plasma frequency. These unstable modes are parametrically
coupled to each other due to the RF and are a mix between two--stream and

linearization of the kinetic equations for a beam--plasma system as well as the
Maxwell equations. In order to highlight the effect of the radiation field we
present a comparison of our analytical and numerical results obtained for
nonzero RF with those for vanishing RF. Assuming that the drift velocity
$\mathbf{u}_{b}$ of the beam is parallel to the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ of the
excitations two particular transversal and parallel configurations of the
polarization vector $\mathbf{E}_{0}$ of the RF with respect to $\mathbf{k}$ are

nonresonant couplings between different modes are possible. The largest growth
rates are expected at the transversal configuration when $\mathbf{E}_{0}$ is
perpendicular to $\mathbf{k}$. In this case it is demonstrated that in general
the spectrum of the unstable modes in $\omega $--$k$ plane is split into two
distinct domains with long and short wavelengths, where the unstable modes are
mainly sensitive to the beam or the RF parameters, respectively. In parallel

  Properties","28 pages,10 Tables, 5 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting the transition temperature, Tc, of a superconductor from Periodic
Table normal state properties is regarded as one of the grand challenges of
superconductivity. By studying the correlations of Periodic Table properties
with known superconductors, it is possible to estimate their transition
temperatures. Starting from the isotope effect and correlations of
superconductivity with electronegativity (\Chi), valence electron count per
atom (Ne), atomic number(Z) and formula weight (Fw), we derive an empirical
formula for estimating Tc that includes an unknown parameter,(Ko). With average
values of \Chi, Ne and Z, we develop a material specific characterization
dataset (MSCD) model of a superconductor that is quantitatively useful for
characterizing and comparing superconductors. We show that for most
superconductors, Ko correlates with Fw/Z, Ne, Z, number of atoms (An) in the
formula, number of elements (En) and with Tc. We study some superconductor
families and use the discovered correlations to predict similar and novel
superconductors and also estimate their Tcs. Thus the material specific
equations derived in this paper, the material specific characterization dataset
(MSCD) system developed here and the discovered correlation between Tc and
Fw/Z, En and An, provide the building blocks for the analysis, design and
search of potential novel high temperature superconductors with specific
estimated Tcs.

induction motor. We first cast the motor as a boundary value problem involving
two phenomenological time-constants. These are derived from the widely used
equivalent circuit model of the induction motor. We then use an iterative
procedure to evaluate these constants and obtain the motor performance

applied voltage needed to extract maximum performance from a given motor at any
rotation speed.
