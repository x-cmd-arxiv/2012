posesses a reset word of length at most $(n-1)^2$. From the other side the best
known upper bound on the reset length (minimum length of reset words) is cubic
in $n$. Thus the main problem here is to prove quadratic (in $n$) upper bounds.
Since 1964, this problem has been solved for few special classes of \sa. One of
this result is due to Kari \cite{Ka03} for automata with Eulerian digraphs. In
this paper we introduce a new approach to prove quadratic upper bounds and
explain it in terms of Markov chains and Perron-Frobenius theories. Using this
approach we obtain a quadratic upper bound for a generalization of Eulerian
automata.

interstellar clouds is a key component of the star formation process. In this
paper, we present new Herschel PACS and SPIRE observations of the B59 and Stem
regions in the Pipe Nebula complex, revealing a rich, organized network of
filaments. The asymmetric column density profiles observed for several
filaments, along with the bow-like edge of B59, indicates that the Pipe Nebula
is being compressed from its western side, most likely by the winds from the
nearby Sco OB2 association. We suggest that this compressive flow has
contributed to the formation of some of the observed filamentary structures. In
B59, the only region of the entire Pipe complex showing star formation
activity, the same compressive flow has likely enhanced the initial column
density of the clump, allowing it to become globally gravitationally unstable.
Although more speculative, we propose that gravity has also been responsible
for shaping the converging filamentary pattern observed in B59. While the
question of the relative impact of large-scale compression and gravity remains
open in B59, large-scale compression appears to be a plausible mechanism for
the initial formation of filamentary structures in the rest of the complex

protocluster evolution. We observed the ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) inversion
transitions with the VLA. Ammonia is the best thermometer for dense and cold
gas, and the observed transitions have critical densities able to trace the
kinematics of the intracluster gaseous medium. The ammonia emission is extended
and distributed in two filamentary structures. The starless condensations are
colder than the star-forming cores, but the gas temperature across the whole
protocluster is higher (by a factor of ~1.3-1.5) than that measured typically
in both infrared dark clouds and low-mass protoclusters. The non-thermal
contribution to the observed line broadening is at least a factor of 2 larger
than the expected thermal broadening even in starless condensations, contrary
to the close-to-thermal line widths measured in low-mass quiescent dense cores.
The NH3-to-N2H+ abundance ratio is greatly enhanced (a factor of 10) in the
pre--stellar core candidates, probably due to freeze-out of most molecular
species heavier than He. The more massive and evolved objects likely play a
dominant role in the physical properties and kinematics of the protocluster.
The high level of turbulence and the fact that the measured core masses are
larger than the expected thermal Jeans masses indicate that turbulence likely
was an important factor in the initial fragmentation of the parental clump.

It
is a highly evolved post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) star of spectral
type F, with a large infrared excess produced by thermal emission of
circumstellar dust. We deploy a multi-wavelength study which includes the
analyses of optical and IR spectra as well as a variability study based on
photometric and spectroscopic time-series. The spectral energy distribution
(SED) properties as well as the highly processed silicate N-band emission show
that the dust in IRAS11472-0800 is likely trapped in a stable disc. The
energetics of the SED and the colour variability show that our viewing angle is
close to edge-on and that the optical flux is dominated by scattered light.
With photospheric abundances of [Fe/H] = -2.7 and [Sc/H]=-4.2, we discovered
that IRAS11472-0800 is one of the most chemically-depleted objects known to
date. Moreover, IRAS11472-0800 is a pulsating star with a period of 31.16 days
and a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.6 mag in V. The radial velocity variability
is strongly influenced by the pulsations, but the significant cycle-to-cycle
variability is systematic on a longer time scale, which we interpret as
evidence for binary motion. We conclude that IRAS11472-0800 is a pulsating
binary star surrounded by a circumbinary disc. The line-of-sight towards the
object lies close the the orbital plane making that the optical light is
dominated by scattered light. IRAS11472-0800 is one of the most
chemically-depleted objects known so far and links the dusty RV\,Tauri stars to
the non-pulsating class of strongly depleted objects.

kinetics. It is obtained as a limit when the probability of mutation tends to
zero and the number of divisions to infinity. It can be interpreted as a
compound Poisson distribution (for the number of mutations) of exponential
mixtures (for the developing time of mutant clones) of geometric distributions
(for the number of cells produced by a mutant clone in a given time). The
probabilistic interpretation, and a rigourous proof of convergence in the
general case, are deduced from classical results on Bellman-Harris branching
processes. The two parameters of the Luria-Delbr\""uck distribution are the
expected number of mutations, which is the parameter of interest, and the
relative fitness of normal cells compared to mutants, which is the heavy tail
exponent. Both can be simultaneously estimated by the maximum likehood method.
However, the computation becomes numerically unstable as soon as the maximal
value of the sample is large, which occurs frequently due to the heavy tail
property. Based on the empirical generating function, robust estimators are
proposed and their asymptotic variance is given. They are comparable in
precision to maximum likelihood estimators, with a much broader range of
calculability, a better numerical stability, and a negligible computing time.

associated with the nearby galaxy group comprised of two dominant ellipticals,
NGC 5898 and NGC 5903, and a dwarf lenticular ESO514-G003. Striking new details
of radio emission are unveiled from the 2nd Data Release of the ongoing
TIFR.GMRT.SKY.SURVEY (TGSS) which provides images with a resolution of ~ 24
arcsec x 18 arcsec and a typical rms noise of 5 mJy at 150 MHz. Previous radio
observations of this compact triplet of galaxies include images at higher
frequencies of the radio continuum as well as HI emission, the latter showing
huge HI trails originating from the vicinity of NGC 5903 where HI is in a
kinematically disturbed state. The TGSS 150 MHz image has revealed a large
asymmetric radio halo around NGC 5903 and also established that the dwarf SO
galaxy ESO514-G003 is the host to a previously known bright double radio
source. The radio emission from NGC 5903 is found to have a very steep radio
spectrum ({\alpha} ~ -1.5) and to envelope a network of radio continuum
filaments bearing a spatial relationship to the HI trails. Another noteworthy
aspect of this triplet of early-type galaxies highlighted by the present study
is that both its radio loud members, namely NGC 5903 and ESO514-G003, are also
the only galaxies that are seen to be connected to an HI filament. This
correlation is consistent with the premise that cold gas accretion is of prime
importance for triggering powerful jet activity in the nuclei of early-type
galaxies.

the Standard Model with a new CERN-SPS neutrino beam. The experiment is based
on two identical LAr-TPC's followed by magnetized spectrometers, observing the
electron and muon neutrino events at 1600 and 300 m from the proton target.
This project will exploit the ICARUS T600, moved from LNGS to the CERN ""Far""
position. An additional 1/4 of the T600 detector will be constructed and
located in the ""Near"" position. Two spectrometers will be placed downstream of
the two LAr-TPC detectors to greatly complement the physics capabilities.
Spectrometers will exploit a classical dipole magnetic field with iron slabs,
and a new concept air-magnet, to perform charge identification and muon
momentum measurements in a wide energy range over a large transverse area. In
the two positions, the radial and energy spectra of the nu_e beam are
practically identical. Comparing the two detectors, in absence of oscillations,
all cross sections and experimental biases cancel out, and the two
experimentally observed event distributions must be identical. Any difference
of the event distributions at the locations of the two detectors might be
attributed to the possible existence of {\nu}-oscillations, presumably due to
additional neutrinos with a mixing angle sin^2(2theta_new) and a larger mass
difference Delta_m^2_new. The superior quality of the LAr imaging TPC, in
particular its unique electron-pi_zero discrimination allows full rejection of
backgrounds and offers a lossless nu_e detection capability. The determination
of the muon charge with the spectrometers allows the full separation of nu_mu
from anti-nu_mu and therefore controlling systematics from muon
mis-identification largely at high momenta.

a variety of masses for each star as well as for the initial orbital period

  It is found that the evolution of systems, with fixed initial values for the
orbital period and the mass of the normal donor star, heavily depends upon the
mass of the neutron star. In some cases, varying the initial value of the
neutron star mass, we obtain evolved configurations ranging from ultra-compact
to widely separated objects.
  We also analyse the dependence of the final orbital period with the mass of
the white dwarf. In agreement with previous expectations, our calculations show
that the final orbital period-white dwarf mass relation is fairly insensitive
to the initial neutron star mass value. A new period-mass relation based on our
own calculations is proposed, which is in good agreement with period-mass
relations available in the literature.
  As consequence of considering a set of values for the initial neutron star
mass, these models allow finding different plausible initial configurations

can lead to angular momentum exchange. The presence of viscosity is generally
regarded as the condition for such transfer to happen. In this paper, we show
how the orbital evolution can cause a persistent torque between the binary
components, even for inviscid bodies. This preferentially occurs at the final
stage of coalescence of compact binaries, when the orbit shrinks successively
by gravitational waves and plunging on a timescale shorter than the viscous
timescale. The total orbital energy transferred to the secondary by this torque
is ~0.01 of its binding energy. We further show that this persistent torque
induces a differentially rotating quadrupole perturbation. Specializing to the
case of a secondary neutron star, we find that this non equilibrium state has
an associated free energy of 10^47-10^48 erg, just prior to coalescence. This
energy is likely stored in internal fluid motions, with a sizable amount of
differential rotation. By tapping this free energy reservoir, a preexisting
weak magnetic field could be amplified up to a strength of ~10^15 Gauss. Such a
dynamically driven tidal torque can thus recycle an old neutron star into a
highly magnetized neutron star, with possible observational consequences at
merger.

gamma, W W and Z Z at roughly 125 GeV. The current excess in the diphoton
channel is twice that expected from a Standard Model Higgs; whilst this may
well change with more statistics, it is interesting to consider the
implications should the result persist. Here, we assess whether the NMSSM with
a neutralino dark matter candidate could explain this excess when astrophysical
constraints (e.g. no overproduction of gamma rays and radio emission in the
galaxy, no anomalous excess in the dark matter direct detection experiments and
no dark matter overabundance) are imposed on the neutralino. This enables us to
disregard unphysical regions of the parameter space even though the Higgs
signal is compatible with the observed excess. The result of our analysis is
that there are configurations of the parameter space which can explain the
signal strength reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations for a Higgs mass
within the required range. Should the observed signal strength finally be
compatible with Standard Model expectations, it would be difficult to
distinguish between the discovery of Standard Model Higgs and a SM-like Higgs
from the NMSSM, unless one performs dedicated searches of very light Higgs
bosons and possibly investigate peculiar signatures of supersymmetric
particles. We also propose a new jets + missing E_T signal for the case where
the LSP is a singlino-like neutralino.

replacing classical big bang in the Planck regime. Post bounce, after a phase
of super-inflation, dynamical trajectories evolve towards the classical
attractor in the inflationary scenarios. Depending on the initial conditions,
bounce is shown to occur in kinetic as well as potential dominated regimes. We
analyze the number of e-foldings resulting from the phase of super-inflation,

equation of state at the bounce and on the steepness of the potential. We find
that if the potential is not steep, this phase can lead to large number of

increase in the number of fields can yield a significant increase in the number
of e-foldings during super-inflation.

  account",,"10.1088/0004-637X/753/1/15",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We argue that current observations of $M - \sigma$ relations for galaxies can
be used to constrain theories of super-massive black holes (SMBH) feeding. In
particular, assuming that SMBH mass is limited only by the feedback on the gas
that feeds it, we show that SMBHs fed via a planar galaxy scale gas flow, such
as a disc or a bar, should be much more massive than their counterparts fed by
quasi-spherical inflows. This follows from the relative inefficiency of AGN
feedback on a flattened inflow. We find that even under the most optimistic
conditions for SMBH feedback on flattened inflows, the mass at which the SMBH
expels the gas disc and terminates its own growth is a factor of several higher
than the one established for quasi-spherical inflows. Any beaming of feedback
away from the disc and any disc self-shadowing strengthens this result further.
Contrary to this theoretical expectation, recent observations have shown that
SMBH in pseudobulge galaxies (which are associated with barred galaxies) are
typically under- rather than over-massive when compared with their classical
bulge counterparts at a fixed value of $\sigma$. We conclude from this that
SMBHs are not fed by large (100 pc to many kpc) scale gas discs or bars, most
likely because such planar flows are turned into stars too efficiently to allow
any SMBH growth. Based on this and other related observational evidence, we
argue that most SMBHs grow by chaotic accretion of gas clouds with a small and
nearly randomly distributed direction of angular momentum.

reveal the cold molecular gas component of a warm molecular gas outflow that
was previously known from Spitzer Space Telescope data. The 12CO(3-2) profile
indicates the presence of absorption at -950 km/s from systemic velocity with a
central optical depth of 0.22. Its profile is similar to that of the HI
absorption that was seen in radio data of this source. A potential detection of
the (0-1) absorption enabled us to place an upper limit of 0.03 on its central
optical depth, and to constrain the excitation temperature of the outflowing CO
gas to >=65K assuming that the gas is thermalized. If the molecular clouds
fully obscure the background millimeter continuum that is emitted by the radio
core, the H2 column density is >=1.8*10^22 /cm^2. The outflow then carries an
estimated cold H2 mass of at least 4.2*10^3 M_sun along the nuclear line of
sight. This mass will be even higher when integrated over several lines of
sight, but if it were to exceed 3*10^9 M_sun, the outflow would most likely be
seen in emission. Since the ambient cold gas reservoir of 4C12.50 is 1.0*10^10

horizon in a black hole background, which in turn is significantly lower than
the Planck scale, the black hole radiance rate may not be enhanced by the
emission of all the light IR modes. Instead, there may be additional
suppressions hidden in the UV completion of the field theory, which really
control which light modes can be emitted by the black hole. It could turn out
that many degrees of freedom cannot be efficiently emitted by the black hole,
and so the radiance rate may be much smaller than its estimate based on the
counting of the light IR degrees of freedom. If we apply this argument to the
RS2 brane world, it implies that the emission rates of the low energy CFT modes
will be dramatically suppressed: its UV completion is given by the bulk gravity
on $AdS_5 \times S^5$, and the only bulk modes that could be emitted by a black
hole are the 4D s-waves of bulk modes with small 5D momentum, or equivalently,
small 4D masses. Further, their emission is suppressed by bulk warping, which
lowers the radiation rate much below the IR estimate, yielding a radiation flux
$\sim (T_{BH} L)^2 {\cal L}_{hawking} \sim (T_{BH}/M_{Pl})^2 N {\cal
L}_{hawking}$, where ${\cal L}_{hawking}$ is the Hawking radiation rate of a
single light species. This follows directly from low CFT cutoff $\mu \sim

strongly suggests the TeV emission to have a morphology consistent with a point

while the point-source nature of the GeV emission is currently unsettled, with
indications that it may be spatially extended. In the case that the emission is
hadronic and in a steady state, we show that the expected gamma-ray morphology
is dominated by the distribution of target gas, rather than by details of
cosmic-ray injection and propagation. Specifically, we expect a significant
portion of hadronic emission to coincide with the position of the
circum-nuclear ring, which resides between 1-3 pc from the Galactic center. We
note that the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be able to observe
conclusive correlations between the morphology of the TeV gamma-ray source and
the observed gas density, convincingly confirming or ruling out a hadronic

We compare the red sequence LF to that for clusters at z<0.8 correcting the
luminosities for passive evolution. The shape of the cluster red sequence LF
does not evolve between z=1.62 and z=0.6 but at z<0.6 the faint population
builds up significantly. Meanwhile, between z=1.62 to 0.6 the inferred total
light on the red sequence grows by a factor of about 2 and the bright end of

from the field that are then quenched and subsequently allowed to merge. We
find that 3--4 mergers among cluster galaxies during the 4 Gyr between z=1.62

annihilating dark matter particles provide the primary contribution to the
observed isotropic radio background through the emission of synchrotron
radiation from electron and positron annihilation products. For reasonable
estimates of the magnetic fields present in clusters and galaxies, we find that
dark matter could potentially account for the observed radio excess, but only
if it annihilates mostly to electrons and/or muons, and only if it possesses a
mass in the range of approximately 5-50 GeV. For such models, the annihilation
cross section required to normalize the synchrotron signal to the observed
excess is sigma v ~ (0.4-30) x 10^-26 cm^3/s, similar to the value predicted
for a simple thermal relic (sigma v ~ 3 x 10^-26 cm^3/s). We find that in any
scenario in which dark matter annihilations are responsible for the observed
excess radio emission, a significant fraction of the isotropic gamma ray
background observed by Fermi must result from dark matter as well.

derived from broad-band SED-fitting - such as age, stellar mass, dust
reddening, etc. - on a variety of parameters, such as SFHs, metallicity, IMF,
dust reddening and reddening law, and wavelength coverage. Mock galaxies serve
as test particles. We confirm our earlier results based on real z=2 galaxies,
that usually adopted \tau-models lead to overestimate the SFR and to
underestimate the stellar mass. Here, we show that - for star-forming galaxies
- ages, masses and reddening, can be well determined simultaneously only when
the correct SFH is identified. This is the case for inverted-\tau-models at
high-z, for which we find that the mass recovery (at fixed IMF) is as good as
~0.04 dex. Since the right SFH is usually unknown we quantify offsets generated
by adopting standard fitting setups. Stellar masses are generally
underestimated resulting from underestimating ages. For fitting setups with a
variety of SFHs the median mass recovery at z ~ 2-3 is as decent as ~0.1 dex,
albeit with large scatter. The situation worsens towards lower redshifts
because of the variety of possible SFHs and ages (~0.6 dex at z=0.5). A
practical trick to improve upon this is to exclude reddening from the fitting
to avoid unrealistically young and dusty solutions. Reddening and SFRs should
then be determined by a separate fit. As expected, the recovery of properties
is better for passive galaxies. For the two galaxy types the parameter recovery
is optimal for a wavelength coverage from the rest-frame UV to the rest-frame
near-IR. We quantify the effect of narrowing the wavelength coverage or
adding/removing filters which can be useful for planning observational surveys.
Finally, we provide scaling relations that allow the transformation of stellar
masses obtained using different template fitting setups and stellar population
models.

Cepheids is the calibration of the Leavitt Law or period-luminosity
relationship. The Baade-Wesselink method for distance determination to Cepheids
relies on the ratio of the measured radial velocity and pulsation velocity, the
so-called projection factor and the ability to measure the stellar angular
diameters. Aims. We use spherically-symmetric model stellar atmospheres to
explore the dependence of the p-factor and angular diameter corrections as a
function of pulsation period. Methods. Intensity profiles are computed from a
grid of plane-parallel and spherically-symmetric model stellar atmospheres
using the SAtlas code. Projection factors and angular diameter corrections are
determined from these intensity profiles and compared to previous results.
Results. Our predicted geometric period-projection factor relation including
previously published state-of-the-art hydrodynamical predictions is not with
recent observational constraints. We suggest a number of potential resolutions
to this discrepancy. The model atmosphere geometry also affects predictions for
angular diameter corrections used to interpret interferometric observations,
suggesting corrections used in the past underestimated Cepheid angular
diameters by 3 - 5%. Conclusions. While spherically-symmetric hydrostatic model
atmospheres cannot resolve differences between projection factors from theory
and observations, they do help constrain underlying physics that must be
included, including chromospheres and mass loss. The models also predict more
physically-based limb-darkening corrections for interferometric observations.

causes a volume increase of the inherent structures with increasing energy
content. In most glass formers, this increase is stronger than the vibrational
Gr\""uneisen volume expansion and dominates the thermal expansion of the liquid
phase. For a gaussian distribution of inherent states in energy, the generic
case, this implies a 1/T-squared temperature dependence of the additional
thermal expansion and the additional heat capacity at zero pressure. The
corresponding compressibility contribution has the Prigogine-Defay ratio one.
In experiment, one finds a higher Prigogine-Defay ratio, explainable in terms
of structural volume changes without any energy change. These should always
exist, though their influence becomes weak in close-packing systems, at the
crossover to soft matter.

vector field u), in any n. We study the cases where one of these parts vanishes
in particular, i.e., purely electric (PE) or magnetic (PM) spacetimes. We
generalize several results from four to higher dimensions and discuss new
features of higher dimensions. We prove that the only permitted Weyl types are
G, I_i and D, and discuss the possible relation of u with the WANDs; we provide
invariant conditions that characterize PE/PM spacetimes, such as Bel-Debever
criteria, or constraints on scalar invariants, and connect the PE/PM parts to
the kinematic quantities of u; we present conditions under which direct product
spacetimes (and certain warps) are PE/PM, which enables us to construct
explicit examples. In particular, it is also shown that all static spacetimes
are necessarily PE, while stationary spacetimes (e.g., spinning black holes)
are in general neither PE nor PM. Ample classes of PE spacetimes exist, but PM
solutions are elusive, and we prove that PM Einstein spacetimes of type D do
not exist, for any n. Finally, we derive corresponding results for the
electric/magnetic parts of the Riemann tensor. This also leads to first
examples of PM spacetimes in higher dimensions. We also note in passing that
PE/PM Weyl tensors provide examples of minimal tensors, and we make the
connection hereof with the recently proved alignment theorem. This in turn
sheds new light on classification of the Weyl tensors based on null alignment,
providing a further invariant characterization that distinguishes the types
G/I/D from the types II/III/N.

convex Hamiltonian systems. It somehow makes a bridge between viscosity
solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Mather invariant sets of
Hamiltonian systems, although this was fully understood only a posteriori.
These theories converge under the hypothesis of convexity, and the richness of
applications mostly comes from this remarkable convergence. In the present
course, we provide an elementary exposition of some of the basic concepts of
weak KAM theory. In a companion lecture, Albert Fathi exposes the aspects of
his theory which are more directly related to viscosity solutions. Here on the
contrary, we focus on dynamical applications, even if we also discuss some
viscosity aspects to underline the connections with Fathi's lecture. The
fundamental reference on Weak KAM theory is the still unpublished book of
Albert Fathi \textit{Weak KAM theorem in Lagrangian dynamics}. Although we do
not offer new results, our exposition is original in several aspects. We only
work with the Hamiltonian and do not rely on the Lagrangian, even if some
proofs are directly inspired from the classical Lagrangian proofs. This
approach is made easier by the choice of a somewhat specific setting. We work
on $\Rm^d$ and make uniform hypotheses on the Hamiltonian. This allows us to
replace some compactness arguments by explicit estimates. For the most
interesting dynamical applications however, the compactness of the
configuration space remains a useful hypothesis and we retrieve it by
considering periodic (in space) Hamiltonians. Our exposition is centered on the
Cauchy problem for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the Lax-Oleinik evolution
operators associated to it. Dynamical applications are reached by considering
fixed points of these evolution operators, the Weak KAM solutions. The
evolution operators can also be used for their regularizing properties, this
opens a second way to dynamical applications.

neutron star, the amount of material received by the accreting component is, so
far, a real intrigue. In the literature there are available models that link
the accretion disk surrounding the neutron star with the amount of material it
receives, but there is no model linking the amount of matter lost by the donor
star to that falling onto the neutron star.
  In this paper we explore the evolutionary response of these close binary
systems when we vary the amount of material accreted by the neutron star. We
consider a parameter \beta, which represents the fraction of material lost by
the normal star that can be accreted by the neutron star. \beta is considered
as constant throughout evolution. We have computed the evolution of a set of
models considering initial donor star masses (in solar units) between 0.5 and
3.50, initial orbital periods (in days) between 0.175 and 12, initial masses of
neutron stars (in solar units) of 0.80, 1.00, 1.20 and 1.40 and several values
of beta. We assumed solar abundances. These systems evolve to ultracompact or
to open binary systems, many of which form low mass helium white dwarfs. We
present a grid of calculations and analyze how these results are affected upon
changes in the value of \beta. We find a weak dependence of the final donor
star mass with respect to \beta. In most cases this is also true for the final
orbital period. The most sensitive quantity is the final mass of the accreting
neutron star.
  As we do not know the initial mass and rotation rate of the neutron star of
any system, we find that performing evolutionary studies is not helpful for
determining \beta.

kernel functions are possible, including projection, approximation or
reproducing kernels. In this last case, we obtain a parametric rate of testing
for a weak metric defined in the RKHS associated with the considered

multiple tests are proved to be of level \alpha, and to satisfy non-asymptotic

chemotactic sensitivity is below the same critical value. The solution is
constructed by using a minimising scheme involving the Kantorovich-Wasserstein

cornerstone of the proof is the derivation of additional estimates which relies
on a generalisation to a non-monotone functional of a method due to Matthes,

contracts: a publisher guarantees to the advertiser a certain number of user
visits satisfying the targeting predicates of the contract. The publisher is
then tasked with solving the ad serving problem - given a user visit, which of
the thousands of matching contracts should be displayed, so that by the
expiration time every contract has obtained the requisite number of user
visits. The challenges of the problem come from (1) the sheer size of the
problem being solved, with tens of thousands of contracts and billions of user
visits, (2) the unpredictability of user behavior, since these contracts are
sold months ahead of time, when only a forecast of user visits is available and
(3) the minute amount of resources available online, as an ad server must
respond with a matching contract in a fraction of a second.
  We present a solution to the guaranteed delivery ad serving problem using
{\em compact allocation plans}. These plans, computed offline, can be
efficiently queried by the ad server during an ad call; they are small, using
only O(1) space for contract; and are stateless, allowing for distributed
serving without any central coordination. We evaluate this approach on a real
set of user visits and guaranteed contracts and show that the compact
allocation plans are an effective way of solving the guaranteed delivery ad
serving problem.

  within the Millennium-II simulation and self consistent treatment of
  radiative feedback",,"10.1093/mnras/sts206",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the epoch of reionization and the properties of the first
galaxies represents an important goal for modern cosmology. The structure of
reionization, and hence the observed power spectrum of redshifted 21cm
fluctuations are known to be sensitive to the astrophysical properties of the
galaxies that drove reionization. Thus, detailed measurements of the 21cm power
spectrum and its evolution could lead to measurements of the properties of
early galaxies that are otherwise inaccessible. In this paper, we make
predictions for the ionised structure during reionization and the 21cm power
spectrum based on detailed models of galaxy formation. We combine the
semi-analytic GALFORM model implemented within the Millennium-II dark matter
simulation, with a semi-numerical scheme to describe the resulting ionization
structure. Using these models we show that the details of SNe and radiative
feedback affect the structure and distribution of ionised regions, and hence
the slope and amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum. These results indicate
that forthcoming measurements of the 21cm power-spectrum could be used to
uncover details of early galaxy formation. We find that the strength of SNe
feedback is the dominant effect governing the evolution of structure during
reionization. In particular we show SNe feedback to be more important than
radiative feedback, the presence of which we find does not influence either the
total stellar mass or overall ionising photon budget. Thus, if SNe feedback is
effective at suppressing star formation in high redshift galaxies, we find that
photoionization feedback does not lead to self-regulation of the reionization
process as has been thought.

localization and tracking method is proposed for Cluster based Mobile Ad hoc
Network (MANET). Certificate Authority (CA) node is selected as the most stable
node among trusted nodes, surrounded by Registration Authority nodes (RAs) in
each cluster to generate the Dynamic Demilitarized Zone (DDMZ) to defend CA
from probable attackers and mitigate the authentication overhead. The RAs also
co-operate with member nodes to detect a target node and determine whether it
is malicious or not, by providing the public key certificate and trust value.
In addition, Internet Protocol (IP) based Triangulation and multi-lateration
method are deployed based on using the average time difference of Time of
Arrival (ToA) and Time of Departure (ToD) of the management packets.
Triangulation uses three reference nodes which are elected within each cluster
based on Best Criterion Function (BCF) to localize each member node inside the
cluster in 2D. Multi-lateration is employed to localize the malicious target
node in 2D using four neighbor nodes. After localization of two consecutive
positions, the target node is continuously localized and tracked by a
particular node using the modified real time Position Localization and Tracking
(PL&T) algorithm by adaptive beam forming and mapping the energy contours of
tracking zone into coverage radii distance. The performance of the proposed
scheme demonstrates the significant accuracy in the detection of malicious
nodes within each cluster.

second order Fourier coefficient $v_2$, are used to investigate the path length
($L$) and transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependent jet quenching patterns of the
QCD medium produced in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$\,TeV. $v_2$
shows a linear decrease as $1/\sqrt{p_T}$ and a linear increase with the medium
path length difference ($\Delta L$) in- and out of the $\Psi_2$ event plane.
These patterns compliment a prior observation of the scaling of jet quenching
($R_{\rm AA}$) measurements. Together, they suggest that radiative parton
energy loss is a dominant mechanism for jet suppression, and $v_2$ stems from
the difference in the parton propagation length $\Delta L$.An estimate of the
transport coefficient $\hat{q}$, gives a value comparable to that obtained in a
prior study of the scaling properties of $R_{\rm AA}$. These results suggest
that high-$p_T$ azimuthal anisotropy measurements provide strong constraints
for delineating the mechanism(s) for parton energy loss, as well as for
reliable extraction of $\hat{q}$.

via two separate analyses of (first) the $\pi^+ p$ and (subsequently) the

previous PSA: a) we now perform only one test for the acceptance of each data
set (based on its contribution to the overall $\chi^2$) and b) we adopt a more
stringent acceptance criterion in the statistical tests. We show that it is
possible to obtain self-consistent databases after removing a very small amount
of the data (4.57% of the initial database). We subsequently fit the ETH model
(Goudsmit et al. 1994) to the truncated $\pi^\pm p$ elastic-scattering
databases. The model-parameter values show reasonable stability when subjected
to different criteria for the rejection of single data points and entire data
sets. Our result for the pseudovector $\pi N N$ coupling constant is $0.0726

and p-wave hadronic phase shifts up to T=100 MeV. Large differences in the

comparing to other methods of periodically modulating graphene, namely
perforated graphene structures, we find that the resulting band gap is

the magnitude of the gate potential as well as the exact geometry of the edge

collisions of dust agglomerates. Very uncertain is still the relative velocity
regime in which growth rather than destruction can take place. The outcome of a
collision depends on the bulk properties of the porous dust agglomerates.
Continuum models of dust agglomerates require a set of material parameters that
are often difficult to obtain from laboratory experiments. Here, we aim at
determining those parameters from ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our
goal is to improveon the existing model that describe the interaction of
individual monomers. We use a molecular dynamics approach featuring a detailed
micro-physical model of the interaction of spherical grains. The model includes
normal forces, rolling, twisting and sliding between the dust grains. We
present a new treatment of wall-particle interaction that allows us to perform
customized simulations that directly correspond to laboratory experiments. We
find that the existing interaction model by Dominik & Tielens leads to a too
soft compressive strength behavior for uni and omni-directional compression.
Upon making the rolling and sliding coefficients stiffer we find excellent
agreement in both cases. Additionally, we find that the compressive strength
curve depends on the velocity with which the sample is compressed. The modified
interaction strengths between two individual dust grains will lead to a
different behaviour of the whole dust agglomerate. This will influences the
sticking probabilities and hence the growth of planetesimals. The new parameter
set might possibly lead to an enhanced sticking as more energy can be stored in
the system before breakup.

profile. The red peak is much stronger than the blue one for most of the cases.
The red peaks themselves also show weak but significant asymmetry and their
widths are correlated with the velocity separation of the red and the blue
peaks, which implies that the peaks are not isolated multiple components with
different velocities but the parts of the single line which is modified by the
absorption and/or scattering by the associated neutral hydrogen gas. The
characteristic profile can be naturally explained by the scattering in the
expanding shell of neutral hydrogen surrounding the Ly\alpha\ emitting region

bridging scales, we show how variations of elastic or adhesive properties at

heterogeneous systems involving front propagation: (i) patterning the elastic
bending stiffness of the film produces fluctuations of the driving force
resulting in dramatically enhanced resistance to peeling; (ii) optimized
arrangements of pinning sites with large adhesion energy are shown to control
the effective system resistance, allowing the design of highly anisotropic and
asymmetric adhesives; (iii) heterogeneities of both types result in front
motion instabilities producing sudden energy releases that increase the overall
adhesion energy. These findings open potentially new avenues for the design of
thin films with improved adhesion properties, and motivate new investigation of
other phenomena involving front propagation.

graphs (dags). Given a sequence S:=(a_1,b_1),...,(a_n, b_n) with a_i, b_i in
Z_0^+, does there exist a dag (no parallel arcs allowed) with labeled vertex
set V:= {v_1,...,v_n} such that for all v_i in V indegree and outdegree of v_i
match exactly the given numbers a_i and b_i, respectively? Recently this
decision problem has been shown to be NP-complete by Nichterlein (2011).
However, we can show that several important classes of sequences are
efficiently solvable.
  In previous work (Berger and Mueller-Hannemann, FCT2011), we have proved that
yes-instances always have a special kind of topological order which allows us
to reduce the number of possible topological orderings in most cases
drastically. This leads to an exact exponential-time algorithm which
significantly improves upon a straightforward approach. Moreover, a combination
of this exponential-time algorithm with a special strategy gives a linear-time
algorithm. Interestingly, in systematic experiments we observed that we could
solve a huge majority of all instances by the linear-time heuristic. This
motivates us to develop characteristics like dag density and ""distance to
provably easy sequences"" which can give us an indicator how easy or difficult a
given sequence can be realized.
  Furthermore, we propose a randomized algorithm which exploits our structural
insight on topological sortings and uses a number of reduction rules. We
observe that it clearly outperforms all other variants and behaves surprisingly
well for almost all instances. Another striking observation is that our simple
linear-time algorithm solves a set of real-world instances from different
domains, namely ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs), train and flight
schedules, as well as instances derived from food-web networks without any
exception.

unsatisfactory for dealing with time-dependent covariates when the counts are
low. For this situation, we explore a within-cluster resampling (WCR) approach
that involves repeated analyses of random subsamples with a final analysis that
synthesizes results across subsamples. This leads to a novel WCR method which
operates on separated blocks within subjects and which performs better than all

method allows a fully Bayesian exploration of the sets of initial conditions
that are consistent with the galaxy distribution sampling the final density

reconstruction of the present density and velocity fields, including a full
propagation of the observational uncertainties. A test of these methods on
simulated data mimicking the survey mask, selection function and galaxy number
of the SDSS DR7 main sample shows that this physical model gives accurate
reconstructions of the underlying present-day density and velocity fields on
scales larger than ~6 Mpc/h. Our method naturally and accurately reconstructs
non-linear features corresponding to three-point and higher order correlation
functions such as walls and filaments. Simple tests of the reconstructed

The size-dependent FG nanoplate is investigated by using Eringen's differential

only in the thickness direction and the effective properties for FG nanoplate
are computed using Mori-Tanaka homogenization scheme. The accuracy of the
present formulation is tested considering the problems for which solutions are

using text as the target medium is relatively difficult as compared to the
other target media, because of the lack of available redundant information in a

text based steganographic approaches, we propose simple, yet novel approaches
that overcome the same. Our approaches are based on combining the random
character sequence and feature coding methods to hide a character. We also
analytically evaluate the approaches based on metrics viz. hiding strength,

believe the approaches proposed impart increased randomness and thus aid higher

nil-automorphism if, for every $g\in G$, there exists $n=n(g)$ such that $[g,_n
x]=1$. If the integer $n$ can be chosen independently of $g$, then $x$ is said
to be unipotent. Nil and unipotent automorphisms can be regarded as a natural
extension of the concept of Engel element, since a nil-automorphism $x$ is just
a left-Engel element in $G < x >$. In this paper we consider nil-automorphisms
of groups with residual properties namely locally-graded groups,
residually-finite groups and profinite groups. The first result we prove says
that a finite group of nil-automorphisms of a locally graded group, must be
nilpotent. Next we turn our attention to groups of unipotent automorphisms of
residually-finite and profinite groups. We show that such groups are
locally-nilpotent and, as a by-product, we obtain an alternative proof of a
well known theorem of Wilson about n-Engel residually-finite groups.

population of free-floating planetary mass objects. The main conclusion from
this work was partly based on constraints from a direct imaging survey. This
survey determined upper limits for the frequency of stars that harbor giant
exoplanets at large orbital separations. Aims. We want to verify to what extent
upper limits from direct imaging do indeed constrain the microlensing results.
We examine the current derivation of the upper limits used in the microlensing
study and re-analyze the data from the corresponding imaging survey. We focus
on the mass and semi-major axis ranges that are most relevant in context of the
microlensing results. We also consider new results from a recent M-dwarf
imaging survey as these objects are typically the host stars for planets
detected by microlensing. We find that the upper limits currently applied in
context of the microlensing results are probably underestimated. This means
that a larger fraction of stars than assumed may harbor gas giant planets at
larger orbital separations. Also, the way the upper limit is currently used to
estimate the fraction of free-floating objects is not strictly correct. If the
planetary surface density of giant planets around M-dwarfs is described as
df_Planet ~ a^beta da, we find that beta ~ 0.5 - 0.6 is consistent with results
from different observational studies probing semi-major axes between ~0.03 - 30
AU. Having a higher upper limit on the fraction of stars that may have gas
giant planets at orbital separations probed by the microlensing data implies
that more of the planets detected in the microlensing study are potentially
bound to stars rather than free-floating. The current observational data are
consistent with a rising planetary surface density for giant exoplanets around
M-dwarfs out to ~30 AU.

(i) The neutrino must be a Majorana particle, i. e. identical to the

with which one can calculate by different methods: (1) Quasi-Particle Random
Phase Approach (QRPA), (2) the Shell Model (SM), (3) the (before the variation)
angular momentum projected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method (PHFB)and the (4)
Interacting Boson Approach (IBA). In the second part we investigate how to
determine experimentally the leading mechanism for the Neutrinoless Double Beta
Decay. Is it (a) the light Majorana neutrino exchange as one assumes to
determine the effective Majorana neutrino mass, ist it the heavy left (b) or
right handed (c) Majorana neutrino exchange allowed by left-right symmetric
Grand Unified Theories (GUT's). Is it a mechanism due to Supersymmetry e.g.
with gluino exchange and R-parity and lepton number violating terms. At the end
we assume, that Klapdor et al. have indeed measured the Neutrinoless Double
Beta Decay(, although contested,)and that the light Majorana neutrino exchange

constants over the course of cosmic time. Methods. We use unique observations
of the CO(7-6) rotational line and the [CI] 3P_2 - 3P_1 fine-structure line
towards a lensed galaxy at redshift z = 5.2 to constrain temporal variations in
the constant F = alpha^2/mu, where mu is the electron-to-proton mass ratio and
alpha is the fine-structure constant. The relative change in F between z = 0
and z = 5.2, dFF = (F_obs - F_lab)/F_lab, is estimated from the radial velocity
offset, dV = V_rot - V_fs, between the rotational transitions in carbon
monoxide and the fine-structure transition in atomic carbon. Results. We find a
conservative value dV = 1 +/- 5 km/s (1sigma C.L.), which when interpreted in
terms of dFF gives dFF < 2x10^-5. Independent methods restrict the
mu-variations at the level of dmm < 1x10^-7 at z = 0.7 (look-back time t_z0.7 =
6.4 Gyr). Assuming that temporal variations in mu, if any, are linear, this
leads to an upper limit on dmm < 2x10^-7 at z = 5.2 (t_z5.2 = 12.9 Gyr). From
both constraints on dFF and dmm, one obtains for the relative change in alpha

Bose gas are analysed in the semi-classical wave limit. Representing one of the
simplest correlation functions these give information about possible universal
scaling behaviour. Motivated by the previously discovered connection between
(quasi-)topological field configurations, strong wave turbulence, and
nonthermal fixed points of quantum field dynamics, soliton formation is studied
with respect to the appearance of transient power-law spectra. A random-soliton
model is developed to describe the spectra analytically, and the analogies and
difference between the appearing power laws and those found in a field theory
approach to strong wave turbulence are discussed. The results open a view on
solitary wave dynamics from the point of view of critical phenomena far from
thermal equilibrium and on a possibility to study this dynamics in experiment
without the necessity of detecting solitons in situ.

that allows variation in 3 dimensions. The resulting spacetime may be
statistically uniform on average, or have random, non-repeating variation. The
construction utilises the Darmois junction conditions to join many different
component spacetime regions. In the initial simple example given, the component
parts are spatially flat and uniform, but much more general combinations should
be possible. Further inhomogeneity may be added via swiss cheese vacuoles and
inhomogeneous metrics. This model is used to explore the proposal, that
observers are located in bound, non-expanding regions, while the universe is
actually in the process of becoming void dominated, and thus its average
expansion rate is increasing. The model confirms qualitatively that the faster
expanding components come to dominate the average, and that inhomogeneity
results in average parameters which evolve differently from those of any one
component, but more realistic modelling of the effect will need this
construction to be generalised.

Avoiding the need for a priori parametric assumptions, the P\'olya tree

increase in network traffic, active queue management techniques such as Random
Early Detection (RED) have come into picture. Flow Random Early Drop (FRED)
keeps state based on instantaneous queue occupancy of a given flow. FRED
protects fragile flows by deterministically accepting flows from low bandwidth
connections and fixes several shortcomings of RED by computing queue length
during both arrival and departure of the packet. Stochastic Fair Queuing (SFQ)
ensures fair access to network resources and prevents a busty flow from
consuming more than its fair share. In case of (Random Exponential Marking)
REM, the key idea is to decouple congestion measure from performance measure
(loss, queue length or delay). Stabilized RED (SRED) is another approach of
detecting nonresponsive flows. In this paper, we have shown a comparative
analysis of throughput, delay and queue length for the various congestion
control algorithms RED, SFQ and REM. We also included the comparative analysis
of loss rate having different bandwidth for these algorithms.

secondly, we optimize the total Laplacian (the gradient flux) of a fixed

mainly orientated towards medical imaging applications such as X-ray scanners.
However, we believe that after a proper gas optimization, these detectors could
also achieve a high time resolution and could thus be used in applications as
TOF-PET, detection of charged particles with simultaneous high time and

  Applications","18 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Researchers in the biological sciences nowadays often encounter the curse of
high-dimensionality, which many previously developed statistical models fail to
overcome. To tackle this problem, sufficient dimension reduction aims to
estimate the central subspace (CS), in which all the necessary information
supplied by the covariates regarding the response of interest is contained.
Subsequent statistical analysis can then be made in a lower-dimensional space
while preserving relevant information. Oftentimes studies are interested in a
certain transformation of the response (the induced response), instead of the
original one, whose corresponding CS may vary. When estimating the CS of the
induced response, existing dimension reduction methods may, however, suffer the
problem of inefficiency. In this article, we propose a more efficient two-stage
estimation procedure to estimate the CS of an induced response. This approach
is further extended to the case of censored responses. An application for
combining multiple biomarkers is also illustrated. Simulation studies and two
data examples provide further evidence of the usefulness of the proposed
method.

pseudo-simplicial objects. This paper explores the relationship amongst three
of them: the pseudo-simplicial bicategory so-called Grothendieck nerve of the
tricategory, the simplicial bicategory termed its Segal nerve, and the
simplicial set called its Street geometric nerve, and it proves the fact that
the geometric realizations of all of these possible candidate 'nerves of the
tricategory' are homotopy equivalent. Our results provide coherence for all
reasonable extensions to tricategories of Quillen's definition of the
'classifying space' of a category as the geometric realization of the
category's Grothendieck nerve. Many properties of the classifying space
construction for tricategories may be easier to establish depending on the
nerve used for realizations. For instance, by using Grothendieck nerves we
state and prove the precise form in which the process of taking classifying
spaces transports tricategorical coherence to homotopy coherence. Segal nerves
allow us to obtain an extension to bicategories of the results by Mac Lane,
Stasheff, and Fiedorowicz about the relation between loop spaces and monoidal
or braided monoidal categories by showing that the group completion of the
classifying space of a bicategory enriched with a monoidal structure is, in a
precise way, a loop space. With the use of geometric nerves, we obtain genuine
simplicial sets whose simplices have a pleasing geometrical description in
terms of the cells of the tricategory and, furthermore, we obtain an extension
of the results by Joyal, Street, and Tierney about the classification of
braided categorical groups and their relationship with connected, simply
connected homotopy 3-types, by showing that, via the classifying space
construction, bicategorical groups are a convenient algebraic model for
connected homotopy 3-types.

most the product of the two individual probabilities.
  We show several other extensions and modifications of the BK inequality.In
particular, we prove that the antiferromagnetic Ising Curie-Weiss model
satisfies the BK inequality for all increasing events. We prove that this also
holds for the Curie-Weiss model with three-body interactions under the

that the probability that two events occur `cluster-disjointly' is at most the

two-dimensional colloidal crystal confined by structured parallel walls. When
walls are sheared very slowly, only two or three crystalline layers next to the
walls move along with them, while the inner layers of the crystal are only
slightly tilted. At higher shear velocities, this inner part of the crystal
breaks into several pieces with different orientations. The velocity profile
across the slit is reminiscent of shear-banding in flowing soft materials,
where liquid and solid regions coexist; the difference, however, is that in the
latter case the solid regions are glassy while here they are crystalline. At
even higher shear velocities, the effect of the shearing becomes smaller again.
Also the effective temperature near the walls (deduced from the velocity
distributions of the particles) decreases again when the wall velocity gets
very large. When the walls are placed closer together, thereby introducing a
misfit, a structure containing a soliton staircase arises in simulations
without shear. Introducing shear increases the disorder in these systems until
no solitons are visible any more. Instead, similar structures like in the case
without misfit result. At high shear rates, configurations where the
incommensurability of the crystalline structure is compensated by the creation
of holes become relevant.

degree of freedom is represented by the pseudo-spin operator. Competition
arises from an Ising interaction for the $z$ component of pseudo-spins along
the vertical/horizontal bonds and an Ising interaction for the $x$ component
along diagonal bonds. Classical and quantum compass models are analyzed by
utilizing several analytical methods and numerical simulations. At a fully
frustrated point where the two Ising interactions compete with each other, a
macroscopic number of orbital configurations are degenerate in a classical
ground state. This degeneracy is lifted by thermal and quantum fluctuations,
and a staggered long-range order of the $z$ component of the pseudo-spin is
realized. A tricritical point for this order appears due to competition between
the bond dependent Ising interactions. Roles of geometrical frustration on
excitation dynamics are also examined.

simulations of cosmic structure formation. These finders span a wide range of
techniques and methodologies to extract and quantify substructures within a
larger non-homogeneous background density (e.g. a host halo). This includes
real-space, phase-space, velocity-space and time- space based finders, as well
as finders employing a Voronoi tessellation, friends-of-friends techniques, or
refined meshes as the starting point for locating substructure.A common
post-processing pipeline was used to uniformly analyse the particle lists
provided by each finder. We extract quantitative and comparable measures for
the subhaloes, primarily focusing on mass and the peak of the rotation curve
for this particular study. We find that all of the finders agree extremely well
on the presence and location of substructure and even for properties relating
to the inner part part of the subhalo (e.g. the maximum value of the rotation
curve). For properties that rely on particles near the outer edge of the
subhalo the agreement is at around the 20 per cent level. We find that basic
properties (mass, maximum circular velocity) of a subhalo can be reliably
recovered if the subhalo contains more than 100 particles although its presence
can be reliably inferred for a lower particle number limit of 20. We finally
note that the logarithmic slope of the subhalo cumulative number count is
remarkably consistent and <1 for all the finders that reached high resolution.
If correct, this would indicate that the larger and more massive, respectively,
substructures are the most dynamically interesting and that higher levels of
the (sub-)subhalo hierarchy become progressively less important.

technique is based on local modification of variables (replacing X by aX or Xa)
and iterative replacement of pairs of letters appearing in the equation by a
`fresh' letter, which can be seen as a bottom-up compression of the solution of
the given word equation, to be more specific, building an SLP (Straight-Line
Programme) for the solution of the word equation.
  Using this technique we give a new, independent and self-contained proofs of
most of the known results for word equations. To be more specific, the
presented (nondeterministic) algorithm runs in O(n log n) space and in time
polynomial in log N, where N is the size of the length-minimal solution of the
word equation. The presented algorithm can be easily generalised to a generator
of all solutions of the given word equation (without increasing the space
usage). Furthermore, a further analysis of the algorithm yields a doubly
exponential upper bound on the size of the length-minimal solution. The
presented algorithm does not use exponential bound on the exponent of
periodicity. Conversely, the analysis of the algorithm yields an independent
proof of the exponential bound on exponent of periodicity.
  We believe that the presented algorithm, its idea and analysis are far
simpler than all previously applied. Furthermore, thanks to it we can obtain a
unified and simple approach to most of known results for word equations.
  As a small additional result we show that for O(1) variables (with arbitrary
many appearances in the equation) word equations can be solved in linear space,
i.e. they are context-sensitive.

more gradual variations occurred already before the (putative) event. Since

simple in that the effect of large-scale structures is limited to a
quasi-steady response of the near-wall turbulence to slow large-scale
fluctuations of the skin friction. The most natural and compact form of
expressing this mechanism is given by the usual Reynolds-number-independent
representation of the total skin friction and velocity, scaled in wall
variables, where the mean quantities are replaced by large-scale
low-pass-filtered fluctuating components. The theory is rewritten in terms of
fuctuations via a universal mean velocity and random mean square fluctuation
velocity profiles of the small-scales and then linearised assuming that the
large-scale fluctuations are small as compared to the mean components. This
allows us to express the superposition and modulation coefficients of the
empirical predictive models of the skin friction and streamwise fluctuating

Carlo simulations at densities inside the two-phase coexistence region of fluid

crystal at the wall, conditions can be created where a single nanoscopic
wall-attached crystalline cluster coexists with fluid in the remainder of the
simulation box. Following related ideas that have been useful to study
heterogeneous nucleation of liquid droplets at the vapor-liquid coexistence, we
estimate the contact angles from observations of the crystalline clusters in
thermal equilibrium. We find fair agreement with a prediction based on Young's
equation, using estimates of interface and wall tension from the study of flat
surfaces. It is shown that the pressure versus density curve of the finite
system exhibits a loop, but the pressure maximum signifies the ""droplet
evaporation-condensation"" transition and thus has nothing in common with a van

inside the two-phase coexistence region, the system spontaneously forms a ""slab
state"", with two wall-attached crystalline domains separated by (flat)
interfaces from liquid in full equilibrium with the crystal in between;
analysis of such states allows a precise estimation of the bulk equilibrium
properties at phase coexistence.

Orion, NGC 2071 and L1641 S3 MMS 1. The extended SMA (eSMA) probes structure at
angular resolutions up to 0.2"", revealing protostellar disks on scales of 200
AU. Continuum flux measurements on these scales indicate that a significant
amount of mass, a few tens of M{\odot}, are present. Envelope, stellar, and
disk masses are derived using both compact, extended and eSMA configurations
and compared against SED-fitting models. We hypothesize that fragmentation into
three components occurred within NGC 2071 at an early time, when the envelopes
were less than 10% of their current masses, e.g. < 0.5 M{\odot}. No
fragmentation occurred for L1641 S3 MMS 1. For NGC 2071 evidence is given that
the bulk of the envelope material currently around each source was accreted
after the initial fragmentation. In addition, about 30% of the total core mass
is not yet associated to one of the three sources. A global accretion model is
favored and a potential accretion history of NGC 2071 is presented. It is shown
that the relatively low level of fragmentation in NGC 2071 was stifled compared
to the expected fragmentation from a Jean's argument.

astroparticle physics research, and additional experimental results are
required for further progress. Here we investigate what can be learned from the
statistical correlation factor r between the depth of shower maximum and the
muon shower size, when these observables are measured simultaneously for a set
of air showers. The correlation factor r contains the lowest-order moment of a
two-dimensional distribution taking both observables into account, and it is
independent of systematic uncertainties of the absolute scales of the two
observables. We find that, assuming realistic measurement uncertainties, the
value of r can provide a measure of the spread of masses in the primary beam.
Particularly, one can differentiate between a well-mixed composition (i.e., a
beam that contains large fractions of both light and heavy primaries) and a
relatively pure composition (i.e., a beam that contains species all of a
similar mass). The number of events required for a statistically significant
differentiation is ~ 200. This differentiation, though diluted, is maintained
to a significant extent in the presence of uncertainties in the phenomenology
of high energy hadronic interactions. Testing whether the beam is pure or
well-mixed is well motivated by recent measurements of the depth of shower
maximum.

trapped-ion two-qubit phase gates and one-qubit gates and found an error per
random two-qubit Clifford unitary of $0.162 \pm 0.008$, thus setting the first
benchmark for such unitaries. By implementing a second set of sequences with an
extra two-qubit phase gate at each step, we extracted an error per phase gate
of $0.069 \pm 0.017$. We conducted these experiments with movable,
sympathetically cooled ions in a multi-zone Paul trap - a system that can in

result by Dirac where he identified the simple 3-connected graphs with no minor
isomorphic to the prism graph. We prove that besides Dirac's infinite families
of graphs and four infinite families of non-regular matroids determined by
Oxley, there are only three possibilities for a matroid in this class: it is
isomorphic to the dual of the generalized parallel connection of $F_7$ with
itself across a triangle with an element of the triangle deleted; it's rank is
bounded by 5; or it admits a non-minimal exact 3-separation induced by the
3-separation in $P_9$. Since the prism graph has rank 5, the class has to
contain the binary projective geometries of rank 3 and 4, $F_7$ and $PG(3, 2)$,
respectively. We show that there is just one rank 5 extremal matroid in the
class. It has 17 elements and is an extension of $R_{10}$, the unique splitter
for regular matroids. As a corollary, we obtain Dillon, Mayhew, and Royle's
result identifying the binary internally 4-connected matroids with no prism

The new algorithm is a combination of three techniques, namely smoothing,
Lagrangian decomposition and path-following gradient framework. The algorithm
decomposes the original problem into smaller subproblems by using dual
decomposition and smoothing via self-concordant barriers, updates the dual
variables using a path-following gradient method and allows one to solve the
subproblem in parallel. Moreover, the algorithmic parameters are updated
automatically without any tuning strategy as in augmented Lagrangian
approaches. We prove the global convergence of the new algorithm and analyze
its local convergence rate. Then, we modify the proposed algorithm by applying
Nesterov's accelerating scheme to get a new variant which has a better local
convergence rate. Finally, we present preliminary numerical tests that confirm
the theory development.

explore electronic excitation energy transfer in the context of
light-harvesting complexes in photosynthetic antenna systems, and comment on
some new insights into the underlying physics. Advantages and pitfalls of these
methodologies are discussed, as are some physical insights into the
photosynthetic dynamics. By combining results from molecular modelling of the
complexes (structural description) with an effective non-equilibrium
statistical description (time evolution), we identify some general features,
regardless of the particular distribution in the protein scaffold, that are
central to light-harvesting dynamics and, that could ultimately be related to
the high efficiency of the overall process. Based on these general common
features, some possible new directions in the field are discussed.

spaces. The notions of interior and closure are generalized using these sets. A
detail study is carried out on properties of semiopen, semiclosed soft sets,
semi interior and semi closure of a soft set in a soft topological space.
Various forms of soft functions, like semicontinuous, irresolute, semiopen soft
functions are introduced and characterized. Further soft semicompactness,soft
semiconnectedness and soft semiseparation axioms are introduced and studied.

quantizers asymptotically make an equal contribution to the distortion of the
quantizer. Motivated by this fact, we investigate in this paper quantizers in
the scalar case, where each codecell contributes with exactly the same portion
to the quantization error. We will show that such quantizers of Gersho type -
or Gersho quantizers for short - exist for non-atomic scalar distributions. As
a main result we will prove that Gersho quantizers are asymptotically optimal.

1974, just before the advent of QCD, when quark-model ideas, duality principles
and vector meson dominance were widely accepted, developed and applied. The
present author had the privilege to collaborate with Mario in most of these
contributions and looking backward in time to remember the good old days we
spent together in Frascati has been a great pleasure.

environments have recently received renewed attention with the discovery of
long-lived coherences in different photosynthetic complexes. This experimental
evidence has raised two fundamental questions: Firstly, what are the mechanisms
supporting long-lived coherences and secondly, how can we assess the possible
functional role that the interplay of noise and quantum coherence might play in
the seemingly optimal operation of biological systems under natural conditions?
Here we review recent results, illuminate them at the hand of two paradigmatic
systems, the Fenna-Matthew-Olson (FMO) complex and the light harvesting complex
LHII, and present new progress on both questions. In particular we introduce
the concept of the phonon antennae and discuss the possible microscopic origin
or long-lived electronic coherences.

theory of modular arithmetic in the scheme of the cipher. Based on observed
implementation of the proposed cipher on a set of real data files of several
types, all results are tabulated and analyzed.The schematic strength of the
cipher and the freedom of using a long key-space expectedly can make it
reasonably nonvulnerable against possible cryptanalytic attacks. As a part of
the future scope of the work, it is also intended to formulate and implement an
enhanced scheme that will use a carrier image to have a secure transmission of
the private key.
