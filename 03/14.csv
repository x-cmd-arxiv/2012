Astronomy at Terahertz frequencies operated on the Stratospheric Observatory
for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). GREAT is a modular dual-color heterodyne
instrument for highresolution far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy. Selected for
SOFIA's Early Science demonstration, the instrument has successfully performed
three Short and more than a dozen Basic Science flights since first light was
recorded on its April 1, 2011 commissioning flight.
  We report on the in-flight performance and operation of the receiver that -
in various flight configurations, with three different detector channels -
observed in several science-defined frequency windows between 1.25 and 2.5 THz.
The receiver optics was verified to be diffraction-limited as designed, with
nominal efficiencies; receiver sensitivities are state-of-the-art, with
excellent system stability. The modular design allows for the continuous
integration of latest technologies; we briefly discuss additional channels
under development and ongoing improvements for Cycle 1 observations.
  GREAT is a principal investigator instrument, developed by a consortium of
four German research institutes, available to the SOFIA users on a
collaborative basis.

under the attractions of a star and a giant planet which orbits the star on a
much wider and elliptic orbit. In particular, we focus on the influence of an
eccentric orbit of the outer perturber on the dynamics of a small highly
inclined inner body. Our analytical study of the secular perturbations relies
on the classical octupole hamiltonian expansion (third-order theory in the
ratio of the semi-major axes), as third-order terms are needed to consider the
secular variations of the outer perturber and potential secular resonances
between the arguments of the pericenter and/or longitudes of the node of both
bodies. Short-period averaging and node reduction (Laplace plane) reduce the
problem to two degrees of freedom. The four-dimensional dynamics is analyzed
through representative planes which identify the main equilibria of the
problem. As in the circular problem (i.e. perturber on a circular orbit), the
""Kozai-bifurcated"" equilibria play a major role in the dynamics of an inner
body on quasi-circular orbit: its eccentricity variations are very limited for
mutual inclination between the orbital planes smaller than ~40^{\deg}, while
they become large and chaotic for higher mutual inclination. Particular
attention is also given to a region around 35^{\deg} of mutual inclination,
detected numerically by Funk et al. (2011) and consisting of long-time stable
and particularly low eccentric orbits of the small body. Using a 12th-order
Hamiltonian expansion in eccentricities and inclinations, in particular its
action-angle formulation obtained by Lie transforms in Libert & Henrard (2008),
we show that this region presents an equality of two fundamental frequencies
and can be regarded as a secular resonance. Our results also apply to binary
star systems where a planet is revolving around one of the two stars.

The analysis is based on a dynamical system approach and makes use of an

perfect fluids and provides a measure of deviation from isotropy. Thereby the
role of perfect fluid solutions is put into a broader context.
  The results of this paper concern the past and future asymptotic dynamics of
locally rotationally symmetric solutions of type VIII with anisotropic matter.
It is shown that solutions whose matter source is sufficiently close to being
isotropic exhibit the same qualitative dynamics as perfect fluid solutions.
However a high degree of anisotropy of the matter model can cause dynamics to
differ significantly from the vacuum and perfect fluid case.

We consider a general CTRW with symmetric and continuous (but otherwise

distribution $\psi(\tau)$. The traps are initially distributed uniformly in
space with density $\rho$. We prove an exact relation, valid for all time $t$,
between $P_s(t)$ and the expected maximum $E[M(t)]$ of the trap process up to
time $t$, for rather general stochastic motion $x_{\rm trap}(t)$ of each trap.
When $x_{\rm trap}(t)$ represents a general CTRW with arbitrary $f(\eta)$ and
$\psi(\tau)$, we are able to compute exactly the first two leading terms in the
asymptotic behavior of $E[M(t)]$ for large $t$. This allows us subsequently to
compute the precise asymptotic behavior, $P_s(t)\sim a\, \exp[-b\,

crystal of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ by using Compton scattering. A
two-dimensional (2D) momentum density reconstruction from measured Compton
profiles yields a clear FS signature in the third Brillouin zone along [100].
The quantitative agreement between density functional theory (DFT) calculations
and momentum density experiment suggests that Fermi-liquid physics is restored
in the overdoped regime. In particular the predicted FS topology is found to be
in good accord with the corresponding experimental data. We find similar
quantitative agreement between the measured 2D angular correlation of positron
annihilation radiation (2D-ACAR) spectra and the DFT based computations.
However, 2D-ACAR does not give such a clear signature of the FS in the extended
momentum space in either the theory or the experiment.

\gamma-ray variability on timescales of the order of one to two months possibly
linked to the X-ray outburst that takes place about 100 days after the
periastron passage. Furthermore our measurements provide for the first time the

colors to the vertices of G such that for every edge e of G, the vertices of e
are colored by at least min{c,|e|} distinct colors. The hypergraph G is
t-intersecting if every two edges of G have at least t vertices in common. We
ask: for fixed c >= 2 and t >= 1, what is the minimum number of colors that is
sufficient to c-strong color any t-intersecting hypergraphs?
  The purpose of this note is to answer the question for some values of t and c
and, more importantly, to describe the settings for which the question is still
open. We show that when t <= c-2, no finite number of colors is sufficient to
c-strong color all t-intersecting hypergraphs. It is still unknown whether a
finite number of colors suffices for the same task when t = c-1 and c > 2. In
the last case, when t >= c, we show with a probabilistic argument that a finite

hypergraphs, but a large gap still remains between the best upper and lower

cosmological model. The majority of the methods to derive constraints on
cosmological parameters use second-order statistics of the cosmic shear.
Despite their success, second-order statistics are not optimal and degeneracies
between some parameters remain. Tighter constraints can be obtained if
second-order statistics are combined with a statistic that is efficient to
capture non-Gaussianity. In this paper, we search for such a statistical tool
and we show that there is additional information to be extracted from
statistical analysis of the convergence maps beyond what can be obtained from
statistical analysis of the shear field. For this purpose, we have carried out
a large number of cosmological simulations along the {\sigma}8-{\Omega}m
degeneracy, and we have considered three different statistics commonly used for
non-Gaussian features characterization: skewness, kurtosis and peak count. To
be able to investigate non-Gaussianity directly in the shear field we have used
the aperture mass definition of these three statistics for different scales.
Then, the results have been compared with the results obtained with the same
statistics estimated in the convergence maps at the same scales. First, we show
that shear statistics give similar constraints to those given by convergence
statistics, if the same scale is considered. In addition, we find that the peak
count statistic is the best to capture non-Gaussianities in the weak lensing
field and to break the {\sigma}8-{\Omega}m degeneracy. We show that this
statistical analysis should be conducted in the convergence maps: first,
because there exist fast algorithms to compute the convergence map for
different scales, and secondly because it offers the opportunity to denoise the
reconstructed convergence map, which improves non-Gaussian features extraction.

unintentionally deposited few monolayer films of surface contamination. This
contamination arises from the diverse population of volatile organics and
inorganics in the atmosphere. Such surface contamination can affect the
uncertainties in determination of thickness, roughness and density of thin film
structures by X-Ray Reflectometry (XRR). Here we study the effect of a 0.5 nm
carbon surface contamination layer on thickness determination for a 20 nm
titanium nitride thin film on silicon. Uncertainties calculated using
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian statistical methods from simulated data of
clean and contaminated TiN thin films are compared at varying degrees of data
quality to study (1) whether synchrotron sources cope better with contamination
than laboratory sources and (2) whether cleaning off the surface of thin films
prior to XRR measurement is necessary. We show that, surprisingly,
contributions to uncertainty from surface contamination can dominate
uncertainty estimates, leading to minimal advantages in using synchrotron- over
laboratory-intensity data. Further, even prior knowledge of the exact nature of
the surface contamination does not significantly reduce the contamination's
contribution to the uncertainty in the TiN layer thickness. We conclude, then,
that effective and standardized cleaning protocols are necessary to achieve
high levels of accuracy in XRR measurement.

against entero-pathogens. As with other ecosystems, its species composition is
resilient against small disturbances but strong perturbations such as
antibiotics can affect the consortium dramatically. Antibiotic cessation does
not necessarily restore pre-treatment conditions and disturbed microbiota are
often susceptible to pathogen invasion. Here we propose a mathematical model to
explain how antibiotic-mediated switches in the microbiota composition can
result from simple social interactions between antibiotic-tolerant and
antibiotic-sensitive bacterial groups. We build a two-species (e.g. two
functional-groups) model and identify regions of domination by
antibiotic-sensitive or antibiotic-tolerant bacteria, as well as a region of
multistability where domination by either group is possible. Using a new
framework that we derived from statistical physics, we calculate the duration
of each microbiota composition state. This is shown to depend on the balance
between random fluctuations in the bacterial densities and the strength of
microbial interactions. The singular value decomposition of recent metagenomic
data confirms our assumption of grouping microbes as antibiotic-tolerant or
antibiotic-sensitive in response to a single antibiotic. Our methodology can be
extended to multiple bacterial groups and thus it provides an ecological
formalism to help interpret the present surge in microbiome data.

buildup of asymmetric excitation structures. These aggregates can extend over
the entire ensemble volume, but are in general not localized relative to the
system boundaries. The characteristic distances between neighboring excitations
depend on the laser detuning and on the interaction potential. These properties
lead to characteristic features in the spatial excitation density, the Mandel
$Q$ parameter, and the total number of excitations. As an application an
implementation of the three-atom CSWAP or Fredkin gate with Rydberg atoms is
discussed. The gate not only exploits the Rydberg blockade, but also utilizes
the special features of an asymmetric geometric arrangement of the three atoms.

under the additional assumption that X has a polarization of degree 2d with p >

improve the main result to K3 surfaces which admit a polarization of degree

construct ample divisors on the moduli space. We also establish

this work we approximated the mechanism by introducing variations in the
convective parameters of the Florida-Budapest hydrodynamic code and also by
means of amplitude equations. We found that the process is only effective for
long modulation periods, typically for more than hundred days, in agreement
with the thermal time scales of the pulsation in RR Lyrae stars. Due to the
slow response of the pulsation to the structure changes, short period, high
amplitude Blazhko-modulation cannot be reproduced with this mechanism or would
require implausible variations in the convective parameters on short time
scales. We also found that the modulation of the mixing length results in
strong differences between both the luminosity and radius variations and the
respective phase modulations of the two quantities, suggesting notable
differences between the energy output of the photosphere and the mechanical
variations of the layers. The findings suggest that the convective cycle model

system causes orbital instability. The subsequent chaotic orbital evolution of
the stars triggers close encounters, collisions, exchanges between the stellar

(including Sirius like binaries). We demonstrate that the rate of stellar
collisions due to the TEDI is approximately 10^{-4} yr^{-1} per Milky-Way
Galaxy, which is nearly 30 times higher than the total collision rate due to
random encounters in the Galactic globular clusters. Moreover, we find that the
dominant type of stellar collisions is qualitatively different; most collisions
involve asymptotic giant branch stars, rather than main sequence, or slightly
evolved stars, which dominate collisions in globular clusters. The TEDI
mechanism should lead us to revise our understanding of collisions and the
formation of compact, eccentric binaries in the field.

Using our 1D spherically-symmetric implementation, we show that, similar to the
photon transport case, the implicit scheme enables significantly larger
timesteps compared with explicit time discretization, without sacrificing
accuracy, while the discrete-diffusion method leads to significant speed-ups at
high optical depth. Our results suggest that a combination of spectral,

et al. (2011), half of all SNe Ia with detectable Na D absorption at the

providing the first link between the progenitor systems and properties of the
explosion. This finding is further evidence that the outflow scenario is the
correct interpretation of the blueshifted Na D absorption, adding additional
confirmation that some SNe Ia are produced from a single-degenerate progenitor
channel. An additional implication is that either SN Ia progenitor systems have
highly asymmetric outflows that are also aligned with the SN explosion or SNe
Ia come from a variety of progenitor systems where SNe Ia from systems with
strong outflows tend to have more kinetic energy per unit mass than those from

companion star captures some of the mass ejected in a wind by the primary star.
The captured material forms an accretion disk. Here, we study the evolution of
wind-accretion disks, using a numerical approach which allows us to follow the
long term evolution. For a broad range of initial conditions, we derive the
radial density and temperature profiles of the disk. In most cases,
wind-accretion leads to long-lived stable disks over the lifetime of the AGB
donor star. The disks have masses of a few times 10^{-5}-10^{-3} M_sun, with
surface density and temperature profiles that follow broken power-laws. The
total mass in the disk scales approximately linearly with the viscosity
parameter used. Roughly 50% to 80% of the mass falling into the disk accretes
onto the central star; the rest flows out through the outer edge of the disk
into the stellar wind of the primary. For systems with large accretion rates,
the secondary accretes as much as 0.1 M_sun. When the secondary is a white
dwarf, accretion naturally leads to nova and supernova eruptions. For all types
of secondary star, the surface density and temperature profiles of massive
disks resemble structures observed in protoplanetary disks, suggesting that
coordinated observational programs might improve our understanding of uncertain
disk physics.

companion in a 2.2 hr orbit, was reported. The combination of this orbital
period and the very low mass function is unique. The discoverers, Bailes et
al., proposed an ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) as the progenitor system.
However, the standard UCXB scenario would not produce this system as the time
required to reach this orbital period exceeds the current estimate of the age
of the Universe. The detached state of the system aggravates the problem. Aims.
We want to understand the evolutionary history of PSR J1719-1438, and determine
under which circumstances it could have evolved from an UCXB. Methods. We model
UCXB evolution varying the donor size and investigate the effect of a wind mass
loss from the donor, and compare the results with the observed characteristics
of PSR J1719-1438. Results. An UCXB can reach a 2.2 hr orbit within the age of
the Universe, provided that 1) the millisecond pulsar can significantly heat
and expand the donor by pulsar irradiation, or 2) the system loses extra
orbital angular momentum, e.g. via a fast wind from the donor. Conclusions. The
most likely scenario for the formation of PSR J1719-1438 is UCXB evolution
driven by angular momentum loss via the usual gravitational wave emission,
which is enhanced by angular momentum loss via a donor wind of ~3x10^-13
Msun/yr. Depending on the size of the donor during the evolution, the companion
presently probably has a mass of ~1-3 Jupiter masses, making it a very low mass
white dwarf as proposed by Bailes et al. Its composition can be either helium
or carbon-oxygen. A helium white dwarf companion makes the long (for an UCXB)
orbital period easier to explain, but the required inclination makes it a
priori less likely than a carbon-oxygen white dwarf.

produced in a binary merger can recoil with a velocity as large as 5,000 km/s.
Because of enhanced gravitational-wave emission in the so-called ""hang-up""
configurations, this maximum recoil occurs when the black-hole spins are
partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum. We revisit our previous
statistical analysis of post-Newtonian evolutions of black-hole binaries in the
light of these new findings. We demonstrate that despite these new
configurations with enhanced recoil velocities, spin alignment during the
post-Newtonian stage of the inspiral will still significantly suppress (or
enhance) kick magnitudes when the initial spin of the more massive black hole
is more (or less) closely aligned with the orbital angular momentum than that
of the smaller hole. We present a preliminary study of how this post-Newtonian
spin alignment affects the ejection probabilities of supermassive black holes
from their host galaxies with astrophysically motivated mass ratio and initial
spin distributions. We find that spin alignment suppresses (enhances) ejection
probabilities by ~ 40% (20%) for an observationally motivated mass-dependent
galactic escape velocity, and by an even greater amount for a constant escape
velocity of 1,000 km/s. Kick suppression is thus at least a factor two more
efficient than enhancement.

magnetic fields and anisotropies in the circumstellar envelopes of evolved
stars. Here we present the first detection of thermal CO(J=2-1) and SiO(J=5-4,
v=0) polarization, in the envelope of the asymptotic giant branch star IK Tau.
The observed polarization direction does not match predictions for
circumstellar envelope polarization induced only by an anisotropic radiation
field. Assuming that the polarization is purely due to the Goldreich-Kylafis
effect, the linear polarization direction is defined by the magnetic field as
even the small Zeeman splitting of CO and SiO dominates the molecular
collisional and spontaneous emission rates. The polarization was mapped using
the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and is predominantly north-south. There is close
agreement between the CO and SiO observations, even though the CO polarization
arises in the circumstellar envelope at ~800 AU and the SiO polarization at
<250 AU. If the polarization indeed traces the magnetic field, we can thus
conclude that it maintains a large-scale structure throughout the circumstellar
envelope. We propose that the magnetic field, oriented either east-west or
north-south is responsible for the east-west elongation of the CO distribution
and asymmetries in the dust envelope. In the future, the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array will be able to map the magnetic field using CO
polarization for a large number of evolved stars.

particle and pairwise metrics. This leads to phase space constraints that are
extremely complicated beyond the lowest orders in perturbation theory, and in
practice they must be implemented numerically. This complication presents a
significant barrier to gaining an analytic understanding of the perturbative
structure of jet cross sections. We present a novel framework to express the
jet algorithm's phase space constraints as a function of clustered groups of
particles, which are the possible outcomes of the algorithm. This approach
highlights the analytic properties of jet observables, rather than the explicit
constraints on individual final state momenta, which can be unwieldy at higher
orders. We derive the form of the n-particle phase space constraints for a jet
algorithm with any measurement. We provide an expression for the measurement
that makes clustering effects manifest and relates them to constraints from
clustering at lower orders. The utility of this framework is demonstrated by
using it to understand clustering effects for a large class of jet shape
observables in the soft/collinear limit. We apply this framework to isolate
divergences and analyze the logarithmic structure of the Abelian terms in the
soft function, providing the all-orders form of these terms and showing that
corrections from clustering start at next-to-leading logarithmic order in the
exponent of the cross section.

represented by a power law S_tau(x) ~ x^{beta} with index beta ~ 0.33 +/- 0.07
corresponding to a power spectrum P_tau(U) ~ U^{-2.33}. This is slightly
shallower than the earlier reported power law index of ~ 2.5-3.0 at ~ 1000 AU

of ~ 20-60 times higher than the extrapolated amplitude from observation of Cas
A at larger scales. On the other hand, extrapolating the AU scale structure

important feedback mechanism in forming star clusters and the disks of
starburst galaxies. However, there is great uncertainty in how efficiently
radiation couples to matter in these high optical depth environments. In
particular, it is unclear what levels of turbulence the radiation can produce,
and whether the infrared radiation trapped by the dust opacity can give rise to
heavily mass-loaded winds. In this paper we report a series of two-dimensional
flux-limited diffusion radiation-hydrodynamics calculations performed with the
code ORION in which we drive strong radiation fluxes through columns of dusty
matter confined by gravity. We consider both systems where the radiation flux
is sub-Eddington throughout the gas column, and where it is super-Eddington at
the midplane but sub-Eddington in the atmosphere. In the latter, we find that
the radiation-matter interaction gives rise to radiation-driven Rayleigh-Taylor
instability, which drives supersonic turbulence at a level sufficient to fully
explain the turbulence seen in Galactic protocluster gas clouds, and to make a
non-trivial contribution to the turbulence observed in starburst galaxy disks.
However, the instability also produces a channel structure in which the
radiation-matter interaction is reduced because the radiation field is not
fully trapped. For astrophysical parameters relevant to forming star clusters
and starburst galaxies, we find that this effect reduces the net momentum
deposition rate in the dusty gas by a factor of ~2-6 compared to simple
analytic estimates, and that in steady state the Eddington ratio reaches unity
and there are no strong winds. We provide an approximation formula, appropriate
for implementation in analytic models and non-radiative simulations, for the
force exerted by the infrared radiation field in this regime.

massive star formation and possibly accretion onto a supermassive black hole,
by providing large amounts of dense molecular gas down to the central
kiloparsec region. Several scenarios to drive the gas further down to the
central ~100 pc, have been proposed, including the formation of a nuclear disk
around the black hole, where massive stars would produce supernovae. Here, we
probe the radial distribution of supernovae and supernova remnants in the
nuclear regions of the starburst galaxies M82, Arp 299-A, and Arp 220, by using
high-angular resolution (< 0.""1) radio observations published in the literature
(for M82 and Arp 220), or obtained by ourselves from the European VLBI Network
(Arp 299-A). Our main goal was to characterize the nuclear starbursts in those
galaxies and thus test scenarios that propose that nuclear disks of sizes ~100
pc form in the central regions of starburst galaxies. We obtained the radial
distribution of supernovae (SNe) in the nuclear starbursts of M82, Arp 299-A,

powering the bursts in those central regions. The scale lengths for the
(exponential) disks range from ~20-30 pc for Arp 299-A and Arp 220, up to ~140
pc for M82. The radial distribution of SNe for the nuclear disks in Arp 299-A
and Arp 220 is also consistent with a power-law surface density profile of
exponent gamma=1, as expected from detailed hydrodynamical simulations of
nuclear disks. Our results support scenarios where a nuclear disk of size ~100
pc is formed in (U)LIRGs, and sustained by gas pressure, in which case the
accretion onto the black hole could be lowered by supernova feedback.

Vassiliadis & Wood mass-loss rate, which stays low until the pulsation period
reaches 500 days after which point a superwind begins. Vassiliadis & Wood noted
that for stars over 2.5Msun the superwind should be delayed until P ~ 750 days
at 5Msun. We calculate evolutionary sequences where we delay the onset of the
superwind to pulsation periods of P ~ 700-800 days in models of M = 5, 6, and
7Msun. Post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations show that the 6 and 7Msun
models produce the most Rb, with [Rb/Fe] ~ 1 dex, close to the average of most
of the Galactic Rb-rich stars ([Rb/Fe] ~ 1.4 plus or minus 0.8 dex). Changing
the rate of the 22Ne + alpha reactions results in variations of [Rb/Fe] as
large as 0.5 dex in models with a delayed superwind. The largest enrichment in
heavy elements is found for models that adopt the NACRE rate of the
22Ne(a,n)25Mg reaction. Using this rate allows us to best match the composition
of most of the Rb-rich stars. A synthetic evolution algorithm is then used to
remove the remaining envelope resulting in final [Rb/Fe] of ~ 1.4 dex although
with C/O ratios > 1. We conclude that delaying the superwind may account for
the large Rb overabundances observed in the brightest metal-rich AGB stars.

to exclude EWBG in the MSSM at greater than (90) 95% confidence level in the

probability distribution for that variable. When further information is
available, in the form of a finite interval in which the variable is known to
lie, we indicate how the distribution for the variable in this case can be
obtained. A Gaussian distribution should only be used in this case when the
standard deviation is small compared to the range of variation (the length of
the interval). In general, when the interval is finite, the parameters of the
distribution should be evaluated numerically, as suggested by I. Lira,

variation is equivalent to a bias of the distribution toward a flat
distribution in that range, and the principle of minimum Kullback entropy (mKE)
should be used in the derivation of the probability distribution rather than
the MaxEnt, thus leading to an exponential distribution with non Gaussian
features. Furthermore, up to evaluating the distribution negentropy, we
quantify the deviation of mKE distributions from MaxEnt ones and, thus, we

scattering in the Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE) are
significantly larger than those calculated by all models based on the impulse
approximation and using the world average value for the axial mass of $M_A
\approx 1 \GeV$. This discrepancy has led to various, quite different
explanations in terms of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form
of the axial form factor, increased vector strength in nuclei, and initial
two-particle interactions. This is disconcerting since the neutrino energy
reconstruction depends on the reaction mechanism. Purpose: We investigate
whether exclusive observables, such as nucleon knock-out, can be used to
distinguish between the various proposed reaction mechanisms. We determine the
influence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction. Method: We use the
Giessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and
spectra of knock-out nucleons. The model is extended by incorporating a simple,
but realistic treatment of initial 2p-2h excitations. Results: We show numbers
and spectra of knock-out nucleons and show their sensitivity to the presence of
2p-2h initial excitations. We also discuss the influence of 2p-2h excitations
on the neutrino energy reconstruction. Conclusions: 2p-2h excitations do lead
to an increase in the number $n$ of knock-out nucleons for $n \ge 2$ while only
the $n=1$ knock-out remains a clean signal of true QE scattering. The spectra
of knock-out nucleons do also change, but their qualitative shape remains as
before. In the energy reconstruction 2p-2h interactions lead to a downward
shift of the reconstructed energy; this effect of 2p-2h excitations disappears
at higher energies because the 2p-2h influence is spread out over a wider
energy range.

contain a large number of stars and compact objects. A fraction of these are
likely to be members of binaries. Here we discuss the binary population of
stellar black holes and neutron stars near SMBHs and focus on the secular
evolution of such binaries, due to the perturbation by the SMBH. Binaries with
highly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the SMBH are strongly
affected by secular Kozai processes, which periodically change their
eccentricities and inclinations (Kozai-cycles). During periapsis approach, at
the highest eccentricities during the Kozai-cycles, gravitational wave emission
becomes highly efficient. Some binaries in this environment can inspiral and
coalesce at timescales much shorter than a Hubble time and much shorter than
similar binaries which do not reside near a SMBH. The close environment of
SMBHs could therefore serve as catalyst for the inspiral and coalescence of
binaries, and strongly affect their orbital properties. Such compact binaries
would be detectable as gravitational wave (GW) sources by the next generation
of GW detectors (e.g. advanced- LIGO). About 0.5% of such nuclear merging
binaries will enter the LIGO observational window while on orbit that are still
very eccentric (e>~0.5). The efficient gravitational wave analysis for such
systems would therefore require the use of eccentric templates. We also find
that binaries very close to the MBH could evolve through a complex dynamical
(non-secular) evolution leading to emission of several GW pulses during only a
few yrs (though these are likely to be rare). Finally, we note that the
formation of close stellar binaries, X-ray binaries and their merger products
could be induced by similar secular processes, combined with tidal friction
rather than GW emission as in the case of compact object binaries.

gravitational instabilities may be triggered by localized enhancements in the
dust-to-gas ratio, and one hypothesis is that sufficient enhancements may be
produced in the pile-up of small solid particles inspiralling under aerodynamic
drag from the large mass reservoir in the outer disc. Studies of particle
pile-up in static gas discs have provided partial support for this hypothesis.
Here, we study the radial and temporal evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio in
turbulent discs, that evolve under the action of viscosity and
photoevaporation. We find that particle pile-ups do not generically occur
within evolving discs, particularly if the introduction of large grains is
restricted to the inner, dense regions of a disc. Instead, radial drift results
in depletion of solids from the outer disc, while the inner disc maintains a
dust-to-gas ratio that is within a factor of ~2 of the initial value. We
attribute this result to the short time-scales for turbulent diffusion and
radial advection (with the mean gas flow) in the inner disc. We show that the
qualitative evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio depends only weakly upon the
parameters of the disc model (the disc mass, size, viscosity, and value of the
Schmidt number), and discuss the implications for planetesimal formation via
collective instabilities. Our results suggest that in discs where there is a
significant level of midplane turbulence and accretion, planetesimal formation
would need to be possible in the absence of large-scale enhancements. Instead,
trapping and concentration of particles within local turbulent structures may
be required as a first stage of planetesimal formation.

the computational power of vectorized hardware is used, utilizing either
multi-core computer power or graphics processing units. The approach is a
self-consistent way to solve the radiative transfer equation in arbitrary dust
configurations. The code calculates the equilibrium temperatures of two
populations of large grains and stochastic heated polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAH). Anisotropic scattering is treated applying the
Heney-Greenstein phase function. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the
object is derived at low spatial resolution by a photon counting procedure and
at high spatial resolution by a vectorized ray-tracer. The latter allows
computation of high signal-to-noise images of the objects at any frequencies
and arbitrary viewing angles. We test the robustness of our approach against
other radiative transfer codes. The SED and dust temperatures of one and two
dimensional benchmarks are reproduced at high precision. We utilize the
Lucy-algorithm for the optical thin case where the Poisson noise is high, the
iteration free Bjorkman & Wood method to reduce the calculation time, and the
Fleck & Canfield diffusion approximation for extreme optical thick cells. The
code is applied to model the appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at
optical and infrared wavelengths. The AGN torus is clumpy and includes fluffy
composite grains of various sizes made-up of silicates and carbon. The
dependence of the SED on the number of clumps in the torus and the viewing

Sigut & Pradhan (2003) include details of the FeII ion microphysics and cover a
wide range in ionization parameter log U_ion= (-3.0 -> -1.3) and density log

main goals are to confirm the role played by Ly\alpha-fluorescence mechanisms

used to subtract it in other sources. A good overall match between the observed
FeII+MgII features with those predicted by the best fitted model is obtained,
corroborating the Ly\alpha-fluorescence as a key process to understand the FeII
spectrum. The best model is then adjusted by applying a deconvolution method on
the observed FeII+MgII spectrum. The derived semi-empirical template is then
fitted to the spectrum of Ark 564, suitably reproducing its observed FeII+MgII

system can form, provided that the mutual inclination is excited by some
dynamical mechanism. Resonant interactions and close planetary encounters are
thought to be the primary inclination-excitation mechanisms, resulting in a
resonant and non-resonant system, respectively. Here we propose an alternative
formation scenario, starting from a system composed of three giant planets in a
nearly coplanar configuration. As was recently shown for the case of the Solar
system, planetary migration in the gas disc (Type II migration) can force the
planets to become trapped in a multiply resonant state. We simulate this
process, assuming different values for the planetary masses and mass ratios. We
show that such a triple resonance generally becomes unstable as the resonance
excites the eccentricities of all planets and planet-planet scattering sets in.
One of the three planets is typically ejected from the system, leaving behind a
dynamically 'hot' (but stable) two-planet configuration. The resulting
two-planet systems typically have large values of semimajor axial ratios (a1/a2
< 0.3), while the mutual inclination can be as high as 70{\deg}, with a median
of \sim30{\deg}. A small fraction of our two-planet systems (\sim5 per cent)
ends up in the stability zone of the Kozai resonance. In a few cases, the
triple resonance can remain stable for long times and a '3D' system can form by
resonant excitation of the orbital inclinations; such a three-planet system
could be stable if enough eccentricity damping is exerted on the planets.
Finally, in the single-planet resulting systems, which are formed when two
planets are ejected from the system, the inclination of the planet's orbital
plane with respect to the initial invariant plane -presumably the plane
perpendicular to the star's spin axis- can be as large as \sim40{\deg}.

reaching the center in 30 kyr and 10% in 10 Myr. The average metallicity of the
combined returning ejecta and the pristine filaments feeding into the halo
center from the cosmic web is 0.001 - 0.01 Z_sun, but the two remain unmixed
until accreting onto the central hydrostatic core that is unresolved at the end
of the simulation. We conclude that if Population III stars had less extreme
masses, they promptly enriched the host minihalos with metals and triggered
Population II star formation.

insulators via proximity, Majorana modes will be trapped on the vortex cores.
The same effects hold for doped topological insulators which become bulk s-wave
superconductors as long as the doping does not exceed a critical values $
\mu^{\pm}_c.$ It is this critical chemical potential at which the material
forgets it arose from a band-inverted topological insulator; it loses its
topological \emph{imprint.} For the most common classes of topological
insulators, which can be modeled with a minimal 4-band Dirac model the values
of $\mu^{\pm}_c$ can be easily calculated, but for materials with more
complicated electronic structures such as HgTe or ScPtBi the result is unknown.
We show that due to the hybridization with an additional Kramers' pair of
topologically trivial bands the topological imprint of HgTe-like electronic
structures (which includes the ternary Heusler compounds) can be widely
extended for p-doping. As a practical consequence we consider the effects of
such hybridization on the range of doping over which Majorana modes will be
bound to vortices in superconducting topological insulators and show that the
range is strongly extended for p-doping, and reduced for n-doping. This leaves
open the possibility that other topological phenomena may be stabilized over a
wider range of doping.

relations that occur, by varying the physical and initial orbital parameters of
the planets (mass, initial semi-major axis and eccentricity) as well as the
parameters of the migration forces (migration rate and eccentricity damping
rate), which are modeled here through a simplified analytic prescription. We
find that, in general, for planetary masses below 1.5 M_J, multiple-planet
resonances of the form n3:n2:n1=1:2:4 and 1:3:6 are established, as the inner
planets, m1 and m2, get trapped in a 1:2 resonance and the outer planet m3
subsequently is captured in a 1:2 or 1:3 resonance with m2. For mild
eccentricity damping, the resonance pumps the eccentricities of all planets on
a relatively short time-scale, to the point where they enter an
inclination-type resonance (as in Libert & Tsiganis 2011); then mutual
inclinations can grow to ~35{\deg}, thus forming a ""3-D system"". On the other
hand, we find that trapping of m2 in a 2:3 resonance with m1 occurs very
rarely, for the range of masses used here, so only two cases of capture in a
respective three-planet resonance were found. Our results suggest that trapping
in a three-planet resonance can be common in exoplanetary systems, provided
that the planets are not very massive. Inclination pumping could then occur
relatively fast, provided that eccentricity damping is not very efficient so
that at least one of the inner planets acquires an orbital eccentricity higher
than e=0.3.

with zero $\Lambda$. The effective gravitational coupling differs essentially
in these two phases. Generalizing the previous result of Barvinsky we show that
the non-local theory in question is free of ghosts on the background of any

to the phase with a positive $\Lambda$, where the entropy vanishes for any type
of horizon, in an Einstein spacetime with zero cosmological constant the

somewhat surprisingly, the presence of any, even extremely tiny, positive

have so far concentrated on the colder parts (T<30K) of these regions. The aim
is to characterize the warmer parts of the protostellar envelope in order to
quantify the feedback of the protostars on their surroundings in terms of
shocks, UV heating, photodissociation and outflow dispersal. Fully sampled
large scale maps of the region were obtained; APEX-CHAMP+ was used for 12CO
6-5, 13CO 6-5 and [CI] 2-1, and JCMT-HARP-B for 12CO 3-2 emissions.
Complementary Herschel-HIFI and ground-based lines of CO and its isotopologs,
from 1-0 upto 10-9 (Eu/k 300K), are collected at the source positions.
Radiative-transfer models of the dust and lines are used to determine
temperatures and masses of the outflowing and UV-heated gas and infer the CO
abundance structure. Broad CO emission line profiles trace entrained shocked
gas along the outflow walls, with typical temperatures of ~100K. At other
positions surrounding the outflow and the protostar, the 6-5 line profiles are
narrow indicating UV excitation. The narrow 13CO 6-5 data directly reveal the
UV heated gas distribution for the first time. The amount of UV-heated and
outflowing gas are found to be comparable from the 12CO and 13CO 6-5 maps,
implying that UV photons can affect the gas as much as the outflows. Weak [CI]
emission throughout the region indicates a lack of CO dissociating photons.
Modeling of the C18O lines indicates the necessity of a ""drop"" abundance
profile throughout the envelope where the CO freezes out and is reloaded back
into the gas phase, thus providing quantitative evidence for the CO ice
evaporation zone around the protostars. The inner abundances are less than the
canonical value of CO/H_2=2.7x10^-4, indicating some processing of CO into
other species on the grains.

order to drive turbulence, we injected velocity fluctuations in Fourier space
with frequencies concentrated around $k_{inj}=1/l_{inj}$, as described in
Alvelius (1999). In this paper we extend our previous studies by comparing fast
magnetic reconnection under different mechanisms of turbulence injection by
introducing a new way of turbulence driving. The new method injects velocity or
magnetic eddies with a specified amplitude and scale in random locations
directly in real space. We provide exact relations between the eddy parameters
and turbulent power and injection scale. We performed simulations with new
forcing in order to study turbulent power and injection scale dependencies. The
results show no discrepancy between models with two different methods of

which involves both the attenuation of ocean surface waves by sea ice and the
concomitant breaking of the ice by waves. It is specifically designed to embed
wave-ice interactions in an operational ice/ocean model for the first time. We
investigate different methods of including the wave forcing, and different
criteria for determining if they cause floes to break. We also investigate and
discuss the effects of using various attenuation models, finding that predicted
MIZ widths are quite sensitive to the choice of model. Additional sensitivity
tests are performed on: (i) different parameterizations of the floe size
distribution (FSD), including the initial FSD used; (ii) the properties of the
wave field; and (iii) the sea ice properties such as concentration, thickness
and breaking strain. Results are relatively insensitive to FSD parameterization
but vary noticeably and systematically with its initial configuration, as they
do with properties (ii-iii). An additional, somewhat surprising sensitivity, is
the degree of influence of the numerical scheme that performs wave attenuation
and advection. This is because a naive implementation of spatial and temporal
discretizations can cause the waves to be over-attenuated, leading to a
reduction of the predicted MIZ width by a substantial factor. Example
simulations intended to represent conditions in the Fram Strait in 2007, which
exploit reanalyzed wave and ice model data, are shown to conclude the results
section. These compare favorably to estimates of MIZ width using concentrations
obtained from remotely-sensed passive microwave images.

the failure can also occur in links such as dysfunctional power cables and

($R_{n}$), we propose a link-robustness index ($R_{l}$). We show that solely
enhancing $R_{n}$ cannot guarantee the improvement of $R_{l}$. Moreover, the
structure of $R_{l}$-optimized network is found to be entirely different from
that of onion network. In order to design robust networks resistant to more

general graphs. As any Dirac fermion (including electronic) operator can be
expressed as a linear combination of two Majorana fermion operators, our
results further lead to dualities between interacting Dirac fermionic systems.
The spin duals allow us to predict the feasibility of various standard
transitions as well as spin-glass type behavior in {\it interacting} Majorana
fermion or electronic systems. Several new systems that can be simulated by
arrays of Majorana wires are further introduced and investigated: (1) the {\it

terms. By the use of dualities, we show that all of these systems lie in the 3D

Condensates are very strong candidates for dark matter, since they can solve
some major issues in observational astrophysics, like, for example, the
galactic core/cusp problem. The presence of the dark matter condensates also
drastically affects the cosmic history of the Universe. In the present paper we
analyze the effects of the finite dark matter temperature on the cosmological
evolution of the Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter systems. We formulate the
basic equations describing the finite temperature condensate, representing a
generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation that takes into account the presence of
the thermal cloud in thermodynamic equilibrium with the condensate. The
temperature dependent equations of state of the thermal cloud and of the
condensate are explicitly obtained in an analytical form. By assuming a flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometry, the cosmological evolution of the
finite temperature dark matter filled Universe is considered in detail in the
framework of a two interacting fluid dark matter model, describing the
transition from the initial thermal cloud to the low temperature condensate
state. The dynamics of the cosmological parameters during the finite
temperature dominated phase of the dark matter evolution are investigated in
detail, and it is shown that the presence of the thermal excitations leads to
an overall increase in the expansion rate of the Universe.

learning in an individual human brain is hampered by the presence of effective

it comes to learning higher-level abstractions, i.e., concepts that cover a
vast and highly-nonlinear span of sensory configurations; (3) such high-level
abstractions are best represented in brains by the composition of many levels

better high-level internal representations of their world. These hypotheses put

steep-spectrum radio sources in their central regions, known as radio
mini-halos. It has been proposed that the relativistic electrons responsible
for the emission have been reaccelerated by turbulence generated by the
sloshing of the cool core gas. We present a high-resolution MHD simulation of
gas sloshing in a galaxy cluster coupled with subgrid simulations of
relativistic electron acceleration to test this hypothesis. Our simulation
shows that the sloshing motions generate turbulence on the order of $\delta{v}
\sim$ 50-200 km s$^{-1}$ on spatial scales of $\sim$50-100 kpc and below in the
cool core region within the envelope of the sloshing cold fronts, whereas
outside the cold fronts, there is negligible turbulence. This turbulence is
potentially strong enough to reaccelerate relativistic electron seeds (with
initial $\gamma \sim 100-500$) to $\gamma \sim 10^4$ via damping of
magnetosonic waves and non-resonant compression. The seed electrons could
remain in the cluster from, e.g., past AGN activity. In combination with the
magnetic field amplification in the core, these electrons then produce diffuse
radio synchrotron emission that is coincident with the region bounded by the

resulting radio emission are consistent with observations of minihalos, though

problem in the context of sparse recovery, for applications such as compressed
sensing. The standard proximal gradient method, also known as iterative
soft-thresholding when applied to this problem, has low computational cost per
iteration but a rather slow convergence rate. Nevertheless, when the solution
is sparse, it often exhibits fast linear convergence in the final stage. We
exploit the local linear convergence using a homotopy continuation strategy,
i.e., we solve the $\ell_1$-LS problem for a sequence of decreasing values of
the regularization parameter, and use an approximate solution at the end of
each stage to warm start the next stage. Although similar strategies have been
studied in the literature, there have been no theoretical analysis of their
global iteration complexity. This paper shows that under suitable assumptions
for sparse recovery, the proposed homotopy strategy ensures that all iterates
along the homotopy solution path are sparse. Therefore the objective function
is effectively strongly convex along the solution path, and geometric
convergence at each stage can be established. As a result, the overall
iteration complexity of our method is $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ for finding an
$\epsilon$-optimal solution, which can be interpreted as global geometric rate
of convergence. We also present empirical results to support our theoretical
analysis.

solutes, of a nanometer size, in a molecular solvent. It combines the molecular
dipole moment of the solute with the polarization of a large subensemble of
solvent molecules at the solute-solvent interface. The goal of the theory is
two-fold: (i) to formulate the problem of the dielectric response avoiding the
reliance on the cavity-field concepts of dielectric theories and (ii) to
separate the non-additive polarization of the interface, jointly produced by
the external field of the laboratory experiment and the solute, from specific
solute-solvent interactions contributing to the dielectric signal. The theory
is applied to experimentally reported frequency-dependent dielectric spectra of
lysozyme in solution. The analysis of the data in the broad range of
frequencies up to 700 GHz shows that the cavity field susceptibility, critical
for the theory formulation, is consistent with the prediction of Maxwell's
electrostatics in the frequency range of 10--200 GHz, but deviates from it
outside this range. In particular, it becomes much smaller then the Maxwell
result and shifts to negative values at small frequencies. The latter
observation implies a dia-electric response, or negative dielectrophoresis, of
hydrated lysozyme. It also implies that the effective protein dipole recorded
by dielectric spectroscopy is much smaller than the value calculated from
protein's charge distribution. We suggest an empirical equation that describes
both the increment of the static dielectric constat and the decrement of the
Debye water peak with increasing protein concentration. It gives fair agreement
with broad-band dispersion and loss spectra of protein solutions, but misses
the delta-dispersion region.

models applications as chemical solutions where molecules representing digital

leveraged. Among them, the atomic capture of molecules participating in concur-
rent reactions is one of the most significant. In this paper, we propose a
protocol for the atomic capture of these molecules distributed and evolving
over a large scale platform. As the density of possible reactions is crucial
for the liveness and efficiency of such a capture, the protocol proposed is
made up of two sub-protocols, each of them aimed at addressing different levels

choose one or the other is local to each node participating in a program's

three protocluster galaxies, including Halpha-emitter (HAE) 229, HAE 131, and
the central Spiderweb Galaxy. Star formation rates of 500-1100 Msun/yr are
estimated from the 7.7 micron PAH feature. At such prodigious formation rates,
the galaxy stellar masses will double in 0.6-1.1 Gyr. We are viewing the peak
epoch of star formation for these protocluster galaxies. However, it appears
that extinction of Halpha is much greater (factor of 40) in the two ULIRG HAEs
compared to the Spiderweb. This may be attributed to different spatial
distributions of star formation--nuclear star formation in the HAEs versus
extended star formation in accreting satellite galaxies in the Spiderweb. We
find extremely luminous mid-IR rotational line emission from warm molecular
hydrogen in the Spiderweb Galaxy, with L(H2 0-0 S(3))= 1.4E44 erg/s (3.7E10
Lsun), 20 times more luminous than any previously known H2 emission galaxy
(MOHEG). Depending on temperature, this corresponds to a very large mass of
>9E6-2E9 Msun of T>300 K molecular gas, heated by the PKS 1138-26 radio jet,
acting to quench nuclear star formation. There is >8 times more warm H2 at
these temperatures in the Spiderweb than what has been seen in low-redshift
(z<0.2) radio galaxies, indicating that the Spiderweb may have a larger
reservoir of molecular gas than more evolved radio galaxies. This is the
highest redshift galaxy yet in which warm molecular hydrogen has been directly
detected.

natural looking and understandable ASL animations. Our methods include
linguistic annotation of initial text and semantic orientation to generate the

fuzzy logic to produce the degree of interpolation between facial expressions.
Roughly, we present a new expressive language Text Adapted Sign Modeling

(12r_c<= R<= 22r_c), in the magnitude range in which the two distributions
overlap (M_I<= 4.0). These results support the conclusion by Dalessandro et al.
that there is no significant mass segregation among cluster stars, hence the
stellar mass-to-light ratio remains constant with distance from the cluster
centre. We fitted the observed Luminosity Function with theoretical
counterparts with the proper age and metallicity from different sets of stellar
evolution models and we consistently derive a total V band mass-to-light ratio
1.2<= M/L_V<= 1.7, by extrapolating to the Hydrogen burning limit, with a
best-fit value M/L_V=1.5 +/- 0.1. On the other hand, assuming that there are no
cluster stars with m<= 0.3 M_sun, we establish a robust lower limit M/L_V> 0.8.
These estimates provide useful constraints for dynamical models of the cluster
that were forced to consider the stellar mass-to-light ratio as a (nearly) free
parameter.

particles represents a paradigmatic example of a relaxation process leading to
the formation of a quasi-stationary state in virial equilibrium. We consider
several N-body simulations of such a system, with the initial velocity
dispersion as a free parameter. We show that there is a clear difference
between structures formed when the initial virial ratio is b_0 =2K_0/W_0 <
b_0^c ~ -1/2 and b_0> b_0^c. These two sets of initial conditions give rise
respectively to a mild and violent relaxation occurring in about the same time
scale: however in the latter case the system contracts by a large factor, while
in the former it approximately maintains its original size. Correspondingly the
resulting quasi equilibrium state is characterized by a density profile
decaying at large enough distances as ~1/r^4 or with a sharp cut-off. The case
b_0<b_0^c can be well described by the Lynden-Bell theory of collisionless
relaxation considering the system confined in a box. On the other hand the
relevant feature for b_0>b_0^c is the ejection of particles and energy, which
is not captured by such a theoretical approach: for this case we introduce a
simple physical model to explain the formation of the power-law density
profile. This model shows that the behavior n(r) ~1/r^4 is the typical density
profile that is obtained when the initial conditions are cold enough that mass
and energy ejection occurs. In addition, we clarify the origin of the critical
value of the initial virial ratio b_0^c.

non-equilibrium electron distribution function, the quasi-stationary
distribution function with steady-in-time source of light, the time of setting
of the quasi-stationary distribution and the time of energy loss via relaxation
to the bottom of conduction band. The actual calculations have been performed
for titanium dioxide in the anatase structure and zinc oxide in the wurtzite
structure. We find that the quasi-stationary electron distribution function for
ZnO is a fermi-like curve that rises linearly with increasing excitation energy
whereas the analogous curve for anatase consists of a main peak and a shoulder.
The calculations demonstrate that the relaxation of excited electrons and the
setting of the quasi-stationary distribution occur within the time no more than
500 fsec for ZnO and 100 fsec for anatase.
  We also discuss the applicability of the effective phonon model with
energy-independent electron-phonon transition probability. We find that the
model only reproduces the trends in changing of the characteristic times
whereas the precision of such calculations is not high. The rate of energy
transfer to phonons at the quasi-stationary electron distribution also have
been evaluated and the effect of this transfer on the photocatalyses has been
discussed. We found that for ZnO this rate is about 5 times less than in

species (e.g. N III, N IV, O IV) originate from a different phase. The measured
N(Ne VIII)/N(O VI) ratio is found to be remarkably similar (within a factor of
~ 2) in several individual absorption components kinematically spread over ~
1800 km/s. Under photoionization this requires a fine tuning between hydrogen
density (nH) and the distance of the absorbing gas from the QSO. Alternatively
this can also be explained by collisional ionization in hot gas with T >
10^{5.7} K. Long-term stability favors the absorbing gas being located outside
the broad line region (BLR). We speculate that the collimated flow of such a
hot gas could possibly be triggered by the radio jet interaction.

into the inner parsec of the Galaxy is widely believed to explain the origin of
over a hundred unusually massive young stars born there $\sim 6$ Myr ago. An
unknown fraction of that gas could have been accreted by Sgr A*, the
supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the Milky Way. It has been recently suggested
that two observed $\gamma$-ray-emitting bubbles emanating from the very center
of our Galaxy were inflated by this putative activity of Sgr A*. We run a suite
of numerical simulations to test whether the observed morphology of the bubbles
could be due to the collimation of a wide angle outflow from Sgr A* by the
disc-like Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), a well known massive repository of
molecular gas in the central $\sim 200$ pc. We find that an Eddington-limited
outburst of Sgr A* lasting $\simeq 1$ Myr is required to reproduce the
morphology of the {\it Fermi} bubbles, suggesting that the GMC mass was $\sim
10^5 \msun$ and it was mainly accreted by Sgr A* rather than used to make
stars. We also find that the outflow from Sgr A* enforces strong angular
momentum mixing in the CMZ disc, robustly sculpting it into a much narrower
structure -- a ring -- perhaps synonymous with the recently reported ""Herschel
ring"". In addition, we find that Sgr A* outflow is likely to have induced
formation of massive star-forming GMCs in the CMZ. In this scenario, the Arches
and Quintuplet clusters, the two observed young star clusters in the central
tens of parsecs of the Galaxy, and also GMCs such as Sgr B2, owe their
existence to the recent Sgr A* activity.

the celebrated description of superconductivity due to Ginzburg and Landau and
believed to describe its essence. This posits a free energy functional for the
superconductor in terms of a complex order parameter characterizing it. We
propose, for superconducting cuprates, a similar functional of the complex, in
plane, nearest neighbor spin singlet bond (or Cooper) pair amplitude psi_ij. A
crucial part of it is a (short range) positive interaction between nearest
neighbor bond pairs, of strength J'. Such an interaction leads to nonzero long
wavelength phase stiffness or superconductive long range order, with the
observed d-wave symmetry, below a temperature T_c\simzJ' where z is the number
of nearest neighbours; it is thus an emergent, collective consequence. Using
the functional, we calculate a large range of properties, e.g. the pseudogap
transition temperature T* as a function of hole doping x, the transition curve
T_c(x), the superfluid stiffness rho_s(x,T), the specific heat (without and
with a magnetic field) due to the fluctuating pair degrees of freedom, and the
zero temperature vortex structure. We find remarkable agreement with
experiment. We also calculate the self energy of electrons hopping on the
square cuprate lattice and coupled to electrons of nearly opposite momenta via
inevitable long wavelength Cooper pair fluctuations formed of these electrons.
The ensuing results for electron spectral density are successfully compared
with recent ARPES experiments, and comprehensively explain strange features
such as temperature dependent Fermi arcs above T_c and the 'bending' of the
superconducting gap below T_c .

a delta-function barrier, we use a quasi-analytic method to show that the
relative norms of the outgoing waves depends sinusoidally on the relative phase
of the incoming waves, and to determine whether one, or both, of the outgoing

quasi-analytic result is valid in the high velocity limit: outside this limit
nonlinear effects introduce a skew to the phase-dependence, which we quantify.
Finally, we numerically explore the effects of introducing a finite-width

describe a range of interferometry experiments using bright solitary

where the halo neutrons experience only weak binding and a weak, or no,
potential barrier. Modern direct reaction measurement techniques provide
powerful probes of the structure of exotic nuclei. Despite more than four
decades of these studies on the benchmark one-neutron halo nucleus Be-11, the
spectroscopic factors for the two bound states remain poorly constrained. In
the present work, the Be-10(d,p) reaction has been used in inverse kinematics
at four beam energies to study the structure of Be-11. The spectroscopic
factors extracted using the adiabatic model, were found to be consistent across
the four measurements, and were largely insensitive to the optical potential
used. The extracted spectroscopic factor for a neutron in a nlj = 2s1/2 state
coupled to the ground state of Be-10 is 0.71(5). For the first excited state at
0.32 MeV, a spectroscopic factor of 0.62(4) is found for the halo neutron in a

studies relies on approaches that consider each SNP individually. However,
there is a strong correlation structure among SNPs that need to be taken into
account. Hence, increasingly modern computationally expensive regression
methods are employed for SNP selection that consider all markers simultaneously
and thus incorporate dependencies among SNPs.
  Results: We develop a novel multivariate algorithm for large scale SNP
selection using CAR score regression, a promising new approach for prioritizing
biomarkers. Specifically, we propose a computationally efficient procedure for
shrinkage estimation of CAR scores from high-dimensional data. Subsequently, we
conduct a comprehensive comparison study including five advanced regression
approaches (boosting, lasso, NEG, MCP, and CAR score) and a univariate approach
(marginal correlation) to determine the effectiveness in finding true causal
SNPs.
  Conclusions: Simultaneous SNP selection is a challenging task. We demonstrate
that our CAR score-based algorithm consistently outperforms all competing
approaches, both uni- and multivariate, in terms of correctly recovered causal
SNPs and SNP ranking. An R package implementing the approach as well as R code
to reproduce the complete study presented here is available from

presented for lead-lead collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV with the ATLAS
detector at the LHC, based on an integrated luminosity of approximately 8
mb^-1. This anisotropy is characterized via a Fourier expansion of the
distribution of charged particles in azimuthal angle (phi), with the
coefficients v_n denoting the magnitude of the anisotropy. Significant v_2-v_6
values are obtained as a function of transverse momentum (0.5<pT<20 GeV),
pseudorapidity (|eta|<2.5) and centrality using an event plane method. The v_n
values for n>=3 are found to vary weakly with both eta and centrality, and
their pT dependencies are found to follow an approximate scaling relation,
v_n^{1/n}(pT) \propto v_2^{1/2}(pT). A Fourier analysis of the charged particle
pair distribution in relative azimuthal angle (Dphi=phi_a-phi_b) is performed
to extract the coefficients v_{n,n}=<cos (n Dphi)>. For pairs of charged
particles with a large pseudorapidity gap (|Deta=eta_a-eta_b|>2) and one
particle with pT<3 GeV, the v_{2,2}-v_{6,6} values are found to factorize as
v_{n,n}(pT^a,pT^b) ~ v_n(pT^a)v_n(pT^b) in central and mid-central events. Such
factorization suggests that these values of v_{2,2}-v_{6,6} are primarily due
to the response of the created matter to the fluctuations in the geometry of
the initial state. A detailed study shows that the v_{1,1}(pT^a,pT^b) data are
consistent with the combined contributions from a rapidity-even v_1 and global
momentum conservation. A two-component fit is used to extract the v_1
contribution. The extracted v_1 is observed to cross zero at pT\sim1.0 GeV,
reaches a maximum at 4-5 GeV with a value comparable to that for v_3, and
decreases at higher pT.

theoretical physics during the 1930s-1950s, and the subsequent reinvigoration

relativists of the time did not develop heuristic concepts about the physics of
the theory with which they could communicate with other physicists, and that
the revival happened when they began to develop such concepts. A powerful
heuristic today is the concept of a black hole, which is a robust and stable
component of many astronomical systems. During the 1930s relativists could only
offer the ""Schwarzschild singularity"". I argue that the change occurred at
least partly because key theoretical physicists schooled in quantum theory
entered relativity research and began to approach problematic issues by asking
questions about observable effects and the outcomes of thought experiments. The
result was the development of a physical intuition about such things as black
holes, which could then be communicated to non-specialists. Only then was it
possible to integrate general relativity fully into the rest of physics.

by means of azimuthal distributions of charged particles relative to the

single-molecule junctions based on C60 and C60-terminated molecules. We first
analyze the transport properties of gold-C60-gold junctions and show that these
junctions can be highly conductive (with conductances above 0.1G0, where G0 is
the quantum of conductance). Moreover, we find that the thermopower in these
junctions is negative due to the fact that the LUMO dominates the charge
transport, and its magnitude can reach several tens of micro-V/K, depending on
the contact geometry. On the other hand, we study the suitability of C60 as an
anchoring group in single-molecule junctions. For this purpose, we analyze the
transport through several dumbbell derivatives using C60 as anchors, and we
compare the results with those obtained with thiol and amine groups. Our
results show that the conductance of C60-terminated molecules is rather
sensitive to the binding geometry. Moreover, the conductance of the molecules
is typically reduced by the presence of the C60 anchors, which in turn makes
the junctions more sensitive to the functionalization of the molecular core
with appropriate side groups.

CP}(\pi^+\pi^-)=-1.00\times 10^{-3}$, lower than the LHCb and CDF data.

applied for the study of polymer dynamics on the nanometer scale. The core idea
is to extract, from a measured autocorrelation curve, an effective mean-square
displacement function that contains information about the underlying
conformational dynamics. The paper presents a fundamental study of the
applicability of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy for the investigation of
nanoscale conformational and diffusional dynamics. We find that fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy cannot reliably elucidate processes on length scales
much smaller than the resolution limit of the optics used and that its improper
use can yield spurious results for the observed dynamics.

  approach","First appeared in FOCS'11",,,,"math.CO cs.CC cs.DM cs.GT math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A central theme in social choice theory is that of impossibility theorems,
such as Arrow's theorem and the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, which state that
under certain natural constraints, social choice mechanisms are impossible to
construct. In recent years, beginning in Kalai`01, much work has been done in
finding \textit{robust} versions of these theorems, showing ""approximate""
impossibility remains even when most, but not all, of the constraints are
satisfied. We study a spectrum of settings between the case where society
chooses a single outcome (\'a-la-Gibbard-Satterthwaite) and the choice of a
complete order (as in Arrow's theorem). We use algebraic techniques,
specifically representation theory of the symmetric group, and also prove
robust versions of the theorems that we state. Our relaxations of the
constraints involve relaxing of a version of ""independence of irrelevant
alternatives"", rather than relaxing the demand of a transitive outcome, as is
done in most other robustness results.

  Graphical Statistics (http://www.amstat.org/publications/jcgs.cfm)",,,,"stat.CO cond-mat.stat-mech cs.AI cs.SI physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Undirected graphical models are widely used in statistics, physics and
machine vision. However Bayesian parameter estimation for undirected models is
extremely challenging, since evaluation of the posterior typically involves the
calculation of an intractable normalising constant. This problem has received
much attention, but very little of this has focussed on the important practical
case where the data consists of noisy or incomplete observations of the
underlying hidden structure. This paper specifically addresses this problem,
comparing two alternative methodologies. In the first of these approaches
particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (Andrieu et al., 2010) is used to efficiently
explore the parameter space, combined with the exchange algorithm (Murray et
al., 2006) for avoiding the calculation of the intractable normalising constant
(a proof showing that this combination targets the correct distribution in
found in a supplementary appendix online). This approach is compared with
approximate Bayesian computation (Pritchard et al., 1999). Applications to
estimating the parameters of Ising models and exponential random graphs from
noisy data are presented. Each algorithm used in the paper targets an
approximation to the true posterior due to the use of MCMC to simulate from the
latent graphical model, in lieu of being able to do this exactly in general.
The supplementary appendix also describes the nature of the resulting
approximation.

different conditions and also SPS process were used for consolidation of the
powder into a bulk nanostructure and nanocomposites. The main factors allowing
slowing-down of the growth of nanograins as a result of recrystallization are
the reduction of the temperature and of the duration of the pressing, the
increase of the pressure, as well as addition of small value additives (like
MoS2, thermally expanded graphite or fullerenes). It was reached the
thermoelectric figure of merit ZT=1.22 (at 360 K) in the bulk nanostructure
Bi0,4Sb1,6Te3 fabricated by SPS method. Some mechanisms of the improvement of
the thermoelectric efficiency in bulk nanocrystalline semiconductors based on
BixSb2-xTe3 are studied theoretically. The reduction of nanograin size can lead
to improvement of the thermoelectric figure of merit. The theoretical
dependence of the electric and heat conductivities and the thermoelectric power
as the function of nanograins size in BixSb2-xTe3 bulk nanostructure are quite
accurately correlates with the experimental data.

which two different colors of light(red/green) are used to make a rapidly

colors within a single strobe period. Such a stroboscope has its own advantages
in experiments over the conventional one. This article describes the
construction of this stroboscope in all detail. Various aspects of its
performance are discussed pictorially with reference to a simple rotating disc.
This stroboscope can be used in the study/quantitative-assessment of rapidly
moving objects which by default are taken to be cyclic in nature.

which consists of packing a set of circles of known radii into a strip of fixed
width and unlimited length without overlapping. The objective is to minimize
the length of the strip. An iterated tabu search approach, named ITS, is
proposed. ITS starts from a randomly generated solution and attempts to gain
improvements by a tabu search procedure. After that, if the obtained solution
is not feasible, a perturbation operator is subsequently employed to
reconstruct the incumbent solution and an acceptance criterion is implemented
to determine whether or not accept the perturbed solution. This process is
repeated until a feasible solution has been found or the allowed computation
time has been elapsed. Computational experiments based on well-known benchmark
instances show that ITS produces quite competitive results with respect to the
best known results. For 18 representative CODP instances taken from the
literature, ITS succeeds in improving 13 best known results within reasonable
time. In addition, for another challenging related variant: the problem of
packing arbitrary sized circles into a circular container, ITS also succeeds in
improving many best known results. Supplementary experiments are also provided
to analyze the influence of the perturbation operator, as well as the
acceptance criterion.
