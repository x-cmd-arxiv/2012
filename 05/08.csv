\Gamma_s/ \Gamma_s = 17.6 % \pm 2.9 %$ by the LHCb collaboration and very
precise data for $\tau_{B_s}$ from TeVatron and LHCb our theoretical tools can
now be rigorously tested and it turns out that the Heavy Quark Expansion works
in the $B$-system to an accuracy of at least 30% for quantities like
$\Gamma_{12}$, which is most sensitive to hypothetical violations of quark
hadron duality. This issue that gave rise in the past to numerous theoretical
papers, has now been settled experimentally. Further data will even allow to
shrink this bound. For total inclusive quantities like lifetimes the compliance
is even more astonishing: $\tau_{B_s}^{\rm LHCb}/ \tau_{B_d}^{\rm HFAG} = 1.001

$\tau_{B_s}/\tau_{B_d} = 0.996 ... 1.000$. Despite the fact that the new data
show no deviations from the standard model expectations, there is still some
sizable room for new physics effects. Model-independent search strategies for
these effects are presented with an emphasis on the interconnection with many
different observables that have to be taken into account. In that respect a
special emphasis is given to the large value of the di-muon asymmetry measured

wide-field observations in the H2 1-0 S(1) line at 2.122{\mu}m alleviates the

driving sources. Aims. As part of a large-scale multi-waveband study of ongoing
star formation in the Braid Nebula Star Formation region, we focus on a one
square degree region that includes Lynds Dark Nebula 1003 and 1004. Our goal is
to find all of the near-infrared outflows, uncover their driving sources and
estimate their evolutionary phase. Methods. We use near-infrared wide-field
observations obtained with WFCAM on UKIRT, in conjunction with
previously-published optical and archival MM data, to search for outflows and
identify their driving sources; we subsequently use colour-colour analysis to
determine the evolutionary phase of each source. Results. Within a one square
degree field we have identified 37 complex MHOs, most of which are new. After
combining our findings with other wide-field, multi-waveband observations of
the same region we were able to discern 28 outflows and at least 18 protostars.
Our analysis suggests that these protostars are younger and/or more energetic
than those of the Taurus-Auriga region. The outflow data enable us to suggest
connection between outflow ejection and repetitive FU Ori outburst events. We
also find that star formation progresses from W to E across the investigated
region.

parallax allow for a precise subtraction of the kinematic contribution to the
observed orbital decay; this results in a significant measurement of the
intrinsic orbital decay: (-25.9 +/- 3.2) \times 10^{-15} s/s. This is
consistent with the orbital decay from the emission of gravitational waves
predicted by general relativity, (-27.7 +1.5/-1.9) \times 10^{-15} s/s (...).
This agreement introduces a tight upper limit on dipolar gravitational wave
emission, a prediction of most alternative theories of gravity for asymmetric
binary systems such as this. We use this limit to derive the most stringent
constraints ever on a wide class of gravity theories, where gravity involves a
scalar field contribution. When considering general scalar-tensor theories of
gravity, our new bounds are more stringent than the best current solar-system
limits over most of the parameter space, and constrain the matter-scalar
coupling constant {\alpha}_0^2 to be below the 10^{-5} level. For the special
case of the Jordan-Fierz-Brans-Dicke, we obtain the one-sigma bound
{\alpha}_0^2 < 2 \times 10^{-5}, which is within a factor two of the Cassini
limit. We also use our limit on dipolar gravitational wave emission to
constrain a wide class of theories of gravity which are based on a
generalization of Bekenstein's Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity (TeVeS), a

as well as those of E_8, have been used extensively in the literature. The
present paper analyses such Coxeter groups in the Clifford Geometric Algebra
framework, which affords a simple way of performing reflections and rotations
whilst exposing more clearly the underlying geometry. The Clifford approach
shows that the quaternionic representations in fact have very simple geometric
interpretations. The representations of the groups A_1 x A_1 x A_1, A_3, B_3
and H_3 of rank 3 in terms of pure quaternions are shown to be simply the Hodge
dualised root vectors, which determine the reflection planes of the Coxeter
groups. Two successive reflections result in a rotation, described by the
geometric product of the two reflection vectors, giving a Clifford spinor. The
spinors for the rank-3 groups A_1 x A_1 x A_1, A_3, B_3 and H_3 yield a new
simple construction of binary polyhedral groups. These in turn generate the
groups A_1 x A_1 x A_1 x A_1, D_4, F_4 and H_4 of rank 4, and their widely used
quaternionic representations are shown to be spinors in disguise. Therefore,
the Clifford geometric product in fact induces the rank-4 groups from the
rank-3 groups. In particular, the groups D_4, F_4 and H_4 are exceptional
structures, which our study sheds new light on.

sources at 5 GHz, but the cores are essentially unpolarized, except in M87.
Polarization is detected at the jet edges in several sources, and the inferred
magnetic field is primarily aligned with the jet direction. This could be
indicative of magnetic field ""shearing"" due to jet-medium interaction, or the
presence of helical magnetic fields. The jet peak intensity $I_\nu$ falls with
distance $d$ from the core, following the relation, $I_\nu\propto d^a$, where
$a$ is typically -1.5. Assuming that adiabatic expansion losses are primarily
responsible for the jet intensity ""dimming"", two limiting cases are considered:
[1] the jet has a constant speed on parsec-scales and is expanding gradually
such that the jet radius $r\propto d^0.4$; this expansion is however
unobservable in the laterally unresolved jets at 5 GHz, and [2] the jet is
cylindrical and is accelerating on parsec-scales. Accelerating parsec-scale
jets are consistent with the phenomenon of ""magnetic driving"" in Poynting flux
dominated jets. Chandra observations of 15 UGC FRIs detect X-ray jets in nine
of them. The high frequency of occurrence of X-ray jets in this complete sample

been a very popular and active area of research. A reasonable model should not
only replicate all the structural properties that are observed in real world
networks (for example, heavy tailed degree distributions, high clustering and
small diameter), but it should also be amenable to mathematical analysis. There
are plenty of models that succeed in the first task but are hard to analyze
rigorously. On the other hand, a multitude of proposed models, like classical
random graphs, can be studied mathematically, but fail in creating certain
aspects that are observed in real-world networks.
  Recently, Papadopoulos, Krioukov, Boguna and Vahdat [INFOCOM'10] introduced a
random geometric graph model that is based on hyperbolic geometry. The authors
argued empirically and by some preliminary mathematical analysis that the
resulting graphs have many of the desired properties. Moreover, by computing
explicitly a maximum likelihood fit of the Internet graph, they demonstrated
impressively that this model is adequate for reproducing the structure of real
graphs with high accuracy.
  In this work we initiate the rigorous study of random hyperbolic graphs. We
compute exact asymptotic expressions for the expected number of vertices of
degree k for all k up to the maximum degree and provide small probabilities for
large deviations. We also prove a constant lower bound for the clustering
coefficient. In particular, our findings confirm rigorously that the degree
sequence follows a power-law distribution with controllable exponent and that
the clustering is nonvanishing.

under a matroid constraint: We are given a set of elements over which a matroid
is defined. The goal is to incrementally choose a subset that remains
independent in the matroid over time. At each time, a new weighted rank
function of a different matroid (one per time) over the same elements is
presented; the algorithm can add a few elements to the incrementally
constructed set, and reaps a reward equal to the value of the new weighted rank
function on the current set. The goal of the algorithm as it builds this
independent set online is to maximize the sum of these (weighted rank) rewards.
As in regular online analysis, we compare the rewards of our online algorithm
to that of an offline optimum, namely a single independent set of the matroid
that maximizes the sum of the weighted rank rewards that arrive over time. This
problem is a natural extension of two well-studied streams of earlier work: the
first is on online set cover algorithms (in particular for the max coverage
version) while the second is on approximately maximizing submodular functions
under a matroid constraint.
  In this paper, we present the first randomized online algorithms for this
problem with poly-logarithmic competitive ratio. To do this, we employ the LP
formulation of a scaled reward version of the problem. Then we extend a
weighted-majority type update rule along with uncrossing properties of tight
sets in the matroid polytope to find an approximately optimal fractional LP
solution. We use the fractional solution values as probabilities for a online
randomized rounding algorithm. To show that our rounding produces a
sufficiently large reward independent set, we prove and use new covering
properties for randomly rounded fractional solutions in the matroid polytope

times that of non-variable stars, with a significant correlation between the
amount of underlying stellar variability and peak flare amplitude. The flare
energy loss rates are generally higher than those of nearby well-studied single

function of distance along the mat direction. The latter, defined by a periodic
length and a shear-stress amplitude, represents a pre-existing micro-structure.
These model parameters, along with the mobile dislocation density, are found to
admit a diversity of micro-plastic behaviour involving intermittent plasticity
in the form of a scale-free avalanche phenomenon, with an exponent for the
strain burst magnitude distribution similar to those seen in experiment and
more complex dislocation dynamics simulations.

in the IGM. We find that the emission from individual galaxies dominates over
the IGM with a total Lyman-alpha intensity (times frequency) of about
(1.43-3.57)x10^{-8} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1} at a redshift of 7. This
intensity level is low so it is unlikely that the Lyman-\alpha background
during reionization can be established by an experiment aiming at an absolute
background light measurement. Instead we consider Lyman-\alpha intensity
mapping with the aim of measuring the anisotropy power spectrum which has rms
fluctuations at the level of 1 x 10^{-16} [erg s^[-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1}]^2 at a
few Mpc scales. These anisotropies could be measured with a spectrometer at
near-IR wavelengths from 0.9 to 1.4 \mu m with fields in the order of 0.5 to 1
sq. degrees. We recommend that existing ground-based programs using narrow band

distribution of faint Lyman-\alpha emitters. We also discuss the
cross-correlation signal with 21 cm experiments that probe HI in the IGM during

stellar evolution: UV and blue wavelength band SBFs are sensitive to the
evolution of stars within the hot Horizontal Branch (HB) and post-Asymptotic
Giant Branch (post-AGB) phase, whereas optical SBF magnitudes explore the stars
within the Red Giant Branch (RGB) and HB regime. Near- and Far-infrared SBF

often difficult to achieve. The situation changes if interactions take place in
a network where the network structure jointly evolves with the behavioral
strategies of the interacting individuals. In particular, cooperation can be
stabilized if individuals tend to cut interaction links when facing adverse
neighborhoods. Here we consider two different types of reaction to adverse
neighborhoods, and all possible mixtures between these reactions. When faced
with a gloomy outlook, players can either choose to cut and rewire some of
their links to other individuals, or they can migrate to another location and
establish new links in the new local neighborhood. We find that in general
local rewiring is more favorable for the evolution of cooperation than
emigration from adverse neighborhoods. Rewiring helps to maintain the diversity
in the degree distribution of players and favors the spontaneous emergence of
cooperative clusters. Both properties are known to favor the evolution of
cooperation on networks. Interestingly, a mixture of migration and rewiring is
even more favorable for the evolution of cooperation than rewiring on its own.
While most models only consider a single type of reaction to adverse
neighborhoods, the coexistence of several such reactions may actually be an
optimal setting for the evolution of cooperation.

cosmological quantities like density, pressure, Hubble constant and expansion
parameter vary rapidly with time. (iii) After the characteristic time these
quantities settles down and the models are turned into de-sitter type model
with uniform matter, radiation, creation densities and Hubble's constant H. The
de-sitter regime survives during a decay time then connects continuously to a
usual adiabatic matter radiation RW universe.The interesting thing in the paper
is that we have related the phenomenological radiation dominated model to

rise to the present observed value of cosmic background radiation . It is also
found that the dust filled model tallies exactly with that of the Prigogine's

the power, thrust and lifetime of the jet, we use the mass accretion history
onto the black hole as calculated by detailed hydrodynamic simulations of the
tidal disruption of stars. We go on to determine the states of the interstellar
medium in various types of quiescent galactic nuclei, and describe how this
external matter can affect jets propagating through it. We use this
information, together with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the
structure of the relativistic flow, to study the dynamics of the jet, the
propagation of which is regulated by the density stratification of the
environment and by its injection history. The breaking of symmetry involved in
transitioning from one to two dimensions is crucial and leads to qualitatively
new phenomena. Many of the observed properties of the Swift 1644+57/GRB 110328A
event can be understood as resulting from accretion onto and jets driven by a
$10^6 M_\odot$ central mass black hole following the disruption of sun-like
star. With the inclusion of a stochastic contribution to the luminosity due to
variations in the feeding rate driven by instabilities near the tidal radius,
we find that our model can explain the X-ray light curve without invoking a
rarely-occurring deep encounter. In conjunction with the number density of
black holes in the local universe, we hypothesize that the conditions required
to produce the Swift event are not anomalous, but are in fact representative of
the jet-driven flare population arising from tidal disruptions.

lower and up to twice as high as those observed in the Galactic field. We
follow the evolution of a population of binary stars in dense and loose star

multiplicity fraction of unity, and demonstrate that these models can explain
the observed binary properties in Taurus, Rho-Ophiuchus, Chamaeleon, Orion, IC
348, Upper Scorpius A, Praesepe, and the Pleiades. The model needs to consider
solely different birth densities for these regions. The evolved theoretical
orbital-parameter distributions are highly probable parent distributions for
the observed ones. We constrain the birth conditions (stellar mass, M_ecl, and
half-mass radius, r_h) for the derived progenitors of the star clusters and the
overall present-day binary fractions allowed by the present model. The results
compare very well with properties of molecular cloud clumps on the verge of
star formation. Combining these with previously and independently obtained
constraints on the birth densities of globular clusters, we identify a weak
stellar mass -- half-mass radius correlation for cluster-forming cloud clumps,
r_h / pc ~ (M_ecl / M_sun)^(0.13+-0.04). The ability of the model to reproduce
the binary properties in all the investigated young objects, covering
present-day densities from 1-10 stars pc^-3 (Taurus) to 2x10^4 stars pc^-3
(Orion), suggests that environment-dependent dynamical evolution plays an
important role in shaping the present-day properties of binary populations in
star clusters, and that the initial binary properties may not vary dramatically
between different environments.

J0942.7-7726AB joins a growing group of wide binaries kinematically linked to
Sco-Cen, suggesting that such fragile systems can survive the turbulent
environment of their natal molecular clouds while still being dispersed with
large velocities. Conversely, the small radial velocity difference between the
stars (2.7 \pm 1.0 km/s) could mean the system is unbound, a result of the
coincidental ejection of two single stars with similar velocity vectors from
the OB association early in its evolution.

relationship between 12CO FWHM and 12CO line luminosity in high-redshift
starbursts, which we interpret as a natural consequence of the baryon-dominated
dynamics within the regions probed by our observations. We use far-infrared
luminosities to assess the star-formation efficiency in our SMGs, finding a
steepening of the L'CO-LFIR relation as a function of increasing 12CO J_up
transition. We derive dynamical masses and molecular gas masses, and use these
to determine the redshift evolution of the gas content of SMGs, finding that
they do not appear to be significantly more gas rich than less vigorously
star-forming galaxies at high redshifts. Finally, we collate X-ray
observations, and study the interdependence of gas and dynamical properties of
SMGs with their AGN activity and supermassive black hole masses (MBH), finding
that SMGs lie significantly below the local M_BH-sigma relation. We conclude
that SMGs represent a class of massive, gas-rich ultraluminous galaxies with
somewhat heterogeneous properties, ranging from starbursting disc-like systems
with L~10^12 L_sun, to the most highly star-forming mergers in the Universe.

with the same flux limits (I=24) as the VVDS (CMOCKS), built using the semi-

mocks roughly agrees with the observed LF, but at z<0.8 the faint-end slope of
the model LF is steeper than the VVDS one. Computing the LF for early and late

bright late-type galaxies with respect to data. We find that the CDR in OMOCKS

agrees with the VVDS one (red galaxies reside mainly in high densities). Yet,
the strength of the CDR in mocks does not vary within 0.2<z<1.5, while the
observed relation flattens with increasing z and possibly inverts at z=1.3. We
argue that the lack of evolution in the CDR in mocks is not due only to
inaccurate prescriptions for satellite galaxies, but that also the treatment of
central galaxies has to be revised. The reversal of the CDR can be explained by
wet mergers between young galaxies, producing a starburst event. This should be
seen on group scales. A residual of this is found in observations at z=1.5 on
larger scales, but not in the mocks, suggesting that the treatment of physical
processes affecting satellites and central galaxies in models should be
revised.

perturbation is sourced by light scalar fields other than the inflaton. The
corresponding perturbations are both scale invariant and special conformally
invariant. We exploit the operator product expansion technique of conformal
field theories to study the inflationary correlators enjoying the symmetries
present during the de Sitter epoch. The operator product expansion is
particularly powerful in characterizing inflationary correlation functions in
two observationally interesting limits, the squeezed limit of the three-point
correlator and the collapsed limit of the four-point correlator. Despite the
fact that the shape of the four-point correlators is not fixed by the
symmetries of de Sitter, its exact shape can be found in the collapsed limit
making use of the operator product expansion. By employing the fact that
conformal invariance imposes the two-point cross-correlations of the light
fields to vanish unless the fields have the same conformal weights, we are able
to show that the Suyama-Yamaguchi inequality relating the coefficients $f_{\rm
NL}$ of the bispectrum in the squeezed limit and $\tau_{\rm NL}$ of the
trispectrum in the collapsed limit also holds when the light fields are
intrinsically non-Gaussian. In fact, we show that the inequality is valid
irrespectively of the conformal symmetry, being just a consequence of
fundamental physical principles, such as the short-distance expansion of
operator products. The observation of a strong violation of the inequality will
then have profound implications for inflationary models as it will imply either
that multifield inflation cannot be responsible for generating the observed
fluctuations independently of the details of the model or that some new
non-trivial degrees of freedom play a role during inflation.

encompasses the inner binary, with emission detected at locations that should
be dynamically cleared on several hundred-year timescales. Extensions of H2 gas
emission are seen to ~100 AU distances from the central stars. The v = 2-1 S(1)
emission at 2.24 microns is also detected at ~30 AU from the central stars,
with a line ratio of 0.05 +/- 0.01 with respect to the v = 1-0 S(1) emission.
Assuming gas in LTE, this ratio corresponds to an emission environment at ~1700
K. We estimate that this temperature is too high for quiescent gas heated by
X-ray or UV emission from the central stars. Surprisingly, we find that the
brightest region of H2 emission arises from a spatial location that is exactly
coincident with a recently revealed dust ""streamer"" which seems to be
transferring material from the outer circumbinary ring around GG Tau A into the
inner region. As a result, we identify a new excitation mechanism for
ro-vibrational H2 stimulation in the environment of young stars. The H2 in the
GG Tau A system appears to be stimulated by mass accretion infall as material
in the circumbinary ring accretes onto the system to replenish the inner
circumstellar disks. We postulate that H2 stimulated by accretion infall could
be present in other systems, particularly binaries and ""transition disk""
systems which have dust cleared gaps in their circumstellar environments.

position-dependent forces that determine and stabilize the location of a single
brane. For illustrative purposes, we consider the 2-dimensional hyperbolic horn
and the Euclidean cone as toy models of the extra-dimensional manifold, and add
a brane wrapped around one of the two spatial dimensions. We calculate the
total energy due to brane tension and bending (extrinsic curvature) as well as
that due to the Casimir energy of a bulk scalar satisfying a Dirchlet boundary
condition on the brane. From the competition of at least two of these effects
there can exist a stable minimum of the effective potential for the brane
location. However, on more generic spaces (on which more symmetries are broken)
any one of these effects may be sufficient to stabilize the brane. We discuss
this as an example of physics that is neither local nor global, but regional.

forward-backward asymmetry in which the top quark tends to follow the proton

effect grows with increasing effective mass $m_{t \bar t}$ of the top-antitop

observed effect is about three times as large as predicted by
next-to-leading-order QCD, but with the same sign. An estimate of
non-factorizable effects based on a QCD string picture finds they are
negligible, but that small distortions of the $m_t$ spectrum are possible.

balances obtained from the fundamental MHD equations. The linchpin of the
approach is the concept of gyroscopic pumping whereby the meridional
circulation across isosurfaces of specific angular momentum is linked to the
angular momentum transport by the convective Reynolds stress. We find that the
amplitude of the convective velocity must be at least 30 m s$^{-1}$ in the
upper CZ ($r \sim 0.95 R$) and at least 8 m s$^{-1}$ in the lower CZ ($r \sim
0.75 R$) in order to be consistent with the observed mean flows. Using the base
of the near-surface shear layer as a probe of the rotational influence, we are
further able to show that the characteristic length scale of deep convective
motions must be no smaller than 5.5--30 Mm. These results are compatible with
convection models but suggest that the efficiency of the turbulent transport
assumed in advection-dominated flux-transport dynamo models is generally not
consistent with the mean flows they employ.

their default fund and initial margin contributions. Such losses can be
incurred whenever the CCP has insufficient funds to unwind the portfolio of a
defaulting clearing member. This does not necessarily require the default of
the CCP itself. In this note we aim to quantify the risk a financial
institution has when facing a CCP.
  We show that a clearing member's CCP risk is given by a sum of exposures to
each of the other clearing members. This arises because of the implicit default
insurance that each member has provided in the form of mutualised, loss sharing
collateral. We calculate the exposures by explicitly modeling the capital
structure of a CCP as well as the loss distributions of the individual member
portfolios.
  An important consideration in designing the model is the limited transparency
with respect to the portfolio composition and collateral levels of individual
clearing members. To overcome this we leverage the fact that, for a typical
CCP, margin levels are risk-based. In particular, we parameterise the portfolio
loss tail as a Pareto distribution and we calibrate this to the CCP defined
probability of losses exceeding the posted initial margin levels.
  A key aspect of the model is that we explicitly take into account wrong-way
risk, i.e. the fact that member defaults are more likely to occur in stressed
market conditions, as well as potential contagion between a member's default
and the losses on his portfolio.

Depending on the actual values of T_g, \alpha, \sigma_eff, and z_gf, model
galaxies may have M_g^min that are either greater or smaller than M_b. Galaxies
with M_DM \ga 10^9 M_sun are usually characterized by M_g^min \la M_b, implying
that SF in such objects is a natural outcome as the required gas mass is
consistent with what is available according to the \LambdaCDM theory. On the

potential in diverse number of dimensions is systematically investigated using
the gauge/gravity duality. We consider a model with a thin-shell of charged
dust collapsing from the boundary toward the bulk interior of asymptotically
anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. In the outer region there is a
Reissner-Nordstr\""om-AdS black hole (RNAdS-BH), while in the inner region there
is an anti-de Sitter space. We consider renormalized geodesic lengths and
minimal area surfaces as probes of thermalization, which in the dual quantum
field theory (QFT) correspond to two-point functions and expectation values of
Wilson loops, respectively. We show how the behavior of these extensive probes
changes for charged black holes in comparison with Schwarzschild-AdS black
holes (AdS-BH), for different values of the black hole mass and charge. The
full range of values of the chemical potential over temperature ratio in the
dual QFT is investigated. In all cases, the structure of the thermalization
curves shares similar features with those obtained from the AdS-BH. On the
other hand, there is an important difference in comparison with the AdS-BH: the
thermalization times obtained from the renormalized geodesic lengths and the
minimal area surfaces are larger for the RNAdS-BH, and they increase as the
black hole charge increases.

  Coding","An old version of this paper is submitted to IEEE Globecom 2012
  conference",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diversity coding is a network restoration technique which offers near-hitless
restoration, while other state-of-the art techniques are significantly slower.
Furthermore, the extra spare capacity requirement of diversity coding is
competitive with the others. Previously, we developed heuristic algorithms to
employ diversity coding structures in networks with arbitrary topology. This
paper presents two algorithms to solve the network design problems using
diversity coding in an optimal manner. The first technique pre-provisions
static traffic whereas the second technique carries out the dynamic
provisioning of the traffic on-demand. In both cases, diversity coding results
in smaller restoration time, simpler synchronization, and much reduced
signaling complexity than the existing techniques in the literature. A Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) formulation and an algorithm based on Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) are developed for pre-provisioning and dynamic provisioning,
respectively. Simulation results indicate that diversity coding has
significantly higher restoration speed than Shared Path Protection (SPP) and
p-cycle techniques. It requires more extra capacity than the p-cycle technique
and SPP. However, the increase in the total capacity is negligible compared to
the increase in the restoration speed.

common than minor mergers (mass ratios < 0.3). The peculiar spiral NGC 2782 is
the result of a merger between two disk galaxies with a mass ratio of ~4:1
occurring ~200 Myr ago. This merger produced a molecular and H I-rich,
optically bright eastern tail and an H I-rich, optically faint western tail.
Non-detection of CO in the western tail by Braine et al. suggested that star
formation had not yet begun to occur in that tidal tail. However, deep
H{\alpha} narrowband images show evidence of recent star formation in the
western tail. Across the entire western tail, we find the global star formation
rate per unit area ({\Sigma}SFR) to be several orders of magnitude less than
expected from the total gas density. Together with extended FUV+NUV emission
from Galaxy Evolution Explorer along the tail, this indicates a low global star
formation efficiency in the tidal tail producing lower mass star clusters. The
H II region that we observed has a local (few-kiloparsec scale) {\Sigma}SFR
from H{\alpha} that is less than that expected from the total gas density,
which is consistent with other observations of tidal debris. The star formation
efficiency of this H II region inferred from the total gas density is low, but
normal when inferred from the molecular gas density. These results suggest the
presence of a very small, locally dense region in the western tail of NGC 2782

distributions. Notably, the entropy profiles follow a power-law form, with an
index 0.92-1.07. The cumulative hot X-ray emitting gas mass profiles and the
gas-mass to stellar-light ratios of all five galaxies are also similar. Overall
the observed similarity of the thermodynamic profiles in this radial range
argues that, in these systems, relativistic jets heat the gas at a similar rate
averaged over time scales longer than the cooling time of 10^8 yr. These jets
are powered by accretion from the hot gas, or material entrained within it,
onto the central super-massive black hole. This jet heating creates an energy
balance where heating and cooling are in equilibrium, keeping the hot galactic
atmospheres in a `steady-state'. Within r < 1 kpc, this similarity breaks down:
the observed entropy profiles show well resolved flattening and the values
differ from system to system substantially. The accretion rate onto the black
hole and the AGN activity, heating the interstellar medium, must therefore vary
significantly on time scales shorter than the cooling time of 10^7 - 10^8 yr.

emission, broad-band and high-quality GRXE spectra were produced from 18
pointing observations with Suzaku in the Galactic bulge region, with the total
exposure of 1 Ms. The spectra were successfully fitted by a sum of two major
spectral components; a spectral model of magnetic accreting white dwarfs with a
mass of 0.66 (0.59-0.75) solar, and a softer optically-thin thermal emission
with a plasma temperature of 1.2-1.5 keV which is attributable to coronal X-ray
sources.
  When combined with previous studies which employed high spatial resolution of
the Chandra satellite (e.g. Revnivtsev et al. 2009, Nature), the present
spectroscopic result gives another strong support to a scenario that the GRXE
is essentially an assembly of numerous discrete faint X-ray stars.
  The detected GRXE flux in the hard X-ray band was used to estimate the number
density of the unresolved hard X-ray sources. When integrated over a luminosity
range of ~10^30-10^34 erg/s, the result is consistent with a value which was
reported previously by directly resolving faint point sources.

spatial extent of molecular emission greatly affects the determination of

the metallic phase but also in the insulating phases of fermions such as in the
empty/filled band limit. A systematic analysis of the relation between the
quasiparticle weight and the strength of superfluidity reveals that the
renormalization effect is indeed caused by the boson degrees of freedom. It is
found that such renormalization is also relevant to a supersolid phase

  Comput. Math",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Demixing refers to the challenge of identifying two structured signals given
only the sum of the two signals and prior information about their structures.
Examples include the problem of separating a signal that is sparse with respect
to one basis from a signal that is sparse with respect to a second basis, and
the problem of decomposing an observed matrix into a low-rank matrix plus a
sparse matrix. This paper describes and analyzes a framework, based on convex
optimization, for solving these demixing problems, and many others. This work
introduces a randomized signal model which ensures that the two structures are
incoherent, i.e., generically oriented. For an observation from this model,
this approach identifies a summary statistic that reflects the complexity of a
particular signal. The difficulty of separating two structured, incoherent
signals depends only on the total complexity of the two structures. Some
applications include (i) demixing two signals that are sparse in mutually
incoherent bases; (ii) decoding spread-spectrum transmissions in the presence
of impulsive errors; and (iii) removing sparse corruptions from a low-rank
matrix. In each case, the theoretical analysis of the convex demixing method
closely matches its empirical behavior.

the overdensity estimator, the merger rate Fmg is found about twenty times
larger in the densest regions than in under-dense ones in two of the four
models while it is roughly four times higher in the other two. In other words,
the discrepancies of the merger rate difference between two extremes can differ
by a factor of ~ five depending on the SAMs adopted. On the other hand for the
halo mass estimator, Fmg does not monotonically increase with the host halo
mass Mh, but peaks in the $M_h$ range between 10^12 and 10^13 h-1 M{\Theta},
which corresponds to group environments. High merger rate in high local density
regions corresponds primarily to the high merge rate in group
environments......

investigated assuming chiral p-wave pairing symmetry. The two bands correspond
to the alpha-beta-bands of Sr2RuO4 and are modeled within a tight-binding model
including inter-orbital hybridization and spin-orbit coupling effects.
Including superconductivity the quasiparticle spectrum is determined by means
of a self-consistent Bogolyubov-de Gennes calculation. While a full
quasiparticle excitation gap appears in the bulk, gapless states form at the
edges which produce spontaneous spin and/or charge currents. The spin current
is the result of the specific band structure while the charge current
originates from the superconducting condensate. Together they induce a small
spin polarization at the edge. Furthermore onsite Coulomb repulsion is included
to show that the edge states are unstable against the formation of a
Stoner-like spin polarization of the edge states. Through spin-orbit coupling
the current- and the correlation-induced magnetism are coupled to the
orientation of the chirality of the superconducting condensate. We speculate
that this type of phenomenon could yield a compensation of the magnetic fields
induced by currents and also explain the negative result in the recent
experimental search for chiral edge currents.

formation of the Peregrine rogue wave: one is the localized process of the
continuous wave background, and the other is the reduction process of the
periodization of the bright soliton. The characteristics of the Peregrine rogue
wave are exhibited by strong temporal and spatial localization. Also, various
initial excitations of the Peregrine rogue wave are performed and the results
show that the Peregrine rogue wave can be excited by a small localized (single
peak) perturbation pulse of the continuous wave background, even for the
nonintegrable case. The numerical simulations show that the Peregrine rogue
wave is unstable. Finally, through a realistic example, the influence of the
self-frequency shift to the dynamics of the Peregrine rogue wave is discussed.
The results show that in the absence of the self-frequency shift, the Peregrine
rogue wave can split into several subpuslses; however, when the self-frequency
shift is considered, the Peregrine rogue wave no longer splits and exhibits
mainly a peak changing and an increasing evolution property of the field

the severe challenge posed by fast-electron source divergence. The hybrid

heating, and thermonuclear burn. The fast electron source is based on a 3D
explicit-PIC laser-plasma simulation with the PSC code. This shows a quasi
two-temperature energy spectrum, and a divergent angle spectrum (average
velocity-space polar angle of 52 degrees). Transport simulations with the
PIC-based divergence do not ignite for > 1 MJ of fast-electron energy, for a
modest 70 micron standoff distance from fast-electron injection to the dense
fuel. However, artificially collimating the source gives an ignition energy of
132 kJ. To mitigate the divergence, we consider imposed axial magnetic fields.
Uniform fields ~50 MG are sufficient to recover the artificially collimated
ignition energy. Experiments at the Omega laser facility have generated fields
of this magnitude by imploding a capsule in seed fields of 50-100 kG. Such
imploded fields are however more compressed in the transport region than in the
laser absorption region. When fast electrons encounter increasing field
strength, magnetic mirroring can reflect a substantial fraction of them and
reduce coupling to the fuel. A hollow magnetic pipe, which peaks at a finite
radius, is presented as one field configuration which circumvents mirroring.

goal is to control the handover decisions depending on the users' mobility by

use RSSI, speed and distance as the input decision criteria of a handover

monitored for a period of time before handover is triggered. Finally, through

to find a path between communicating nodes. The considerations of the MANET

forming a cocoon dominated by cosmic rays with a decreased thermal gas
emissivity. We selected this process for our first attempt to look for the
effects of this type of interaction. We analyzed the Chandra X-ray data for the
radio galaxy M87 in order to verify if the expected regions of diminished
emissivity may be present near the spectacular X-ray jet in this source. The
detailed analysis of the data, merged from 42 separate observations, shows
signatures of lower emissivity surrounding the jet. In particular we detect an
intensity dip along the part of the jet, which would be approximately 150 pc x
2 kpc in size, if situated along the jet which is inclined toward us. Due to a
highly non-uniform X-ray background in the central region we are not able to
claim the discovery of a cosmic ray cocoon around the M87 jet: we only have
demonstrated that the data show morphological structures which could be
accounted for if a cosmic ray cocoon exists.

the theory introduces modified Friedmann equations where the standard matter

constant, quintessence and stiff matter, respectively. We test the viability of
this massive gravity formulation by contrasting its theoretical prediction to
the Hubble diagram as traced by Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) and Gamma Ray Bursts
(GRBs), the $H(z)$ measurements from passively evolving galaxies, Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) from galaxy surveys and the distance priors from
the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) anisotropy spectrum. It turns
out that the model is indeed able to very well fit this large dataset thus
offering a viable alternative to the usual dark energy framework. We finally
set stringent constraints on its parameters also narrowing down the allowed

the gap formation and DC superconductivity) of superconducting conductivity.
There also exist some differences among the three models as far as the AC

nonzero frequency for the imaginary part of the conductivity, which is present
in the nonconformal models; their asymptotic behaviors are different-for D1/D5
the real part of the AC conductivity approaches one at large frequency limit,
for D2/D4 it slowly goes to a certain nonzero constant smaller than one and for
D3/D3 it goes to zero. We find the profile of the AC conductivity for the D1/D5

that an arbitrary copula is in the domain of attraction of a multivariate
extreme value distribution if and only if its upper tail can be approximated by
the upper tail of a multivariate GPD with uniform margins. The multivariate PT
then consists of two steps: The upper tail of a given copula $C$ is cut off and
substituted by a multivariate GPD copula in a continuous manner. The result is
again a copula. The other step consists of the transformation of each margin of
this new copula by a given univariate distribution function. This provides,
altogether, a multivariate distribution function with prescribed margins whose
copula coincides in its central part with $C$ and in its upper tail with a GPD
copula. When applied to data, this approach also enables the evaluation of a
wide range of rational scenarios for the upper tail of the underlying
distribution function in the multivariate case. We apply this approach to
operational loss data in order to evaluate the range of operational risk.

braking. This may explain why low luminosity magnetars are more likely to have
radio emissions. In the wind braking scenario, magnetars are neutron stars with

Each parameter measures ""how far'' $H$ is from $G$ in a different way. Whereas
the folded covering number has been investigated thoroughly for some covering
classes, e.g., interval graphs and planar graphs, the local covering number has
received little attention.
  We provide new bounds on each covering number with respect to the following
covering classes: linear forests, star forests, caterpillar forests, and
interval graphs. The classical graph parameters that result this way are
interval number, track number, linear arboricity, star arboricity, and
caterpillar arboricity. As input graphs we consider graphs of bounded
degeneracy, bounded degree, bounded tree-width or bounded simple tree-width, as
well as outerplanar, planar bipartite, and planar graphs. For several pairs of

Fokker-Planck equation is similar to that used in the theory of binary
nucleation, but the non-diagonal elements exist in the reaction rate matrix.
First, the general solution for the steady-state nucleation rate and the
direction of nucleation flux is derived. Next, this information is then used to
study the nucleation of composite nucleus at the saddle point. The dependence
of steady-state nucleation rate as well as the direction of nucleation flux on

offers many useful and critical applications including the safety applications.
Most of these applications require that each vehicle knows precisely its
current position in real time. GPS is the most common positioning technique for
VANET. However, it is not accurate. Moreover, the GPS signals cannot be
received in the tunnels, undergrounds, or near tall buildings. Thus, no
positioning service can be obtained in these locations. Even if the Deferential
GPS (DGPS) can provide high accuracy, but still no GPS converge in these
locations. In this paper, we provide positioning techniques for VANET that can
provide accurate positioning service in the areas where GPS signals are
hindered by the obstacles. Experimental results show significant improvement in
the accuracy. This allows when combined with DGPS the continuity of a precise
positioning service that can be used by most of the VANET applications.

physical content of all so-called ""space-time measurements"" only requires
timing (by a physical/material clock) of particle detections (at a
physical/material detector). It is interesting then to establish which aspects
of our current theories afford us the convenient abstraction of a spacetime. I
emphasize the role played by the assumed triviality of the geometry of momentum
space, which makes room for an observer-independent notion of locality. This is
relevant for some recent studies of the quantum-gravity problem that stumbled
upon hints of a nontrivial geometry of momentum space, something which had been
strikingly envisaged for quantum gravity already in 1938 by Max Born. If indeed
momentum space has nontrivial geometry then the abstraction of a spacetime
becomes more evidently redundant and less convenient: one may still abstract a
spacetime but only allowing for the possibility of a relativity of spacetime
locality. I also provide some examples of how all this could affect our
attitude toward the quantum-gravity problem, including some for the program of
emergent gravity and emergent spacetime and an indication of triviality of the
holographic description of black holes. And in order to give an illustrative
example of possible logical path for the ""disappearance of spacetime"" I rely on
formulas inspired by the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e framework.

of iceberg sizes at irregular intervals. We present calving-event data obtained
from continuous observations of the termini of two tidewater glaciers on
Svalbard, and show that the distributions of event sizes and inter-event
intervals can be reproduced by a simple calving model focusing on the mutual
interplay between calving and the destabilization of the glacier terminus. The
event-size distributions of both the field and the model data extend over
several orders of magnitude and resemble power laws. The distributions of
inter-event intervals are broad, but have a less pronounced tail. In the model,
the width of the size distribution increases with the calving susceptibility of
the glacier terminus, a parameter measuring the effect of calving on the stress
in the local neighborhood of the calving region. Inter-event interval
distributions, in contrast, are insensitive to the calving susceptibility.
Above a critical susceptibility, small perturbations of the glacier result in
ongoing self-sustained calving activity. The model suggests that the shape of
the event-size distribution of a glacier is informative about its proximity to
this transition point. Observations of rapid glacier retreats can be explained
by supercritical self-sustained calving.

the vortex the ground state has a d-wave configuration. In presence of the
vortex, the superconducting order parameter, above the critical doping, drops
to a low non zero value within a few lattice points from the vortex (that is
within the the vortex core) and beyond it converges to the constant value in

$\cg(S)$, is a simple graph whose vertices are the non-central elements of $S$

symmetric inverse semigroup of partial injective transformations on a finite
set $X$. The semigroup $\mi(X)$ has the symmetric group $\sym(X)$ of
permutations on $X$ as its group of units. In 1989, Burns and Goldsmith
determined the clique number of the commuting graph of $\sym(X)$. In 2008,
Iranmanesh and Jafarzadeh found an upper bound of the diameter of

a GAP) that this upper bound is in fact the exact value.
  The goal of this paper is to begin the study of the commuting graph of the

odd prime. We show that when $|X|$ is odd and divisible by at least two primes,
then the diameter of $\cg(\mi(X))$ is either 4 or 5. In the process, we obtain
several results about semigroups, such as a description of all commutative
subsemigroups of $\mi(X)$ of maximum order, and analogous results for
commutative inverse and commutative nilpotent subsemigroups of $\mi(X)$. The
paper closes with a number of problems for experts in combinatorics and in

is widely invoked to explain cluster statistics at different ages. While a well
studied problem, most recent studies of gas expulsion's effect on a cluster
have focused on massive clusters, with stellar counts of order $10^4$. Here we
argue that the evolutionary timescales associated with the compact low-mass
clusters typical of the median cluster in the Solar neighborhood are short
enough that significant dynamical evolution can take place over the ages
usually associated with gas expulsion. To test this we perform {\it N}-body
simulations of the dynamics of a very young star forming region, with initial
conditions drawn from a large-scale hydrodynamic simulation of gravitational
collapse and fragmentation. The subclusters we analyse, with populations of a
few hundred stars, have high local star formation efficiencies and are roughly
virialised even after the gas is removed. Over 10 Myr they expand to a similar
degree as would be expected from gas expulsion if they were initially gas-rich,
but the expansion is purely due to the internal stellar dynamics of the young
clusters. The expansion is such that the stellar densities at 2 Myr match those
of YSOs in the Solar neighborhood. We argue that at the low-mass end of the
cluster mass spectrum, a deficit of clusters at 10s of Myr does not necessarily
imply gas expulsion as a disruption mechanism.

identified in previous work as being close to the contact binary short-period
limit, were studied for evidence of period change. The orbital periods of most
of the stars were confirmed, and period decrease, significant at more than 5
sigma, was observed in three objects: 1SWASP J174310.98+432709.6 (-0.055
\pm0.003 s/yr), 1SWASP J133105.91+121538.0 (-0.075 \pm0.013 s/yr) and 1SWASP
J234401.81-212229.1 (-0.313 \pm0.019 s/yr). The magnitudes of the observed
period changes cannot be explained by magnetic braking or gravitational
radiation effects, and are most likely primarily due to unstable mass transfer
from primary to secondary components, possibly accompanied by unstable mass and
angular momentum loss from the systems. If these period decreases persist, the
systems could merge on a relatively short timescale.

accumulation-and-threshold process. The model arises from an analogy with
signal processing in wireless communications. Complex wavefunctions are
interpreted as expressing the amplitude and phase information of a modulated
carrier wave. Particle transmission events are modeled as the outcome of a
process of signal accumulation that occurs in an extra (non-spacetime)
dimension.
  Besides giving a natural interpretation of the wavefunction and the Born
rule, the model accommodates the collapse of the wave packet and other quantum
paradoxes such as EPR and the Ahanorov-Bohm effect. The model also gives a new
perspective on the 'relational' nature of quantum mechanics: that is, whether
the wave function of a physical system is ""real"" or simply reflects the
observer's partial knowledge of the system. We simulate the model for a 2-slit
experiment, and indicate possible deviations of the model's predictions from
conventional quantum mechanics. We also indicate how the theory may be extended
to a field theory.

produced in compact jet regions, although in at least one case, Centaurus A,

localization of the gamma-ray dissipation zone in a high power radio galaxy

The site, coincident with the radio core, is estimated to be at a distance
<~0.3 pc from the black hole. Although the place where high energy photons are

rarer in the GeV sky. Our study of all the radio sources belonging to four

enhanced in VDE, since the mass function at high redshift is boosted up to a
factor of ten with respect to \LCDM, possibly alleviating tensions with the
observations of massive clusters at high redshifts and early reionization
epoch. Significant differences can also be found for the value of the growth
factor, that in VDE shows a completely different behaviour, and in the
distribution of voids, which in this cosmology are on average smaller and less
abundant. We further studied the structure of dark matter haloes more massive
than $5\times10^{13}$\hMsun, finding that no substantial difference emerges

can be found in the concentration-mass relation and the two point correlation
function; both showing different amplitudes and steeper slopes.Using an
additional series of simulations of a \LCDM\ scenario with the same $\Omega_M$

Maloney","Mesoscale harmonic analysis of homogenous dislocation nucleation","9 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We perform atomistic computer simulations to study the mechanism of
homogeneous dislocation nucleation in two dimensional (2D) hexagonal
crystalline films during indentation with a circular nanoindenter. The
nucleation process is governed by the vanishing of the energy associated with a
single normal mode. This critical mode is largely confined to a single plane of
adjacent atoms. For fixed film thickness, L, the spatial extent, \xi, of the
critical mode grows with indenter radius, R. For fixed R/L, the spatial extent
\xi, grows roughly as \xi ~ L^0.4. We, furthermore, perform a mesoscale
analysis to determine the lowest energy normal mode for mesoscale regions of
varying radius, r_{meso}, centered on the critical mode's core. The energy,
\lambda_{meso}, of the lowest normal mode in the meso-region decays very
rapidly with r_{meso} and \lambda_{meso} ~= 0 for r_{meso} >~ \xi. The lowest
normal mode shows a spatial extent, \xi_{meso}, which has a sublinear power-law
increase with r_{meso} for r_{meso} <~ \xi, and saturates at r_{meso} \gtrsim
1.5\xi. We demonstrate a universal relationship between \xi_{meso}/ \xi versus
r_{meso}/ \xi: independent of film thickness or indenter radius. The scenario
that emerges is one where the analysis of small regions, r_{meso} <~ \xi, in
the material \emph{can} reveal the presence of incipient instability even when
the region being probed is much smaller than the spatial extent of the critical
mode. However, the mesoscale analysis gives good estimates for the energy and
spatial extent of the critical mode \emph{only} for r_{meso} >~ 1.5 \xi. In
this sense homogeneous dislocation nucleation should be understood as a
quasi-local phenomenon.

lines with well separated formation heights have been considered. The data have
been filtered of p-modes to isolate the pure convective phenomenon. From our
studies of global correlation coefficients and coherence and phase shift
analyzes between the several line parameters, the following results can be
reported. The convective velocity pattern preserves structures larger than 1.0""
up to the highest layers of the photosphere (~ 435 km). However, at these
layers, in the intensity pattern only structures larger than 2.0"" are still
connected with those at the continuum level although showing inverted
brightness contrast. This confirms an inversion of temperature that we have
found at a height of ~140 km. A possible evidence of gravity waves superimposed
to the convective motions is derived from the phase shift analysis. We
interpret the behavior of the full width at half maximum and the equivalent
width as a function of the distance to the granular borders, as a consequence
of enhanced turbulence and/or strong velocity gradients in the intergranular

trapped surfaces (MOTS), for which a well-defined notion of stability exists.
In this paper we obtain the explicit form for the stability operator for such
MOTS and analyze in detail its properties in the particular case of
non-evolving horizons, which include both isolated and Killing horizons. We
link these stability properties with the surface gravity of the horizon and/or
to the existence of minimal sections. The results are used, in particular, to
obtain an area-angular momentum inequality for sections of axially symmetric
horizons in four spacetime dimensions, which helps clarifying the relationship
between two different approaches to this inequality existing in the literature.

An average granular cell model is presented, showing the granule-intergranular

specific small and a specific large granular cell complement these results. A
strong decay of the temperature fluctuations with increasing height together
with a less efficient penetration of smaller cells is revealed. The T -T

At the layers beyond, an inversion of the temperature contrast is revealed.
Vertical velocities are in phase throughout the photosphere and penetrate into

network with N nodes randomly accessing the spectrum licensed to a primary node
during the idle slots of the primary user. If the sensing is perfect, then the
secondary nodes do not interfere with the primary node and hence do not affect
its stable throughput. In case of imperfect sensing, it is shown that if the
primary user's arrival rate is less than some calculated finite value,
cognitive nodes can employ any transmission power or probabilities without
affecting the primary user's stability; otherwise, the secondary nodes should
control their transmission parameters to reduce the interference on the
primary. It is also shown that in contrast with the primary's maximum stable
throughput which strictly decreases with increased sensing errors, the
throughput of the secondary nodes might increase with sensing errors as more
transmission opportunities become available to them. Finally, we explore the
use of the secondary nodes as relays of the primary node's traffic to
compensate for the interference they might cause. We introduce a relaying
protocol based on distributed space-time coding that forces all the secondary
nodes that are able to decode a primary's unsuccessful packet to relay that
packet whenever the primary is idle. In this case, for appropriate modulation
scheme and under perfect sensing, it is shown that the more secondary nodes in
the system, the better for the primary user in terms of his stable throughput.
Meanwhile, the secondary nodes might benefit from relaying by having access to
a larger number of idle slots due to the increase of the service rate of the
primary. For the case of a single secondary node, the proposed relaying
protocol guarantees that either both the primary and the secondary benefit from
relaying or none of them does.

motives. In the pure world, we start by proving that the classical category
AM(k) of Artin motives (over a base field k) can be characterized as the
largest category inside Chow motives which fully-embeds into noncommutative
Chow motives. Making use of a refined bridge between pure motives and
noncommutative pure motives we then show that the image of this full embedding,
which we call the category NAM(k) of noncommutative Artin motives, is invariant
under the different equivalence relations and modification of the symmetry
isomorphism constraints. As an application, we recover the absolute Galois
group of k from the Tannakian formalism applied to NAM(k). Then, we develop the
theory of base-change in the world of noncommutative pure motives. As an
application, we obtain new tools for the study of motivic decompositions and
Schur/Kimura finiteness. Making use of this theory of base-change we construct
a short exact sequence relating the absolute Galois group of k with the
noncommutative motivic Galois groups of k and of its algebraic closure.
Finally, we describe a precise relationship between this short exact sequence
and the one constructed by Deligne-Milne. In the mixed world, we introduce the
triangulated category NMAM(k) of noncommutative mixed Artin motives and
construct a faithful functor from the classical category MAM(k) of mixed Artin
motives to it. When k is a finite field this functor is an equivalent. On the
other hand, when k is of characteristic zero NMAM(k) is much richer than MAM(k)
since its higher Ext-groups encode all the (rationalized) higher algebraic
K-theory of finite etale k-schemes. In the appendix we establish a general
result about short exact sequences of Galois groups which is of independent
interest. As an application, we obtain a new proof of Deligne-Milne's short
exact sequence.

which makes an attempt to unify distributed averaging and maximizing algorithms
considered in the literature. Each node iteratively updates its state as a
time-varying weighted average of its own state, the minimal state, and the
maximal state of its neighbors. We prove that finite-time consensus is almost
impossible for averaging under this uniform model. Both time-dependent and
state-dependent graphs are considered, and various necessary and/or sufficient
conditions are presented on the consensus convergence. For time-dependent
graphs, we show that quasi-strong connectivity is critical for averaging, as is
strong connectivity for maximizing. For state-dependent graphs defined by a
$\mu$-nearest-neighbor rule, where each node interacts with its $\mu$ nearest
smaller neighbors and the $\mu$ nearest larger neighbors, we show that $\mu+1$
is a critical threshold on the total number of nodes for the transit from
finite-time to asymptotic convergence for averaging, in the absence of node
self-confidence. The threshold is $2\mu$ if each node chooses to connect only
to neighbors with unique values. Numerical examples illustrate the tightness of
the conditions. The results characterize some fundamental similarities and
differences between distributed averaging and maximizing algorithms.

light Higgs boson search analyses. When tuned to the equivalent light jet
rejection rate, HOBIT tags 54% of b jets in simulated 120 GeV/c2 Higgs boson
