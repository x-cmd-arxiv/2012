Lyman \alpha forest correlation function on large scales. We study the effect
both numerically, by inserting HCD systems on mock spectra for a specific
model, and analytically, in the context of two-point correlations and linear
theory. We show that the presence of HCDs substantially contributes to the
noise of the correlation function measurement, and systematically alters the
measured redshift-space correlation function of the Lyman \alpha forest,
increasing the value of the density bias factor and decreasing the redshift
distortion parameter $\beta_\alpha$ of the Lyman \alpha forest. We provide
simple formulae for corrections on these derived parameters, as a function of
the mean effective optical depth and bias factor of the host halos of the HCDs,
and discuss the conditions under which these expressions should be valid. In
practice, precise corrections to the measured parameters of the Lyman \alpha
forest correlation for the HCD effects are more complex than the simple
analytical approximations we present, owing to non-linear effects of the damped
wings of the HCD systems and the presence of three-point terms. However, we
conclude that an accurate correction for these HCD effects can be obtained
numerically and calibrated with observations of the HCD-Lyman \alpha
cross-correlation. We also discuss an analogous formalism to treat and correct
for the contaminating effect of metal lines overlapping the Lyman \alpha forest
spectra.

study to what extent these cold streams are traceable in the extended

low ionisation metal absorption lines. We model the expected absorption
signatures using high resolution zoom-in AMR cosmological simulations. In the
postprocessing, we distinguish between self-shielded gas and unshielded gas. In
the self-shielded gas, which is optically thick to Lyman continuum radiation,
we assume pure collisional ionisation for species with an ionisation potential
greater than 13.6 eV. In the optically thin, unshielded gas these species are
also photoionised by the meta-galactic radiation. In addition to absorption of
radiation from background quasars, we compute the absorption line profiles of
radiation emitted by the galaxy at the centre of the same halo. We predict the
strength of the absorption signal for individual galaxies without stacking. We
find that the Ly alpha absorption profiles produced by the streams are
consistent with observations of absorption and emission Ly alpha profiles in
high redshift galaxies. Due to the low metallicities in the streams, and their
low covering factors, the metal absorption features are weak and difficult to
detect.

carries larger winding number and states where |L1-L2| > 1. We present a
detailed analysis of the stability of the observed vortex structures with

whole range of temperatures and applied magnetic fields in which both bands are
active. Finally, we propose an efficient way of increasing the range of

for obtaining three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules in
native states. A minimum cryo-EM image data set for deriving a meaningful
reconstruction is comprised of thousands of randomly orientated projections of
identical particles photographed with a small number of electrons. The
computation of 3D structure from 2D projections requires clustering, which aims
to enhance the signal to noise ratio in each view by grouping similarly
oriented images. Nevertheless, the prevailing clustering techniques are often
compromised by three characteristics of cryo-EM data: high noise content, high
dimensionality and large number of clusters. Moreover, since clustering
requires registering images of similar orientation into the same pixel
coordinates by 2D alignment, it is desired that the clustering algorithm can
label misaligned images as outliers. Herein, we introduce a clustering
algorithm $\gamma$-SUP to model the data with a $q$-Gaussian mixture and adopt
the minimum $\gamma$-divergence for estimation, and then use a self-updating
procedure to obtain the numerical solution. We apply $\gamma$-SUP to the
cryo-EM images of two benchmark macromolecules, RNA polymerase II and ribosome.
In the former case, simulated images were chosen to decouple clustering from
alignment to demonstrate $\gamma$-SUP is more robust to misalignment outliers
than the existing clustering methods used in the cryo-EM community. In the
latter case, the clustering of real cryo-EM data by our $\gamma$-SUP method
eliminates noise in many views to reveal true structure features of ribosome at
the projection level.

transfinite iteration of ordinal functions.
  Hyperations are iterations of normal functions. Unlike iteration by pointwise
convergence, hyperation preserves normality. The hyperation of a normal
function f is a sequence of normal functions so that f^0= id, f^1 = f and for
all ordinals \alpha, \beta we have that f^(\alpha + \beta) = f^\alpha f^\beta.
These conditions do not determine f^\alpha uniquely; in addition, we require
that the functions be minimal in an appropriate sense. We study hyperations
systematically and show that they are a natural refinement of Veblen
progressions.
  Next, we define cohyperations, very similar to hyperations except that they
are left-additive: given \alpha, \beta, f^(\alpha + \beta)= f^\beta f^\alpha.
Cohyperations iterate initial functions which are functions that map initial
segments to initial segments. We systematically study cohyperations and see how
they can be employed to define left inverses to hyperations.
  Hyperations provide an alternative presentation of Veblen progressions and
can be useful where a more fine-grained analysis of such sequences is called
for. They are very amenable to algebraic manipulation and hence are convenient
to work with. Cohyperations, meanwhile, give a novel way to describe slowly
increasing functions as often appear, for example, in proof theory.

energy, only the ground state of the system has received consideration
heretofore. This is a spin singlet state. In this work we exhaustively study
the lowest excited (spin triplet) harmonium state, with the main purpose of
revisiting the relation between entanglement measures and correlation energy
for this quite different species. The task is made easier by working with
Wigner quasiprobabilities on phase space.

objects detected above a flux threshold of S24mum=310muJy. We adopt
optical/near-IR color selection criteria to split the sample into the
lower-redshift and higher-redshift galaxy populations. We measure the angular
correlation function on scales of theta=0.01-3.5 deg, from which, using the
Limber inversion along with the redshift distribution established for similarly
selected source populations in the GOODS fields (Rodighiero et al. 2010), we
obtain comoving correlation lengths of r0=4.98+-0.28 h^-1 Mpc and r0
=8.04+-0.69 h^-1 Mpc for the low-z (<z>=0.7) and high-z (<z>=1.7) subsamples,
respectively. Comparing these measurements with the correlation functions of
dark matter halos identified in the Bolshoi cosmological simulation (Klypin et
al. 2011}, we find that the high-redshift objects reside in progressively more
massive halos reaching Mtot>3e12 h^-1 Msun, compared to Mtot>7e11 h^-1 Msun for
the low-redshift population. Approximate estimates of the IR luminosities based
on the catalogs of 24mum sources in the GOODS fields show that our high-z
subsample represents a population of ""distant ULIRGs"" with LIR>10^12Lsun, while
the low-z subsample mainly consists of ""LIRGs"", LIR~10^11Lsun. The comparison
of number density of the 24mum selected galaxies and of dark matter halos with
derived minimum mass Mtot shows that only 20% of such halos may host
star-forming galaxies.

is depleted from the inner disk. This sample is combined with a larger FUV
sample of accretors and non-accretors with ages between 1 and 100 Myr, showing
that as early as 1--3 Myr, systems both with and without gas are found.
Possible mechanisms for depleting gas quickly include viscous evolution, planet
formation and photoevaporation by stellar radiation fields. Since these
mechanisms alone cannot account for the lack of gas at 1--3 Myr, it is likely
that the initial conditions (e.g. initial disk mass or core angular momentum)
contribute to the variety of disks observed at any age. We estimate the angular
momentum of a cloud needed for most of the mass to fall very close to the
central object and compare this to models of the expected distribution of
angular momenta. Up to 20% of cloud cores have low enough angular momenta to
form disks with the mass close to the star, which would then accrete quickly;
this percentage is similar to the fraction of diskless stars in the youngest
star forming regions. With our sample, we characterize the chromospheric
contribution to the FUV luminosity and find that $L_{FUV}/L_{bol}$ saturates at
$\sim10^{-4.1}$.

We focus on deterministic distributed algorithms, and study models of computing
that are weaker versions of the widely-studied port-numbering model. In the
port-numbering model, a node of degree d receives messages through d input
ports and sends messages through d output ports, both numbered with 1,2,...,d.
In this work, VVc is the class of all graph problems that can be solved in the
standard port-numbering model. We study the following subclasses of VVc:
  VV: Input port i and output port i are not necessarily connected to the same
neighbour.
  MV: Input ports are not numbered; algorithms receive a multiset of messages.
  SV: Input ports are not numbered; algorithms receive a set of messages.
  VB: Output ports are not numbered; algorithms send the same message to all
output ports.
  MB: Combination of MV and VB.
  SB: Combination of SV and VB.
  Now we have many trivial containment relations, such as SB \subseteq MB
\subseteq VB \subseteq VV \subseteq VVc, but it is not obvious if, for example,
either of VB \subseteq SV or SV \subseteq VB should hold. Nevertheless, it
turns out that we can identify a linear order on these classes. We prove that
SB \subsetneq MB = VB \subsetneq SV = MV = VV \subsetneq VVc. The same holds
for the constant-time versions of these classes.
  We also show that the constant-time variants of these classes can be
characterised by a corresponding modal logic. Hence the linear order identified
in this work has direct implications in the study of the expressibility of
modal logic. Conversely, one can use tools from modal logic to study these
classes.

novel combinations of existing alleles, while selection amplifies the fittest
genotypes in the population. If recombination is more rapid than selection,
populations consist of a diverse mixture of many genotypes, as is observed in
many populations. In the opposite regime, which is realized for example in the
facultatively sexual populations that outcross in only a fraction of
reproductive cycles, selection can amplify individual genotypes into large
clones. Such clones emerge when the fitness advantage of some of the genotypes
is large enough that they grow to a significant fraction of the population
despite being broken down by recombination. The occurrence of this ""clonal
condensation"" depends, in addition to the outcrossing rate, on the heritability
of fitness. Clonal condensation leads to a strong genetic heterogeneity of the
population which is not adequately described by traditional population genetics
measures, such as Linkage Disequilibrium. Here we point out the similarity
between clonal condensation and the freezing transition in the Random Energy
Model of spin glasses. Guided by this analogy we explicitly calculate the
probability, Y, that two individuals are genetically identical as a function of
the key parameters of the model. While Y is the analog of the spin-glass order
parameter, it is also closely related to rate of coalescence in population
genetics: Two individuals that are part of the same clone have a recent common
ancestor.

dust along with the ejected gas. The evidence for this dust was found in the
form of an IR excess in the integrated spectrum of the Crab and in extinction
against the synchrotron nebula that revealed the presence of dust in the
filament cores. We present the first spatially resolved emission spectra of
dust in the Crab Nebula acquired with the Infrared Spectrograph aboard the
Spitzer Space Telescope. The IR spectra are dominated by synchrotron emission
and show forbidden line emission from from S, Si, Ne, Ar, O, Fe, and Ni. We
derived a synchrotron spectral map from the 3.6 and 4.5 microns images, and
subtracted this contribution from our data to produce a map of the residual
continuum emission from dust. The dust emission appears to be concentrated
along the ejecta filaments and is well described by an amorphous carbon or
silicate grain compositions. We find a dust temperature of 55+/- 4 K for
silicates and 60 +/- 7 K for carbon grains. The total estimated dust mass is
0.0012-0.012 solar masses, well below the theoretical dust yield predicted for
a core-collapse supernova. Our grain heating model implies that the dust grain
radii are relatively small, unlike what is expected for dust grains formed in a
Type IIP SN.

However, despite its strong magnitude, this transfer is very far from the

were proposed to have been formed in the supernova remnant (SNR) G016.8-01.1.
Aims. We aim to obtain the Galactic trajectory of LS 5039 and PSR J1825-1446 to
find their origin in the Galaxy, and in particular to check their association
with SNR G016.8-01.1 to restrict their age. Methods. By means of radio and
optical observations we obtained the proper motion and the space velocity of
the sources. Results. The proper motion of PSR J1825-1446 corresponds to a
transverse space velocity of 690 km/s at a distance of 5 kpc. Its Galactic
velocity at different distances is not compatible with the expected Galactic
rotation. The velocity and characteristic age of PSR J1825-1446 make it
incompatible with SNR G016.8-01.1. There are no clear OB associations or SNRs
crossing the past trajectory of PSR J1825-1446. We estimate the age of the
pulsar to be 80-245 kyr, which is compatible with its characteristic age. The
proper motion of LS 5039 is 7.09 and -8.82 mas/yr in right ascension and
declination, respectively. The association of LS 5039 with SNR G016.8-01.1 is
unlikely, although we cannot to discard it. The system would have had to be
formed in the association Ser OB2 (at 2.0 kpc) if the age of the system is
1.0-1.2 Myr, or in the association Sct OB3 (distance 1.5-2 kpc) for an age of
0.1-0.2 Myr. If the system were not formed close to Ser OB2, the
pseudo-synchronization of the orbit would be unlikely. Conclusions. PSR
J1825-1446 is a high-velocity isolated pulsar ejected from the Galaxy. The
distance to LS 5039, which needs to be constrained by future astrometric
missions such as Gaia, is a key parameter for restricting its origin and age.

ones are the mutual coherence, the restricted isometry property (RIP), and the

showing that for a given matrix A and positive integer k, computing the best
constants for which the RIP or NSP hold is, in general, NP-hard. These results
are based on the fact that determining the spark of a matrix is NP-hard, which

significantly suppresses both the number of halos formed and the amount of
baryons accreted onto such halos of masses 10^6 < M_{halo} / M_solar < 10^8 at

reionization. As halos of these masses are believed to have very little star
formation after reionization due to the effects of photo-heating by the
ultraviolet background, this effect persists to the present day. We calculate
that the number of low-mass 10^6 < M_{halo} / M_solar < 10^8 halos that host
luminous satellite galaxies today is typically suppressed by 50 percent, with
values ranging up to 90 percent in regions where the initial supersonic

transformations and not only under transformations that go to a constant at
spatial infinity. The construction is based on concepts in loop spaces and on a
generalization of the non-abelian Stokes theorem for two-form connections. The
third goal of the paper is to present the integral form of the self dual
Yangs-Mills equations, and calculate the conserved charges associated to them.
The charges are explicitly evaluated for the cases of monopoles, dyons,

analysed in an earlier study (Schuberth et al. 2006), we now have a sample of
460 globular cluster velocities out to a radius of 12 arcmin (60 kpc) available
- one of the largest of its kind. This new data set also provides a much more
complete angular coverage. Moreover, we present new kinematical data of the
inner stellar population of NGC 4636. We perform an updated Jeans analysis,
using both stellar and GC data, to better constrain the dark halo properties.
We find a stellar M/L-ratio of 5.8 in the R-band, higher than expected from
single stellar population synthesis. We model the dark halo by cored and cuspy
analytical halo profiles and consider different anisotropies for the tracer
populations. Properties of NFW halos lie well within the expected range of
cosmological simulations. Cored halos give central dark matter densities, which
are typical for elliptical galaxies of NGC 4636's luminosity. The surface
densities of the dark matter halos are higher than those of spiral galaxies. We
compare the predictions of Modified Newtonian Dynamics with the derived halo
properties and find satisfactory agreement. Therefore NGC 4636 therefore falls
onto the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for spiral galaxies. The comparison
with the X-ray mass profile of Johnson et al. (2009) reveals satisfactory
agreement only, if the abundance gradient of hot plasma has been taken into
account. This might indicate a general bias towards higher masses for X-ray
based mass profiles in all systems, including galaxy clusters, with strong
abundance gradients.

geometric definition, based on the notion of discriminant points of

RP^{2n+1}. On the other hand we also show by elementary arguments that the

This Kondo regime, closely related to the SU(4) Kondo, flips spin from one to
zero through cotunneling processes that generate almost totally spin-polarized
currents with opposite spin orientation along the two channels. Moreover, by
appropriately changing the gate voltages of both quantum dots, one can
simultaneously flip the spin polarization of the currents in each channel. As a

  layer",,,"10.1063/1.4729334",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The sudden reconnection of a non-force free 2D current layer, embedded in a
low-beta plasma, triggered by the onset of an anomalous resistivity, is studied
in detail. The resulting behaviour consists of two main phases. Firstly, a
transient reconnection phase, in which the current in the layer is rapidly
dispersed and some flux is reconnected. This dispersal of current launches a
family of small amplitude magnetic and plasma perturbations, which propagate
away from the null at the local fast and slow magnetosonic speeds. The vast
majority of the magnetic energy released in this phase goes into internal
energy of the plasma, and only a tiny amount is converted into kinetic energy.
In the wake of the outwards propagating pulses, an imbalance of Lorentz and
pressure forces creates a stagnation flow which drives a regime of impulsive
bursty reconnection, in which fast reconnection is turned on and off in a
turbulent manner as the current density exceeds and falls below a critical
value. During this phase, the null current density is continuously built up
above a certain critical level, then dissipated very rapidly, and built up
again, in a stochastic manner. Interestingly, the magnetic energy converted

unstable equilibria and corresponds to an unstable hyperbolic fixed point in
the dynamical phase space. Unstable fixed points are central to understanding
Hamiltonian chaos in classical systems. In many-body quantum systems,
mean-field approximations fail in the vicinity of unstable fixed points and
lead to dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations. Here, we measure the
non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body quantum pendulum initialized to a
hyperbolic fixed point of the phase space. The experiment uses a spin-1 Bose
condensate, which exhibits Josephson dynamics in the spin populations that
correspond in the mean-field limit to motion of a non-rigid mechanical
pendulum. The condensate is initialized to a minimum uncertainty spin state,
and quantum fluctuations lead to non-linear spin evolution along a separatrix
and non-Gaussian probability distributions that are measured to be in good
agreement with exact quantum calculations up to 0.25 s. At longer times, atomic
loss due to the finite lifetime of the condensate leads to larger spin
oscillation amplitudes compared to no loss case as orbits depart from the
separatrix. This demonstrates how decoherence of a many-body system can result
in more apparent coherent behaviour. This experiment provides new avenues for
studying macroscopic spin systems in the quantum limit and for investigations
of important topics in non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.

a factor of six. This factor will decrease with time as more brown dwarfs are
identified within this volume, but unless there is a vast reservoir of cold

provide a poor fit to the observed object counts as a function of spectral type

origin of slow dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity in glass-forming systems. The
simulation is performed in a weakly frustrated two-dimensional liquid, where
locally preferred order is allowed to develop with increasing density. The
four-point density correlations and bond-orientation correlations, which have
been frequently used to capture dynamic and static length scales $\xi$ in a
quiescent condition, can be readily extended to a system under steady shear in
this case. In the absence of shear, we confirmed the previous findings that the
dynamic slowing down accompanies the development of dynamic heterogeneity. The
dynamic and static length scales increase with $\alpha$-relaxation time
$\tau_{\alpha}$ as power-law $\xi\sim\tau_{\alpha}^{\mu}$ with $\mu>0$. In the
presence of shear, both viscosity and $\tau_{\alpha}$ have power-law dependence
on shear rate in the marked shear thinning regime. However, dependence of
correlation lengths cannot be described by power laws in the same regime.
Furthermore, the relation $\xi\sim\tau_{\alpha}^{\mu}$ between length scales
and dynamics holds for not too strong shear where thermal fluctuations and
external forces are both important in determining the properties of dense
liquids. Thus, our results demonstrate a link between slow dynamics and
structure in glass-forming liquids even under nonequilibrium conditions.

processes, and point out that plasma waves or turbulence play an important role
in all mechanisms of acceleration. Thus, stochastic acceleration by turbulence
is active in most situations. We also show that it is the most efficient
mechanism of acceleration of relatively cool non relativistic thermal
background plasma particles. In addition, it can preferentially accelerate
electrons relative to protons as is needed in many astrophysical radiating
sources, where usually there are no indications of presence of shocks. We also
point out that a hybrid acceleration mechanism consisting of initial
acceleration by turbulence of background particles followed by a second stage

and they are potentially detectable from the upcoming cosmic shear and CMB
lensing observations. For $P\sim 10^{-1}$, the minimum detectable tension of
the cosmic string will be down to $G\mu\sim 5\times 10^{-8}$. With a
theoretically inferred smallest value $P\sim 10^{-3}$, we could even detect the
string with $G\mu\sim 5\times 10^{-10}$.

  TVWS","submitted to IEEE DySPAN 2012",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper summarizes our attempts to establish a systematic approach that
overcomes a key difficulty in sensing wireless microphone signals, namely, the
inability for most existing detection methods to effectively distinguish
between a wireless microphone signal and a sinusoidal continuous wave (CW).
Such an inability has led to an excessively high false alarm rate and thus
severely limited the utility of sensing-based cognitive transmission in the TV
white space (TVWS) spectrum. Having recognized the root of the difficulty, we
propose two potential solutions. The first solution focuses on the periodogram
as an estimate of the power spectral density (PSD), utilizing the property that
a CW has a line spectral component while a wireless microphone signal has a
slightly dispersed PSD. In that approach, we formulate the resulting decision
model as an one-sided test for Gaussian vectors, based on Kullback-Leibler
distance type of decision statistics. The second solution goes beyond the PSD
and looks into the spectral correlation function (SCF), proposing an augmented
SCF that is capable of revealing more features in the cycle frequency domain
compared with the conventional SCF. Thus the augmented SCF exhibits the key
difference between CW and wireless microphone signals. Both simulation results
and experimental validation results indicate that the two proposed solutions
are promising for sensing wireless microphones in TVWS.

approximately to 100 MeV to 3 PeV for secondary gamma-rays. The production
cross-section of gamma-rays produced in the forward region is essential for the

that the former increases very slowly with $\bar{p}_{t}$ = 100 - 220 MeV/c for

It is special for having asymmetric two-peak profiles in both the X-ray and the

paper, we show that this observed GeV flare could be produced by the
Doppler-boosted synchrotron emission in the bow shock tail. An anisotropic
pulsar wind model, which mainly affects the energy flux injection to the
termination shock in different orbital phase, is also used in this paper, and
we find that the anisotropy in the pulsar wind can play a significant role in
producing the asymmetric two-peak profiles in both X-ray and TeV light curves.
The X-ray and TeV photons before periastron are mainly produced by the shocked
electrons around the shock apex and the light curves after periastron are
contributed by the emission from the shock apex and the shock tail together,
which result in the asymmetric two-peak light curves.

early-time optical polarization in the forward shock (rather than that in the
reverse shock reported by Steele et al. (2009). This detection disfavors the

viewed as a suitable limit of bimetric gravity. The limiting procedure is more
delicate than currently appreciated. Specifically, this limiting procedure
should not unnecessarily constrain the background metric, which must be
externally specified by the theory of massive gravity itself. The fact that in
bimetric theories one always has two sets of metric equations of motion
continues to have an effect even in the massive gravity limit, leading to
additional constraints besides the one set of equations of motion naively
expected. Thus, since solutions of bimetric gravity in the limit of vanishing
kinetic term are also solutions of massive gravity, but the contrary statement
is not necessarily true, there is not complete continuity in the parameter
space of the theory. In particular, we study the massive cosmological solutions

that is relevant for collective foraging in animal groups. Specifically, we
consider a setting in which k identical (probabilistic) agents, initially
placed at some central location, collectively search for a treasure in the
two-dimensional plane. The treasure is placed at a target location by an
adversary and the goal is to find it as fast as possible as a function of both
k and D, where D is the distance between the central location and the target.
This is biologically motivated by cooperative, central place foraging such as
performed by ants around their nest. In this type of search there is a strong
preference to locate nearby food sources before those that are further away.
Our focus is on trying to find what can be achieved if communication is limited
or altogether absent. Indeed, to avoid overlaps agents must be highly dispersed
making communication difficult. Furthermore, if agents do not commence the
search in synchrony then even initial communication is problematic. This holds,
in particular, with respect to the question of whether the agents can
communicate and conclude their total number, k. It turns out that the knowledge
of k by the individual agents is crucial for performance. Indeed, it is a
straightforward observation that the time required for finding the treasure is
$\Omega$(D + D 2 /k), and we show in this paper that this bound can be matched
if the agents have knowledge of k up to some constant approximation. We present
an almost tight bound for the competitive penalty that must be paid, in the
running time, if agents have no information about k. Specifically, on the
negative side, we show that in such a case, there is no algorithm whose
competitiveness is O(log k). On the other hand, we show that for every constant
$\epsilon \textgreater{} 0$, there exists a rather simple uniform search
algorithm which is $O( \log^{1+\epsilon} k)$-competitive. In addition, we give
a lower bound for the setting in which agents are given some estimation of k.
As a special case, this lower bound implies that for any constant $\epsilon
\textgreater{} 0$, if each agent is given a (one-sided)
$k^\epsilon$-approximation to k, then the competitiveness is $\Omega$(log k).
Informally, our results imply that the agents can potentially perform well
without any knowledge of their total number k, however, to further improve,
they must be given a relatively good approximation of k. Finally, we propose a
uniform algorithm that is both efficient and extremely simple suggesting its
relevance for actual biological scenarios.

three dimensions the trajectories, the translation, and the rotation of finite
size inertial particles together with the turbulent flow. The flow field is
analyzed by tracking the temporal evolution of small fluorescent tracer
particles. The inertial particles consist of a super-absorbent polymer that
renders them index and density matched with water and thus invisible. The
particles are marked by inserting at various locations tracer particles into
the polymer. Translation and rotation, as well as the flow field around the
particle are recovered dynamically from the analysis of the marker and tracer
particle trajectories. We apply this technique to study the dynamics of
inertial particles much larger in size (Rp/{\eta} \approx 100) than the
Kolmogorov length scale {\eta} in a von K\'arm\'an swirling water flow
(R{\lambda} \approx 400). We show, using the mixed (particle/fluid) Eulerian
second order velocity structure function, that the interaction zone between the
particle and the flow develops in a spherical shell of width 2Rp around the
particle of radius Rp. This we interpret as an indication of a wake induced by
the particle. This measurement technique has many additional advantages that
will make it useful to address other problems such as particle collisions,
dynamics of non-spherical solid objects, or even of wet granular matter.

optical forbidden lines observed for three stars with UVES. The [Ne II] line
was detected in 7 stars, among them the first confirmed detection of [Ne II] in
a Herbig Be star, V892 Tau. In four cases, the large blueshifted lines indicate
an origin in a jet. In two stars, the small shifts and asymmetric profiles
indicate an origin in a photo-evaporative wind. CoKu Tau 1, seen close to
edge-on, shows a spatially unresolved line centered at the stellar rest
velocity, although cross-dispersion centroids move within 10 AU from one side
of the star to the other as a function of wavelength. The line profile is
symmetric with wings extending up to about +-80 km/s. The origin of the [Ne II]
line could either be due to the bipolar jet or to the disk. For the stars with
VLT-UVES observations, in several cases, the optical forbidden line profiles
and shifts are very similar to the profile of the [Ne II] line, suggesting that
the lines are emitted in the same region. A general trend observed with VISIR
is a lower line flux when compared with the fluxes obtained with Spitzer. We
found no correlation between the line full-width at half maximum and the line
peak velocity. The [Ne II] line remains undetected in a large part of the
sample, an indication that the emission detected with Spitzer in those stars is
likely extended.

So, it is indispensable to develop techniques of verifying and debugging

verification of classical cryptographic protocols, but an essential difficulty
arises when it is applied to quantum systems: the state space of a quantum
system is always a continuum even when its dimension is finite. To overcome
this difficulty, we introduce a novel notion of quantum Markov chain, specially
suited to model quantum cryptographic protocols, in which quantum effects are
entirely encoded into super-operators labelling transitions, leaving the
location information (nodes) being classical. Then we define a quantum
extension of probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) and develop a
model-checking algorithm for quantum Markov chains.

intuitive way of approximating the solution to chance-constrained optimization
programs, based on finding the optimal solution under a finite number of
sampled outcomes of the uncertainty (`scenarios'). A key merit of this approach
is that it neither assumes knowledge of the uncertainty set, as it is common in
robust optimization, nor of its probability distribution, as it is usually
required in stochastic optimization. Moreover, the scenario approach is
computationally efficient as its solution is based on a deterministic
optimization program that is canonically convex, even when the original
chance-constrained problem is not. Recently, researchers have obtained
theoretical foundations for the scenario approach, providing a direct link
between the number of scenarios and bounds on the constraint violation
probability. These bounds are tight in the general case of an uncertain
optimization problem with a single chance constraint. However, this paper shows
that these bounds can be improved in situations where the constraints have a
limited `support rank', a new concept that is introduced for the first time.
This property is typically found in a large number of practical
applications---most importantly, if the problem originally contains multiple
chance constraints (e.g. multi-stage uncertain decision problems), or if a
chance constraint belongs to a special class of constraints (e.g. linear or
quadratic constraints). In these cases the quality of the scenario solution is
improved while the same bound on the constraint violation probability is
maintained, and also the computational complexity is reduced.

Jupiter Trojans and that of asteroids in the main belt, although only eight
members of this far distant asteroid swarm have been observed up to now. Six
leading Neptune Trojans around the Lagrange point L4 discovered earlier have
been studied in detail, but two trailing ones found recently around the L5
point, 2004 KV18 and 2008 LC18, have not been investigated yet. In this paper,
we report our investigations on the dynamical behaviors of these two new
Neptune Trojans. Our calculations show that the asteroid 2004 KV18 is a
temporary Neptune Trojan. Most probably, it was captured into the trailing
Trojan cloud no earlier than 203kyr ago, and it will not keep this identity no
later than 165kyr in future. Based on the statistics on our orbital
simulations, we argue that this object is more like a scattered Kuiper belt
object. On the contrary, the orbit of asteroid 2008 LC18 is much more stable.
Among the clone orbits spread within the orbital uncertainties, a considerable
portion of clones may survive on the L5 tadpole orbits for 4Gyr. The strong
dependence of the stability on the semimajor axis and resonant angle suggests
that further observations are badly needed to confine the orbit in the stable
region. We also discuss the implications of the existence and dynamics of these
two trailing Trojans on the Solar system history.

interference and the amount of which-way information that one can obtain, in
the context of such modified experiments. As the wave-aspect can only be
revealed by an ensemble of detections, we argue that in such experiments, a
single detection can contribute only to one subensemble, corresponding to
either wave-aspect or particle aspect. This way, each detected particle behaves
either as particle or as wave, never both, and Bohr's complementarity is fully
respected.

a superconducting state of single crystals of
Ba$_{0.65}$Na$_{0.35}$Fe$_2$As$_2$. The isothermal magnetic field ($H||c$ axis)
dependent magnetization ($M$) loops exhibit a second peak (SP) or `fishtail
effect', as well as remarkable flux jumps at low temperatures. The critical
current density $J_c$ obtained from the $M(H)$ loops is rather high, of the
order of 10$^6$ A/cm$^2$. The analysis of the temperature and field dependent
$J_c$ implies that high $J_c$ is mainly due to collective (weak) pinning of
vortices by dense microscopic point defects with some contribution from a
strong pinning mechanism. Pronounced magnetic instabilities in terms of flux
jumps depend strongly on temperature as well on the field sweep rate. The field
for first flux jump as calculated from an adiabatic model, however, is much
lower than the experimentally observed values, and this enhanced stability is
attributed to a flux creep phenomenon. The analysis of field dependent magnetic
relaxation data additionally supports a collective pinning model. The data
further suggests that SP in M(H) is likely related to crossover in creep
dynamics from elastic to plastic mechanism. We have constructed the vortex
phase diagram on field-temperature plane.

interacting quantum dot connected to leads in the presence of oscillating gate
voltages. The energy dissipated is characterized by the charge relaxation
resistance, which under the loose assumption of Fermi liquid behavior at low
energy, is shown to depend only on static charge susceptibilities. The
predictions of the scattering theory are recovered in the noninteracting limit
while the effect of interactions is simply to replace densities of states by
charge susceptibilities in formulas. In order to substantiate the Fermi liquid
picture in the case of a quantum RC geometry, we apply a renormalization group
analysis and derive the low-energy Hamiltonian for two specific models: the
Anderson and the Coulomb blockade models. The Anderson model is shown, using a
field theoretical approach based on Barnes slave bosons, to map onto the Kondo
model. We recover the well-known expression of the Kondo temperature for the
asymmetric Anderson model and compute the charge susceptibility. The Barnes
slave bosons are extended to the Coulomb blockade model where the
renormalization-group analysis can be carried out perturbatively up to zero
energy. All calculations agree with the Fermi liquid nature of the low-energy
fixed point and satisfy the Friedel sum rule.

given by a constituent quark model that describes well the meson phenomenology

154 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that were detected by satellite-based gamma-ray
experiments in 2009-2010, during the sixth LIGO science run and the second and
third Virgo science runs. We perform two distinct searches: a modeled search
for coalescences of either two neutron stars or a neutron star and black hole;
and a search for generic, unmodeled gravitational-wave bursts. We find no
evidence for gravitational-wave counterparts, either with any individual GRB in
this sample or with the population as a whole. For all GRBs we place lower
bounds on the distance to the progenitor, under the optimistic assumption of a
gravitational-wave emission energy of 10^-2 M c^2 at 150 Hz, with a median
limit of 17 Mpc. For short hard GRBs we place exclusion distances on binary
neutron star and neutron star-black hole progenitors, using astrophysically
motivated priors on the source parameters, with median values of 16 Mpc and 28
Mpc respectively. These distance limits, while significantly larger than for a
search that is not aided by GRB satellite observations, are not large enough to
expect a coincidence with a GRB. However, projecting these exclusions to the
sensitivities of Advanced LIGO and Virgo, which should begin operation in 2015,
we find that the detection of gravitational waves associated with GRBs will
become quite possible.

traditional techniques are based on the calculation of the electrostatic
potential by solving the Poisson equation, in the new approach the electric
field is calculated by solving the Ampere's law. When the Ampere's law is
discretized explicitly in time, the electric field values on the mesh are
simply updated from the previous values. In this way, the electrostatic solver
becomes an embarrassingly parallel problem, making the algorithm extremely
scalable and suitable for exascale computing platforms. An implementation of a
one dimensional PM code is presented to show that the proposed method produces
correct results, and it is a very promising algorithm for exascale PM
simulations.

in the three-dimensional problem and the stability and interaction of both line

small amplitude, and the dynamics of the solitary waves is complex involving
nonlinear focussing of wave packets, quasi-elastic collisions, and the
generation of propagating, spatially localised, time-periodic structures
(breathers).

is that the effective potential for perturbations forms an infinite wall at

present paper. As a result, we have shown that all configurations under study

characterise the nature of this material. Second, by fitting broadband near to

the star is surrounded by an irradiated rim heated to a temperature of
3800-5500 K, along with a viscous disk component at an inner temperature of 750

the chiral indices (m, n) for each peak are identified. Peaks shift from their
positions in air when different pressure media are added - water, hexane,
sulphuric acid - and when the nanotubes are unbundled in water with surfactant
and sonication. The shift is about 2 - 3 cm-1 in RBM frequency, but
unexpectedly large in resonance energy, being spread over up to 100meV for a
given peak. This contrasts with the effect of pressure. The shift of the peaks
of semiconducting nanotubes in water under pressure is orthogonal to the shift
from air to water. This permits the separation of the effects of the pressure

literature. Some argue that it is a bimodal distribution, implying that there
are two separate QSO populations (normally referred to as 'radio-loud' and
'radio-quiet'), while others claim it forms a more continuous distribution
characteristic of a single population. We use deep observations at 20 GHz to
investigate whether the distribution is bimodal at high radio frequencies.
Carrying out this study at high radio frequencies has an advantage over
previous studies as the radio emission comes predominantly from the core of the
AGN, hence probes the most recent activity. Studies carried out at lower
frequencies are dominated by the large scale lobes where the emission is built
up over longer timescales (10^7-10^8 yrs), thereby confusing the sample. Our
sample comprises 874 X-ray selected QSOs that were observed as part of the 6dF
Galaxy Survey. Of these, 40% were detected down to a 3 sigma detection limit of
0.2-0.5 mJy.
  No evidence of bimodality is seen in either the 20 GHz luminosity
distribution or in the distribution of the R_20 parameter: the ratio of the
radio to optical luminosities traditionally used to classify objects as being
either radio-loud or radio-quiet. Previous results have claimed that at low
radio luminosities, star formation processes can dominate the radio emission
observed in QSOs. We attempt to investigate these claims by stacking the
undetected sources at 20 GHz and discuss the limitations in carrying out this
analysis. However, if the radio emission was solely due to star formation
processes, we calculate that this corresponds to star formation rates ranging
from ~10 solar masses/yr to ~2300 solar masses/yr.

mechanics of spatially constant fields is given using the method of minimal
embedding of SU(2) into SU(3) by Kihlberg and Marnelius. Using a canonical
transformation of the gluon fields to a new set of adapted coordinates (a
non-standard type polar decomposition), which Abelianizes the Non-Abelian Gauss
law constraints to be implemented, the corresponding unconstrained Hamiltonian
and total angular momentum are derived. This reduces the colored spin-1 gluons
to unconstrained colorless spin-0, spin-1, spin-2 and spin-3 glueball fields.
The obtained unconstrained Hamiltonian is then rewritten into a form, which
separates the rotational from the scalar degrees of freedom. It is shown that
the chromomagnetic potential has classical zero-energy valleys for two
arbitrarily large classical glueball fields, which are the unconstrained
analogs of the well-known ""constant Abelian fields"". On the quantum level,
practically all glueball excitation energy is expected to go into the increase
of the strengths of these two fields. Finally, as an outlook, the
straightforward generalization to low energy SU(3) Yang-Mills quantum theory in
analogy to the SU(2) case is indicated, leading to an expansion in the number
of spatial derivatives, equivalent to a strong coupling expansion, with the
SU(3) Yang-Mills quantum mechanics constituting the leading order.

methods for recovering a discrete signal or image from data that are corrupted
by additive Gaussian white noise. The basic idea is to select a frame of
analyzing elements that separates the data in few large coefficients due to the
signal and many small coefficients mainly due to the noise \epsilon_n. Removing
all data coefficients being in magnitude below a certain threshold yields a
reconstruction of the original signal. In order to properly balance the amount
of noise to be removed and the relevant signal features to be kept, a precise
understanding of the statistical properties of thresholding is important. For
that purpose we derive the asymptotic distribution of max_{\omega \in \Omega_n}
|<\phi_\omega^n,\epsilon_n>| for a wide class of redundant frames
(\phi_\omega^n: \omega \in \Omega_n}. Based on our theoretical results we give
a rationale for universal extreme value thresholding techniques yielding
asymptotically sharp confidence regions and smoothness estimates corresponding
to prescribed significance levels. The results cover many frames used in
imaging and signal recovery applications, such as redundant wavelet systems,
curvelet frames, or unions of bases. We show that `generically' a standard
Gumbel law results as it is known from the case of orthonormal wavelet bases.
However, for specific highly redundant frames other limiting laws may occur. We
indeed verify that the translation invariant wavelet transform shows a
different asymptotic behaviour.

the innermost LIRG nuclear regions, such as SNe and SN remnants, as well as AGN
buried deep in the LIRG nuclei. We studied the LIRG IC883 aiming at: (i)
investigating its (circum-)nuclear regions using the e-EVN at 5GHz, and
e-MERLIN at 6.9GHz, complemented by archival VLBI data; (ii) detecting at radio
frequencies the two recently reported circumnuclear SNe 2010cu and 2011hi,
which were discovered by near-IR (NIR) adaptive optics observations of IC883;
and (iii) further investigating the nature of SN2011hi at NIR by means of
observations with Gemini-North. The circumnuclear regions traced by e-MERLIN at
6.9GHz have an extension of ~1kpc, and show a striking double-sided structure,
which very likely corresponds to a warped rotating ring, in agreement with
previous studies. Our e-EVN observations at 5GHz and complementary archival
VLBI data at 5GHz and 8.4GHz, reveal the presence of various milliarcsec
compact components in the nucleus of IC883. A single compact source, an AGN
candidate, dominates the emission at both nuclear and circumnuclear scales, as
imaged with the e-EVN and e-MERLIN, respectively. The other milliarcsec
components are very suggestive of ongoing nuclear CCSN activity. Our e-EVN
observations also resulted in upper limits to the radio luminosity of the two
SNe in IC883 recently discovered at NIR. We refine the classification of
SN2011hi as a Type IIP SN according to our latest Gemini-North epoch from 2012,
in agreement with a low-luminosity radio SN nature. We estimate a CCSN rate

backgrounds from other detector materials subdominant to the R8778

been screened, with benchmark isotope counts measured at <0.4 238U / <0.3 232Th
/ <8.3 40K / 2.0+-0.2 60Co mBq/PMT. This represents a large reduction, equal to
a change of \times 1/24 238U / \times 1/9 232Th / \times 1/8 40K per PMT,
between R8778 and R11410 MOD, concurrent with a doubling of the photocathode
surface area (4.5 cm to 6.4 cm diameter). 60Co measurements are comparable
between the PMTs, but can be significantly reduced in future R11410 MOD units
through further material selection. Assuming PMT activity equal to the measured
90% upper limits, Monte Carlo estimates indicate that replacement of R8778 PMTs
with R11410 MOD PMTs will change LUX PMT electron recoil background
contributions by a factor of \times1/25 after further material selection for
60Co reduction, and nuclear recoil backgrounds by a factor of \times 1/36. The
strong reduction in backgrounds below the measured R8778 levels makes the
R11410 MOD a very competitive technology for use in large-scale liquid xenon

there is as yet no consensus as to which -- if any -- are operative in nature.
Any theory of brown dwarf formation must explain the observed statistics of
brown dwarfs. These statistics are limited by selection effects, but they are
becoming increasingly discriminating. In particular, it appears (a) that brown
dwarfs that are secondaries to Sun-like stars tend to be on wide orbits, $a\ga
100\,{\rm AU}$ (the Brown Dwarf Desert), and (b) that these brown dwarfs have a
significantly higher chance of being in a close ($a\la 10\,{\rm AU}$) binary
system with another brown dwarf than do brown dwarfs in the field. This then
raises the issue of whether these brown dwarfs have formed {\it in situ}, i.e.
by fragmentation of a circumstellar disc; or have formed elsewhere and
subsequently been captured. We present numerical simulations of the purely
gravitational interaction between a close brown-dwarf binary and a Sun-like
star. These simulations demonstrate that such interactions have a negligible
chance ($<0.001$) of leading to the close brown-dwarf binary being captured by
the Sun-like star. Making the interactions dissipative by invoking the
hydrodynamic effects of attendant discs might alter this conclusion. However,
in order to explain the above statistics, this dissipation would have to favour
the capture of brown-dwarf binaries over single brown-dwarfs, and we present
arguments why this is unlikely. The simplest inference is that most brown-dwarf
binaries -- and therefore possibly also most single brown dwarfs -- form by
fragmentation of circumstellar discs around Sun-like protostars, with some of
them subsequently being ejected into the field.

consequences on the evolution of the initial data and the calculus of

demand expressed as a complex number, and there is a limit on the magnitude of

knapsack problem (C-KP), a new variation of the traditional knapsack problem,
where each item is associated with a demand as a complex number, rather than a
real number often interpreted as weight or size of the item. While keeping the
same goal as to maximize the sum of values of the selected items, we put the
capacity limit on the magnitude of the sum of satisfied demands. For C-KP, we
prove its inapproximability by FPTAS (unless P = NP), as well as presenting a
(1/2-epsilon)-approximation algorithm. Furthermore, we investigate the selfish
multi-agent setting where each agent is in charge of one item, and an agent may
misreport the demand and value of his item for his own interest. We show a
simple way to adapt our approximation algorithm to be monotone, which is
sufficient for the existence of incentive compatible payments such that no
agent has an incentive to misreport. Our results shed insight on the design of

In junctions with high doping concentrations in the nanowire Josephson
supercurrent values up to 100\,nA are found. Owing to the use of Nb as
superconductor the Josephson coupling persists at temperatures up to 4K. In all

proximity effect in ultra-small Josephson junctions. For the low-doped

the large number of phase-coherent channels due to the large superconducting

adapt their consumption strategy to new information about their mortality rate

optimal consumption rate and focus on the impact of mortality rate uncertainty
vs. simple lifetime uncertainty -- assuming the actuarial survival curves are
initially identical -- in the retirement phase where this risk plays a greater
role.
  In addition to deriving and numerically solving the PDE for the optimal
consumption rate, our main general result is that when utility preferences are
logarithmic the initial consumption rates are identical. But, in a CRRA
framework in which the coefficient of relative risk aversion is greater
(smaller) than one, the consumption rate is higher (lower) and a stochastic
force of mortality does make a difference.
  That said, numerical experiments indicate that even for non-logarithmic
preferences, the stochastic mortality effect is relatively minor from the
individual's perspective. Our results should be relevant to researchers
interested in calibrating the lifecycle model as well as those who provide

the broad ($\sim500$kms$^{-1}$) symmetric line wings on the HI Brackett series
lines are due to Stark broadening or electron scattering, rather than pure
Doppler broadening due to high speed motion. The results are consistent with
the presence of a very dense circumstellar environment. In addition, many of
these lines show evidence for weak line self-absorption, suggestive of a wind
or disc-wind origin for that part of the absorbing material. The weakness of
the self-absorption suggests a large opening angle for such an outflow. We also
study the fluorescent 1.688$\mu$m FeII line, which is sensitive to dense
material. We fitted a Keplerian disc model to this line, and find reasonable
fits in all bar one case, in agreement with previous finding for classical Be
stars that fluorescent iron transitions are reasonable disc tracers. Overall
the picture is one in which these stars still have accretion discs, with a very
dense inner circumstellar environment which may be tracing either the inner
regions of a disc, or of a stellar wind, and in which ionised outflow is also
present. The similarity with lower mass stars is striking, suggesting that at
least in this mass range they form in a similar fashion.

fewer copies of the state, i.e., the sample complexity of tomography decreases
with the rank. Second, we show that unknown low-rank states can be
reconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from
compressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli
measurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions
about the unknown state.
  We give a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the
restricted isometry property (RIP) for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we
obtain near-optimal error bounds, for the realistic situation where the data
contains noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank
with decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper-bounds on the sample complexity
of compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample
complexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements.
  Using numerical simulations, we compare the performance of two compressed
sensing estimators with standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). We find
that, given comparable experimental resources, the compressed sensing
estimators consistently produce higher-fidelity state reconstructions than MLE.
In addition, the use of an incomplete set of measurements leads to faster
classical processing with no loss of accuracy.
