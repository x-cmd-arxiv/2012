candidates accessible to spectroscopy. Only one J-dropout source was selected
in this field fulfilling the color and magnitude criteria. This source was
recently confirmed as a mid-z interloper based on X-Shooter spectroscopy. The
depth and the area covered by our survey are well suited to set strong
constraints on the bright-end of the galaxy luminosity function and hence on
the star formation history at very high redshift. The non-detection of reliable
J-dropout sources over the ~36arcmin2 field of view towards A2667 was used to
carefully determine the lens-corrected effective volume and the corresponding
upper-limit on the density of sources. The strongest limit is obtained for
Phi(M_{1500}=-21.4+/-0.50)<6.70x10^{-6}Mpc^{-3}mag^{-1} at z~9. A
maximum-likelihood fit of the luminosity function using all available data
points including the present new result yields M*>-19.7 with fixed alpha=-1.74

should be rho_{SFR}<5.97x10^{-3}M_{solar}/yr/Mpc^{3} at z~9. These results are
in good agreement with the most recent estimates already published in this
range of redshift and for this luminosity domain. This new result confirms the
decrease in the density of luminous galaxies at very high-redshift, hence
providing strong constraints for the design of future surveys aiming to explore
the very high-redshift Universe.

G156.2+5.7 based on six pointing observations with Suzaku. The remnant's large
extent (100$\arcmin$ in diameter) allows us to investigate its radial structure
in the northwestern and eastern directions from the apparent center. The X-ray
spectra were well fit with a two-component non-equilibrium ionization model
representing the swept-up interstellar medium (ISM) and the metal-rich ejecta.
We found prominent central concentrations of Si, S and Fe from the ejecta
component; the lighter elements of O, Ne and Mg were distributed more
uniformly. The temperature of the ISM component suggests a slow shock (610-960
km s$^{-1}$), hence the remnant's age is estimated to be 7,000-15,000 yr,
assuming its distance to be $\sim$1.1 kpc. G156.2+5.7 has also been thought to
emit hard, non-thermal X-rays, despite being considerably older than any other
such remnant. In response to a recent discovery of a background cluster of
galaxies (2XMM J045637.2+522411), we carefully excluded its contribution, and
reexamined the origin of the hard X-ray emission. We found that the residual
hard X-ray emission is consistent with the expected level of the cosmic X-ray
background. Thus, no robust evidence for the non-thermal emission was obtained
from G156.2+5.7. These results are consistent with the picture of an evolved
SNR.

strategy to work around this obstacle was to develop numerical methods based on
the well-known theoretical renormalization group. In recent years, it was
realized that quantum states engineered via numerical renormalization allow a
variational representation in terms of a tensor network picture. The discovery
provided a further boost to the effectiveness of these techniques, not only due
to the increased flexibility and manipulability, but also because tensor
network states embed a direct interface to the entanglement they carry, so that
one can directly address many-body quantum correlations within these
variational ansatz states. This lead to the application of several numerical
tools, originally developed in the field of quantum-information, to approach
condensed matter problems.

winds and present a uniform analysis using Chandra grating spectra. The high
quality grating spectra facilitate the characterization of the outflow
velocity, ionization and column density of the absorbing gas. We find that the
kinetic power of the winds scales with increasing bolometric luminosity as
log(L_wind) \propto (1.58 \pm 0.07) log(L_Bol). This means that SMBH may be
more efficient than stellar-mass black holes in launching winds. In addition,
the simplicity of the scaling may suggest common driving mechanisms across the
mass scale. For comparison, we next examine jet production, estimating jet
power based on the energy required to inflate local bubbles. The jet relation
is log(L_Jet)\propto (1.18\pm0.24) log(L_Bol). The energetics of the bubble
associated with Cygnus X-1 are particularly difficult to determine, and the
bubble could be a background SNR. If we exclude Cygnus X-1, then the jets
follow a consistent relation to the winds within errors but with a higher
normalization, log(L_Jet) \propto (1.34 \pm 0.50) log(L_Bol). The formal
consistency in the wind and jet scaling relations suggests that a common
launching mechanism may drive both flows; magnetic processes are viable
possibilities. We also examine winds with especially high velocities, v >
0.01c. These ultra-fast outflows tend to resemble the jets more than the winds,
indicating we may be observing a regime in which winds become jets. This study
allows for the total power from black hole accretion, both mechanical and
radiative, to be characterized in a simple manner and suggests a possible
connection between winds and jets. Finally, we find at low Eddington fractions,
the jet power is dominant, and at high Eddington fractions the wind power is
dominant.

most distant HII regions yet discovered. We find that 61% of HRDS sources are
located at the far distance, 31% at the tangent point distance, and only 7% at
the near distance. ""Bubble"" HII regions are not preferentially at the near
distance (as was assumed previously) but average 10kpc from the Sun. The HRDS
nebulae, when combined with a large sample of HII regions with previously known
distances, show evidence of spiral structure in two circular arc segments of
mean Galactocentric radii of 4.25 and 6.0kpc. We perform a thorough uncertainty
analysis to analyze the effect of using different rotation curves, streaming
motions, and a change to the Solar circular rotation speed. The median distance
uncertainty for our sample of HII regions is only 0.5kpc, or 5%. This is
significantly less than the median difference between the near and far
kinematic distances, 6kpc. The basic Galactic structure results are unchanged
after considering these sources of uncertainty.

continuum survey of all z<1 GRB hosts in The Optically Unbiased GRB Host

none in the TOUGH sample), increasing the number of radio-detected GRB hosts
from two to five. The star formation rate (SFR) for the GRB 021211 host of ~825
Mo yr^-1, the highest ever reported for a GRB host, places it in the category
of ultraluminous infrared galaxies. We found that at least 63% of GRB hosts
have SFR < 100 Mo yr^-1 and at most 8% can have SFR > 500 Mo yr^-1. For the
undetected hosts the mean radio flux (<35 uJy 3sigma) corresponds to an average
SFR < 15 Mo yr^-1. Moreover, ~88% of the z<1 GRB hosts have ultraviolet dust
attenuation A_UV < 6.7 mag (visual attenuation A_V < 3 mag). Hence we did not
find evidence for large dust obscuration in a majority of GRB hosts. Finally,
we found that the distributions of SFRs and A_UV of GRB hosts are consistent
with those of Lyman break galaxies, Halpha emitters at similar redshifts and of
galaxies from cosmological simulations. The similarity of the GRB population
with other star-forming galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that GRBs, a
least at z<1, trace a large fraction of all star formation, and are therefore
less biased indicators than once thought.

(GLF) estimators. Using a cluster expansion of the density field, we show how,
for both volume and flux limited samples, the GLF estimates are covariant. The
covariance matrix can be decomposed into three pieces: a diagonal term arising
from Poisson noise; a sample variance term arising from large-scale structure
in the survey volume; an occupancy covariance term arising due to galaxies of
different luminosities inhabiting the same cluster. To evaluate the theory one
needs: the mass function and bias of clusters, and the conditional luminosity
function (CLF). We use a semi-analytic model (SAM) galaxy catalogue from the
Millennium run N-body simulation and the CLF of Yang et al. (2003) to explore
these effects. The GLF estimates from the SAM and the CLF qualitatively
reproduce results from the 2dFGRS. We also measure the luminosity dependence of
clustering in the SAM and find reasonable agreement with 2dFGRS results for
bright galaxies. However, for fainter galaxies, L<L*, the SAM overpredicts the
relative bias by ~10-20%. We use the SAM data to estimate the errors in the GLF
estimates for a volume limited survey of volume V~0.13 [Gpc/h]^3. We find that
different luminosity bins are highly correlated: for L<L* the correlation
coefficient is r>0.5. Our theory is in good agreement with these measurements.
These strong correlations can be attributed to sample variance. For a
flux-limited survey of similar volume, the estimates are only slightly less
correlated. We explore the importance of these effects for GLF model parameter
estimation. We show that neglecting to take into account the bin-to-bin
covariances can lead to significant systematic errors in best-fit parameters.

dynamical state of the dense gas surrounding the AGN. Analysis of the

arise from beam smearing of the velocity gradient. The observed morphological
and kinematic parameters (dimensions, major axis position angle, red and blue
channel separation, and integrated line width) are well reproduced by a thick
disk, where the emitting dense gas has a large intrinsic dispersion (20-40
km/s), implying that it exists at significant scale heights (25-30% of the disk
radius). To put the observed kinematics in the context of the starburst and AGN
evolution, we estimate the Toomre Q parameter. We find this is always greater
than the critical value, i.e. Q is above the limit such that the gas is stable
against rapid star formation. This is supported by the lack of direct evidence,
in these 4 Seyfert galaxies, for on-going star formation close around the AGN.
Instead, any current star formation tends to be located in a circumnuclear
ring. We conclude that the physical conditions are indeed not suited to star
formation within the central ~100 pc.

between the star formation activity of massive (~10^{11.4}\msol) central
galaxies, their stellar masses, and the large-scale (~10 Mpc) environments of
their group-mass (~10^{13.6}\msol) dark matter halos. Probing the redshift
range z=[0.2,1.0], our measurements come from two independent sources: an X-ray
detected group catalog and constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation
derived from a combination of clustering and weak lensing statistics. At z=1,
we find that the stellar mass in star-forming centrals is a factor of two less
than in passive centrals at the same halo mass. This implies that the presence
or lack of star formation in group-scale centrals cannot be a stochastic
process. By z=0, the offset reverses, probably as a result of the different
growth rates of these objects. A similar but weaker trend is observed when
dividing the sample by morphology rather than star formation. Remarkably, we
find that star-forming centrals at z~1 live in groups that are significantly
more clustered on 10 Mpc scales than similar mass groups hosting passive
centrals. We discuss this signal in the context of halo assembly and recent
simulations, suggesting that star-forming centrals prefer halos with higher
angular momentum and/or formation histories with more recent growth; such halos
are known to evolve in denser large-scale environments. If confirmed, this

order by order in the derivative expansion by requiring that its divergence is
non-negative. In the framework of the fluid/gravity correspondence, the entropy
current of the fluid is mapped to a vector density associated with the event
horizon of the dual geometry. In this work we consider the local horizon
entropy current for higher-curvature gravitational theories proposed in
arXiv:1202.2469, whose flux for stationary solutions is the Wald entropy. In
non-stationary cases this definition contains ambiguities, associated with
absence of a preferred timelike Killing vector. We argue that these ambiguities
can be eliminated in general by choosing the vector that generates the subset
of diffeomorphisms preserving a natural gauge condition on the bulk metric. We
study a dynamical, perturbed Rindler horizon in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity
setting and compute the bulk dual solution to second order in fluid gradients.
We show that the corresponding unambiguous entropy current at second order has
a manifestly non-negative divergence.

Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BH-XRBs). In the past few years evidence of
such correspondence include similarities in the broadband shape of the X-ray
variability power spectra, with characteristic bend times-scales scaling with
mass. We have performed a uniform analysis of the power spectrum densities
(PSDs) of 104 nearby (z<0.4) AGN using 209 XMM-Newton/pn observations. The PSDs
have been estimated in three energy bands: 0.2-10, 0.2-2, and 2-10 keV. The
sample comprises 61 Type-1 AGN, 21 Type-2 AGN, 15 NLSy1, and 7 BLLACS. We have
fitted each PSD to two models: (1) a single power-law model and (2) a bending
power-law model. Among the entire sample, 72% show significant variability in
at least one of the three bands tested. A high percentage of low-luminosity AGN
do not show any significant variability. The PSD of the majority of the
variable AGN was well described by a simple power-law with a mean index of 2.
In 15 sources we found that the bending power law model was preferred with a
mean slope of 3 and a mean bend frequency of 2.E-04 Hz. Only KUG1031+398
(REJ1034+396) shows evidence for quasi-periodic oscillations. The `fundamental
plane' relating variability timescale, black hole mass, and luminosity is
demonstrated using the new X-ray timing results presented here together with a
compilation of the previously detected timescales from the literature. Both
quantitative (i.e. scaling with BH mass) and qualitative (overall PSD shapes)
found in this sample of AGN are in agreement with the expectations for the
SMBHs and BH-XRBs being the same phenomenon scaled-up with the size of the BH.
The steep PSD slopes above the high frequency bend bear a closer resemblance to
those of the `soft/thermal dominated' BH-XRB states than other states.

antecedents and also improve on the latter by being valid under the whole class

mass profiles of halos as well as the formation and evolution of the massive
galaxies that they host. The task is observationally challenging because we
cannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or X-ray
emission from hot plasma are imperfect. In this paper we quantify the
consequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129
X-ray selected galaxy groups in the COSMOS field with redshifts 0<z<1 and halo
masses in the range 10^13 - 10^14 M_sun. By measuring the stacked lensing
signal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest member
galaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the X-ray centroid), we
determine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. In this
sample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the X-ray centroids trace
the center of mass to <~75 kpc, while the X-ray position and centroids based on
the mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to the
statistical uncertainties in their positions (typically ~50-150 kpc).
Approximately 30% of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiple
bright or massive galaxies, and these groups show disturbed mass profiles that
are not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems.
We find that halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by
5-30% if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is not
addressed.

  We present, and make publicly available, a set of 672 wind-type (WT)
synthetic spectra, obtained from the expanding NLTE SSS models introduced in
Van Rossum 2010 with the PHOENIX stellar atmosphere code. The set presented in
this paper is limited to solar abundances with the aim to focus on the basic
model parameters and their effect on the spectra, providing the basis upon
which abundance effects can be studied using a much bigger non-solar set in the
next paper in this series.
  We fit the WT spectra to the five grating spectra taken in the SSS phase of
nova V4743 Sgr 2003 as an example application of the WT models. Within the
limits of solar abundances we demonstrate that the following parameters are
constrained by the data (in order of decreasing accuracy): column density N_H,
bolometric luminosity L_bol, effective temperature T_eff, white dwarf radius R,
wind asymptotic velocity v_inf, and the mass-loss rate M_dot. The models are
also sensitive to the assumed white dwarf mass M_wd but the effect on the
spectra can largely be compensated by the other model parameters. The WT
spectra with solar abundances fit the data better than abundance optimized
hydro-static models.

presented as an alternative to the two established techniques, dynamic light
scattering on liposome suspension, and electrical measurements on planar lipid
bilayers. In the described technique, an individual GUV is transferred using a
micropipette from a sucrose/glucose solution into an isomolar solution
containing the solute under investigation. Throughout the experiment, vesicle
cross-section is monitored and recorded using a digital camera mounted on a
phase-contrast microscope. Using a least-squares procedure for circle fitting,
vesicle radius R is computed from the recorded images of vesicle cross-section.
Two methods for determining membrane permeability from the obtained R(t)
dependence are described: the first one uses the slope of R(t) for a spherical
GUV, and the second one the R(t) dependence around the transition point at
which a flaccid vesicle transforms into a spherical one. We demonstrate that
both methods give consistent estimates for membrane permeability.

a new search for luminous galaxies at redshifts z ~ 7. The unique
multi-wavelength dataset provided by VISTA, CFHT, Subaru, HST and Spitzer over
a common area of 1 deg^2 has allowed us to select galaxy candidates at z > 6.5
by searching first for Y+J-detected (< 25 AB mag) objects which are undetected
in the CFHT+HST optical data. This sample was then refined using a photometric
redshift fitting code, enabling the rejection of lower-redshift galaxy
contaminants and cool galactic M,L,T dwarf stars.The final result of this
process is a small sample of (at most) ten credible galaxy candidates at z >
6.5 which we present in this paper. The first four of these appear to be robust
galaxies at z > 6.5, and fitting to their stacked SED yields z = 6.98+-0.05
with a stellar mass M* = 5x10^9 Msun, and rest-frame UV spectral slope beta =
-2.0+-0.2. The next three are also good candidates for z > 6.5 galaxies, but
the possibility that they are low-redshift galaxies or dwarf stars cannot be
excluded. Our final subset of three additional candidates is afflicted not only
by potential dwarf-star contamination, but also contains objects likely to lie
at redshifts just below z = 6.5. We show that the three even-brighter z > 7
galaxy candidates reported in the COSMOS field by Capak et al. (2011) in fact
all lie at z ~ 1.5-3.5. Consequently the new z ~ 7 galaxies reported here are
the first credible z ~ 7 Lyman-break galaxies discovered in the COSMOS field
and, as the most UV-luminous discovered to date at these redshifts, are prime
targets for deep follow-up spectroscopy. We explore their physical properties,
and briefly consider the implications of their inferred number density for the
form of the galaxy luminosity function at z = 7.

efficient assignment of virtual machines to physical host machines in a network
cloud, so that the number of occupied hosts is minimized.
  There are multiple input flows of different type customers, with a customer
mean service time depending on its type. There is infinite number of servers. A
server packing {\em configuration} is the vector $k=\{k_i\}$, where $k_i$ is
the number of type $i$ customers the server ""contains"". Packing constraints
must be observed, namely there is a fixed finite set of configurations $k$ that
are allowed. Service times of different customers are independent; after a
service completion, each customer leaves its server and the system. Each new
arriving customer is placed for service immediately; it can be placed into a
server already serving other customers (as long as packing constraints are not
violated), or into an idle server.
  We consider a simple parsimonious real-time algorithm, called {\em Greedy},
which attempts to minimize the increment of the objective function $\sum_k
X_k^{1+\alpha}$, $\alpha>0$, caused by each new assignment; here $X_k$ is the
number of servers in configuration $k$. (When $\alpha$ is small, $\sum_k
X_k^{1+\alpha}$ approximates the total number $\sum_k X_k$ of occupied
servers.) Our main results show that certain versions of the Greedy algorithm
are {\em asymptotically optimal}, in the sense of minimizing $\sum_k
X_k^{1+\alpha}$ in stationary regime, as the input flow rates grow to infinity.
We also show that in the special case when the set of allowed configurations is
determined by {\em vector-packing} constraints, Greedy algorithm can work with
{\em aggregate configurations} as opposed to exact configurations $k$, thus
reducing computational complexity while preserving the asymptotic optimality.

presented.
  An axiomatic complexity measure is defined, allowing various concrete
complexity measures for definable functions to be covered. This includes common
concrete measures such as the degree of polynomials, and complexity of Pfaffian
functions.
  A generalisation of the Thom-Milnor Bound for sets defined by the conjunction
of equations and non-strict inequalities is presented, in the new context of
sets definable in o-minimal structures using the axiomatic complexity measure.
Next bounds are produced for sets defined by Boolean combinations of equations
and inequalities, through firstly considering sets defined by sign conditions,
then using this to produce results for closed sets, and then making use of a
construction to approximate any set defined by a Boolean combination of
equations and inequalities by a closed set.
  Lastly, existing results for sets defined using quantifiers on an open or
closed set are generalised, using a construction from Gabrielov and Vorobjov to
approximate any set by a compact set. This results in a method to find a
general bound for any set definable in an o-minimal structure in terms of the
axiomatic complexity measure. As a consequence for the first time an upper
bound for sub-Pfaffian sets defined by arbitrary formulae with quantifiers is
given. This bound is singly exponential if the number of quantifier
alternations is fixed.

detailed investigation of the HII region RCW175. We determined that RCW175,
which actually consists of two separate HII regions, G29.1-0.7 and G29.0-0.6,
is located at a distance of 3.2+/-0.2 kpc. Based on the observations we infer
that the more compact G29.0-0.6 is less evolved than G29.1-0.7 and was possibly
produced as a result of the expansion of G29.1-0.7 into the surrounding
interstellar medium. We compute a star formation rate for RCW175 of
(12.6+/-1.9)x10^{-5} M_{\sun}/yr, and identified 6 possible young stellar
object candidates within its vicinity. Additionally, we estimate that RCW175
contains a total dust mass of 215+/-53 M_{\sun}.
  RCW175 has previously been identified as a source of anomalous microwave
emission (AME), an excess of emission at cm wavelengths often attributed to
electric dipole radiation from the smallest dust grains. We find that the AME
previously detected in RCW175 is not correlated with the smallest dust grains
(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or small carbonaceous dust grains), but
rather with the exciting radiation field within the region. This is a similar
result to that found in the Perseus molecular cloud, another region which
harbors AME, suggesting that the radiation field may play a pivotal role in the
production of this new Galactic emission mechanism. Finally, we suggest that
these observations may hint at the importance of understanding the role played
by the major gas ions in spinning dust models.

Entanglement Entropy (TEE) using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group

entangled state, from amongst the quasi-degenerate ground states in a
topological phase. This proposal both explains the success of this method, and
the absence of ground state degeneracy found in prior DMRG sightings of
topological phases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the calculational
procedure by obtaining the TEE for several microscopic models, with an accuracy
of order $10^{-3}$ when the circumference of the cylinder is around ten times
the correlation length. As an example, we definitively show the ground state of
the quantum $S=1/2$ antiferromagnet on the kagom\'e lattice is a topological

storage management for a power consuming entity. The entity's objective is to
find an optimal control policy for deciding how much load to consume, how much
power to purchase from/sell to the power grid, and how to use the finite
capacity energy storage device and renewable energy, to minimize his average
cost, being the disutility due to load- shedding and cost for purchasing power.
Due to the coupling effect of the finite size energy storage, such problems are
challenging and are typically tackled using dynamic programming, which is often
complex in computation and requires substantial statistical information of the
system dynamics. We instead develop a low-complexity algorithm called Demand
Response with Energy Storage Management (DR-ESM). DR-ESM does not require any
statistical knowledge of the system dynamics, including the renewable energy
and the power prices. It only requires the entity to solve a small convex
optimization program with 6 variables and 6 linear constraints every time for
decision making. We prove that DR-ESM is able to achieve near-optimal
performance and explicitly compute the required energy storage size.

spectrograph, we present first observations for a set of 14 early-type galaxies
in the core of the Coma cluster. Our data consist of I- and z-band spatially
resolved spectroscopy obtained with the Oxford SWIFT spectrograph, combined
with r-band photometry from the SDSS archive for 14 early- type galaxies. We
derive spatially resolved kinematics for all objects from observations of the
calcium triplet absorption features at \sim 8500 {AA} . Using this kinematic
information we classify galaxies as either Fast Rotators or Slow Rotators. We
compare the fraction of fast and slow rotators in our sample, representing the
densest environment in the nearby Universe, to results from the ATLAS3D survey,
finding the slow rotator fraction is \sim 50 per cent larger in the core of the
Coma cluster than in the Virgo cluster or field, a 1.2 {\sigma} increase given
our selection criteria. Comparing our sample to the Virgo cluster core only
(which is 24 times less dense than the Coma core) we find no evidence of an
increase in the slow rotator fraction. Combining measurements of the effective
velocity dispersion {\sigma_e} with the photometric data we determine the
Fundamental Plane for our sample of galaxies. We find the use of the average
velocity dispersion within 1 effective radius, {\sigma_e}, reduces the
residuals by 13 per cent with respect to comparable studies using central
velocity dispersions, consistent with other recent integral field Fundamental
Plane determinations.

free-energy surface relative to a set of appropriately chosen collective
variables. In standard metadynamics the free-energy surface is filled by the
addition of Gaussian potentials of pre-assigned and typically diagonal
covariance. Asymptotically the free-energy surface is proportional to the bias
deposited. Here we consider the possibility of using Gaussians whose variance
is adjusted on the fly to the local properties of the free-energy surface. We
suggest two different prescriptions: one is based on the local diffusivity and
the other on the local geometrical properties. We further examine the problem
of extracting the free-energy surface when using adaptive Gaussians. We show
that the standard relation between the bias and the free energy does not hold.
In the limit of narrow Gaussians an explicit correction can be evaluated. In
the general case we propose to use instead a relation between bias and free
energy borrowed from umbrella sampling. This relation holds for all kinds of
incrementally deposited bias. We illustrate on the case of alanine dipeptide
the advantage of using adaptive Gaussians in conjunction with the new
free-energy estimator both in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence.

explain the confused behaviour of the system as an intermediate state between
periodic and chaotic motions. More specifically, we discuss the following two
facts: (1) If we adjust the time interval $\Delta t$ properly, figures
consisting of plotted dots at the constant time interval acquire scale
invariance under replacement of $\Delta t$ by $s\Delta t$, where $s(>1)$ is an
arbitrary real but not transcendental number. (2) We can compute values of the

approximation (a rational approximation of an irrational number).

studying the nature of unresolved star clusters in external galaxies. However,
the plethora of currently available SSP models gives rise to significant and
poorly documented systematic differences. Here we consider the outputs of the
commonly used Bruzual & Charlot and GALEV models, as well as a recently updated
SSP model suite which attempts to include the contributions of binary merger
products in the form of blue straggler stars (BS-SSP). We rederive the ages,
metallicities, extinction values and masses of 445 previously observed
globular-like clusters in M31 based on chi-square minimisation of their
spectral energy distributions with respect to these three different SSP models
and adopting a Chabrier-like stellar initial mass function. A comparison
between our new results and previous estimates of the same parameters shows
that the Bruzual & Charlot models yield the youngest ages and lowest masses,
while adoption of the BS-SSP models results in the oldest ages and highest mass
estimates. Similarly, the GALEV SSP models produce the lowest metallicities,
with the highest values resulting from the BS-SSP model suite. These trends are
caused by intrinsic differences associated with the models, and are not
significantly affected by the well-known age-metallicity degeneracy. Finally,
we note that the mass function of the massive M31 star clusters is similar to
that of the Milky Way's globular clusters, which implies that the two star
cluster systems likely formed under similar environmental conditions.

requires the development of new mathematical models, which would allow to
adequately describe the existing physical and logical connections between the
elements on its different levels, and to effectively solve the problems of
design. The paper formulates the problem of synthesis of structure of MPLS
network layered with the transport SDH network or WDM and suggests the method
of its solving. The solving is based on the application of mathematical model
of multi-layer graph. II, III, IV. Main Part During the planning of MPLS
networks it is necessary to determine the topology of both the networks: that
of transport one and that of MPLS one. This means that one needs to determine:
- what nodes of the transport network should support the MPLS functionality; -
in what way the LSR nodes should be connected via the transport network; - what
should be the bandwidth between LSR links. According to the general method for
solving the problem of synthesis of multiservice telecommunication systems with
the usage of multi-layer graphs, we have to synthesize the initial redundant .
The solving of the task above can be reduced to the finding of the multi-layer
minimum weight subgraph that provides the transfer of information flows with
the consideration of the requirements to the structure of the multilayer graph
[5] and the flows on its edges [6] observed at the applying of constraints to
the bandwidth of the edges of the multi-layer graph. V. Conclusion The paper
reduces the problem of design of multiservice telecommunication system with the
transferred flows to the problem of finding a multilayer minimum weight
subgraph with the consideration of constraints to the graph edges bandwidth. It
is shown that application of given method provide to reduce MPLS network cost
to 10 - 16 %.

of bosons, we consider helium atoms interacting through a potential model which
does not present a strong repulsion at short distances. We have used an
attractive gaussian potential to reproduce the values of the dimer binding

one of the most widely used He-He interaction, the LM2M2 potential. In

k(G) for a graph G and it has been one of the important research problems in
the study of competition graphs to characterize a graph by its competition

the constraints from the measured $\bar{B}_s^0\to PP (VV)$ decays, two (four)
restricted solutions of the parameters spaces are found. In scheme II, we find
that most of the theoretical predictions agree well with the experimental data
with single parameter $m_{g}\sim 0.5{\rm GeV}$. However, within both schemes,
${\cal B}(\bar{B}_s^0\to\phi\phi)$ are always much larger than ${\cal

exchange between the system components during a previous epoch. A high rate of
disk accretion onto the white dwarf surface resulted in temporary screening of
its magnetic field and spin-up of the white dwarf to its present spin period.
Transition of the white dwarf to the ejector state had occurred at a final
stage of the spin-up epoch as its magnetic field emerged from the accreted
plasma due to diffusion. In the frame of this scenario AE Aqr represents a

information, which is unknown at the encoder, to help the reconstruction. In
this paper, we propose and implement a new WZC structure, called residual WZC,
for the quadratic-Gaussian Wyner-Ziv problem where side information can be
arbitrarily distributed. In our two-stage residual WZC, the source is quantized
twice and the input of the second stage is the quantization error (residue) of
the first stage. The codebook of the first stage quantizer must be
simultaneously good for source and channel coding, since it also acts as a
channel code at the decoder. Stemming from the non-ideal quantization at the
encoder, a problem of channel decoding beyond capacity is identified and solved
when we design the practical decoder. Moreover,by using the modified reinforced
belief-propagation quantization algorithm, the low-density parity check code
(LDPC), whose edge degree is optimized for channel coding, also performs well
as a source code. We then implement the residual WZC by an LDPC and a low
density generator matrix code (LDGM). The simulation results show that our
practical construction approaches the Wyner-Ziv bound. Compared with previous
works, our construction can offer more design lexibility in terms of
distribution of side information and practical code rate selection.

Einstein the free-thinker did not respect the two major professors in the
Polytechnic - Heinrich Friedrich Weber and Jean Pernet - who eventually turned
on him. He felt that his beloved science had lost its appeal because Weber's
lectures did not include Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. Einstein seldom
showed up to Pernet's practical physics course. By his fourth-rightness and his
distrust of authority he had alienated his professors, especially Weber, who
apparently conceived a particular dislike of him. At the Z\""urich Polytechnic,
Einstein could not easily bring himself to study what did not interest him.
Most of his time he spent on his own studying Maxwell's theory and learning at
first hand the works of great pioneers in science and philosophy: Boltzmann,
Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, Hertz, Mach. Eventually, Einstein finished first in his
class in the intermediate exams; second after him was his note taker Grossmann.
Do not ever try Einstein's recipe for studying in college, because after
obtaining the diploma, when he sought university positions, he was rebuffed.

the neutrino oscillation results in long baseline neutrino experiments. There
are rather large uncertainties in the cross section, due to insufficient
knowledge on the role of two-body weak currents. Purpose: Determine the role of
two-body weak currents in neutrino-deuteron quasi-elastic scattering up to GeV
energies. Methods: Calculate cross sections for inclusive neutrino scattering
off deuteron induced by neutral and charge-changing weak currents, from
threshold up to GeV energies, using the Argonne $v_{18}$ potential and
consistent nuclear electroweak currents with one- and two-body terms. Results:
Two-body contributions are found to be small, and increase the cross sections
obtained with one-body currents by less than 10% over the whole range of
energies. Total cross sections obtained by describing the final two-nucleon
states with plane waves differ negligibly, for neutrino energies $\gtrsim 500$
MeV, from those in which interaction effects in these states are fully
accounted for. The sensitivity of the calculated cross sections to different
models for the two-nucleon potential and/or two-body terms in the weak current
is found to be weak. Comparing cross sections to those obtained in a naive
model in which the deuteron is taken to consist of a free proton and neutron at
rest, nuclear structure effects are illustrated to be non-negligible.
Conclusion: Contributions of two-body currents in neutrino-deuteron
quasi-elastic scattering up to GeV are found to be smaller than 10%. Finally,
it should be stressed that the results reported in this work do not include

  Boston, MA, July 2012",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many applications require data processing to be performed on individual
pieces of data which are of finite sizes, e.g., files in cloud storage units
and packets in data networks. However, traditional universal compression
solutions would not perform well over the finite-length sequences. Recently, we
proposed a framework called memory-assisted universal compression that holds a
significant promise for reducing the amount of redundant data from the
finite-length sequences. The proposed compression scheme is based on the
observation that it is possible to learn source statistics (by memorizing
previous sequences from the source) at some intermediate entities and then
leverage the memorized context to reduce redundancy of the universal
compression of finite-length sequences. We first present the fundamental gain
of the proposed memory-assisted universal source coding over conventional
universal compression (without memorization) for a single parametric source.
Then, we extend and investigate the benefits of the memory-assisted universal
source coding when the data sequences are generated by a compound source which
is a mixture of parametric sources. We further develop a clustering technique
within the memory-assisted compression framework to better utilize the memory
by classifying the observed data sequences from a mixture of parametric
sources. Finally, we demonstrate through computer simulations that the proposed
joint memorization and clustering technique can achieve up to 6-fold
improvement over the traditional universal compression technique when a mixture
of non-binary Markov sources is considered.

back and forth through a periodic lattice of pores (drift ratchet). In order to
explain the particle drift observed in such an experiment, we present an
one-dimensional deterministic model of Stokes' drag. We show that the stability
of oscillations of particle is related to their amplitude. Under appropriate
conditions, particles may drift and two mechanisms of transport are pointed
out. The first one is due to an spatio-temporal synchronization between the
fluid and particle motions. As results the velocity is locked by the ratio of
the space periodicity over the time periodicity. The direction of the transport
may switch by tuning the parameters. Noteworthy, its emergence is related to a
lattice of 2-periodic orbits but not necessary to chaotic dynamics. The second
mechanism is due to an intermittent bifurcation and leads to a slow transport
composed by long time oscillations following by a relative short transport to
the next pore. Both steps repeat in a quasi-periodic manner. The direction of
this last transport is strongly dependent on the pore geometry.

  View",,,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A very small amount of K\""ahler algebra (i.e. Clifford algebra of
differential forms) in the real plane makes x + ydxdy emerge as a factor
between the differentials of the Cartesian and polar coordinates, largely
replacing the concept of complex variable. The integration on closed curves of
closed 1-forms on multiply connected regions takes us directly to a real plane
version of the theorem of residues. One need not resort to anything like
differentiation and integration with respect to x + ydxdy. It is a matter of
algebra and integration of periodic functions. We then derive Cauchy's integral
formulas, including the ones for the derivatives. Additional complex variable
theory of general interest for phyicists is then trivial. The approach is
consistent with the Weierstrass point of view: power series expansions, even if
explicit expressions are not needed. By design, this approach cannot replace
integrations that yield complex results. These can be obtained with an approach
based on the Cauchy point of view, where the Cauchy-Riemann conditions come
first and the theorem of residues comes last.

This large $\lambda$ and pronounced anisotropy in this system are responsible
for large thermal fluctuations and the presence of a liquid vortex phase in
this low-temperature superconductor with critical temperature of 11 K,
consistent with the interpretation of the electrical transport data. The
superconducting parameters obtained from $\lambda$ and coherence length $\xi$
place this compound in the extreme type \MakeUppercase{\romannumeral 2} regime.
Meissner responses (via MFM) at different locations across the sample are
similar to each other, indicating good homogeneity of the superconducting state
on a sub-micron scale.
