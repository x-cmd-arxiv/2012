content of homogeneous orthogonal space. In the present study, it is shown,
that their spatial and temporal rates of variation do not contribute to the
differential calculus of arbitrary functions in orthogonal space. Based on
this, the Navier-Stokes equations are formulated accordingly, to provide a
method of studying the kinematics of fluid motion in orthogonal plane space.
Employing this formulation and regular perturbation theory, the kinematic
physical measures of the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid around two
identical circular cylinders, which move with equal and opposite velocity
towards central impact are evaluated. For this case, the space is parametrised
according to the bipolar transformation of the cartesian plane.

TRACE observations of the growing flare arcade and some simplified estimation,
we explain why a reaction of active region plasma to accelerated electrons may
change drastically over time. We suggest that, during the ""burst-on-tail"",
non-thermal electrons were injected into magnetic loops of larger spatial scale
than during the impulsive phase bursts, thus resulting in much smaller values
of plasma temperature and emission measure in their coronal volume, and hence
little soft X-ray flux. The nature of the long gap between the main impulsive
phase and the ""burst-on-tail"" is, however, still an open question.

The discovery of about 700 extrasolar planets, so far, has lead to
the first statistics concerning extrasolar planets. The presence of giant
planets seems to depend on stellar metallicity and mass. For example, they are
more frequent around metal-rich stars,with an exponential increase in planet
occurrence rates with metallicity.
  Aims. We analyzed two samples of metal-poor stars (-2.0 \leq [Fe/H] \leq 0.0)
to see if giant planets are indeed rare around these objects. Radial velocity
datasets were obtained with two different spectrographs (HARPS and HIRES).
Detection limits for these data,expressed in minimum planetary mass and period,
are calculated. These produce trustworthy numbers for the planet frequency.
  Methods. A general Lomb Scargle (GLS) periodogram analysis was used together
with a bootstrapping method to produce the detection limits. Planet frequencies
were calculated based on a binomial distribution function within metallicity
bins.
  Results. Almost all hot Jupiters and most giant planets should have been
found in these data. Hot Jupiters around metal-poor stars have a frequency
lower than 1.0% at one sigma. Giant planets with periods up to 1800 days,
however, have a higher frequency of $f_p = 2.63^{+2.5}_{-0.8}%$. Taking into
account the different metallicities of the stars, we show that giant planets
appear to be very frequent $(f_p = 4.48^{+4.04}_{-1.38}%)$ around stars with
[Fe/H] > -0.7, while they are rare around stars with [Fe/H] \leq -0.7 (\leq
2.36% at one sigma).
  Conclusions. Giant planet frequency is indeed a strong function of
metallicity, even in the low-metallicity tail. However, the frequencies are
most likely higher than previously thought.

based on the estimated covariance of the ICP. The resulting filter is very

order of 10^(-2) cps in the region of the tritium beta-decay endpoint is
required. Measurements with an electrostatic retarding spectrometer have
revealed that electrons, arising from nuclear decays in the volume of the
spectrometer, are stored over long time periods and thereby act as a major
source of background exceeding this limit. In this paper we present a novel
active background reduction method based on stochastic heating of stored
electrons by the well-known process of electron cyclotron resonance (ECR). A
successful proof-of-principle of the ECR technique was demonstrated in test
measurements at the KATRIN pre-spectrometer, yielding a large reduction of the
background rate. In addition, we have carried out extensive Monte Carlo
simulations to reveal the potential of the ECR technique to remove all trapped
electrons within negligible loss of measurement time in the main spectrometer.
This would allow the KATRIN experiment attaining its full physics potential.

with energy for $E\le 13$ meV. Upon entering the superconducting state, a spin

was 1000 km/s, similar to those measured from the AIA 1700 {\AA} (967 km/s) and
1600 {\AA} (893 km/s) observations. The wave was reflected by a remote region
with open fields, and a slower wave-like feature at a speed of 220 km/s was
also identified following the primary fast wave. In addition, a type-II radio
burst was observed to be associated with the wave. We conclude that this wave
should be a fast magnetosonic shock wave, which was firstly driven by the
associated coronal mass ejection and then propagated freely in the corona. As
the shock wave propagated, its legs swept the solar surface and thereby
resulted in the wave signatures observed in the lower layers of the solar
atmosphere. The slower wave-like structure following the primary wave was
probably caused by the reconfiguration of the low coronal magnetic fields, as
predicted in the field-line stretching model.

partial halo coronal mass ejection. Using high temporal and spatial resolution
observations taken by the {\em Solar Dynamics Observatory} and the

detailed kinematics of the EUV wave. We find several arguments that support the
fast-mode wave scenario: (1) The speed of the EUV wave (570 km/s) is higher
than the sound speed of quiet-Sun corona. (2) Significant deceleration of the
EUV wave (-130 m/s2) is found during its propagation. (3) The EUV wave resulted
in the oscillations of a loop and a filament along its propagation path, and a
reflected wave from the polar coronal hole is also detected. (4) Refraction or
reflection effect is observed when the EUV wave was passing through two coronal
bright points. (5) The dimming region behind the wavefront stopped to expand
when the wavefront started to become diffuse. (6) The profiles of the wavefront
exhibited a dispersive nature, and the magnetosonic Mach number of the EUV wave
derived from the highest intensity jump is about 1.4. In addition,
triangulation indicates that the EUV wave propagated within a height range of
about 60-100 Mm above the photosphere. We propose that the EUV wave observed
should be a nonlinear fast-mode magnetosonic wave that propagated freely in the
corona after it was driven by the CME expanding flanks during the initial
period.

a phenomenon closely related to SEP violation, and speculate on future

availability of auxiliary invariants about the studied system. Abstract
interpretation is currently one of the best approaches to discover useful
invariants, especially numerical ones. However, its application is limited by
two orthogonal issues: (i) developing an abstract interpretation is often
non-trivial; each transfer function of the system has to be represented at the
abstract level, depending on the abstract domain used; (ii) with precise but
costly abstract domains, the information computed by the abstract interpreter
can be used only once a post fix point has been reached; something that may
take a long time for very large system analysis or with delayed widening to
improve precision.
  This paper proposes a new, completely automatic, method to build abstract

translational invariance is that spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry
and Goldstone's theorem \emph{do not} imply the existence of \emph{massless}
Goldstone modes. We study spontaneous symmetry breaking in an O(2) model, and
implications for O(N) in de Sitter space time. The Goldstone mode acquires a
radiatively generated mass as a consequence of infrared divergences, and the
continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken for any finite $N$, however there
is a \emph{first order phase transition} as a function of the Hawking
temperature $T_H=H/2\pi$. For O(2) the symmetry is spontaneously broken for
$T_H < T_c= \lambda^{1/4} v/2.419$ where $\lambda$ is the quartic coupling and
$v$ is the tree level vacuum expectation value and the Goldstone mode acquires
a radiatively generated mass $\mathcal{M}^2_\pi \propto \lambda^{1/4} H$. The
first order nature of the transition is a consequence of the strong infrared
behavior of minimally coupled scalar fields in de Sitter space time, the jump
in the order parameter at $T_H=T_c$ is $\sigma_{0c} \simeq 0.61\,
{H}/{\lambda^{1/4}}$. In the strict $N\rightarrow \infty$ the symmetry cannot
be spontaneously broken. Furthermore, the lack of kinematic thresholds imply
that the Goldstone modes \emph{decay} into Goldstone and Higgs modes by
emission and absorption of superhorizon quanta.

the W' and Z' bosons emerge after the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously

defining quantum-mechanical amplitudes for questions involving spacetime
regions. For example, the amplitude for entering a spatial region during a
given time interval is typically defined by summing over all paths between
given initial and final points but restricting them to pass through the region
at any time. We argue that there is, however, under very general conditions, a
significant complication in such constructions. This is the fact that the
concrete implementation of the restrictions on paths over an interval of time
corresponds, in an operator language, to sharp monitoring at every moment of
time in the given time interval. Such processes suffer from the quantum Zeno
effect - the continual monitoring of a quantum system in a Hilbert subspace
prevents its state from leaving that subspace. As a consequence, path integral
amplitudes defined in this seemingly obvious way have physically and
intuitively unreasonable properties and in particular, no sensible classical
limit. In this paper we describe this frequently-occurring but
little-appreciated phenomenon in some detail, showing clearly the connection
with the quantum Zeno effect. We then show that it may be avoided by
implementing the restriction on paths in the path integral in a ""softer"" way.
The resulting amplitudes then involve a new coarse graining parameter, which
may be taken to be a timescale \epsilon, describing the softening of the
restrictions on the paths. We argue that the complications arising from the
Zeno effect are then negligible as long as \epsilon >> 1/ E, where E is the
energy scale of the incoming state.

sources have 500um flux densities (S_500) greater than 100mJy. Gravitational
lensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),
and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. We also
present a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationally
lensed SMG candidates with S_500=80--100mJy, which are expected to contain a
higher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. The number counts
of the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical model
of the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsic
SMG number counts, and an assumed SMG redshift distribution. The model predicts
that 32--74% of our S_500>100mJy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed
(mu>2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistent
with the observational data. Our statistical model also predicts that, on
average, lensed galaxies with S_500=100mJy are magnified by factors of ~9, with
apparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,
due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources are
expected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mJy. Thus,
samples of strongly gravitationally lensed SMGs, such as those presented here,
probe below the nominal Herschel detection limit at 500 micron. They are good
targets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,
star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead to
spatial resolutions of ~0.01"" in the source plane.

break galaxies at the 98.3% level, in the sense that the TOUGH hosts on average
have larger EWs than bright LBGs. We can exclude an early indication, based on
a smaller, heterogeneous sample of pre-Swift GRB hosts, that all GRB hosts are
Lya emitters. We find that the TOUGH hosts on average have lower EWs than the
pre-Swift GRB hosts, but the two samples are only inconsistent at the 92%
level. The velocity centroid of the Lya line is redshifted by 200-700 km/s with
respect to the systemic velocity, similar to what is seen for LBGs, possibly
indicating star-formation driven outflows from the host galaxies. There seems
to be a trend between the Lya EW and the optical to X-ray spectral index of the
afterglow (beta_OX), hinting that dust plays a role in the observed strength
and even presence of Lya emission. [ABRIDGED]

acceleration processes in Supernova Remnants, and the arrival direction is
likely determined by the distribution of their sources throughout the Galaxy,
in particular by the nearest and youngest ones. Transport to Earth through the
interstellar medium is expected to affect the cosmic ray properties as well.
However, the observed anisotropy of TeV cosmic rays and its energy dependence
cannot be explained with diffusion models of particle propagation in the
Galaxy. Within a distance of a few parsec, diffusion regime is not valid and
particles with energy below about 100 TeV must be influenced by the heliosphere
and its elongated tail. The observation of a highly significant localized
excess region of cosmic rays from the apparent direction of the downstream
interstellar flow at 1-10 TeV energies might provide the first experimental
evidence that the heliotail can affect the transport of energetic particles. In
particular, TeV cosmic rays propagating through the heliotail interact with the
100-300 AU wide magnetic field polarity domains generated by the 11 year
cycles. Since the strength of non-linear convective processes is expected to be
larger than viscous damping, the plasma in the heliotail is turbulent. Where
magnetic field domains converge on each other due to solar wind gradient,
stochastic magnetic reconnection likely occurs. Such processes may be efficient
enough to re-accelerate a fraction of TeV particles as long as scattering
processes are not strong. Therefore the fractional excess of TeV cosmic rays
from the narrow region toward the heliotail direction traces sightlines with
the lowest smearing scattering effects, that can also explain the observation
of a harder than average energy spectrum.

of imaging polarimetry at optical wavelengths. Using ExPo, a dual-beam imaging

the Sunyaev-Zel'Dovich effect has been observed. In this paper we report on the
discovery with HST imaging of a giant arc associated with this cluster. The
curvature of the arc suggests that the lensing mass is nearly coincident with
the brightest cluster galaxy, and the color is consistent with the arc being a
star-forming galaxy. We compare the constraint on M200 based upon strong
lensing with Sunyaev-Zel'Dovich results, finding that the two are consistent if
the redshift of the arc is z > 3. Finally, we explore the cosmological
implications of this system, considering the likelihood of the existence of a
strongly lensing galaxy cluster at this epoch in an LCDM universe. While the
existence of the cluster itself can potentially be accomodated if one considers
the entire volume covered at this redshift by all current high-redshift cluster
surveys, the existence of this strongly lensed galaxy greatly exacerbates the
long-standing giant arc problem. For standard LCDM structure formation and
observed background field galaxy counts this lens system should not exist.
Specifically, there should be no giant arcs in the entire sky as bright in
F814W as the observed arc for clusters at z \geq 1.75, and only \sim 0.3 as
bright in F160W as the observed arc. If we relax the redshift constraint to
consider all clusters at z \geq 1.5, the expected number of giant arcs rises to
\sim15 in F160W, but the number of giant arcs of this brightness in F814W
remains zero. These arc statistic results are independent of the mass of IDCS
J1426.5+3508. We consider possible explanations for this discrepancy.

utility of a 2D column density $\sigma_{\Sigma/\Sigma_0}^2$-${\cal M}_s$

(2D) power spectral indices asymptotically become a constant for each galaxy
when a significant part of the line profile is integrated. For narrow channel
maps, the PS become shallower as the channel width decreases, and this
shallowing trend continues to our single channel maps. This implies that even
the highest velocity resolution of 1.8 km/s is not smaller than the thermal
dispersion of the coolest, widespread HI component. The one-dimensional PS of
azimuthal profiles at different radii suggest that the shallower PS for
narrower channel width is mainly contributed by the inner disks, which
indicates that the inner disks have proportionally more cooler HI than the
outer disks. Galaxies with lower luminosity (M_B > -14.5 mag) and star
formation rate (SFR, log(SFR (M\odot/yr)) < -2.1) tend to have steeper PS,
which implies that the HI line-of-sight depths can be comparable with the
radial length scales in low mass galaxies. A lack of a correlation between the

conclusions are: 1) An increasing progenitor mass sequence is observed, implied
from an increasing association of SNe to host galaxy H-alpha emission. This
commences with the type Ia (SNIa) showing the weakest association, followed by
the SNII, then the SNIb, with the SNIc showing the strongest correlation to SF
regions. Thus our progenitor mass sequence runs Ia-II-Ib-Ic. 2) Overall SNIbc
are found to occur nearer to bright HII regions than SNII. This implies that
the former have shorter stellar lifetimes thus arising from more massive
progenitor stars. 3) While SNIIP do not closely follow the on-going SF, they
accurately trace the recent formation. This implies that their progenitors
arise from stars at the low end of the CC SN mass sequence, consistent with
direct detections of progenitors in pre-explosion imaging. 4) Similarly SNIIn
trace recent but not the on-going SF. This implies that, contrary to the
general consensus, the majority of these SNe do not arise from the most massive
stars. Results and constraints are also presented for the less numerous SNIIL,
IIb, and 'impostors'. Finally we present analysis of possible biases in the
data, the results of which argue strongly against any selection effects that
could explain the relative excess of SNIbc within bright HII regions. Thus
intrinsic progenitor differences in the sense of the mass sequence we propose
remain the most plausible explanation of our findings.

axiom is: $\varphi$ is necessarily true iff there is a justification for

justifications. Instead of defining purely algebraic models in the style of

some algebraic structure for dealing with justifications and prove soundness

$\square\varphi \to \square\square\varphi$ and a rule of Axiom Necessitation to
our system. As a main result, we show that the modal logics S4 and S5 can be

limb. On 2011/09/25 8:00UT material flows upwards from the prominence core
along a narrow loop-like structure, accompanied by a rise ($\geq$50,000km) of
the prominence core and the loop. As the loop fades by 10:00, small blobs and
streaks of varying brightness rotate around the top part of the prominence and
cavity, mimicking a cyclone. The most intense and coherent rotation lasts for
over three hours, with emission in both hot ($\sim$1MK) and cold (hydrogen and
helium) lines. We suggest that the cyclonic appearance and overall evolution of
the structure can be interpreted in terms of the expansion of helical
structures into the cavity, and the movement of plasma along helical structures
which appears as a rotation when viewed along the helix axis. The coordinated
movement of material between prominence and cavity suggest that they are
structurally linked. Complexity is great due to the combined effect of these
actions and the line-of-sight integration through the structure which contains
tangled fields.

heating and injection of Alfvenic energy at the base of fast solar wind (in

chromospheric spicules that leave the lower solar atmosphere at speeds of order
100km/s, the hotter coronal counterpart of the spicule emits radiation
characteristic of root heating that rapidly reaches temperatures of the order
of 1MK. Furthermore, the same spicules and their coronal counterparts

the fast solar wind. We consider some compositional constraints on this

turned out to be misclassified stars. We inspected the group properties of the
PN spectra and classified them based on the different dust classes
(featureless, carbon-rich dust; oxygen-rich dust; mixed-chemistry dust) and
subclasses (aromatic and aliphatic; crystalline and amorphous). All PNe are
characterized by dust continuum and more than 80% of the sample shows solid
state features above the continuum, in contrast with the Magellanic Cloud
sample where only ~40% of the entire sample displays solid state features; this
is an indication of the strong link between dust properties and metallicity.
The Galactic PNe that show solid state features are almost equally divided
among the CRD, ORD, and MCD. We analyzed dust properties together with other PN
properties and found that (i) there is an enhancement of MCD PNe toward the
Galactic center; (ii) CRD PNe could be seen as defining an evolutionary
sequence, contrary to the ORD and MCD PNe; (iii) C- and O-rich grains retain
different equilibrium temperatures, as expected from models; (iv) ORD PNe are
highly asymmetric and CRD PNe highly symmetric; point-symmetry is statistically
more common in MCD. We find that the Galactic Disk sample does not include MCD
PNe, and the other dust classes are differently populated from high to low
metallicity environments. The MCPNe seem to attain higher dust temperatures at
similar evolutionary stages, in agreement with the observational findings of
smaller dust grains in low metallicity interstellar environments.

background inhibits effective cooling in low-mass haloes, delaying star
formation until the collapse or more massive haloes. Only when molecular
hydrogen (H2) can self-shield from LW radiation, which requires a halo capable
of cooling by atomic line emission, will star formation be possible. To follow
the formation of multiple gravitationally bound objects, at high gas densities
we introduce sink particles which accrete gas directly from the computational
grid. We find that in a 1 Mpc^3 (comoving) box, runaway collapse first occurs
in a 3x10^7 M_sun dark matter halo at z~12 assuming a background intensity of
J21=100. Due to a runaway increase in the H2 abundance and cooling rate, a
self-shielding, supersonically turbulent core develops abruptly with ~10^4
M_sun in cold gas available for star formation. We analyze the formation of
this self-shielding core, the character of turbulence, and the prospects for
star formation. Due to a lack of fragmentation on scales we resolve, we argue
that LW-delayed metal-free star formation in atomic cooling haloes is very
similar to star formation in primordial minihaloes, although in making this
conclusion we ignore internal stellar feedback. Finally, we briefly discuss the
detectability of metal-free stellar clusters with the James Webb Space

the present setting is affected by the competition of different spatial scales,
viz., the coupling length and correlation radius of the nonlocality,
$\sqrt{d}$. By means of numer- ical methods and variational approximation (VA,
which is relevant for small d), we find that, with the increase of the
correlation radius, the SBB changes from subcritical into supercritical, which
makes all the asymmetric solitons stable. On the other hand, the nonlocality
has little influence on the stability of antisymmetric solitons. Analytical
results for the SBB are also obtained (actually, for antisymmetric ""accessible
solitons"") in the opposite limit of the ultra-nonlocal nonlinearity, using a
coupler based on the Snyder-Mitchell model. The results help to grasp the

part of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble, show that the
brightest galaxy in the cluster, A2261-BCG, has the largest core yet detected
in any galaxy. The cusp radius of A2261-BCG is 3.2 kpc, twice as big as the
next largest core known, and ~3x bigger than those typically seen in the most
luminous BCGs. The morphology of the core in A2261-BCG is also unusual, having
a flat or even slightly-depressed interior surface brightness profile, rather
than the typical shallow cusp. This implies that the galaxy has a core with
constant or even centrally decreasing stellar density. Interpretation of the
core as an end product of the ""scouring"" action of a binary supermassive black
hole implies a total black hole mass ~1E+10 M_sun from the extrapolation of
most relationships between core structure and black hole mass. The core falls
1-sigma above the cusp-radius versus galaxy luminosity relation. Its large size
in real terms, and the extremely large black hole mass required to generate it,
raise the possibility that the core has been enlarged by additional processes,
such as the ejection of the black holes that originally generated the core. The
flat central stellar density profile is consistent with this hypothesis. The
core is also displaced by 0.7 kpc from the center of the surrounding envelope,
consistent with a local dynamical perturbation of the core.

long-periodic radial velocity (RV) variations of massive stars, we have been
carrying out a precise RV survey for supergiants that lie near or inside the
Cepheid instability strip.
  Methods. We have obtained high-resolution spectra of {\alpha} Per (F5 Ib)
from November 2005 to September 2011 using the fiber-fed Bohyunsan Observatory
Echelle Spectrograph (BOES) at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO).
  Results. Our measurements reveal that {\alpha} Per shows a periodic RV
variation of 128 days and a semi-amplitude of 70 m/s. We find no strong
correlation between RV variations and bisector velocity span (BVS), but the
128-d peak is indeed present in the BVS variations among several other
significant peaks in periodogram.
  Conclusions. {\alpha} Per may have an exoplanet, but the combined data
spanning over 20 years seem to suggest that the 128-d RV variations have not
been stable on long-term scale, which is somewhat difficult to reconcile with
the exoplanet explanation. We do not exclude the pulsational nature of the
128-d variations in {\alpha} Per. Although we do not find clear evidence for
surface activity or rotational modulations by spots, coupled with the fact that
the expected rotation period is ~ 130 days the rotational modulation seems to
be the most likely cause of the RV variations. More observational data and
research are needed to clearly determine the origin of RV the variations in
{\alpha} Per.

forecasting using previous data without any process knowledge might result in

from string theory is that the configuration thermalizes and the information in
the probe is rather quickly scrambled away. The traditional view of a classical
unique spacetime near a black hole horizon conflicts with this picture. The
question then arises as to what spacetime does the probe actually see as it
crosses a horizon, and how does the background geometry imprint its signature
onto the thermal properties of the probe. In this work, we explore these
questions through an extensive series of numerical simulations of D0 branes. We
determine that the D0 branes quickly settle into an incompressible symmetric
state -- thermalized within a few oscillations through a process driven
entirely by internal non-linear dynamics. Surprisingly, thermal background
fluctuations play no role in this mechanism. Signatures of the background
fields in this thermal state arise either through fluxes, i.e. black hole hair;
or if the probe expands to the size of the horizon -- which we see evidence of.
We determine simple scaling relations for the D0 branes' equilibrium size, time
to thermalize, lifetime, and temperature in terms of their number, initial
energy, and the background fields. Our results are consistent with the
conjecture that black holes are the fastest scramblers as seen by Matrix
theory.

that the circumbinary continuum feature is indeed a rotating disk; furthermore,
the C18O channel maps can be well modeled by a geometrically-thin disk
exhibiting Keplerian rotation. We estimate a mass for the circumbinary disk of

by the protobinary system. Compared with several other Class I protostars known

includes contributions from important QGP probes such as thermal radiation and
the quarkonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi'$ and $\Upsilon$) states. Dileptons coming from
hard $q \bar q$ scattering, the Drell-Yan process, contribute in all mass
regions. In heavy-ion colliders, such as the LHC, semileptonic decays of heavy
flavor hadrons provide a substantial contribution to the dilepton continuum.
The dilepton continuum can give quantitative information about heavy quark
yields and their modification in the medium and thus it is important to know
all different sources which populate the continuum.
  In the present study, we calculate $c \bar c$ and $b \bar b$ production and
determine their contributions to the dilepton continuum in Pb+Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV with and without including heavy quark energy
loss. We also calculate the rates for Drell-Yan and thermal dilepton
production. The contributions to the continuum from these dilepton sources are
studied in the kinematic ranges relevant for the LHC detectors. The relatively
high $p_T$ cutoff for single leptons excludes most dileptons produced by the
thermal medium. Heavy flavors are the dominant source of dilepton production in
all the kinematic regimes except at forward rapidities where Drell-Yan start
dominating in high mass range beyond 10 GeV/$c^2$.

Extending the usual set of integrated fields and external sources to ""proper""
fields and sources, which include partners of the composite fields, we define
the master functional Omega, which collects one-particle irreducible diagrams
and upgrades the usual Gamma-functional in several respects. The functional
Omega is determined from its classical limit applying the usual diagrammatic
rules to the proper fields. Moreover, it behaves as a scalar under the most
general perturbative field redefinitions, which can be expressed as linear
transformations of the proper fields. We extend the Batalin-Vilkovisky
formalism and the master equation. The master functional satisfies the extended
master equation and behaves as a scalar under canonical transformations. The
most general perturbative field redefinitions and changes of gauge-fixing can
be encoded in proper canonical transformations, which are linear and do not mix
integrated fields and external sources. Therefore, they can be applied as true
changes of variables in the functional integral, instead of mere replacements
of integrands. This property overcomes a major difficulty of the functional
Gamma. Finally, the new approach allows us to prove the renormalizability of
gauge theories in a general field-covariant setting. We generalize known
cohomological theorems to the master functional and show that when there are no
gauge anomalies all divergences can be subtracted by means of parameter
redefinitions and proper canonical transformations.

solution coating a vertical fiber. The liquid film has first a constant
thickness and then undergoes the Rayleigh-Plateau instability which leads to
the formation of sequences of drops, separated by a thin film, moving down at a
constant velocity. Different polymer solutions are used, i.e. xanthan solutions
and polyacrylamide (PAAm) solutions. These solutions both exhibit shear-rate
dependence of the viscosity, but for PAAm solutions, there are strong normal
stresses in addition of the shear-thinning effect. We characterize
experimentally and separately the effects of these two non-Newtonian properties
on the flow on the fiber. Thus, in the flat film observed before the emergence
of the drops, only shear-thinning effect plays a role and tends to thin the
film compared to the Newtonian case. The effect of the non-Newtonian rheology
on the Rayleigh-Plateau instability is then investigated through the
measurements of the growth rate and the wavelength of the instability. Results
are in good agreement with linear stability analysis for a shear-thinning
fluid. The effect of normal stress can be taken into account by considering an
effective surface tension which tends to decrease the growth rate of the
instability. Finally, the dependence of the morphology of the drops with the
normal stress is investigated and a simplified model including the normal
stress within the lubrication approximation provides good quantitative results
on the shape of the drops.

suitable scan pattern to optimize radio spectroscopic observations. Adequate
spectral smoothing is applied to the spectrum toward OFF-source blank sky
adjacent to a target source direction for the purpose of bandpass correction.
Because the smoothing process reduces noise, the integration time for
OFF-source scans can be reduced keeping the signal-to-noise ratio. Since the
smoothing is not applied to ON-source scans, the spectral resolution for line
features is kept. An optimal smoothing window is determined by bandpass
flatness evaluated by Spectral Allan Variance (SAV). An efficient scan pattern
is designed to the OFF-source scans within the bandpass stability timescale
estimated by Time-based Allan Variance (TAV). We have tested the SBC using the
digital spectrometer, VESPA, on the VERA Iriki station. For the targeted noise
level of 5e-4 as a ratio to the system noise, the optimal smoothing window was
32 - 60 ch in the whole bandwidth of 1024 ch, and the optimal scan pattern was
designed as a sequence of 70-s ON + 10-s OFF scan pairs. The noise level with
the SBC was reduced by a factor of 1.74 compared with the conventional method.
The total telescope time to achieve the goal with the SBC was 400 s, which was
1/3 of 1200 s required by the conventional way. Improvement in telescope time
efficiency with the SBC was calculated as 3x, 2x and 1.3x for single-beam,
dual-beam, and on-the-fly (OTF) scans, respectively. The SBC works to optimize
scan patterns for observations from now, and also works to improve
signal-to-noise ratios of archival data if ON- and OFF-source spectra are
individually recorded, though the efficiency depends on the spectral stability
of the receiving system.

regard to UR, the alluded philosophy discloses oneself to be an unjustified

simple and limited mathematical formulas, without any essential significance
for physics. Such a finding reinforces the Dirac's prediction that UR ""`in

facets of UR motivate reconsiderations of associated debates on QMS. Mainly one
reveals that, properly, UR have not any essential connection with genuine

mathematically, the quantum observables to be considered as random variables.
The measuring scenarios with a single sampling, such are wave function collapse

step towards answering these questions, we have searched for Ly\alpha\
envelopes around six radio-quiet quasars at z~4.5, using deep spectra taken
with the FORS2 spectrograph attached to the UT1 of the Very Large Telescope
(VLT). Using the multi-slit mode allows us to observe several point spread
function stars simultaneously with the quasar, and to remove the point-like
emission from the quasar, unveiling the faint underlying Ly\alpha\ envelope
with unprecedented depth. An envelope is detected around four of the six
quasars, which suggests that these envelopes are very frequent. Their diameter
varies in the range 26<d<64 kpc, their surface brightness in the range
3x10^{-19}<\mu<2x10^{-17} erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, and their luminosity in the
range 10^{42}<L(Ly\alpha)<10^{44} erg/s. Their shape may be strongly
asymmetric. The Ly\alpha\ emission line full width at half maximum (FWHM) is
900<FWHM<2200 km/s and its luminosity correlates with that of the broad line
region (BLR) of the quasar, with the notable exception of BR2237-0607, the
brightest object in our sample. The same holds for the relation between the
envelope Ly\alpha\ luminosity and the ionizing luminosity of the quasar. While
the deep slit spectroscopy presented in this paper is very efficient at
detecting very faint Ly\alpha\ envelopes, narrow-band imaging is now needed to
measure accurately their spatial extent, radial luminosity profile, and total
luminosity. These observables are crucial to help us discriminate between the
three possible radiation processes responsible for the envelope emission: (i)
cold accretion, (ii) fluorescence induced by the quasar, and (iii) scattering
of the BLR photons by cool gas.

complementary cases, which has no or has an internal (built-in) cancellation
mechanism in amplitudes. Our main results are as following. (a) Bounds from
rates are used to constrain parameters, such as coupling constants and masses.
These constraints can be easily updated by simple scalings, if the experimental
situations change. (b) The muon g-2 data favors non-chiral interactions. (c) In
\mu -> 3 e and \mu N -> e N processes, Z-penguin diagrams may play some role,
while box diagrams contributions are usually highly constrained. (d) In the
first case (without any built-in cancellation mechanism), using the recent \mu
-> e\gamma bound, we find that \mu -> 3e and \mu N -> e N rates are bounded
below the present experimental limits by two to three orders of magnitudes in
general. Furthermore, by comparing \Delta a_\mu and Br(\mu->e\gamma) data, the
couplings of \mu and e are found to be highly hierarchical. Additional
suppression mechanism should be called for. (e) In the second case (with a
built-in cancellation mechanism), mixing angles can provide additional
suppression factors to satisfy the \Delta a_\mu and Br(\mu -> e\gamma) bounds.
While the \mu-> 3 e rate remains suppressed, the bounds on \mu N -> e N rates,
implicated from the latest \mu -> e\gamma bound, can be relaxed significantly
and can be just below the present experimental limits.

volumes of the sky in the region of the Gum nebula. New high-quality
four-colour uvby and H\beta\ Str\""omgren photometry obtained for 352 stars in
six selected areas of Kapteyn, complemented with data obtained in a previous
investigation for two of these areas, were used to estimate the colour excess
and distance to these objects. The obtained colour excess versus distance
diagrams, complemented with other information, when available, were analysed in
order to infer the properties of the interstellar medium permeating the
observed volumes. On the basis of the overall standard deviation in the
photometric measurements, we estimate that colour excesses and distances are
determined with an accuracy of 0.010 mag and better than 30%, respectively, for
a sample of 520 stars. A comparison with 37 stars in common with the new
Hipparcos catalogue attests to the high quality of the photometric distance
determination. The obtained colour excess versus distance diagrams testify to
the low density volume towards the observed lines-of-sight. Very few stars out
to distances of 1 kpc from the Sun have colour excesses larger than E(b-y) =
0.1 mag. In spite of the low density character of the interstellar medium
towards the Puppis-Vela direction, the obtained reddening as a function of the
distance indicates that two or more interstellar structures are crossed towards
the observed lines-of-sight. One of these structures may be associated with the
very low density wall of the Local Cavity, which has a distance of 100-150 pc
from the Sun. Another structure might be related to the Gum nebula, and if so,
its front face would be located at about 350 pc from the Sun.

fields in the bulk, providing canonical ""test screens"" in a ""scattering""-like

the role and properties of dynamical trapping horizons as canonical inner

the recoil dynamics in post-merger binary black holes, an important issue in

contributions. First, we show how to implement an algorithm called nonconjugate
variational message passing for GLMMs. Second, we show that the partially
noncentered parametrization can adapt to the quantity of information in the

partial noncentering can accelerate convergence and produce more accurate

circumvent the no-cloning theorem [5] and faithfully transfer unknown quantum
states to a party whose location is even unknown over arbitrary distances. Ever
since the first experimental demonstrations of quantum teleportation of
independent qubits [6] and of squeezed states [7], researchers have
progressively extended the communication distance in teleportation, usually
without active feed-forward of the classical Bell-state measurement result
which is an essential ingredient in future applications such as communication
between quantum computers. Here we report the first long-distance quantum
teleportation experiment with active feed-forward in real time. The experiment
employed two optical links, quantum and classical, over 143 km free space
between the two Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. To achieve this, the
experiment had to employ novel techniques such as a frequency-uncorrelated
polarization-entangled photon pair source, ultra-low-noise single-photon
detectors, and entanglement-assisted clock synchronization. The average
teleported state fidelity was well beyond the classical limit of 2/3.
Furthermore, we confirmed the quality of the quantum teleportation procedure
(without feed-forward) by complete quantum process tomography. Our experiment
confirms the maturity and applicability of the involved technologies in
real-world scenarios, and is a milestone towards future satellite-based quantum
teleportation.

properties of the system. Sustaining the chaotic properties has been mentioned
to be of importance in some areas such as biological systems. The problem of
stabilizing a chaotic singularly perturbed system will be addressed and a
solution will be proposed based on the OGY (Ott, Grebogi and Yorke)
methodology. For the OGY control, Poincare section of the system is defined on
its slow manifold. The multi-time scale property of the singularly perturbed
system is exploited to control the Poincare map with the slow scale time. Slow
scale time is adaptively estimated using a parameter estimation technique.
Control with slow time scale circumvents the need to observe the states. With
this strategy, the system remains chaotic and chaos identification is possible
with online calculation of lyapunov exponents. Using this strategy on
ecological system improves their control in three aspects. First that for
ecological systems sustaining the dynamical property is important to survival
of them. Second it removes the necessity of insertion of control action in each
sample time. And third it introduces the sufficient time for census.

accounted for if these jets are intrinsically symmetrical, with decelerating
relativistic outflows surrounded by mildly relativistic backflows. Our
interpretation is motivated by sensitive, well-resolved Very Large Array
imaging which shows that both jets in both sources have a two-component
structure transverse to their axes. Close to the jet axis, a centrally-darkened
counter-jet lies opposite a centrally-brightened jet, but both are surrounded
by broader collimated emission that is brighter on the counter-jet side. We
have adapted our previous models of FR I jets as relativistic outflows to
include an added component of symmetric backflow. We find that the observed
radio emission, after subtracting contributions from the extended lobes, is
well described by models in which decelerating outflows with parameters similar
to those derived for jets in plumed FR I sources are surrounded by backflows
containing predominantly toroidal magnetic fields. These return to within a few
kpc of the galaxies with velocities of roughly 0.25c and radiate with a
synchrotron spectral index close to 0.55. We discuss whether such backflow is

harmful interference below a given limit. Uncertainties in the estimation of
propagation loss and DME location affect the feasibility of the secondary

is constrained by a Slavnov-Taylor identity stemming from a nilpotent exact
BRST invariance which is spontaneously broken due to the presence of the Gribov
horizon. This spontaneous symmetry breaking can be described in a purely
algebraic way through the introduction of a pair of auxiliary fields which give
rise to a set of linearly broken Ward identities. The Goldstone sector turns
out to be decoupled. The underlying exact nilpotent BRST invariance allows to
employ BRST cohomology tools within the Gribov horizon to identify
renormalizable extensions of gauge invariant operators. Using a simple toy
model and appropriate Dirac bracket quantization, we discuss the time-evolution
invariance of the operator cohomology. We further comment on the unitarity
issue in a confining theory, and stress that BRST cohomology alone is not
sufficient to ensure unitarity, a fact, although well known, frequently
ignored.

is dominant in categorical logic, notably in topos theory. This paper follows a
different direction in which double negation does hold. The algebraic notions
of effect algebra/module that emerged in theoretical physics form the
cornerstone. It is shown that under mild conditions on a category, its maps of
the form X -> 1+1 carry such effect module structure, and can be used as
predicates. Predicates are identified in many different situations, and capture
for instance ordinary subsets, fuzzy predicates in a probabilistic setting,
idempotents in a ring, and effects (positive elements below the unit) in a
C*-algebra or Hilbert space. In quantum foundations the duality between states
and effects plays an important role. It appears here in the form of an
adjunction, where we use maps 1 -> X as states. For such a state s and a
predicate p, the validity probability s |= p is defined, as an abstract Born
rule. It captures many forms of (Boolean or probabilistic) validity known from
the literature. Measurement from quantum mechanics is formalised categorically
in terms of `instruments', using L\""uders rule in the quantum case. These
instruments are special maps associated with predicates (more generally, with
tests), which perform the act of measurement and may have a side-effect that
disturbs the system under observation. This abstract description of
side-effects is one of the main achievements of the current approach. It is
shown that in the special case of C*-algebras, side-effect appear exclusively
in the non-commutative case. Also, these instruments are used for test
operators in a dynamic logic that can be used for reasoning about quantum
programs/protocols. The paper describes four successive assumptions, towards a
categorical axiomatisation of quantitative logic for probabilistic and quantum
systems.

The binary opinions $\pm 1$ are analogous to up and down Ising spins and in the
equivalent spin system, only the spins at the domain boundary can flip. The
probability that a spin at the boundary is up is taken as $P_{up} = \frac
{s_{up}} {s_{up} + \delta s_{down}}$ where $s_{up} (s_{down})$ denotes the size
of the domain with up (down) spins neighbouring it. With $x$ fraction of up
spins initially, a phase transition is observed in terms of the exit
probability and the phase boundary is obtained in the $\delta -x$ plane. In
addition, we investigate the coarsening behaviour starting from a completely
random state; conventional scaling is observed only at the phase transition
point $\delta = 1$. The scaling behaviour is compared to other dynamical
phenomena; the model apparently belongs to a new dynamical universility class
as far as persistence is concerned although the dynamical exponent, equal to
one, is identical to a similar model with no stochasticity.

magnetic field on the magnetic properties. The thermal conductivity (\kappa)
shows a purely phononic transport in zero field. The external magnetic field
along the c axis induces a dip-like behavior of \kappa(H), which can be
attributed to a simple paramagnetic scattering on phonons. However, the
magnetic field along the ab plane induces another step-like decrease of \kappa.
This kind of \kappa(H) behavior is discussed to be related to a field-induced
partial order, which yields low-energy magnetic excitations that significantly
scatter phonons. These results point to a paramagnetic ground state that

proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=0.9$, 2.76 and 7 TeV with the ALICE
detector at the LHC are presented. The observable is linearized to be collinear
safe and is measured in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction using
primary charged tracks with $p_{\rm T}\geq0.5$ GeV/c in $|\eta|\leq0.8$. The
mean sphericity as a function of the charged particle multiplicity at
mid-rapidity ($N_{\rm ch}$) is reported for events with different $p_{\rm T}$
scales (""soft"" and ""hard"") defined by the transverse momentum of the leading
particle. In addition, the mean charged particle transverse momentum versus
multiplicity is presented for the different event classes, and the sphericity
distributions in bins of multiplicity are presented. The data are compared with
calculations of standard Monte Carlo event generators. The transverse
sphericity is found to grow with multiplicity at all collision energies, with a
steeper rise at low $N_{\rm ch}$, whereas the event generators show the
opposite tendency. The combined study of the sphericity and the mean $p_{\rm
T}$ with multiplicity indicates that most of the tested event generators
produce events with higher multiplicity by generating more back-to-back jets
resulting in decreased sphericity (and isotropy). The PYTHIA6 generator with
tune PERUGIA-2011 exhibits a noticeable improvement in describing the data,
compared to the other tested generators.

strictly thermal. Such a non-strictly thermal character implies that the
spectrum is also not strictly continuous and thus generates a natural
correspondence between Hawking radiation and black hole's quasinormal modes.
This issue endorses the idea that, in an underlying unitary quantum gravity
theory, black holes result highly excited states. We use this key point to
re-analyze the spectrum of black hole's quasinormal modes by introducing a
black hole's effective temperature. Our analysis changes the physical
understanding of such a spectrum and enables a re-examination of various
results in the literature which realizes important modifies on quantum physics
of black holes. In particular, the formula of the horizon's area quantization
and the number of quanta of area are modified becoming functions of the quantum
""overtone"" number n. Consequently, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, its sub-leading
corrections and the number of microstates, i.e. quantities which are
fundamental to realize unitary quantum gravity theory, are also modified. They
become functions of the quantum overtone number too. Previous results in the
literature are re-obtained in the very large n limit.

paradigm is a suitable platform for mixture analysis, particularly when the
number of components is unknown. Bhattacharya (2008) introduced a mixture model
based on the Dirichlet process, where an upper bound on the unknown number of
components is to be specified. Here we consider a Bayesian asymptotic framework
for objectively specifying the upper bound, which we assume to depend on the
sample size. In particular, we define a Bayesian analogue of the mean
integrated squared error (Bayesian MISE), and select that form of the upper
bound, and also that form of the precision parameter of the underlying
Dirichlet process, for which Bayesian MISE of a specific density estimator,
which is a suitable modification of the Polya-urn based prior predictive model,
converges at a desired rate. As a byproduct of our approach, we investigate
asymptotic choice of the precision parameter of the traditional Dirichlet
process mixture model; the density estimator we consider here is a modification
of the prior predictive distribution of Escobar & West (1995) associated with
the Polya urn model. Various asymptotic issues related to the two
aforementioned mixtures, including comparative performances, are also
investigated.

function of particle orientations and the evolution equations for the second

closure approximations are discussed, one of them considering the relaxation of
the fourth order orientational parameter and leading to a novel expression for
the free-energy like function in terms of the scalar order parameter.
Considering the evolution equation of the density of the system and values of
the interaction parameter for which isotropic and nematic phases coexist, our
analysis predicts that patterns and traveling waves can be produced in
lyotropic uniaxial nematics even in the absence of external driving.

in which the wave character is described by classical physics. Most properties
follow from the description of a classical massless charge circulating with
v\,=\,c. The magnetic moment of the electron yields the radius of this
circulation and the generated synchrotron radiation removes the singularity of
the Coulomb field and generates the mass of the electron. Quantum mechanics
yields its size and the angular moment. The fine structure constant $\alpha$
compares this dynamic structure of the electron with the classical point-like
static view. This configuration is not stable. It will decay by the emission of
synchrotron radiation.
  The stability of this description is therefor investigated by extending this
model to 3 dimensions. The field lines within the free electromagnetic fields
of the creation process, solved in polar coordinates, yield possible tracks for
a massless charge. Many possible circulating tracks are found but only a
combination of background fields yield environments in which stable tracks for
$\beta =1$ - charges may be created.
  Knotted toroidal tracks yield the stability. A knotted field line e.g. with
T(3,2)-symmetry may describe a spin-1/3-particle and a field line with
T(2,3)-symmetry in form of a knotted trefoil may belong to an electron as a
stable spin-1/2-particle.
  With its fixed internal revolution frequency this electron appears to the
external world as a standing wave with an amplitude propagating like the de
Broglie wave.
