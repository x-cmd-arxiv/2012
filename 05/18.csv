lattice at finite temperatures which might describe the physics of the quasi
two-dimensional compounds, Na$_2$IrO$_3$ and Li$_2$IrO$_3$. The model undergoes
two phase transitions as a function of temperature. At low temperature, thermal
fluctuations induce magnetic long-range order by order-by-disorder mechanism.
Magnetically ordered state with the spontaneously broken $Z_6$ symmetry
persists up to a certain critical temperature. We find that there is an
intermediate phase between the low-temperature ordered phase and the
high-temperature disordered phase. The finite-sized scaling analysis suggests
that the intermediate phase is a critical Kosterlitz-Thouless phase with
continuously variable exponents. We argue that the intermediate phase has been
actually observed above the low-temperature magnetically ordered phase in
Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and likely in Li$_2$IrO$_3$.

frequently used in front of the focal-plane camera of a very-high-energy

Cherenkov photons and reduce the night-sky background entering at large
incident angles. The shape of a hexagonal light collector is usually based on
Winston's design, which is optimized for only two-dimensional optical systems.
However, it is not known whether a hexagonal Winston cone is optimal for the

Unlike standard approaches, kLog does not represent a probability distribution
directly. It is rather a language to perform kernel-based learning on
expressive logical and relational representations. kLog allows users to specify
learning problems declaratively. It builds on simple but powerful concepts:
learning from interpretations, entity/relationship data modeling, logic
programming, and deductive databases. Access by the kernel to the rich
representation is mediated by a technique we call graphicalization: the
relational representation is first transformed into a graph --- in particular,
a grounded entity/relationship diagram. Subsequently, a choice of graph kernel
defines the feature space. kLog supports mixed numerical and symbolic data, as
well as background knowledge in the form of Prolog or Datalog programs as in
inductive logic programming systems. The kLog framework can be applied to
tackle the same range of tasks that has made statistical relational learning so
popular, including classification, regression, multitask learning, and
collective classification. We also report about empirical comparisons, showing
that kLog can be either more accurate, or much faster at the same level of
accuracy, than Tilde and Alchemy. kLog is GPLv3 licensed and is available at

not reproduce the highly non-elliptical shape of the likelihood function. More
quantitatively, the Fisher method underestimates the marginalized errors for

formation such as weak lensing, we find that the posterior probability contours
from the Fisher matrix estimation are in good agreement with the MCMC contours

non-linear transformations resulting in physically-motivated parameters and
investigate whether these parameterisations exhibit a Gaussian behaviour. We

hypotheses is to simulate the variation of the test statistic by generating the
sampling distribution which assumes both that the null hypothesis is true, and
that the data in the sample is somehow representative of the population. This
philosophy is inapplicable for testing hypotheses for a single parameter like
the population mean, since the two assumptions are contradictory (e.g., how can
we assume both that the mean of the population is $\mu_0,$ and that the
individuals in the sample with a mean $M \ne \mu_0$ are representative of the
population?). The Mirror Bootstrap resolves that conundrum. The philosophy of
the Mirror Bootstrap method for testing hypotheses regarding one population
parameter is that we assume both that the null hypothesis is true, and that the
individuals in our sample are as representative as they could be without
assuming more extreme cases than observed. For example, the Mirror Bootstrap
method for testing hypotheses of one mean uses a generated symmetric
distribution constructed by reflecting the original sample around the
hypothesized population mean $\mu_0$. Simulations of the performance of the
Mirror Bootstrap for testing hypotheses of one mean show that, while the method
is slightly on the conservative side for very small samples, its validity and
power quickly approach that of the widely used t-test. The philosophy of the
Mirror Bootstrap is sufficiently general to be adapted for testing hypotheses
about other parameters; this exploration is left for future research.

learning abilities. The nodes interact with each other on a local level and
diffuse information across the network to solve estimation and inference tasks
in a distributed manner. In this work, we compare the mean-square performance
of two main strategies for distributed estimation over networks: consensus
strategies and diffusion strategies. The analysis in the paper confirms that
under constant step-sizes, diffusion strategies allow information to diffuse
more thoroughly through the network and this property has a favorable effect on
the evolution of the network: diffusion networks are shown to converge faster
and reach lower mean-square deviation than consensus networks, and their
mean-square stability is insensitive to the choice of the combination weights.
In contrast, and surprisingly, it is shown that consensus networks can become
unstable even if all the individual nodes are stable and able to solve the
estimation task on their own. When this occurs, cooperation over the network
leads to a catastrophic failure of the estimation task. This phenomenon does
not occur for diffusion networks: we show that stability of the individual
nodes always ensures stability of the diffusion network irrespective of the
combination topology. Simulation results support the theoretical findings.

Schwimmer to quantum field theories in d=6 spacetime dimensions. The dilaton
effective action is obtained up to 6th order in derivatives. The anomaly flow
a_UV - a_IR is the coefficient of the 6-derivative Euler anomaly term in this
action. It then appears at order p^6 in the low energy limit of n-point
scattering amplitudes of the dilaton for n > 3. The detailed structure with the
correct anomaly coefficient is confirmed by direct calculation in two examples:
(i) the case of explicitly broken conformal symmetry is illustrated by the free
massive scalar field, and (ii) the case of spontaneously broken conformal
symmetry is demonstrated by the (2,0) theory on the Coulomb branch. In the
latter example, the dilaton is a dynamical field so 4-derivative terms in the
action also affect n-point amplitudes at order p^6. The calculation in the
(2,0) theory is done by analyzing an M5-brane probe in AdS_7 x S^4.
  Given the confirmation in two distinct models, we attempt to use dispersion
relations to prove that the anomaly flow is positive in general. Unfortunately
the 4-point matrix element of the Euler anomaly is proportional to stu and
vanishes for forward scattering. Thus the optical theorem cannot be applied to
show positivity. Instead the anomaly flow is given by a dispersion sum rule in
which the integrand does not have definite sign. It may be possible to base a
proof of the a-theorem on the analyticity and unitarity properties of the

the spirit of the stationary phase integration method). In this paper we start
to explore this possibility somewhat systematically. A first inspection reveals
the presence of many difficulties but - quite surprisingly - most of them have
an interesting solution. In particular, it is possible to regularize the
lattice theory on a Lefschetz thimble, where the imaginary part of the action
is constant and disappears from all observables. This regularization can be
justified in terms of symmetries and perturbation theory. Moreover, it is
possible to design a Monte Carlo algorithm that samples the configurations in
the thimble. This is done by simulating, effectively, a five dimensional
system. We describe the algorithm in detail and analyze its expected cost and
stability. Unfortunately, the measure term also produces a phase which is not
constant and it is currently very expensive to compute. This residual sign
problem is expected to be much milder, as the dominant part of the integral is
not affected, but we have still no convincing evidence of this. However, the
main goal of this paper is to introduce a new approach to the sign problem,
that seems to offer much room for improvements. An appealing feature of this
approach is its generality. It is illustrated first in the simple case of a
scalar field theory with chemical potential, and then extended to the more
challenging case of QCD at finite baryonic density.

in which matter slows down from the highly supersonic orbital velocity of the
disk to the rotational velocity of the star. We perform high resolution 2D
hydrodynamical simulations in the equatorial plane of an astrophysical boundary
layer with the goal of exploring the dynamics of non-axisymmetric structures
that form there. We generically find that the supersonic shear in the boundary
layer excites non-axisymmetric quasi-stationary acoustic modes that are trapped
between the surface of the star and a Lindblad resonance in the disk. These
modes rotate in a prograde fashion, are stable for hundreds of orbital periods,
and have a pattern speed that is less than and of order the rotational velocity
at the inner edge of the disk. The origin of these intrinsically global modes
is intimately related to the operation of a corotation amplifier in the system.
Dissipation of acoustic modes in weak shocks provides a universal mechanism for
angular momentum and mass transport even in purely hydrodynamic (i.e.
non-magnetized) boundary layers. We discuss the possible implications of these
trapped modes for explaining the variability seen in accreting compact objects.

Though the
tidal perturbation induced by Earth and super-Earth mass planets is generally
too weak to significantly modify the structure of the disk, the interaction is
potentially strong enough to cause the planets to undergo rapid type I
migration. This physical process may provide a source of short-period
super-Earths, though it may also pose a challenge to the emergence and
retention of cores on long-period orbits with sufficient mass to evolve into
gas giants. Previous numerical simulations have shown that the type I migration
rate sensitively depends upon the circumstellar disk's properties, particularly
the temperature and surface density gradients. Here, we derive these structure
parameters for 1) a self-consistent viscous-disk model based on a constant
\alpha-prescription, 2) an irradiated disk model that takes into account
heating due to the absorption of stellar photons, and 3) a layered-accretion
disk model with variable \alpha-parameter. We show that in the inner
viscously-heated regions of typical protostellar disks, the horseshoe and
corotation torques of super-Earths can exceed their differential Lindblad
torque and cause them to undergo outward migration. However, the temperature
profile due to passive stellar irradiation causes type I migration to be
inwards throughout much of the disk. For disks in which there is outwards
migration, we show that location and the mass range of the ""planet traps""
depends on some uncertain assumptions adopted for these disk models. Competing
physical effects may lead to dispersion in super-Earths' mass-period
distribution.

association of an outgoing soliton wave of gravitons, a ""shell front"" with a
large Lorentz factor derived from the uncertainties in both space and time.
These new equations are combined with the common notions of an all-pervasive
background of gravitons at the Planck limit, the ""Planck sea""; the
identification of the thermodynamic limit with the emission of gravitons in a

the background, the ""Planck sea"", to describe dark energy, black holes, the
inflationary period of the universe, and the arrow of time. These proposals
lead to gravitational waves constituting dark energy. These waves should be
detectable within a few years with pulsar timing arrays. These gravitational
waves can be characterized as uncorrelated solitons, and should also be
detectable with ultra-high precision lunar laser ranging, as well as with
correspondingly precise clocks. The extremely high, but finite Lorentz factor

Grain characteristics in the nearby ISM are obtained from observations of

form of iron oxide. Measurements of the interstellar Ne/O ratio by the

interstellar oxygen in the ISM must be depleted onto dust grains. Local
interstellar abundances are consistent with grain destruction in ~150 km/s
interstellar shocks, provided that the carbonaceous component is hydrogenated
amorphous carbon and carbon abundances are correct. Variations in relative
abundances of refractories in gas suggest variations in the history of grain
destruction in nearby ISM. The large observed grains, > 1 micron, may indicate
a nearby reservoir of denser ISM. Theoretical three-dimensional models of the

galactic nuclei that occurs when an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) is
migrating on an eccentric orbit through the stellar cluster towards the central
supermassive black hole (SMBH). We find that, apart from conventional dynamical
friction, the IMBH experiences an often much stronger systematic torque due to
the secular (i.e., orbit-averaged) interactions with the cluster's stars. The
force which results in this torque is applied, counterintuitively, in the same
direction as the IMBH's precession and we refer to its action as
""secular-dynamical anti-friction"" (SDAF). We argue that SDAF, and not the
gravitational ejection of stars, is responsible for the IMBH's eccentricity
increase seen in the initial stages of previous N-body simulations. Our
numerical experiments, supported by qualitative arguments, demonstrate that (1)
when the IMBH's precession direction is artificially reversed, the torque
changes sign as well, which decreases the orbital eccentricity, (2) the rate of
eccentricity growth is sensitive to the IMBH migration rate, with zero
systematic eccentricity growth for an IMBH whose orbit is artificially
prevented from inward migration, and (3) SDAF is the strongest when the central
star cluster is rapidly rotating. This leads to eccentricity growth/decrease
for the clusters rotating in the opposite/same direction relative to the IMBH's
orbital motion.

looking at galaxy colors at different redshifts, fixed galaxy mass and
environment, offers a powerful diagnosis to disentangle the role of each. In
this work, we study the simulateneous dependence of the fraction of blue
galaxies fblue on secular evolution, environment and galaxy mass with a
well-controlled cluster sample. We are thus able to study the evolution and
respective role of the cessation of star formation history (SFH) in clusters
due to galaxy mass (""mass quenching"") or to environment (""environmental

with 0 < z < 1 and one cluster at z \sim 2.2), having similar masses and
well-defined sizes. Using multicolor photometry and a large spectroscopic
sample to calibrate photometric redshifts, we carefully estimate fblue for each
cluster at different galaxy mass and cluster-centric distance bins. We then fit
with a simple model the dependence of fblue on redshift (z), environment
(r/r200) and galaxy mass (M). fblue increases with cluster-centric distance
with a slope $1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$, decreases with galaxy mass with a slope
$-3.8^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$, and increases with redshift with a slope
$3.2^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$. The data also require for the first time a differential
evolution with galaxy mass of fblue with redshift, with lower mass galaxies
evolving slower by a factor $-4.1^{+1.1}_{-0.9}$. Our study shows that the
processes responsible for the cessation of star formation in clusters are
effective at all epochs (z<2.2), and more effective in denser environments and
for more massive galaxies. We found that the mass and environmental quenchings
are separable, that environmental quenching does not change with epoch, and
that mass quenching is a dynamical process, i.e. its evolutionary rate is
mass-dependent. [Abridged]

total velocities between 40 and 45 km/s. For a core velocity dispersion sigma_c
= 13.4 km/s, this corresponds to up to 3.4 sigma_c. These velocities are close
to the estimated escape velocity (~ 50 km/s) and suggest an ejection from the
core. Two of these stars have been confirmed in our recent integral field
spectroscopy data and we will discuss them in more detail here. These two red
giants are located at a projected distance of ~ 0.3 pc from the center.
According to their positions on the color magnitude diagram, both stars are
cluster members. We investigate several possible origins for the high
velocities of the stars and conceivable ejection mechanisms. Since the
velocities are close to the escape velocity, it is not obvious whether the
stars are bound or unbound to the cluster. We therefore consider both cases in
our analysis. We perform numerical simulations of three-body dynamical
encounters between binaries and single stars and compare the resulting velocity
distributions of escapers with the velocities of our stars. We compare the
predictions for a single dynamical encounter with a compact object with those
of a sequence of two-body encounters due to relaxation. If the stars are
unbound, the encounter must have taken place recently, when the stars were
already in the giant phase. After including binary fractions and black-hole
retention fractions, projection effects, and detection probabilities from
Monte-Carlo simulations, we estimate the expected numbers of detections for all
the different scenarios. Based on these numbers, we conclude that the most
likely scenario is that the stars are bound and were accelerated by a single
encounter between a binary of main-sequence stars and a ~ 10 M_sun black hole.

coexists with a Bose-Einstein condensate while for strong interaction the
system is incompressible but still characterized by a Fermi surface of
composite fermions. At the critical point, the spectral function of the
fermions, A(k,w), exhibits a pseudo-gapped behavior, rising as |w| at the Fermi
momentum, while in the Mott phase it is fully gapped. Taking into account the
interaction between the critical modes leads at very low temperatures either to
p-wave pairing or the transition is driven weakly first order. The same
mechanism should also be important in antiferromagnetic metals with a small
Fermi surface.

Past observations of L>~L* galaxies at redshift >~3 have provided upper limits

relatively high fesc (>10%) seem to be particularly rare at these luminosities,
there is therefore the need to explore fainter limits. Before the advent of
giant ground based telescopes, one viable way to probe fesc down to 0.05-0.15L*
is to exploit strong lensing magnification. This is investigated with Monte
Carlo simulations that take into account the current observational
capabilities. Adopting a lensing cross-section of 10 arcmin^2 within which the
magnification is higher than 1 (achievable with about 4-5 galaxy clusters),
with a U-band survey depth of 30(30.5) (AB, 1-sigma), it is possible to
constrain fesc for z~3 star-forming galaxies down to 15(10)% at 3-sigma for
L<0.15L* luminosities. This is particularly interesting if fesc increases at
fainter luminosities, as predicted from various HI reionization scenarios and
radiation transfer modelling. Ongoing observational programs on galaxy clusters

milliarcsecond scale maps. Since stellar feedback processes are expected to
diminish the filling factor of cold neutral medium over 0.5<z<1, this lack of

substantially enhance the Higgs di-photon rate at the LHC even with a reduced

di-boson searches, especially in the experimentally clean channel where the

showing that it requires the circular velocity to drop more steeply than

step towards removing the bias in GRB samples that is caused by optically-dark

few GeV below the (absolute) vacuum stability bound on the Higgs mass in the
Standard Model (SM), assuming a Planck mass ultraviolet (UV) cutoff. In this
paper, we study some implications of a 125 GeV Higgs boson for new physics in
terms of the vacuum stability bound. We first consider the seesaw extension of
the SM and find that in type III seesaw, the vacuum stability bound on the
Higgs mass can be as low as 125 GeV for the seesaw scale around a TeV. Next we
dicuss some alternative new physics models which provide an effective
ultraviolet cutoff lower than the Planck mass. An effective cutoff \Lambda
\simeq 10^{11} GeV leads to a vacuum stability bound on the Higgs mass of 125
GeV. In a gauge-Higgs unification scenario with five-dimensional flat
spacetime, the so-called gauge-Higgs condition allows us to predict a Higgs
mass of 125 GeV, with the compactification scale of the extra-dimension being
identified as the cutoff scale \Lambda \simeq 10^{11} GeV. Identifying the
compactification scale with the unification scale of the SM SU(2) gauge

galaxy size, stellar mass and specific star-formation rate (sSFR) at redshifts
1.3<z<1.5. Based on a mass complete (M_star >= 6x10^10 Msun), spectroscopic
sample from the UKIDSS Ultra-deep Survey (UDS), with accurate stellar-mass
measurements derived from spectro photometric fitting, we find that at z~1.4
the location of massive galaxies on the size-mass plane is determined primarily
by their sSFR. At this epoch we find that massive galaxies which are passive
(sSFR <= 0.1 Gyr^-1) follow a tight size-mass relation, with half-light radii a
factor f=2.4+/-0.2 smaller than their local counterparts. Moreover, amongst the
passive sub-sample we find no evidence that the off-set from the local
size-mass relation is a function of stellar population age. Based on a
sub-sample with dynamical mass estimates we also derive an independent estimate
of f=2.3+/-0.3 for the typical growth in half-light radius between z~1.4 and
the present day. Focusing on the passive sub-sample, we conclude that to
produce the necessary evolution predominantly via major mergers would require
an unfeasible number of merger events and over populate the high-mass end of
the local stellar mass function. In contrast, we find that a scenario in which
mass accretion is dominated by minor mergers can produce the necessary
evolution, whereby an increase in stellar mass by a factor of ~2, accompanied
by an increase in size by a factor of ~3.5, is sufficient to reconcile the
size-mass relation at z~1.4 with that observed locally. Finally, we note that a
significant fraction (44+/-12%) of the passive galaxies in our sample have a
disk-like morphology, providing additional evidence that separate physical
processes are responsible for the quenching of star-formation and the
morphological transformation of massive galaxies (abridged).

1) the 11-yr Schwabe sunspot number cycle is constrained between the spring
tidal period of Jupiter and Saturn, 9.93 yr, and the tidal orbital period of
Jupiter, 11.86 yr, and a model based on these cycles reconstructs solar
dynamics at multiple time ; 2) a measure of the alignment of Venus, Earth and
Jupiter reveals quasi 11.07-yr cycles well correlated to the 11-year Schwabe
solar cycles; 3) there exists a 11.08 yr cyclical recurrence in the solar
jerk-shock vector, which is induced mostly by Mercury and Venus. However,
Newtonian classical physics fails to explain the phenomenon. Only by means of a
significant nuclear fusion amplification of the tidal gravitational potential
energy released in the Sun, may planetary tides produce irradiance output
oscillations with a sufficient magnitude to influence solar dynamo processes.
Here we use an adaptation of the well-known mass-luminosity relation to
calculate a conversion factor between the solar luminosity and the potential
gravitational power associated to the mass lost by nuclear fusion: the average
estimated amplification factor is A=4,250,000. We use this magnification factor
to evaluate the theoretical luminosity oscillations that planetary tides may
potentially stimulate inside the solar core by making its nuclear fusion rate
oscillate. By converting the power related to this energy into solar irradiance
units at 1 AU we find that the tidal oscillations may be able to theoretically
induce an oscillating luminosity increase from 0.05-0.65 $W/m^{2}$ to 0.25-1.63
$W/m^{2}$, which is a range compatible with the ACRIM satellite observed total
solar irradiance fluctuations. In conclusion, the Sun, by means of its nuclear
active core, may be working as a great amplifier of the small planetary tidal
energy dissipated in it.

neutrino driven wind is proton rich during its entire life, precluding
$r$-process nucleosynthesis and the synthesis of Sr, Y, and Zr. This work
relied on charged current neutrino interaction rates that are appropriate for a
free nucleon gas. Here, it is shown in detail that the inclusion of the nucleon
potential energies and collisional broadening of the response significantly
alters this conclusion. Iso-vector interactions, which give rise to the nuclear
symmetry energy, produce a difference between the neutron and proton
single-particle energies $\Delta U=U_n-U_p$ and alter the kinematics of the
charged current reactions. In neutron-rich matter, and for a given
neutrino/antineutrino energy, the rate for $\nu_e+n\rightarrow e^-+p$ is
enhanced while $ \bar{\nu}_e+p\rightarrow n+e^+$ is suppressed because the $Q$
value for these reactions is altered by $\pm\Delta U$, respectively. In the
neutrino decoupling region, collisional broadening acts to enhance both $\nu_e$
and $\bar{\nu}_e$ cross-sections and RPA corrections decrease the $\nu_e$
cross-section and increase the $\bar \nu_e$ cross-section, but mean field
shifts have a larger effect. Therefore, electron neutrinos decouple at lower
temperature than when the nucleons are assumed to be free and have lower
average energies. The change is large enough to allow for a reasonable period
of time when the neutrino driven wind is predicted to be neutron rich. It is
also shown that the electron fraction in the wind is influenced by the nuclear
symmetry energy.

potentially improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. Here
we add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison to

as many observational constraints as possible. We improve our photometry and
correct empirically for differential reddening effects. We then perform an
extensive comparison of the CMDs and eclipsing binary measurements to Victoria

spectrum of the star 2-17 to improve [Fe/H] constraints. We find a best
estimate of the age of ~8.3 Gyr while demonstrating that remaining age
uncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the CNO abundances. The helium

emission at different wavenumbers, which are compared with those of the [O III]

spectral fitting shows that two dust modified blackbody components with
temperatures of ~20 K and ~50 K can reproduce most of the continuum spectra.

top of a modified blackbody continuum around 80 - 90 cm^-1 (110 - 130 microns).
The warmer dust component is spatially correlated well with the [O III]

represents a dust feature, which is found to be spatially correlated with the

formation in dense cores of molecular clouds that are magnetized to a realistic
level. If all of the magnetic flux of a typical core were to be dragged into
the central star, the stellar field strength would be orders of magnitude
higher than the observed values. This well-known ""magnetic flux problem"" can in
principle be resolved through non-ideal MHD effects. Two dimensional
(axisymmetric) calculations have shown that ambipolar diffusion, in particular,
can transport magnetic flux outward relative to matter, allowing material to
enter the central object without dragging the field lines along. We show
through simulations that such axisymmetric protostellar accretion flows are
unstable in three dimensions to magnetic interchange instability in the
azimuthal direction. The instability is driven by the magnetic flux
redistributed from the matter that enters the central object. It typically
starts to develop during the transition from the prestellar phase of star
formation to the protostellar mass accretion phase. In the latter phase, the
magnetic flux is transported outward mainly through advection, by strongly
magnetized low-density regions that expand against the collapsing inflow. The
tussle between the gravity-driven infall and magnetically driven expansion
leads to a filamentary inner accretion flow, more disordered than previously
pictured. The efficient outward transport of magnetic flux by advection lowers
the field strength at small radii, making the magnetic braking less efficient
and the formation of rotationally supported disks easier in principle. However,
we find no evidence for such disks in any of our rotating collapse simulations.
We conclude that the inner protostellar accretion flow is shaped to a large
extent by this magnetic interchange instability. How disks form in such an
environment is unclear.

$N_c$, traffic jam occurs only when MT length $N>N_c$. The jammed length of MT
increases with total MT length, while the non-jammed MT length might not change
monotonically with the total MT length. The critical value $N_c$ increases with

their environment. With the discovery of spontaneous parametric down-conversion
(SPDC) in nonlinear crystals, an efficient source for entangled photon pairs,
so-called biphotons, became available. It has recently been shown that SPDC can
also be implemented in nonlinear arrays of evanescently coupled waveguides
which allows the generation and the investigation of correlated quantum walks
of such biphotons in an integrated device. Here, we analytically and
experimentally demonstrate that the biphoton degrees of freedom are entailed in
an additional spatial dimension, therefore the SPDC and the subsequent quantum
random walk in one-dimensional (1D) arrays can be simulated through classical
optical beam propagation in a two-dimensional (2D) photonic lattice. Thereby,
the output intensity images directly represent the biphoton correlations and
exhibit a clear violation of a Bell-type inequality.

on the quiescent dense gas. Using HARP at the JCMT, we mapped the B59 region
with the J=3-2 transition of 12CO to study the kinematics and energetics of the
outflows, and 13CO and C18O to study the overall dynamics of the ambient cloud,
the physical properties of the gas, and the hierarchical structure of the
region. The B59 region has a total of 30Msun of cold and quiescent material,
mostly gravitationally bound, with narrow line widths throughout. Such low
levels of turbulence in non-star-forming sites of B59 are indicative of the
intrinsic initial conditions of the cloud. On the other hand, close to the
forming protostars the impact of the outflows is observed as a localised
increase of both line widths from 0.3 to 1 km/s, and 13CO excitation
temperatures by 2-3K. The impact of the outflows is also evident in the low
column density material which shows signs of being pushed, shaped and carved by
the outflow bow shocks as they pierce their way out of the cloud. Much of this
structure is readily apparent in a dendrogram analysis of the cloud. The low
mass of B59 together with its intrinsically quiescent gas and small number of
protostars, allows the identification of specific regions where the outflows
from the embedded sources interact the dense gas. Our study suggests that
outflows are an important mechanism for injecting and sustaining supersonic
turbulence at sub-parsec size scales. We find that less than half of the

turbulent energy is sufficient to slow down the collapse of the region.

designers. On the one hand, complements are common in the standard motivating
applications for combinatorial auctions, like spectrum license auctions. On the
other, welfare maximization in the presence of complements is notoriously
difficult, and this intractability has stymied theoretical progress in the
area. For example, there are no known positive results for combinatorial
auctions in which bidder valuations are multi-parameter and
non-complement-free, other than the relatively weak results known for general
valuations.
  To make inroads on the problem of combinatorial auction design in the
presence of complements, we propose a model for valuations with complements
that is parameterized by the ""size"" of the complements. A valuation in our
model is represented succinctly by a weighted hypergraph, where the size of the
hyper-edges corresponds to degree of complementarity. Our model permits a
variety of computationally efficient queries, and non-trivial
welfare-maximization algorithms and mechanisms.
  We design the following polynomial-time approximation algorithms and truthful
mechanisms for welfare maximization with bidders with hypergraph valuations.
  1- For bidders whose valuations correspond to subgraphs of a known graph that
is planar (or more generally, excludes a fixed minor), we give a truthful and
(1+epsilon)-approximate mechanism.
  2- We give a polynomial-time, r-approximation algorithm for welfare
maximization with hypergraph-r valuations. Our algorithm randomly rounds a
compact linear programming relaxation of the problem.
  3- We design a different approximation algorithm and use it to give a
polynomial-time, truthful-in-expectation mechanism that has an approximation
factor of O(log^r m).

This difference influences the electronic structure of the valence electrons,
thereby giving stereo sensitivity to chemistry and biology. We show that
attosecond and re-collision science provides a detailed and sensitive probe of
electronic asymmetry. On each 1/2 cycle of an intense light pulse,
laser-induced tunnelling extracts an electron wave packet from the molecule.
When the electron wave packet recombines, alternately from one side of the
molecule or the other, its amplitude and phase asymmetry determines the even
and odd harmonics radiation that it generates. This harmonic spectrum encodes
three manifestations of asymmetry; an amplitude and phase asymmetry in electron
tunneling; an asymmetry in the phase that the electron wave packet accumulates
relative to the ion between the moment of ionization and recombination; and an
asymmetry in the amplitude and phase of the transition moment. We report the
first measurement of high harmonics from oriented gas samples. We determine the
phase asymmetry of the attosecond XUV pulses emitted when an electron
recollides from opposite sides of the CO molecule, and the phase asymmetry of
the recollision electron just before recombination. We discuss how the various
contributions to asymmetry can be isolated in future experiments.

Li abundances are derived from the LiI 6707.8 A line measured in
high-resolution spectra using MARCS model atmospheres. Furthermore, masses of
the stars are determined from the logTeff - logg diagram by interpolating
between Yonsei-Yale evolutionary tracks. There is no significant systematic
difference in the lithium abundances of high- and low-alpha halo stars. For the
large majority of stars with masses 0.7 < M/M_sun < 0.9 and heavy-element mass
fractions 0.001 < Z < 0.006, the Li abundance is well fitted by a relation
A(Li) = a0 + a1 M + a2 Z + a3 M Z, where a0, a1, a2, and a3 are constants.
Extrapolating this relation to Z = 0 leads to a Li abundance close to the
primordial value predicted from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations
and the WMAP baryon density. The relation, however, does not apply to stars
with [Fe/H] < -1.5. We suggest that metal-rich halo stars were formed with a Li
abundance close to the primordial value, and that lithium in their atmospheres
has been depleted in time with an approximately linear dependence on stellar
mass and Z. The lack of a systematic difference in the Li abundances of high-

  planar formulas","20 pages",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we build on the idea of Valiant \cite{Val79a} and
Ben-Dor/Halevi \cite{Ben93}, that is, to count the number of satisfying
solutions of a boolean formula via computing the permanent of a specially
constructed matrix. We show that the Desnanot-Jacobi identity ($\dji$) prevents
Valiant's original approach to achieve a parsimonious reduction to the
permanent over a field of characteristic two. As the next step, since the
computation of the permanent is $#\classP$-complete, we make use of the
equality of the permanent and the number of perfect matchings in an unweighted
graph's bipartite double cover. Whenever this bipartite double cover (BDC) is
planar, the number of perfect matchings can be counted in polynomial time using
Kasteleyn's algorithm \cite{Kas67}. To enforce planarity of the BDC, we replace
Valiant's original gadgets with new gadgets and describe what properties these
gadgets must have. We show that the property of \textit{circular planarity}
plays a crucial role to find the correct gadgets for a counting problem. To
circumvent the $\dji$-barrier, we switch over to fields
$\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, for a prime $p > 2$.
  With this approach we are able to count the number of solutions for
$\forestdreisat$ formulas in randomized polynomial time. Finally, we present a
conjecture that states which kind of generalized gadgets can not be found,
since otherwise one could prove $\classRP = \classNP$. The conjecture
establishes a relationship between the determinants of the minors of a graph
$\grG$'s adjacency matrix and the \textit{circular planar} structure of
$\grG$'s BDC regarding a given set of nodes.

namely to the proof that every proper orthochronous isometry of Minkowski
spacetime, which sends some point to its chronological future, is generated
through the frame displacement of an observer which moves with constant
acceleration and constant angular velocity. The acceleration and angular
velocity can be chosen either aligned or perpendicular, and in the latter case
the angular velocity can be chosen equal or smaller than than the acceleration.
We start reviewing the classical Euler's and Chasles' theorems both in the Lie
algebra and group versions. We recall the relativistic generalization of
Euler's theorem and observe that every (infinitesimal) transformation can be
recovered from information of algebraic and geometric type, the former being
identified with the conjugacy class and the latter with some additional
geometric ingredients (the screw axis in the usual non-relativistic version).
Then the proper orthochronous inhomogeneous Lorentz Lie group is studied in
detail. We prove its exponentiality and identify a causal semigroup and the
corresponding Lie cone. Through the identification of new Ad-invariants we
classify the conjugacy classes, and show that those which admit a causal
representative have special physical significance. These results imply a
classification of the inequivalent Killing vector fields of Minkowski spacetime
which we express through simple representatives. Finally, we arrive at the
mentioned generalization of Chasles' theorem.

collection of training samples. The mainstream approach would be to learn an
overcomplete dictionary to provide good approximations of the training samples
using sparse synthesis coefficients. This famous sparse model has a less well
known counterpart, in analysis form, called the cosparse analysis model. In
this new model, signals are characterised by their parsimony in a transformed
domain using an overcomplete (linear) analysis operator. We propose to learn an
analysis operator from a training corpus using a constrained optimisation
framework based on L1 optimisation. The reason for introducing a constraint in
the optimisation framework is to exclude trivial solutions. Although there is
no final answer here for which constraint is the most relevant constraint, we
investigate some conventional constraints in the model adaptation field and use
the uniformly normalised tight frame (UNTF) for this purpose. We then derive a
practical learning algorithm, based on projected subgradients and
Douglas-Rachford splitting technique, and demonstrate its ability to robustly
recover a ground truth analysis operator, when provided with a clean training
set, of sufficient size. We also find an analysis operator for images, using
some noisy cosparse signals, which is indeed a more realistic experiment. As
the derived optimisation problem is not a convex program, we often find a local
minimum using such variational methods. Some local optimality conditions are
derived for two different settings, providing preliminary theoretical support
for the well-posedness of the learning problem under appropriate conditions.

the logarithm of the guesswork satisfies a Large Deviation Principle (LDP),
providing direct estimates of the guesswork distribution when passwords are
long. The rate function governing the LDP possess a specific, restrictive form
that encapsulates underlying structure in the nature of guesswork. Returning to
Massey's original observation, a corollary to the LDP shows that expectation of
the logarithm of the guesswork is the specific Shannon entropy of the password

among several agents. The problem becomes non-trivial when the agents have
different valuations for different parts of the cake (i.e. one agent may like
chocolate while the other may like cream). A fair division of the cake is one
that takes into account the individual valuations of agents and partitions the
cake based on some fairness criterion. Fair division may be accomplished in a
distributed or centralized way. Due to its natural and practical appeal, it has
been a subject of study in economics. To best of our knowledge the role of
partial information in fair division has not been studied so far from an
information theoretic perspective. In this paper we study two important
algorithms in fair division, namely ""divide and choose"" and ""adjusted winner""
for the case of two agents. We quantify the benefit of negotiation in the
divide and choose algorithm, and its use in tricking the adjusted winner
algorithm. Also we analyze the role of implicit information transmission
through actions for the repeated divide and choose problem by finding a
trembling hand perfect equilibrium for an specific setup. Lastly we consider a
centralized algorithm for maximizing the overall welfare of the agents under
the Nash collective utility function (CUF). This corresponds to a clustering
problem of the type traditionally studied in data mining and machine learning.
Drawing a conceptual link between this problem and the portfolio selection
problem in stock markets, we prove an upper bound on the increase of the Nash

used in many contexts where mixed continuous and discrete multivariate
responses are observed in an effort to quantify an unobservable continuous
measurement. In our example, the latent, or unobservable measurement is wetland
condition. While predicted values of the latent wetland condition variable
produced by the model at each location do not hold any intrinsic value, the
relative magnitudes of the wetland condition values are of interest. In
addition, by including point-referenced covariates in the model, we are able to
make predictions at new locations for both the latent random variable and the
multivariate response. Lastly, the model produces ranks of the multivariate
responses in relation to the unobserved latent random field. This is an
important result as it allows us to determine which response variables are most
closely correlated with the latent variable. Our approach offers an alternative
to traditional indices based on best professional judgment that are frequently
used in ecology. We apply our model to assess wetland condition in the North
Platte and Rio Grande River Basins in Colorado. The model facilitates a
comparison of wetland condition at multiple locations and ranks the importance
of in-field measurements.

attributed large (O-C) deviations between the eclipse ephemeris and

the Keplerian, kinematic model of the Light Travel Time (LTT) effect and
re-analyse the whole currently available data set. We add almost 60 new, yet
unpublished, mostly precision light curves obtained using the time
high-resolution photo-polarimeter OPTIMA, as well as photometric observations
performed at the MONET/N, PIRATE and TCS telescopes. We determine new
mid--egress times with a mean uncertainty at the level of 1 second or better.
We claim that because the observations that currently exist in the literature
are non-homogeneous with respect to spectral windows (ultraviolet, X-ray,
visual, polarimetric mode) and the reported mid--egress measurements errors,
they may introduce systematics that affect orbital fits. Indeed, we find that
the published data, when taken literally, cannot be explained by any unique
solution. Many qualitatively different and best-fit 2-planet configurations,
including self-consistent, Newtonian N-body solutions may be able to explain
the data. However, using high resolution, precision OPTIMA light curves, we
find that the (O-C) deviations are best explained by the presence of a single
circumbinary companion orbiting at a distance of ~4.5 AU with a small
eccentricity and having ~7 Jupiter-masses. This object could be the next
circumbinary planet detected from the ground, similar to the announced
companions around close binaries HW Vir, NN Ser, UZ For, DP Leo or SZ Her, and
planets of this type around Kepler-16, Kepler-34 and Kepler-35.

framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics like work, heat
and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined
non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is
still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature.
Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser
traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single
molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices
involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy
balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. Various integral and
detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach
from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat
and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of
non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly
strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem
involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts
include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of
measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and
irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power,
can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two
classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones like molecular motors, and heat
engines like thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle
decomposition of entropy production.

--- uniform phase --- nonuniform phase. This phenomenon is caused by the
interplay between the dipole (ferromagnetic) and quadrupole (dielectric and

have found that these re-entrant Freedericksz transitions exhibit tricritical
behavior, i.e., they can be of the first or the second order. The character of
the transitions depends on a degree of redistribution of magnetic admixture in
the sample exposed to uniform magnetic field (magnetic segregation). We
demonstrate how electric and magnetic fields can change the order of
orientational transitions in ferronematics. We show that electric Freedericksz
transitions in ferronematics subjected to magnetic field have no re-entrant
nature. Tricritical segregation parameters for the transitions induced by
