and radio galaxies may imply the existence of high energy electrons in these
extended jets, and these electrons could produce high energy emission through
inverse Compton (IC) process. In this paper we study the non-variable hard TeV
emission from a blazar. The multi-band emission consists of two components: one
is the traditional synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from the inner jet,
and the other is the emission produced via SSC and IC scattering of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) photons (IC/CMB) and extragalactic background light
(EBL) photons (IC/EBL) by relativistic electrons in the extended jet under the
stochastic acceleration scenario. Such a model is applied to 1ES 1101-232. The
results indicate that (1) the non-variable hard TeV emission of 1ES 1101-232
can be reproduced well, which is dominated by IC/CMB emission from the extended
jet, using three characteristic values of Doppler factor ($\delta_{\rm
D}=5,10,15$) for the TeV emitting region in the extended jet; and (2) in the
cases of $\delta_{\rm D}=15$ and 10, the physical parameters can achieve the
equipartition (or quasi-equipartition) between the relativistic electrons and
the magnetic field; In contrast, the physical parameters largely deviate from
the equipartition for the case of $\delta_{\rm D}=5$. It is therefore concluded
that the TeV emission region of 1ES 1101-232 in the extended jet should be
moderately or highly beamed.

pseudogap regime when the interaction strength is large enough to yield the
Mott insulating phase at half filling. The symmetry breaking accompanies the
recovery of quasiparticle weights along one of the two antinodal directions,

of differences in spatio-temporal networks across groups of subjects or
experimental conditions. Unsupervised clustering and independent component
analysis (ICA) have been used to identify such spatio-temporal networks. While
these approaches have been useful for estimating these networks at the
subject-level, comparisons over groups or experimental conditions require
further methodological development. In this paper, we tackle this problem by
showing how self-organizing maps (SOMs) can be compared within a Frechean
inferential framework. Here, we summarize the mean SOM in each group as a
Frechet mean with respect to a metric on the space of SOMs. We consider the use
of different metrics, and introduce two extensions of the classical sum of
minimum distance (SMD) between two SOMs, which take into account the
spatio-temporal pattern of the fMRI data. The validity of these methods is
illustrated on synthetic data. Through these simulations, we show that the
three metrics of interest behave as expected, in the sense that the ones
capturing temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal aspects of the SOMs are more
likely to reach significance under simulated scenarios characterized by
temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal differences, respectively. In addition, a
re-analysis of a classical experiment on visually-triggered emotions
demonstrates the usefulness of this methodology. In this study, the
multivariate functional patterns typical of the subjects exposed to pleasant
and unpleasant stimuli are found to be more similar than the ones of the
subjects exposed to emotionally neutral stimuli. Taken together, these results
indicate that our proposed methods can cast new light on existing data by
adopting a global analytical perspective on functional MRI paradigms.

They form impurity bands for small $x$, which broaden as $x$ increases. They

magnetic interactions between the `defect' and the `parent' atoms are
relatively weak, while chemical fluctuations are prevalent for low $x$.
Fluctuations of either type leads to the formation of a weakly metallic state.

approach, which is efficient and easily extendable to arbitrary geometries.
Quantum reflection of atoms from a nanotube may become a significant factor at
low temperatures, especially for non-metallic tubes. Interatomic interactions
are shown to increase the rate at which atoms are lost to the nanotube and lead
to non-trivial dynamics. Thermal nanotube vibrations do not significantly

contains a significant and potentially detectable and clean imprint of Baryonic
Acoustic Oscillations. Although the BAO signal in the skewness has a lower
amplitude than second order measures like the two-point correlation function
and power spectrum, it has the advantage of a considerably lower sensitivity to
systematic influences. Because it lacks a direct dependence on bias if this
concerns simple linear bias, skewness will be considerably less beset by
uncertainties due to galaxy bias. Also, it has a weaker sensitivity to redshift
distortion effects. We use perturbation theory to evaluate the magnitude of the
effect on the volume-average skewness, for various cosmological models. One
important finding of our analysis is that the skewness BAO signal occurs at
smaller scales than that in second order statistics. For an LCDM spectrum with

order in high-$T_c$ superconductor, and examine the role played by gapless
fermionic degrees of freedom. Apart from the competitive interaction with the
superconducting order parameter, the nematic order parameter couples strongly
to gapless nodal quasiparticles. The interplay of these two kinds of
interactions is analyzed by means of renormalization group method. In case the
fermionic degree of freedom are entirely neglected, the competitive interaction
between two bosonic order parameters is strongly relevant, and can lead to
runaway behavior. However, these properties are fundamentally changed once the
dynamics of fermions are taken into account. At the nematic quantum critical
point where an extreme fermion velocity anisotropy occurs, the superconducting
and nematic order parameters are decoupled from each other. Consequently, the
phase transitions are continuous, and d-wave superconductivity can coexist with
nematic order homogeneously. These results indicate that the gapless fermions
can play an important role and should be carefully included in the theoretical
description of competing orders.

$X$ as a dense subspace. For an extension $Y$ of $X$ the subspace $Y\backslash
X$ of $Y$ is called the remainder of $Y$. Two extensions of $X$ are said to be
equivalent if there is a homeomorphism between them which fixes $X$ pointwise.
For two (equivalence classes of) extensions $Y$ and $Y'$ of $X$ let $Y\leq Y'$
if there is a continuous mapping of $Y'$ into $Y$ which fixes $X$ pointwise.
Let $P$ be a topological property. An extension $Y$ of $X$ is called a
$P$-extension of $X$ if it has $P$. If $P$ is compactness then $P$-extensions
are called ompactifications.
  The aim of this article is to introduce and study classes of extensions
(which we call compactification-like $P$-extensions, where $P$ is a topological
property subject to some mild requirements) which resemble the classes of
compactifications of locally compact spaces. We formally define
compactification-like $P$-extensions and derive some of their basic properties,
and in the case when the remainders are countable, we characterize spaces
having such extensions. We will then consider the classes of
compactification-like $P$-extensions as partially ordered sets. This
consideration leads to some interesting results which characterize
compactification-like $P$-extensions of a space among all its Tychonoff
$P$-extensions with compact remainder. Furthermore, we study the relations
between the order-structure of classes of compactification-like $P$-extensions
of a Tychonoff space $X$ and the topology of a certain subspace of its
outgrowth $\beta X\backslash X$. We conclude with some applications, including
an answer to an old question of S. Mr\'{o}wka and J.H. Tsai: For what pairs of
topological properties $P$ and $Q$ is it true that every locally-$P$ space with
$Q$ has a one-point extension with both $P$ and $Q$?

predicted to be useful for new terahertz device applications. Terahertz dynamic
conductivity measurements allow us to probe the dynamics of such photon-like
electrons, or massless Dirac fermions. Here, we use terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to investigate
terahertz conductivities of one-dimensional and two-dimensional electrons,

In SWCNTs, we observe extremely anisotropic terahertz conductivities, promising
for terahertz polarizer applications. In graphene, we demonstrate that
terahertz and infrared properties sensitively change with the Fermi energy,

simulations in flat models with a non-evolving equation-of-state of dark energy
w give typical 68% upper bounds on the total neutrino mass of 0.136 eV and
0.098 eV for the inverted and normal hierarchies respectively, assuming the
total summed mass is close to the minimum allowed by the oscillation data for
the respective hierarchies (0.10 eV and 0.06 eV). Including information from
future baryon acoustic oscillation measurements with the complete BOSS, Type 1a
supernovae distance moduli from WFIRST, and a realistic prior on the Hubble
constant, these upper limits shrink to 0.118 eV and 0.080 eV for the inverted

yields percent-level constraints on w. We find tension between our MCMC results
and the results of a Fisher matrix analysis, most likely due to a strong
geometric degeneracy between the total neutrino mass, the Hubble constant, and
w in the unlensed CMB power spectra. If the minimal-mass, normal hierarchy were
realised in nature, the inverted hierarchy should be disfavoured by the full
data combination at typically greater than the 2-sigma level. For the
minimal-mass inverted hierarchy, we compute the Bayes' factor between the two
hierarchies for various combinations of our forecast datasets, and find that
the future probes considered here should be able to provide `strong' evidence
(odds ratio 12:1) for the inverted hierarchy. Finally, we consider potential
biases of the other cosmological parameters from assuming the wrong hierarchy
and find that all biases on the parameters are below their 1-sigma marginalised
errors.

observed to be ~0.4 mag brighter than than that of barred lenticulars. A small
contribution to the observed luminosity difference that is found between SA0
and SB0 galaxies may also be due to the fact that there is an asymmetry between
the effects of small classification errors on SA0 and SB0 galaxies. An E galaxy
might be misclassified as an S0, or an S0 as an E. However, an E will never be
misclassified an SB0, nor will an SB0 ever be called an E. This asymmetry is
important because elliptical (E) galaxies are typically twice as luminous as
lenticular (S0) galaxies. The present results suggest that the evolution of
luminous lenticular galaxies may be closely linked to that of elliptical
galaxies, whereas fainter lenticulars might be more closely associated with
ram-pressure stripped spiral galaxies. Finally it is pointed out that fine
details of the galaxy formation process might account for some of the
differences between the classifications of the same galaxy by individual
competent morphologists.

  Energy-Per-Bit","Several proofs were updated",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When data traffic in a wireless network is bursty, small amounts of data
sporadically become available for transmission, at times that are unknown at
the receivers, and an extra amount of energy must be spent at the transmitters
to overcome this lack of synchronization between the network nodes. In
practice, pre-defined header sequences are used with the purpose of
synchronizing the different network nodes. However, in networks where relays
must be used for communication, the overhead required for synchronizing the
entire network may be very significant.
  In this work, we study the fundamental limits of energy-efficient
communication in an asynchronous diamond network with two relays. We formalize
the notion of relay synchronization by saying that a relay is synchronized if
the conditional entropy of the arrival time of the source message given the
received signals at the relay is small. We show that the minimum energy-per-bit
for bursty traffic in diamond networks is achieved with a coding scheme where
each relay is either synchronized or not used at all. A consequence of this
result is the derivation of a lower bound to the minimum energy-per-bit for
bursty communication in diamond networks. This bound allows us to show that
schemes that perform the tasks of synchronization and communication separately
(i.e., with synchronization signals preceding the communication block) can
achieve the minimum energy-per-bit to within a constant fraction that ranges
from 2 in the synchronous case to 1 in the highly asynchronous regime.

where the cost is energetic expense of plasticity, and benefit is fitness. The
dispersion matrix \Sigma of the genes' response (H = ln|\Sigma|) is used: (i)
in a numerical model as a metric of the phenotypic variance reduction in the
course of fitness optimization, then (ii) in an analytical model, in order to
optimize parameters under the constraint of limited energy availability.
Results lead to speculate that such optimized organisms should maximize their
exergy and thus the direct/indirect work they exert on the habitat. It is shown
that the optimal cost/benefit ratio belongs to an interval in which differences
between individuals should not substantially modify their fitness.
Consequently, even in the case of an ideal population, close to the optimal
plasticity, a certain level of genetic diversity should be long conserved, and
a part, still to be determined, of intra-populations genetic diversity probably
stem from environment fluctuations. Species confronted to monotonous factors
should be less plastic than vicariant species experiencing heterogeneous
environments. Analogies with the MaxEnt algorithm of E.T. Jaynes (1957) are
discussed, leading to the conjecture that this method may be applied even in
case of multivariate but non multinormal distributions of the responses.

gradually increase in the paramagnetic state. At the magnetic ordering

The scaling properties of the avalanches and pinning lines (size and spatial

object. An apparent galaxy merger remnant, it displays signatures of both an
inspiraling, kiloparsec-scale active galactic nucleus (AGN) pair and of a
recoiling AGN with a kick velocity > 1300 km s^-1. Among recoiling AGN
candidates, CID-42 alone has both spatial offsets (in optical and X-ray bands)
and spectroscopic offsets. In order to constrain the relative likelihood of
both scenarios, we develop models using hydrodynamic galaxy merger simulations
coupled with radiative transfer calculations. Our gas-rich, major merger models
are generally well matched to the galactic morphology and to the inferred
stellar mass and star formation rate. We show that a recoiling supermassive
black hole (SMBH) in CID-42 should be observable as an AGN at the time of
observation. However, in order for the recoiling AGN to produce narrow-line
emission, it must be observed shortly after the kick while it still inhabits a
dense gaseous region, implying a large total kick velocity (v_k > 2000 km
s^-1). For the dual AGN scenario, an unusually large broad-line offset is
required, and the best match to the observed morphology requires a galaxy that
is less luminous than CID-42. Further, the lack of X-ray emission from one of
the two optical nuclei is not easily attributed to an intrinsically quiescent
SMBH or to a Compton-thick galactic environment. While the current data do not
allow either the recoiling or the dual AGN scenario for CID-42 to be excluded,
our models highlight the most relevant parameters for distinguishing these
possibilities with future observations. In particular, high-quality,
spatially-resolved spectra that can pinpoint the origin of the broad and narrow
line features will be critical for determining the nature of this unique
source.

distances and is surprisingly cold (sigma_r ~ 50-60 km/s) between 100-150 kpc.
Relating the measured radial velocities to the mass of the Milky Way requires
knowledge of the (unknown) tracer density profile and anisotropy at these
distances. Nonetheless, by assuming the stellar halo stars between 50-150 kpc
have a moderate density fall-off (with power-law slope alpha < 5) and are on
radial orbits (sigma^2_t/sigma^2_r < 1), we infer that the mass within 150 kpc
is less than 10^12 M_solar and suggest it probably lies in the range (5-10) x
10^11 M_solar. We discuss the implications of such a low mass for the Milky
Way.

galaxy NGC 2146. The Ruby Ring, so named due to its appearance, shows a clear
ring-like distribution of star clusters around a central object. It is located
in one of the tidal streams which surround the galaxy. NGC 2146 is part of the
Snapshot Hubble U-band Cluster Survey (SHUCS). The WFC3/F336W data has added
critical information to the available archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging
set of NGC 2146, allowing us to determine ages, masses, and extinctions of the
clusters in the Ruby Ring. These properties have then been used to investigate
the formation of this extraordinary system. We find evidence of a spatial and
temporal correlation between the central cluster and the clusters in the ring.
The latter are about 4 Myr younger than the central cluster, which has an age
of 7 Myr. This result is supported by the H alpha emission which is strongly
coincident with the ring, and weaker at the position of the central cluster.
From the derived total H alpha luminosity of the system we constrain the star
formation rate density to be quite high, e.g. ~ 0.47 Msun/yr/kpc^2. The Ruby
Ring is the product of an intense and localised burst of star formation,
similar to the extended cluster complexes observed in M51 and the Antennae, but
more impressive because is quite isolated. The central cluster contains only 5
% of the total stellar mass in the clusters that are determined within the
complex. The ring-like morphology, the age spread, and the mass ratio support a
triggering formation scenario for this complex. We discuss the formation of the
Ruby Ring in a ""collect & collapse"" framework. The predictions made by this
model agree quite well with the estimated bubble radius and expansion velocity
produced by the feedback from the central cluster, making the Ruby Ring an
interesting case of triggered star formation.

the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field. Unfortunately, since most
blazars have featureless optical spectra that preclude a redshift
determination, a substantial fraction of these VHE extragalactic sources cannot
be used for cosmological studies. To assess whether molecular lines are a
viable way to establish distances, we have undertaken a pilot program at the
IRAM 30m telescope to search for CO lines in three BL Lac objects with known
redshifts. We report a positive detection of M_H2 ~ 3x10^8 Msun toward 1ES
1959+650, but due to the poor quality of the baseline, this value is affected
by a large systematic uncertainty. For the remaining two sources, W Comae and
RGB J0710+591, we derive 3sigma upper limits at, respectively, M_H2 < 8.0x10^8
Msun and M_H2 < 1.6x10^9 Msun, assuming a line width of 150 km/s and a standard
conversion factor alpha=4 M_sun/(K km/s pc^2). If these low molecular gas
masses are typical for blazars, blind redshift searches in molecular lines are
currently unfeasible. However, deep observations are still a promising way to
obtain precise redshifts for sources whose approximate distances are known via
indirect methods. Our observations further reveal a deficiency of molecular gas
in BL Lac objects compared to quasars, suggesting that the host galaxies of
these two types of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are not drawn from the same

approach for signal denoising, source separation and solving inverse problems

of a training data matrix into a dictionary and a sparse coding matrix. The
learned dictionary is characterized by two properties: the coherence of the
dictionary to observations of the signal class, and the self-coherence of the
dictionary atoms. A high coherence to the signal class enables the sparse
coding of signal observations with a small approximation error, while a low
self-coherence of the atoms guarantees atom recovery and a more rapid residual
error decay rate for the sparse coding algorithm. The two goals of high signal
coherence and low self-coherence are typically in conflict, therefore one seeks
a trade-off between them, depending on the application. We present a dictionary
learning method with an effective control over the self-coherence of the

growth rate is measured from redshift-space distortions, i.e. the anisotropy of
the clustering pattern induced by coherent peculiar motions. This is performed
in the overall context of the Euclid spectroscopic survey, which will
simultaneously measure the expansion history of the universe, using the power
spectrum and its baryonic features as a standard ruler, accounting for the
relative degeneracies of expansion and growth parameters. The resulting
expected errors on the growth rate in the different redshift bins, expressed
through the quantity f\sigma_8, range between 1.3% and 4.4%. We discuss the
optimisation of the survey configuration and investigate the important

by following the evolution of models with masses in the range 1M<M<8M
throughthe thermal pulses phase, and assuming that dust forms via condensation
of molecules within a wind expanding isotropically from the stellar surface. We
find that, because of the strong Hot Bottom Burning (HBB) experienced, high
mass models produce silicates, whereas lower mass objects are predicted to be
surrounded by carbonaceous grains; the transition between the two regimes
occurs at a threshold mass of 3.5M. These fndings are consistent with the
results presented in a previous investigation, for Z=0.001. However, in the
present higher metallicity case, the production of silicates in the more
massive stars continues for the whole AGB phase, because the HBB experienced is
softer at Z=0.008 than at Z=0.001, thus the oxygen in the envelope, essential
for the formation of water molecules, is never consumed completely. The total
amount of dust formed for a given mass experiencing HBB increases with
metallicity, because of the higher abundance of silicon, and the softer HBB,
both factors favouring a higher rate of silicates production. This behaviour is
not found in low mass stars,because the carbon enrichment of the stellar
surface layers, due to repeated Third Drege Up episodes, is almost independent
of the metallicity. Regarding cosmic dust enrichment by intermediate mass
stars, we find that the cosmic yield at Z=0.008 is a factor 5 larger than at
Z=0.001. In the lower metallicity case carbon dust dominates after about 300
Myr, but at Z=0.008 the dust mass is dominated by silicates at all times,with a
prompt enrichment occurring after about 40 Myr, associated with the evolution
of stars with masses M =7.5 -8M.

molecular cloud in the ISM. We consider the formation of molecular cloud by
accretion of the HI clouds as suggested in recent observations. The simulation
shows that the initial HI medium is compressed and piled up behind the shock
waves induced by the accretion flows. Since the initial medium is highly
inhomogeneous as a consequence of the thermal instability, the formed molecular
cloud becomes very turbulent owing to the development of the Richtmyer-Meshkov
instability. The structure of the post shock region is composed of dense cold
gas (T<100 K) and diffuse warm gas (T>1,000 K), which are spatially well mixed
owing to the turbulence. Because the energy source of the turbulence is the
accretion flows, the turbulence is highly anisotropic biased toward the
direction of accretion flows. The kinetic energy of the turbulence dominates
the thermal, magnetic, and gravitational energies in the total 10 Myr
evolution. However, the kinetic energy measured by using the
CO-fraction-weighted density is comparable to the other energies. This suggests
that the true kinetic energy of turbulence in molecular cloud as a hole can be
much larger than the kinetic energy of turbulence estimated by line-width of
molecular emissions. The clumps in the molecular cloud show statistically
homogeneous evolution as follows: The typical plasma beta of the clumps is
roughly constant <beta>~ 0.4. The size-velocity dispersion relation show dv ~
1.5 km s^{-1} (l/1 pc)^{0.5}, irrespective of the density. The clumps evolve
toward magnetically supercritical, gravitationally unstable cores. The clumps
seem to evolve into cores that satisfy the condition for fragmentation into
binary. These statistical properties may provide the initial condition of star
formation.

used to classify data, which is one of the most common tasks in observational

using the Gaussian mixture model and show two applications in pulsar astronomy.
After reviewing the Gaussian mixture model and the related
Expectation-Maximization algorithm, we present a data classification method
using the Neyman-Pearson test. To demonstrate the method, we apply the
algorithm to two classification problems. Firstly, it is applied to the well
known period-period derivative diagram, where we find that the pulsar
distribution can be modeled with six Gaussian clusters, with two clusters for
millisecond pulsars (recycled pulsars) and the rest for normal pulsars. From
this distribution, we derive an empirical definition for millisecond pulsars as
$\frac{\dot{P}}{10^{-17}} \leq3.23(\frac{P}{100 \textrm{ms}})^{-2.34}$. The two
millisecond pulsar clusters may have different evolutionary origins, since the
companion stars to these pulsars in the two clusters show different chemical
composition. Four clusters are found for normal pulsars. Possible implications
for these clusters are also discussed. Our second example is to calculate the
likelihood of unidentified \textit{Fermi} point sources being pulsars and rank
them accordingly. In the ranked point source list, the top 5% sources contain
50% known pulsars, the top 50% contain 99% known pulsars, and no known active
galaxy (the other major population) appears in the top 6%. Such a ranked list
can be used to help the future follow-up observations for finding pulsars in
unidentified \textit{Fermi} point sources.

melting of snow or ice. The model is run for a O(10^2) mbar pure CO2
atmosphere, dusty snow, and solar luminosity reduced by 23%. For these
conditions snow only melts near the equator, and only when obliquity >40
degrees, eccentricity >0.12, and perihelion occurs near equinox. These
requirements for melting are satisfied by 0.01-20% of the probability
distribution of Mars' past spin-orbit parameters. Total melt production is
sufficient to account for aqueous alteration of the sedimentary rocks. The
pattern of seasonal snowmelt is integrated over all spin-orbit parameters and
compared to the observed distribution of sedimentary rocks. The global
distribution of snowmelt has maxima in Valles Marineris, Meridiani Planum and
Gale Crater. These correspond to maxima in the sedimentary-rock distribution.
Higher pressures and especially higher temperatures lead to melting over a
broader range of spin-orbit parameters. The pattern of sedimentary rocks on
Mars is most consistent with a Mars paleoclimate that only rarely produced
enough meltwater to precipitate aqueous cements and indurate sediment. The
results suggest intermittency of snowmelt and long globally-dry intervals,
unfavorable for past life on Mars. This model makes testable predictions for
the Mars Science Laboratory rover at Gale Crater. Gale Crater is predicted to
be a hemispheric maximum for snowmelt on Mars.

technological networks is that of network communities, where sets of nodes
organize into densely linked clusters. Even though detection of such
communities is of great interest, understanding the structure communities in
large networks remains relatively limited. Due to unavailability of labeled
ground-truth data it is practically impossible to evaluate and compare
different models and notions of communities on a large scale.
  In this paper we identify 6 large social, collaboration, and information
networks where nodes explicitly state their community memberships. We define
ground-truth communities by using these explicit memberships. We then
empirically study how such ground-truth communities emerge in networks and how
they overlap. We observe some surprising phenomena. First, ground-truth
communities contain high-degree hub nodes that reside in community overlaps and
link to most of the members of the community. Second, the overlaps of
communities are more densely connected than the non-overlapping parts of
communities, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that community overlaps are
more sparsely connected than the communities themselves.
  Existing models of network communities do not capture dense community
overlaps. We present the Community-Affiliation Graph Model (AGM), a conceptual
model of network community structure, which reliably captures the overall
structure of networks as well as the overlapping nature of network communities.

  In this paper we study a set of 230 large real-world social, collaboration

For example, in social networks nodes explicitly join various interest based
social groups. We use such groups to define a reliable and robust notion of
ground-truth communities. We then propose a methodology which allows us to
compare and quantitatively evaluate how different structural definitions of
network communities correspond to ground-truth communities. We choose 13
commonly used structural definitions of network communities and examine their
sensitivity, robustness and performance in identifying the ground-truth. We
show that the 13 structural definitions are heavily correlated and naturally
group into four classes. We find that two of these definitions, Conductance and
Triad-participation-ratio, consistently give the best performance in
identifying ground-truth communities. We also investigate a task of detecting
communities given a single seed node. We extend the local spectral clustering
algorithm into a heuristic parameter-free community detection method that
easily scales to networks with more than hundred million nodes. The proposed
method achieves 30% relative improvement over current local clustering methods.

inhomogeneous cosmological models, the string gravity equations govern the
dynamics of interacting gravitational, dilaton, antisymmetric tensor and any

experiments. Attention is focused on the case of two dimensions, for which
approximate energy and entropy profiles can be calculated analytically.
Simulations and theoretical analysis of the lattice gas highlight the role of
capillary wave-like fluctuations in mediating adsorption. They further point to
ranges of temperature and solute-solvent interaction strength where surface
propensity is expected to be strongest.

pulsar J1833-1034, in the galactic supernova remnant G21.5-0.9. We detect the
presence of 4 glitches in this pulsar over a period of 5.5 years, making it one
of a set of pulsars that show fairly frequent glitches. The glitch amplitudes,
characterized by the fractional change of the rotational frequency, range from
1 \times 10^-9 to 7 \times 10^-9, with no evidence for any appreciable
relaxation of the rotational frequency after the glitches. The fractional
changes observed in the frequency derivative are of the order of 10-5 . We show
conclusively that, in spite of having significant timing noise, the sudden
irregularities like glitches detected in this pulsar can not be modeled as
smooth timing noise. Our timing solution also provides a stable estimate of the
second derivative of the pulsar spin-down model, and a plausible value for the
braking index of 1.857, which, like the value for other such young pulsars, is
much less than the canonical value of 3.0. PSR J1833-1034 appears to belong to
a class of pulsars exhibiting fairly frequent occurrence of low amplitude
glitches. This is further supported by an estimate of the glitch activity
parameter, Ag = 1.53 \times 10^-15 s^-2, which is found to be significantly
lower than the trend of glitch activity versus characteristic age (or spin
frequency derivative) that a majority of the glitching pulsars follow. We
present evidence for a class of such young pulsars, including the Crab, where
higher internal temperature of the neutron star could be responsible for the
nature of the observed glitch activity.

both bound and resonant neutron one-particle energies obtained from spherical

and resonant neutron one-particle levels with smaller orbital angular-momenta
$\ell$, a systematic change of the shell structure and thereby the change of
neutron magic-numbers are pointed out, compared with those of stable nuclei
expected from the conventional j-j shell-model. For spherical shape with the
operator of the spin-orbit potential conventionally used, the $\ell_{j}$ levels
belonging to a given oscillator major shell with parallel spin- and
orbital-angular-momenta tend to gather together in the energetically lower half
of the major shell, while those levels with anti-parallel spin- and
orbital-angular-momenta gather in the upper half. The tendency leads to a
unique shell structure and possible deformation when neutrons start to occupy
the orbits in the lower half of the major shell. Among others, the neutron
magic-number N=28 disappears and N=50 may disappear, while the magic number
N=82 may presumably survive due to the large $\ell =5$ spin-orbit splitting for
the $1h_{11/2}$ orbit. On the other hand, an appreciable amount of energy gap
may appear at N=16 and 40 for spherical shape, while neutron-drip-line nuclei
in the region of neutron number above N=20, 40 and 82, namely N $\approx$
21-28, N $\approx$ 41-54, and N $\approx$ 83-90, may be quadrupole-deformed

flow) is organized in patterns that sometimes exhibit fractal geometries over a
range of length scales, depending on the capillary, gravitational and viscous
forces at play. These forces, as well as the boundary conditions, also
determine whether the flow leads to the appearance of fingering pathways, i.e.,
unstable flow, or not. We present here a short review of these aspects,
focusing on drainage and summarizing when these flows are expected to be stable

We base our review on experimental studies performed in two-dimensional
Hele-Shaw cells, or addressing three dimensional porous media by use of several
imaging techniques. We first present configurations in which solely capillary
forces and gravity play a role. Next, we review configurations in which
capillarity and viscosity are the main forces at play. Eventually, we examine
how the microscopic geometry of the fluid clusters affects the macroscopic
transport properties. An example of such an upscaling is illustrated in detail:
For air invasion in a mono-layer glass-bead cell, the fractal dimension of the
flow structures and the associated scale-ranges, are shown to depend on the
displacement velocity. This controls the relationship between saturation and
the pressure difference between the two phases at the macroscopic scale. We

$\mathcal{Z}_n=(Z_1,...,Z_n)$, are observed subject to a form of coarsening.
Specifically, sample $\mathcal{X}_m$ is fully observed while

establish the large-sample properties of kernel density estimators under the

on the global modulus of continuity, we establish conditions for the strong

properties of these estimators. We conclude by extending our results to the

groups of atoms in a two-well Bose-Einstein condensate using a dynamical
process similar to that employed in quantum optics. The local nonlinear S-wave
scattering interaction has the effect of creating a spin squeezing at each
well, while the tunneling, analogous to a beam splitter in optics, introduces
an interference between these fields that results in an inter-well
entanglement. We consider two internal modes at each well, so that the
entanglement can be detected by measuring a reduction in the variances of the
sums of local Schwinger spin observables. As is typical of continuous variable
(CV) entanglement, the entanglement is predicted to increase with atom number,
and becomes sufficiently strong at higher numbers of atoms that the EPR paradox
and steering non-locality can be realized. The entanglement is predicted using
an analytical approach and, for larger atom numbers, stochastic simulations
based on truncated Wigner function. We find generally that strong tunnelling is
favourable, and that entanglement persists and is even enhanced in the presence

vanishes. In the present paper we give a strong justification of the conjecture
and determine all $T$-optimal designs explicitly for any degree
$n\in\mathbb{N}$. In particular, we show that there exists a one-dimensional
class of $T$-optimal designs. Moreover, we also present a generalization to the
case when the ratio between the coefficients of $x^{n-1}$ and $x^n$ is smaller
than a certain critical value. Because of the complexity of the optimization
problem, $T$-optimal designs have only been determined numerically so far, and
this paper provides the first explicit solution of the $T$-optimal design
problem since its introduction by Atkinson and Fedorov [Biometrika 62 (1975a)
57--70]. Finally, for the remaining cases (where the ratio of coefficients is
larger than the critical value), we propose a numerical procedure to calculate
the $T$-optimal designs. The results are also illustrated in an example.

core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) by large-scale numerical simulations.
Multi-dimensionality of the supernova engine, general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics, energy and lepton number transport by neutrinos emitted
from the forming neutron star as well as nuclear interactions there, are all
believed to play crucial roles in repelling infalling matter and producing
energetic explosions. These ingredients are nonlinearly coupled with one
another in the dynamics of core-collapse, bounce, and shock expansion. Serious
quantitative studies of CCSNe hence make extensive numerical computations
mandatory. Since neutrinos are neither in thermal nor in chemical equilibrium
in general, their distributions in the phase space should be computed. This is
a six dimensional (6D) neutrino transport problem and quite a challenge even
for those with an access to the most advanced numerical resources such as the
""K computer"". To tackle this problem, we have embarked on multi-front efforts.
In particular we report in this paper our recent progresses in the treatments
of multi-dimensional (multi-D) radiation-hydrodynamics. We are currently
proceeding on two different paths to the ultimate goal; in one approach we
employ an approximate but highly efficient scheme for neutrino transport and
treat 3D hydrodynamics and/or general relativity rigorously; some
neutrino-driven explosions will be presented and comparisons will be made
between 2D and 3D models quantitatively; in the second approach, on the other
hand, exact but so far Newtonian Boltzmann equations are solved in two and
three spatial dimensions; we will show some demonstrative test simulations. We
will also address the perspectives of exa-scale computations on the next
generation supercomputers.

ground based data, we build the most extended radial density profiles from
resolved star counts ever published for these systems. These are well
reproduced by isotropic King models of relatively low concentration. BSSs
appear to be significantly more centrally segregated than red giants in all

relaxation times which are smaller than the cluster ages. Assuming that this is
a signature of mass segregation, we conclude that AM 1 and Eridanus are
slightly dynamically more evolved than Pal 3 and Pal 4.

non-cooperative strategies encourage players selfishly maximizing their
transmit data rates, neglecting the deficit of performance caused by and to
other players. In the case of proper complex Gaussian noise, the maximum
entropy theorem shows that the best-response strategy is to transmit with
proper signals (symmetric complex Gaussian symbols). However, such equilibrium
leads to degrees-of-freedom zero due to the saturation of interference.
  With improper signals (asymmetric complex Gaussian symbols), an extra freedom
of optimization is available. In this paper, we study the impact of improper
signaling on the 2-user SISO IC. We explore the achievable rate region with
non-cooperative strategies by computing a Nash equilibrium of a non-cooperative
game with improper signaling. Then, assuming cooperation between players, we
study the achievable rate region of improper signals. We propose the usage of
improper rank one signals for their simplicity and ease of implementation.
Despite their simplicity, rank one signals achieve close to optimal sum rate
compared to full rank improper signals. We characterize the Pareto boundary,
the outer-boundary of the achievable rate region, of improper rank one signals
with a single real-valued parameter; we compute the closed-form solution of the
Pareto boundary with the non-zero-forcing strategies, the maximum sum rate
point and the max-min fairness solution with zero-forcing strategies. Analysis
on the extreme SNR regimes shows that proper signals maximize the wide-band
slope of spectral efficiency whereas improper signals optimize the high-SNR

the periods of G- and M-type stars are log-normally distributed. However,
observations of young binary populations suggest a log-uniform distribution.
Clearly some process(es) change the period distribution over time. Most stars
form in star clusters, in which two important dynamical processes occur: i)
gas-induced orbital decay of embedded binary systems and ii) destruction of
soft binaries in three-body interactions. The emphasis here is on orbital decay
which has been largely neglected so far. Using a combination of Monte-Carlo and
dynamical nbody modelling it is demonstrated here that the cluster dynamics
destroys the number of wide binaries, but leaves short-period binaries
basically undisturbed even for a initially log-uniform distribution. By
contrast orbital decay significantly reduces the number and changes the
properties of short-period binaries, but leaves wide binaries largely
uneffected. Until now it was unclear whether the short period distribution of
the field is unaltered since its formation. It is shown here, that orbital
decay is a prime candidate for such a task. In combination the dynamics of
these two processes, convert an initial log-uniform distribution to a
log-normal period distribution. The probability is 94% that the evolved and
observed period distribution were sampled from the same parent distribution.
This means binaries can be formed with periods that are sampled from the
log-uniform distribution. As the cluster evolves, short-period binaries are
merged to single stars by the gas-induced orbital decay while the dynamical
evolution in the cluster destroys wide binaries. The combination of these two
equally important processes reshapes a initial log-uniform period distribution
to the log-normal period distribution, that is observed in the field
(abridged).

a variety of spectral features that can be used as diagnostics to characterise
the spectra. However, such diagnostics are biased by our prior prejudices on
the origin of the features. Moreover, by using only part of the spectrum they
do not utilise the full information content of the spectra. Blind statistical
techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) consider the whole
spectrum, find correlated features and separate them out into distinct
components.
  We further investigate the principal components (PCs) of ULIRGs derived in
Wang et al.(2011). We quantitatively show that five PCs is optimal for
describing the IRS spectra. These five components (PC1-PC5) and the mean
spectrum provide a template basis set that reproduces spectra of all z<0.35
ULIRGs within the noise. For comparison, the spectra are also modelled with a
combination of radiative transfer models of both starbursts and the dusty torus
surrounding active galactic nuclei. The five PCs typically provide better fits
than the models. We argue that the radiative transfer models require a colder
dust component and have difficulty in modelling strong PAH features.
  Aided by the models we also interpret the physical processes that the
principal components represent. The third principal component is shown to
indicate the nature of the dominant power source, while PC1 is related to the
inclination of the AGN torus.
  Finally, we use the 5 PCs to define a new classification scheme using 5D
Gaussian mixtures modelling and trained on widely used optical classifications.

classify objects are made available at: http://www.phys.susx.ac.uk/~pdh21/PCA/

of idealised model galaxies. The test galaxies consist of a disc-like component
and a spheroidal component with varying proportions and properties. Both
components are assumed to be axially symmetric and coplanar. We simulate these
test galaxies as if observed in the SDSS project through ugriz filters, thus
gaining a set of realistically imperfect images of galaxies with known
intrinsic properties. These artificial SDSS galaxies were thereafter remodelled
by approximating the surface brightness distribution with a 2D projection of a
bulge+disc spatial distribution model and the restored parameters were compared
to the initial ones. Down to the r-band limiting magnitude 18, errors of the
restored integral luminosities and colour indices remain within 0.05 mag and
errors of the luminosities of individual components within 0.2 mag. Accuracy of
the restored bulge-to-disc ratios (B/D) is within 40% in most cases, and
becomes worse for galaxies with low B/D, but the general balance between bulges
and discs is not shifted systematically. Assuming that the intrinsic disc axial
ratio is < 0.3, the inclination angles can be estimated with errors < 5deg for
most of the galaxies with B/D < 2 and with errors < 15deg up to B/D = 6. Errors
of the recovered sizes of the galactic components are below 10% in most cases.

  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light","3 Tables, 12 Figures, accepted in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/754/1/73",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction of
an unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,
which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the core
accretion theory of planet formation. In this paper, we report the discovery of
a giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of a
high-magnification microlensing event MOA-2010-BLG-477. The measured
planet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projected
separation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the Einstein radius. The angular
Einstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm E}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. Combining
this measurement with constraints on the ""microlens parallax"" and the lens
flux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13<M/M_\odot<1.0$. In
this particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax and
planet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planet
masses. However, we find that adding Bayesian priors from two effects (Galactic
model and Keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this mass
range, yielding star and planet masses of $M_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ M_\odot$
and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ M_{\rm JUP}$ at a distance of $D=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,
and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ AU. Finally, we show that the
lens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-IR adaptive optics
observations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

Way, Fornax hosts globular clusters. It remains a puzzle as to why dynamical
friction has not yet dragged any of Fornax's five globular clusters to the
centre, and also why there is no evidence that any similar star cluster has
been in the past (for Fornax or any other dSph). We set up a suite of 2800
N-body simulations that sample the full range of globular-cluster orbits and
mass models consistent with all existing observational constraints for Fornax.
In agreement with previous work, we find that if Fornax has a large dark-matter
core then its globular clusters remain close to their currently observed
locations for long times. Furthermore, we find previously unreported behaviour
for clusters that start inside the core region. These are pushed out of the
core and gain orbital energy, a process we call 'dynamical buoyancy'. Thus a
cored mass distribution in Fornax will naturally lead to a shell-like globular
cluster distribution near the core radius, independent of the initial
conditions. By contrast, CDM-type cusped mass distributions lead to the rapid
infall of at least one cluster within \Delta t = 1-2Gyr, except when picking
unlikely initial conditions for the cluster orbits (\sim 2% probability), and
almost all clusters within \Delta t = 10Gyr. Alternatively, if Fornax has only
a weakly cusped mass distribution, dynamical friction is much reduced. While
over \Delta t = 10Gyr this still leads to the infall of 1-4 clusters from their
present orbits, the infall of any cluster within \Delta t = 1-2Gyr is much less
likely (with probability 0-70%, depending on \Delta t and the strength of the
cusp). Such a solution to the timing problem requires that in the past the
globular clusters were somewhat further from Fornax than today; they most
likely did not form within Fornax, but were accreted.

biased simultaneously by this weak signal and a strong pump signal, both of
which having frequencies close to the inter-level transitions in the system.
The weak signal strongly affects the spectrum generated by the strong pumping
drive by producing and controlling mixed harmonics with amplitudes of the order
of the main harmonic of the strong drive. We show that the amplification is
robust with respect to noise, with an intensity of the order of the weak
signal. When deviating from the optimal regime (corresponding to strong qubit
coupling and a weak-signal frequency equal to the inter-level transition
frequency) the proposed amplifier becomes less efficient, but it can still
considerably enhance a weak signal (by several tens). We therefore propose to
use coupled qubits as a combined parametric amplifier and frequency shifter.

the density response function. In this paper, we derive an incomplete-basis-set
correction for the response, which consists of two terms: (1) a correction that
is formally similar to the Pulay correction in atomic-force calculations and
(2) a numerically more important basis response term originating from the
potential dependence of the basis functions. The basis response term is
constructed from the solutions of radial Sternheimer equations in the
muffin-tin spheres. With these corrections the local potential converges at
much smaller basis sets, at much fewer states, and its construction becomes
numerically very stable. We analyze the improvements for rock-salt ScN and
report results for BN, AlN, and GaN, as well as the perovskites CaTiO3, SrTiO3,

has been considered | appears weak provided that the surface density is
conserved. For bodies with small aspect ratio (i.e. geometrically thin discs),
a first-order Taylor expansion furnishes an excellent approximation for this
mean Green function, the absolute error being of the fourth order in the aspect
ratio. This formula is therefore well suited to studying the structure of
self-gravitating discs and rings in the spirit of the ""standard model of thin
discs"" where the vertical structure is often ignored, but it remains accurate
for discs and tori of finite thickness. This approximation which perfectly
saves the properties of Newton's law everywhere (in particular at large
separations), is also very useful for dynamical studies where the body is just
a source of gravity acting on external test particles.

construction of an undulator beamline dedicated to life science experiments.
The availability of free undulator tunnels at the European XFEL facility offers
a unique opportunity to build a beamline optimized for coherent diffraction
imaging of complex molecules, like proteins and other biologically interesting
structures. Crucial parameters for such bio-imaging beamline are photon energy
range, peak power, and pulse duration. Key component of the setup is the
undulator source. The peak power is maximized in the photon energy range
between 3 keV and 13 keV by the use of a very efficient combination of
self-seeding, fresh bunch and tapered undulator techniques. The unique
combination of ultra-high peak power of 1 TW in the entire energy range, and
ultrashort pulse duration tunable from 2 fs to 10 fs, would allow for single
shot coherent imaging of protein molecules with size larger than 10 nm. Also,
the new beamline would enable imaging of large biological structures in the
water window, between 0.3 keV and 0.4 keV. In order to make use of standardized
components, at present we favor the use of SASE3-type undulator segments. The
number segments, 40, is determined by the tapered length for the design output
power of 1 TW. The present plan assumes the use of a nominal electron bunch
with charge of 0.1 nC. Experiments will be performed without interference with
the other three undulator beamlines. Therefore, the total amount of scheduled
beam time per year is expected to be up to 4000 hours.

predicted by General Relativity. In order to confirm the Kerr-nature of these
objects, we need to probe the geometry of the space-time around them and see if
the observations are consistent with the predictions of the Kerr metric. That
can be achieved, for instance, by studying the properties of the
electromagnetic radiation emitted by the gas in the accretion disk. The
high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the X-ray flux of some
stellar-mass black hole candidates might do the job. As the frequencies of
these oscillations depend only very weakly on the observed X-ray flux, it is
thought they are mainly determined by the metric of the space-time. In this
paper, I consider the resonance models proposed by Abramowicz and Kluzniak and
I extend previous results to the case of non-Kerr space-times. The emerging
picture is more complicated than the one around a Kerr black hole and there is
a larger number of possible combinations between different modes. I then
compare the bounds inferred from the twin peak high-frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations observed in three micro-quasars (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, and
GRS 1915+105) with the measurements from the continuum-fitting method of the
same objects. For Kerr black holes, the two approaches do not provide
consistent results. In a non-Kerr geometry, this conflict may be solved if the
observed quasi-periodic oscillations are produced by the resonance $\nu_\theta
: \nu_r = 3:1$, where $\nu_\theta$ and $\nu_r$ are the two epicyclic
frequencies. It is at least worth mentioning that the deformation from the Kerr
solution required by observations would be consistent with the one suggested in
another recent work discussing the possibility that steady jets are powered by
the spin of these compact objects.

existence of a Lie algebra behind them, can be added to their other relevant
aspects. At the basis of the complete framework for orthogonal polynomials we
put thus --in addition to differential equations, recurrence relations, Hilbert
spaces and square integrable functions-- Lie algebra theory.
  We start here from the square integrable functions on the open connected
subset of the real line whose bases are related to orthogonal polynomials. All
these one-dimensional continuous spaces allow, besides the standard uncountable
basis ${|x>}$, for an alternative countable basis ${|n>}$. The matrix elements
that relate these two bases are essentially the orthogonal polynomials: Hermite
polynomials for the line and Laguerre and Legendre polynomials for the
half-line and the line interval, respectively.
  Differential recurrence relations of orthogonal polynomials allow us to
realize that they determine a unitary representation of a non-compact Lie
algebra, whose second order Casimir ${\cal C}$ gives rise to the second order
differential equation that defines the corresponding family of orthogonal
polynomials. Thus, the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra $h(1)$ with ${\cal C}=0$ for
Hermite polynomials and $su(1,1)$ with ${\cal C}=-1/4$ for Laguerre and
Legendre polynomials are obtained.
  Starting from the orthogonal polynomials the Lie algebra is extended both to
the whole space of the ${\cal L}^2$ functions and to the corresponding
Universal Enveloping Algebra and transformation group. Generalized coherent
states from each vector in the space ${\cal L}^2$ and, in particular,
generalized coherent polynomials are thus obtained.

right-hand side of the single layer distribution type. Such problems arise when
one aims at accounting for a physical hypersurface (or line, for bi-dimensional
problem), but also in the context of fictitious domain methods, when one aims
at accounting for the presence of an inclusion in a domain (in that case the
support of the distribution is the boundary of the inclusion). The most popular
way to handle numerically the single layer distribution in the finite element
context is to spread it out by a regularization technique. An alternative
approach consists in approximating the single layer distribution by a
combination of Dirac masses. As the Dirac mass in the right hand side does not
make sense at the continuous level, this approach raises particular issues. The
object of the present paper is to give a theoretical background to this
approach. We present a rigorous numerical analysis of this approximation, and
we present two examples of application of the main result of this paper. The
first one is a Poisson problem with a single layer distribution as a right-hand
side and the second one is another Poisson problem where the single layer
distribution is the Lagrange multiplier used to enforce a Dirichlet boundary
condition on the boundary of an inclusion in the domain. Theoretical analysis
is supplemented by numerical experiments in the last section.

amplitudes. All three analyses provide similar evidence for rho^0(770)-f_0(980)
mixing in S- and P-wave amplitudes. In Analyses I and II the S-wave amplitudes
|S_d|^2 peak at rho^0(770) mass while the P-wave amplitudes |L_d|^2 dip at
f_0(980) mass. In both analyses the S-wave amplitudes S_tau are nearly in phase
with amplitudes L_tau for both transversitities tau=u(spin up) and d(spin
down), indicating resonant phases of rho^0(770) also in the S-wave. The S-wave
single flip amplitudes |S_1|^2 and the relative phases Phi(S_1)-Phi(L_1) show
the same pattern. While the non-flip amplitudes |L_0|^2 are small below 960
MeV, there is a sudden rise above this mass that may reflect the presence of
f_0(980) resonance. We show that the apparent dependence of rho^0(770) width on
helicity in amplitudes |U_tau|^2 and |N_tau|^2 results from the interference of
amplitudes with helicities lambda=+/-1 and not from the violation of
rotational/Lorentz symmetry. This suggests that the production mechanism and
the mechanism responsible for rho^0(770)-f_0(980) mixing have independent
dynamical origins.

obtained using the diffusion Monte Carlo method. We have found that, in
accordance with previous experimental and simulation results for graphite, the
ground state of $^4$He on this setup is a liquid that, upon compression,
transforms into a triangular solid. To define the stability limits of both
liquid and solid phases, we considered not only the adsorption energies of the
atoms located on the second layer but the average energy of the atoms in both
layers. Our results show that the lower density limit for a stable liquid in
the second layer is 0.163 $\pm$ 0.005 \AA$^{-2}$ and that the lower limit for
the existence of an incommensurate solid on the second layer is 0.186 $\pm$
0.003 \AA$^{-2}$. Both values are in overall agreement with the results of
torsional oscillator experiments and heat capacity measurements on graphite.
The 4/7 and 7/12 registered solids are found to be metastable with respect to
triangular incommensurate arrangements of the same density.

for a significant number of clusters. On average, M33 clusters are more
flattened than those of the Milky Way and M31, and more similar to clusters in
the Small Magellanic Cloud. The ellipticities do not show any correlation with
age or mass, suggesting that rotation is not the main cause of elongation in
the M33 clusters. The position angles of the clusters show a bimodality with a
strong peak perpendicular to the position angle of the galaxy major axis. These
results support the notion that tidal forces are the reason for the cluster
flattening. We fit King and EFF models to the surface brightness profiles and
derive structural parameters including core radii, concentration, half-light
radii and central surface brightness for both filters. The surface brightness
profiles of a significant number of clusters show irregularities such as bumps
and dips. Young clusters (Log age < 8) are notably better fitted by models with
no radial truncation (EFF models), while older clusters show no significant
differences between King or EFF fits. M33 star clusters seem to have smaller
sizes, smaller concentrations, and smaller central surface brightness as
compared to clusters in the MW, M31, LMC and SMC. Analysis of the structural
parameters presents a age-radius relation also detected in other star cluster

and V986 Oph. 670 hours of high-quality differential photoelectric Stromgren,
Johnson and Geneva time-series photometry were obtained with eight telescopes
on five continents during 182 nights. Frequency analyses of the V2052 Oph data
enabled the detection of three pulsation frequencies, the first harmonic of the
strongest signal, and the rotation frequency with its first harmonic.
Pulsational mode identification from analysing the colour amplitude ratios
confirms the dominant mode as being radial, whereas the other two oscillations
are most likely l=4. Combining seismic constraints on the inclination of the
rotation axis with published magnetic field analyses we conclude that the
radial mode must be the fundamental. The rotational light modulation is in
phase with published spectroscopic variability, and consistent with an oblique
rotator for which both magnetic poles pass through the line of sight. The
inclination of the rotation axis is 54o <i< 58o and the magnetic obliquity 58o
<beta< 66o. The possibility that V2052 Oph has a magnetically confined wind is
discussed. The photometric amplitudes of the single oscillation of V986 Oph are
most consistent with an l=3 mode, but this identification is uncertain.
Additional intrinsic, apparently temporally incoherent, light variations of
V986 Oph are reported. Different interpretations thereof cannot be
distinguished at this point, but this kind of variability appears to be present
in many OB stars. The prospects of obtaining asteroseismic information for more
rapidly rotating Beta Cep stars, which appear to prefer modes of higher l, are

transformation, while extreme M2-branes will become new extreme M2-branes. The
resulting tension and charges are quantised appropriately if we use the
discrete U-duality group $E_d(Z)$.

flavor at 2L, which could be detected.

is considered. We explain the conditions for which the Carnot efficiency is
reached and how it can be exceeded! The loss mechanisms - thermalization, angle
entropy, and below-bandgap transmission - explain the gap between Carnot
efficiency and the Shockley-Queisser limit. Wide varieties of techniques
developed to reduce these losses (e.g., solar concentrators, solar-thermal,
tandem cells, etc.) are reinterpreted by using a two level model. Remarkably,
the simple model appears to capture the essence of PV operation and reproduce
the key results and important insights that are known to the experts through
complex derivations.

"1205.6680","Tommi Hirvola","Tommi Hirvola","MIPS code compression","7 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  MIPS machine code is very structured: registers used before are likely to be
used again, some instructions and registers are used more heavily than others,
some instructions often follow each other and so on. Standard file compression
utilities, such as gzip and bzip2, does not take full advantage of the
structure because they work on byte-boundaries and don't see the underlying
instruction fields. My idea is to filter opcodes, registers and immediates from
MIPS binary code into distinct streams and compress them individually to
achieve better compression ratios. Several different ways to split MIPS code
into streams are considered. The results presented in this paper shows that a
simple filter can reduce final compressed size by up to 10 % with gzip and
bzip2.
