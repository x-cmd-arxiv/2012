wavelength with 40 milli-arcsecond resolution resolve the object's radio
emission, which forms an almost round uniform disk of 83 milli arcseconds
diameter, corresponding to 11 AU (for an assumed distance of 130 pc). We find a
brightness temperature of 1630 K for the radio photosphere. Since the emission
is optically thick, we can directly estimate IRC+10216's average luminosity,
which is 8600 L(Sun). This value is in excellent agreement with what is
predicted from the period-luminosity relation for carbon-rich Miras. Assuming
an effective temperature of 2750 K for IRC+10216, it implies an optical
photospheric diameter of 3.8 AU. Our precise determination of IRC+10216's
proper motion fits the picture presented by far-ultraviolet and far-infrared
wavelength observations of its interaction region with the interstellar medium
(its ""astrosphere""): the star moves roughly in the direction expected from the
morphology of the termination shock and its astrotail structures. Calculation
of its three dimensional velocity and an analysis of the kinematics of its
surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) suggest an appreciable relative velocity
of 42 km s/s, which is about half the value discussed in recent studies. This
suggests a lower (time-averaged) mass loss rate and/or a higher ISM density
than previously assumed.

detection procedures based on nonparametric kernel prediction smoothers which
cover various classic detection statistics as special cases. Bandwidth
selection, particularly in a data-adaptive way, is a serious issue and not well
studied for detection problems. To ensure data adaptation, we select the
bandwidth by cross-validation, but in a sequential way leading to a functional
estimation approach. This article provides the asymptotic theory for the method
under fairly weak assumptions on the dependence structure of the error terms,
which cover, e.g., GARCH($p,q$) processes, by establishing (sequential)
functional central limit theorems for the cross-validation objective function
and the associated bandwidth selector. It turns out that the proof can be based
in a neat way on \cite{KurtzProtter1996}'s results on the weak convergence of
\ito integrals and a diagonal argument.
  Our gradual change-point model covers multiple change-points in that it
allows for a nonlinear regression function after the first change-point
possibly with further jumps and Lipschitz continuous between those
discontinuities.
  In applications, the time horizon where monitoring stops latest is often
determined by a random experiment, e.g. a first-exit stopping time applied to a
cumulated cost process or a risk measure, possibly stochastically dependent
from the monitored time series. Thus, we also study that case and establish
related limit theorems in the spirit of \citet{Anscombe1952}'s result. The
result has various applications including statistical parameter estimation and
monitoring financial investment strategies with risk-controlled early
termination, which are briefly discussed.

current and magnetic-field dependences of resistive transition to
superconducting state. It is found that current dependences of differential
resistance taken at different temperatures intersect strictly at two definite
values of current demonstrating crossing point effect. This phenomenon has been
explained taking into account inhomogeneous state of intergrain medium which
can be considered as a two-component system. The particular attention has been
given to magnetoresistance (MR) hysteresis in mixed state of this inhomogeneous
system and to influence of applied current and temperature on this phenomenon.
Two types of hysteresis (clockwise and anticlockwise) have been found with
transition from clockwise to anticlockwise hysteresis with increasing
temperature. Stepwise structure in MR hysteretic curves has been observed in
low-field range. Possible reasons of the change in hysteresis behavior with
increasing temperature and appearance of the stepwise structure in MR curves

VLBA observations were carried out over twelve epochs in 2006 at four
frequencies between 8 and 15 GHz. We detect parsec-scale Faraday RMs in 149
sources and find the quasars to have larger RMs on average than BL Lac objects.
The median core RMs are significantly higher than in the jet components. This
is especially true for quasars where we detect a significant negative
correlation between the magnitude of the RM and the de-projected distance from
the core. We perform detailed simulations of the observational errors of total
intensity, polarization and Faraday rotation, and concentrate on the errors of
transverse Faraday RM gradients in unresolved jets. Our simulations show that
the finite image restoring beam size has a significant effect on the observed
RM gradients, and spurious gradients can occur due to noise in the data if the
jet is less than two beams wide in polarization. We detect significant
transverse RM gradients in four sources (0923+392, 1226+023, 2230+114 and
2251+158). In 1226+023 the RM is for the first time seen to change sign from
positive to negative over the transverse cuts, which supports the presence of a
helical magnetic field in the jet. In this source we also detect variations in
the jet RM over a time scale of three months, which are difficult to explain
with external Faraday screens and suggest internal Faraday rotation. By
comparing fractional polarization changes in jet components between the four
frequency bands to depolarization models we find that an external purely random
Faraday screen viewed through only a few lines of sight can explain most of our
polarization observations but in some sources, such as 1226+023 and 2251+158,
internal Faraday rotation is needed.

two-tier network of sensor nano-machines (SNMs) in the first tier and a data

resistive MHD simulations. We argue that successful planetesimal formation
requires not only a sufficiently large dead zone (which can be produced by tiny
dust grains) but also a sufficiently small net vertical magnetic flux (NVF).
Although often ignored, the latter condition is indeed important since the NVF
strength determines the saturation level of turbulence in MRI-active layers. We
show that direct collisional formation of icy planetesimal across the
fragmentation barrier is possible when the NVF strength is lower than 10 mG
(for the minimum-mass solar nebula model). Formation of rocky planetesimals via
the secular gravitational instability is also possible within a similar range
of the NVF strength. Our results indicate that the fate of planet formation
largely depends on how the NVF is radially transported in the initial disk
formation and subsequent disk accretion processes.

singularity is replaced by a quantum big bounce of the mean scale factor in
loop quantization of Bianchi-I spacetime. An important issue is to understand
various differences in the physical properties of the spacetime across the
bounce. We investigate this issue in the context of various geometrical
structures, identified by Kasner exponents of the metric, which arise on
approach to the singularity in the classical theory. Using effective spacetime
description of Bianchi-I model in loop quantum cosmology with dust, radiation
and stiff matter, we find that as in the classical theory, geometrical
structures such as a cigar or a pancake form, but they are finite and
non-singular. Depending on the initial conditions of matter and anisotropies,
different geometric structures are possible in the pre- and post-bounce phases
in physical evolution. Thus, quantum gravitational effects can cause a Kasner
transition in Bianchi-I spacetime, which is not possible at the classical
level. Interestingly, we find that not all transitions are allowed at the level
of effective dynamics in loop quantum cosmology. We find the selection rules
and underlying conditions for all allowed and forbidden transitions. Selection
rules suggest that for a given set of initial conditions on anisotropies,
occurrence of Kasner transitions follows a distinct pattern, and certain
transitions are more favored than others.

accomplished by combining two Havriliak-Negami functions with 6 parameters. The
temperature dependent relaxation times are fitted with the
Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher relation which provides the corresponding Vogel-Fulcher

greatly over wide ranges often by several orders of magnitude. However, for
well shapes that admit more classically chaotic behavior (e.g. the stadium, the
Sinai billiard) the range of tunneling rates narrows, often by orders of

periodic orbits in the regular wells that produce the largest and smallest

possibly universal shape. It is in this sense that we say the quantum chaos

for 19 galaxies. Oxygen abundances were compared to B-band and 4.5 micron
luminosities and stellar masses in order to characterize the
luminosity-metallicity (L-Z) and mass-metallicity (M-Z) relationships at
low-luminosity.
  We present and analyze a ""Combined Select"" sample composed of 38 objects
(drawn from our parent sample and the literature) with direct oxygen abundances
and reliable distance determinations (TRGB or Ceph). Consistent with previous
studies, the B-band and 4.5 micron L-Z relationships were found to be
12+log(O/H)=(6.27+/-0.21)+(-0.11+/-0.01)M_B and
12+log(O/H)=(6.10+/-0.21)+(-0.10+/-0.01)M_[4.5] (sigma=0.15 and 0.14). For this
sample, we derive a M-Z relationship of
12+log(O/H)=(5.61+/-0.24)+(0.29+/-0.03)log(M*), which agrees with previous
studies; however, the dispersion (sigma=0.15) is not significantly lower than
that of the L-Z relationships. Because of the low dispersions in these
relationships, if an accurate distance is available, the luminosity of a
low-luminosity galaxy is often a better indicator of metallicity than that
derived using certain strong-line methods, so significant departures from the
L-Z relationships may indicate that caution is prudent in such cases. We also
revisit the 70/160 micron color metallicity relationship.
  Additionally, we examine N/O abundance trends with respect to oxygen
abundance and B-V color. We find a positive correlation between N/O ratio and
B-V color for 0.05\lesssimB-V\lesssim0.75:
log(N/O)=(1.18+/-0.9)x(B-V)+(-1.92+/-0.08), with a dispersion of sigma=0.14,

introduces an additional parameter $q$ to the inverse temperature $\beta$.
Here, we show that a previously introduced generalized Metropolis dynamics to
evolve spin models is not local and does not obey the detailed energy balance.
In this dynamics, locality is only retrieved for $q=1$, which corresponds to
the standard Metropolis algorithm. Non-locality implies in very time consuming
computer calculations, since the energy of the whole system must be
reevaluated, when a single spin is flipped. To circumvent this costly
calculation, we propose a generalized master equation, which gives rise to a
local generalized Metropolis dynamics that obeys the detailed energy balance.
To compare the different critical values obtained with other generalized
dynamics, we perform Monte Carlo simulations in equilibrium for Ising model. By
using the short time non-equilibrium numerical simulations, we also calculate
for this model: the critical temperature, the static and dynamical critical
exponents as function of $q$. Even for $q\neq 1$, we show that suitable time
evolving power laws can be found for each initial condition. Our numerical
experiments corroborate the literature results, when we use non-local dynamics,
showing that short time parameter determination works also in this case.
However, the dynamics governed by the new master equation leads to different
results for critical temperatures and also the critical exponents affecting
universality classes. We further propose a simple algorithm to optimize
modeling the time evolution with a power law considering in a log-log plot two
successive refinements.

properties, such as the bulge, disk, and halo. Unraveling the assembly history
of these populations provides a powerful test to the theory of galaxy formation
and evolution, but is often restricted due to difficulties in measuring
accurate stellar ages for low mass, hydrogen-burning stars. Unlike these
progenitors, the ""cinders"" of stellar evolution, white dwarf stars, are
remarkably simple objects and their fundamental properties can be measured with
little ambiguity from spectroscopy. Here I report observations and analysis of
newly formed white dwarf stars in the halo of the Milky Way, and a comparison
to published analysis of white dwarfs in the well-studied 12.5 billion-year-old
globular cluster Messier 4. From this, I measure the mass distribution of the
remnants and invert the stellar evolution process to develop a new relation
that links this final stellar mass to the mass of their immediate progenitors,
and therefore to the age of the parent population. By applying this technique
to a small sample of four nearby and kinematically-confirmed halo white dwarfs,
I measure the age of local field halo stars to be 11.4 +/- 0.7 billion years.
This age is directly tied to the globular cluster age scale, on which the
oldest clusters formed 13.5 billion years ago. Future (spectroscopic)
observations of newly formed white dwarfs in the Milky Way halo can be used to
reduce the present uncertainty, and to probe relative differences between the
formation time of the last clusters and the inner halo.

prevalent companion spectral types were seen to be main-sequence stars between
F0 and K0, while subdwarfs with M-type companions appear much rarer. This is

new sporadic pulsations that are detected on a baseline of about 2.5 years. We
find that the pulse phases anti-correlate with the X-ray flux as previously

pulse phase drift of ~180 degrees in coincidence with the first disappearance

high-quality pairs from the SDSS DR8 spectroscopic database. We separate the
individual WD and dM from each spectrum using an iterative technique that
compares the WD and dM components to best-fit templates. Using the absolute
height above the Galactic plane as a proxy for age, and the H{\alpha} emission
line as an indicator for magnetic activity, we investigate the age-activity
relation for our sample for spectral types \leqM7. Our results show that
early-type M dwarfs (\leqM4) in close binary systems are more likely to be
active and have longer activity lifetimes compared to their field counterparts.
However, at a spectral type of M5 (just past the onset of full convection in M
dwarfs), the activity fraction and lifetimes of WD+dM binary systems becomes
more comparable to that of the field M dwarfs. One of the implications of
having a close binary companion is presumed to be increased stellar rotation
through disk-disruption, tidal effects, or angular momentum exchange. Thus, we
interpret the similarity in activity behavior between late-type dMs in WD+dM
pairs and late-type field dMs to be due to a decrease in sensitivity in close
binary companions (or stellar rotation), which has implications for the nature
of magnetic activity in fully-convective stars. (Abridged)

properties, and are often (though not always) independent of the mass of the
black hole itself (depending only on various charges, angular momenta, and
moduli). Such products are often formulated in terms of the areas of inner
(Cauchy) horizons and outer (event) horizons, and sometimes include the effects
of unphysical ""virtual"" horizons. But the conjectured mass-independence
sometimes fails. Specifically, for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter [Kottler] black
hole in (3+1) dimensions it is shown by explicit exact calculation that the
product of event horizon area and cosmological horizon area is not mass
independent. (Including the effect of the third ""virtual"" horizon does not
improve the situation.) Similarly, in the Reissner-Nordstrom-anti-de Sitter
black hole in (3+1) dimensions the product of inner (Cauchy) horizon area and
event horizon area is calculated (perturbatively), and is shown to be not mass
independent. That is, the mass-independence of the product of physical horizon
areas is not generic. In spherical symmetry, whenever the quasi-local mass m(r)
is a Laurent polynomial in aerial radius, r=sqrt{A/4\pi}, there are
significantly more complicated mass-independent quantities, the elementary
symmetric polynomials built up from the complete set of horizon radii (physical
and virtual). Sometimes it is possible to eliminate the unphysical virtual
horizons, constructing combinations of physical horizon areas that are mass
independent, but they tend to be considerably more complicated than the simple
products and related constructions currently being mooted in the literature.

sample of 26 massive clusters at 0.15<z<0.30, combining Chandra observations
with highly complete spectroscopy of cluster members down to M_K*+2. In total
we identify 48 X-ray AGN among the cluster members, with luminosities
2x10^41-1x10^44erg/s. In the stacked caustic diagram, the X-ray AGN appear to
preferentially lie along the caustics, suggestive of an infalling population.
They also appear to avoid the region with lowest cluster-centric radii and
relative velocities (r_proj<0.4 r_500; |v-<v>|/sigma_v<0.8), which is dominated
by the virialized population of galaxies accreted earliest into the clusters.
Moreover the velocity dispersion of the 48 X-ray AGN is 1.51x that of the
overall cluster population, which is consistent with the sqrt(2) ratio expected
by simple energetic arguments when comparing infalling versus virialized
populations. This kinematic segregation is significant at the 4.66-sigma level.
When splitting the X-ray AGN sample into two according to X-ray or infrared
(IR) luminosity, both X-ray bright and IR-bright sub-samples show higher
velocity dispersions than their X-ray dim and IR-dim counterparts at >2sigma
significance. This is consistent with the nuclear activity responsible for the
X-ray and IR emission being slowly shut down as the host galaxies are accreted
into the cluster. Overall our results provide the strongest observational
evidence to date that X-ray AGN found in massive clusters are an infalling
population, and that the cluster environment very effectively suppresses
radiatively-efficient nuclear activity in its member galaxies. These results
are consistent with the view that for galaxies to host an X-ray AGN they should
be the central galaxy within their dark matter halo and have a ready supply of
cold gas.

selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in order to be pure discs with low
or no current star formation activity, representing one of the best
optically-selected samples of candidate passive spirals. However, we show that
these galaxies are not only still forming stars at a significant rate >= 1
M_sun/yr but, more importantly, their star formation activity is not different
from that of normal star-forming discs of the same stellar mass (M* >= 10^10.2
M_sun). Indeed, these systems lie on the UV-optical blue sequence, even without
any corrections for internal dust attenuation, and they follow the same
specific star formation rate vs. stellar mass relation of star-forming
galaxies. Our findings clearly show that, at high stellar masses, optical
colours do not allow to discriminate between actively star-forming and truly
quiescent systems.

that reciprocated and unreciprocated friendships obey different statistics,

turbulence is generated through the differential acceleration of the upstream

turbulence then amplifies the pre-existing magnetic field.
  Numerical simulations are presented which demonstrate that amplification
factors of 20 or more are easily achievable by this mechanism when reasonable
parameters for the ISM and supernova blastwave are assumed. The length scale
over which this amplification occurs is that of the diffusion length of the
highest energy non-thermal particles.

(Analysis of the Interstellar Medium of Isolated GAlaxies), which identifies
and studies a statistically-significant sample of the most isolated galaxies in
the northern sky. Aims.- We present a catalogue of nuclear activity, traced by
optical emission lines, in a well-defined sample of the most isolated galaxies
in the local Universe, which will be used as a basis for studying the effect of
the environment on nuclear activity. Methods.- We obtained spectral data from
the 6th Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which were inspected in a
semi-automatic way. We subtracted the underlying stellar populations from the
spectra (using the software Starlight) and modelled the nuclear emission
features. Standard emission-line diagnostics diagrams were applied, using a new
classification scheme that takes into account censored data, to classify the
type of nuclear emission. Results.- We provide a final catalogue of
spectroscopic data, stellar populations, emission lines and classification of
optical nuclear activity for AMIGA galaxies. The prevalence of optical active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in AMIGA galaxies is 20.4%, or 36.7% including transition
objects. The fraction of AGN increases steeply towards earlier morphological
types and higher luminosities. We compare these results with a matched analysis
of galaxies in isolated denser environments (Hickson Compact Groups). After
correcting for the effects of the morphology and luminosity, we find that there
is no evidence for a difference in the prevalence of AGN between isolated and
compact group galaxies, and we discuss the implications of this result.
Conclusions.- We find that a major interaction is not a necessary condition for
the triggering of optical AGN.

orientation in the ab-plane. This was interpreted in terms of the resolved
shear stresses in the active slip systems. Evidence of cracking along the {100}
and {110} planes on the ab-plane was observed. As a conclusion, the mechanical
properties of REBa2Cu3O(7-\delta) single crystals prepared from xenotime are
equivalent to those of YBa2Cu3O(7-\delta) single crystals produced by
conventional rare earths oxides.

self-organized nanostructures on binary or impurity-laced targets under
normal-incidence ion irradiation have excited interest in this phenomenon as a
potential route to high-throughput, low-cost manufacture of nanoscale devices
or nanostructured coatings. The currently-prominent explanation for these
structures is a morphological instability driven by ion erosion discovered by
Bradley and Shipman; however, recent parameter estimates via molecular dynamics
simulations suggest that this erosive instability may not be active for the
representative GaSb system in which hexagonal structures were first observed.
  Motivated by experimental and numerical evidence suggesting the possible
importance of phase separation in ion-irradiated compounds, we here generalize
the Bradley-Shipman theory to include the effect of ion-assisted phase
separation. The resulting system admits a chemically-driven finite-wavelength
instability that can explain the order of observed patterns even when the
erosive Bradley-Shipman instability, and in a relevant simplifying limit,
provides an intuitive instability criteria that agrees qualitatively with
experimental observations on pattern wavelengths. Finally, we identify a
characteristic experimental signature that distinguishes the chemical and
morphological instabilities, and highlights the need for specific additional
experimental data on the GaSb system.

Crater, the landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), hosts a 5 km
high sedimentary mound. Hypotheses for mound formation include evaporitic,
lacustrine, fluviodeltaic, and aeolian processes, but the origin and original
extent of Gale's mound is unknown. Here we show new measurements of sedimentary
strata within the mound that indicate ~3 degree outward dips oriented radially
away from the mound center, inconsistent with the first three hypotheses.
Moreover, although mounds are widely considered to be erosional remnants of a
once crater-filling unit, we find that the Gale mound's current form is close
to its maximal extent. Instead we propose that the mound's structure,
stratigraphy, and current shape can be explained by growth in place near the
center of the crater mediated by wind-topography feedbacks. Our model shows how
sediment can initially accrete near the crater center far from crater-wall
katabatic winds, until the increasing relief of the resulting mound generates
mound-flank slope-winds strong enough to erode the mound. Our results indicate
mound formation by airfall-dominated deposition with a limited role for
lacustrine and fluvial activity, and potentially limited organic carbon
preservation. Morphodynamic feedbacks between wind and topography are widely
applicable to a range of sedimentary mounds and ice mounds across the Martian
surface, and possibly other planets.

spontaneously at the cost of breaking Lorentz invariance by a preferred choice

established by Dirac's theory of constrained systems. Firstly, studying scalar
perturbations around Minkowski space-time, we show that there exists one scalar

general analysis is made in the canonical formalism, using ADM variables. It is
useful to introduce an auxiliary scalar field, which allows recasting n-DBI

leading edge vortex (LEV) on an airfoil or wing can provide lift enhancement.
In this paper, unsteady 2D potential flow theory is employed to model the flow
field of a flapping flat plate wing. A multi-vortices model is developed to
model both the leading edge and trailing edge vortices (TEVs), which offers
improved accuracy compared with using only single vortex at each separation
location. The lift is obtained by integrating the unsteady Blasius equation. It
is found that the motion of vortices contributes significantly to the overall
aerodynamic force on the flat plate. The shedding of TEVs and the stabilization
of LEVs explicitly contributes to lift enhancement. A Kutta-like condition is
used to determine the vortex intensity and location at the leading edge for
large angle of attack cases; however, it is proposed to relax this condition
for small angle of attack cases and apply a 2D shear layer model to calculate
the circulation of the new added vortex. The results of the simulation are then
compared with classical numerical, modeled and experimental data for canonical
unsteady flat plat problems. Good agreement with these data is observed.
Moreover, these results suggested that the leading edge vortex shedding for
small angles of attack should be modeled differently than that for large angles
of attack. Finally, the results of vortex motion vs. lift indicate that both a
motion against the streamwise direction of the LEV and a streamwise motion of
the TEV contributes positive lift. This also provides the insights for future
active flow control of MAVs that the formation and shedding process of LEVs and
TEVs can be manipulated to provide lift enhancement.

  International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM 2012)",,,,"cs.IR cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The real-time nature of Twitter means that term distributions in tweets and
in search queries change rapidly: the most frequent terms in one hour may look
very different from those in the next. Informally, we call this phenomenon
""churn"". Our interest in analyzing churn stems from the perspective of
real-time search. Nearly all ranking functions, machine-learned or otherwise,
depend on term statistics such as term frequency, document frequency, as well
as query frequencies. In the real-time context, how do we compute these
statistics, considering that the underlying distributions change rapidly? In
this paper, we present an analysis of tweet and query churn on Twitter, as a
first step to answering this question. Analyses reveal interesting insights on
the temporal dynamics of term distributions on Twitter and hold implications
for the design of search systems.

higher wireless data rates. Denser spectrum reuse through the deployment of
more access points per square mile has the potential to successfully meet the
increasing demand for more bandwidth. In theory, the best approach to density
increase is via distributed multiuser MIMO, where several access points are
connected to a central server and operate as a large distributed multi-antenna
access point, ensuring that all transmitted signal power serves the purpose of
data transmission, rather than creating ""interference."" In practice, while
enterprise networks offer a natural setup in which distributed MIMO might be
possible, there are serious implementation difficulties, the primary one being
the need to eliminate phase and timing offsets between the jointly coordinated
access points.
  In this paper we propose AirSync, a novel scheme which provides not only time
but also phase synchronization, thus enabling distributed MIMO with full
spatial multiplexing gains. AirSync locks the phase of all access points using
a common reference broadcasted over the air in conjunction with a Kalman filter
which closely tracks the phase drift. We have implemented AirSync as a digital
circuit in the FPGA of the WARP radio platform. Our experimental testbed,
comprised of two access points and two clients, shows that AirSync is able to
achieve phase synchronization within a few degrees, and allows the system to
nearly achieve the theoretical optimal multiplexing gain. We also discuss MAC
and higher layer aspects of a practical deployment. To the best of our
knowledge, AirSync offers the first ever realization of the full multiuser MIMO
gain, namely the ability to increase the number of wireless clients linearly
with the number of jointly coordinated access points, without reducing the per
client rate.

measure the positions of thousands of M31 stars and hundreds of compact
background galaxies in each field. High accuracy and robustness is achieved by
building and fitting a unique template for each individual object. The average
proper motion for each field is obtained from the average motion of the M31
stars between the epochs with respect to the background galaxies. For the three
fields, the observed proper motions (mu_W,mu_N) are (-0.0458, -0.0376),
(-0.0533, -0.0104), and (-0.0179,-0.0357) mas/yr, respectively. The ability to
average over large numbers of objects and over the three fields yields a final
accuracy of 0.012 mas/yr. The robustness of the proper-motion measurements and
uncertainties are supported by the fact that data from different instruments,
taken at different times and with different telescope orientations, as well as
measurements of different fields, all yield statistically consistent results.

kinematics of satellite galaxies of M31 and the Local Group. All estimates are
mutually consistent, and imply a weighted average M31 heliocentric transverse
velocity of (v_W,v_N) = (-125.2+/-30.8, -73.8+/-28.4) km/s. We correct for the
reflex motion of the Sun using the most recent insights into the solar motion

Milky Way of V_rad = -109.3+/-4.4 km/s, and a tangential velocity V_tan = 17.0

convenient to reduce the number of sequences under consideration while

to specialize a large database of characterized ""reference sequences"" to a
smaller subset that is as close as possible on average to a collection of

whenever one wishes to find a set of reference sequences that is appropriate to
use for comparative analysis of environmentally-derived sequences, such as for
selecting ""reference tree"" sequences for phylogenetic placement of metagenomic
reads. In this paper we formalize these problems in terms of the minimization
of the Average Distance to the Closest Leaf (ADCL) and investigate algorithms
to perform the relevant minimization. We show that the greedy algorithm is not
effective, show that a variant of the Partitioning Among Medoids (PAM)
heuristic gets stuck in local minima, and develop an exact dynamic programming

to be good for simulated trees, and is faster than the exact algorithm for
small trees. On the other hand, the exact program gives solutions for all

while PAM only gives a solution for the pre-specified number of leaves. Via
application to real data, we show that the ADCL criterion chooses chimeric

the open quantum system's intial density matrix and a grid of times. With this,
the program returns the reduced density matrix of the open quantum system at
all (or some) moments specified by that grid of times. This overall calculation
can be divided into two stages: the setup of the Feynman integral, and the
actual calculation of the Feynman integral for time-propagation of the density
matrix. When this program calculates this propagation on a multi-core CPU, it
is this propagation that is usually the rate limiting step of the calculation,
but when it is calculated on a GPU, the propagation is calculated so quickly
that the setup of the Feynman integal actually becomes the rate limiting step
for most cases tested so far. The overhead of transfrring information from the
CPU to the GPU and back seems to have negligible effect on the overall runtime
of the program. When the required information cannot fit on the GPU, the user
can choose to run the entire program on a CPU.

collapsing thin matter shell in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter space. A central
aspect of our model is to consider a shell moving at finite velocity as
determined by its equation of motion, rather than a quasi-static approximation
as considered previously in the literature. By applying a divergence matching
method, we obtain the evolution of singularities in the retarded unequal time
correlator $G^R(t,t')$, which probes different stages of the thermalization. We
find that the number of singularities decreases from a finite number to zero as
the gauge theory thermalizes. This may be interpreted as a sign of decoherence.
Moreover, in a second part of the paper, we show explicitly that the thermal
correlator is characterized by the existence of singularities in the complex
time plane. By studying a quasi-static state, we show the singularities at real
times originate from contributions of normal modes. We also investigate the
possibility of obtaining complex singularities from contributions of
quasi-normal modes.

transverse-momentum ($p_T$) region is investigated in the recombination model
with emphasis on the effects of minijets on the azimuthal anisotropy. Since the
study is mainly on the hadronization of partons at late time, the fluid picture
is not used to trace the evolution of the system. The inclusive distributions
at low $p_T$ are determined as the recombination products of thermal partons.
The $p_T$ dependencies of both pion and proton have a common exponential factor
apart from other dissimilar kinematic and resonance factors, because they are
inherited from the same pool of thermal partons. Instead of the usual
description based on hydrodynamics, the azimuthal anisotropy of the produced
hadrons is explained as the consequence of the effects of minijets, either
indirectly through the recombination of enhanced thermal partons in the
vicinity of the trajectories of the semihard partons, or directly through
thermal-shower recombination. Although our investigation is focussed on the
single-particle distribution at midrapidity, we give reasons why a component in
that distribution can be identified with the ridge, which together with the
second harmonic $v_2$ is due to the semihard partons created near the medium
surface that lead to calculable anisotropy in $\phi$. It is shown that the
higher azimuthal harmonics, $v_n$, can also be well reproduced without
reference to flow. The $p_T$ and centrality dependencies of the higher
harmonics are prescribed by the interplay between TT and TS recombination
components. The implication of the success of this drastic departure from the
conventional approach is discussed.

effect which lifts the surface to an average height $H\asymp(1/\beta)\log L$.
As an essential step in understanding the effect of entropic repulsion on the
Glauber dynamics we determine the equilibrium height $H$ to within an additive
constant: $H=(1/4\beta)\log L+O(1)$. We then show that starting from zero
initial conditions the surface rises to its final height $H$ through a sequence
of metastable transitions between consecutive levels. The time for a transition
from height $h=aH$, $a\in(0,1)$, to height $h+1$ is roughly $\exp(cL^a)$ for
some constant $c>0$. In particular, the mixing time of the dynamics is
exponentially large in $L$, that is, $T_{\mathrm{MIX}}\geq e^{cL}$. We also
provide the matching upper bound $T_{\mathrm{MIX}}\leq e^{c'L}$, requiring a
challenging analysis of the statistics of height contours at low temperature
and new coupling ideas and techniques. Finally, to emphasize the role of
entropic repulsion we show that without a floor constraint at height zero the
mixing time is no longer exponentially large in $L$.

magnetic field perturbations are perpendicular to the ambient magneticeld,
i.e.,B1 \perp B0, are effected by the anisotropy. However, in oblique
propagation all modes do show such anisotropic effects. Considering the
non-relativistic bi-Maxwellian distribution and studying the relevant

derive the dispersion relations for various modes and instabilities. We show
that only the electromagnetic R- and L- waves, those derived from them and the
O-mode are affected by thermal anisotropies, since they satisfy the required
condition B1\perpB0. By contrast, the perpendicularly propagating X-mode and
the modes derived from it (the pure transverse X-mode and Bernstein mode) show
no such effect. In general, we note that the thermal anisotropy modifies the
parallel propagating modes via the parallel acoustic effect, while it modifies
the perpendicular propagating modes via the Larmor-radius effect. In oblique
propagation for kinetic Alfven waves, the thermal anisotropy affects the
kinetic regime more than it affects the inertial regime. The generalized fast
mode exhibits two distinct acoustic effects, one in the direction parallel to
the ambient magnetic field and the other in the direction perpendicular to it.
In the fast-mode instability, the magneto-sonic wave causes suppression of the
firehose instability. We discuss all these propagation characteristics and

designing, building, and maintaining information and industrial systems. So
far, there exist many SDLC models, one of which is the Waterfall model which
comprises five phases to be completed sequentially in order to develop a
software solution. However, SDLC of software systems has always encountered
problems and limitations that resulted in significant budget overruns, late or
suspended deliveries, and dissatisfied clients. The major reason for these
deficiencies is that project directors are not wisely assigning the required
number of workers and resources on the various activities of the SDLC.
Consequently, some SDLC phases with insufficient resources may be delayed;
while, others with excess resources may be idled, leading to a bottleneck
between the arrival and delivery of projects and to a failure in delivering an
operational product on time and within budget. This paper proposes a simulation
model for the Waterfall development process using the Simphony.NET simulation
tool whose role is to assist project managers in determining how to achieve the
maximum productivity with the minimum number of expenses, workers, and hours.
It helps maximizing the utilization of development processes by keeping all
employees and resources busy all the time to keep pace with the arrival of
projects and to decrease waste and idle time. As future work, other SDLC models
such as spiral and incremental are to be simulated, giving project executives
the choice to use a diversity of software development methodologies.

rate of giant gravitational arcs and the largest observed Einstein radii are
consistent with the standard cosmological model. Recent studies indicate that
mergers provide an efficient mechanism to substantially increase the
strong-lensing efficiency of individual clusters. Based on purely semi-analytic
methods, we investigated the statistical impact of cluster mergers on the
distribution of the largest Einstein radii and the optical depth for giant
gravitational arcs of selected cluster samples. Analysing representative
all-sky realizations of clusters at redshifts z < 1 and assuming a constant
source redshift of z_s = 2.0, we find that mergers increase the number of
Einstein radii above 10 arcsec (20 arcsec) by ~ 35 % (~ 55 %). Exploiting the
tight correlation between Einstein radii and lensing cross sections, we infer
that the optical depth for giant gravitational arcs with a length-to-width
ratio > 7.5 of those clusters with Einstein radii above 10 arcsec (20 arcsec)
increases by ~ 45 % (85 %). Our findings suggest that cluster mergers
significantly influence in particular the statistical lensing properties of the
strongest gravitational lenses. We conclude that semi-analytic studies must
inevitably take these events into account before questioning the standard
cosmological model on the basis of the largest observed Einstein radii and the
statistics of giant gravitational arcs.

contrast, usual observations of H-modes showed that the electron density
profiles tend to flatten with increasing collisionality. In this work it is
reinforced that the role of collisionality alone, depending on the parameter
regime, can be rather weak and in these, dominantly electron heated TCV cases,
the electron density gradient is tailored by the underlying turbulence regime,
which is mostly determined by the ratio of the electron to ion temperature and
that of their gradients. Additionally, mostly in ohmic plasmas, the Ware-pinch
can significantly contribute to the density peaking. Qualitative agreement
between the predicted density peaking by quasi-linear gyrokinetic simulations

necessitate ion temperature measurements, which are lacking in the considered

robustness of the proposed self-triggered coordination system with respect to
skews in the agents' local clocks, to delays, and to limited precision in

the system to consensus. Second, we adapt our framework to a communication
model in which an agent does not poll all its neighbors simultaneously, but
single neighbors instead. This communication policy actually leads to a
self-triggered ""gossip"" coordination system.

Traditionally, these problems are either solved by the Maximum-Likelihood (ML)

inference via the true state-dependent Markov jump process to be feasible.
Typically, inference is conducted by approximating the dynamics through an
ordinary differential equation (ODE), or a stochastic differential equation
(SDE). The former ignores the stochasticity in the true model, and can lead to
inaccurate inferences. The latter is more accurate but is harder to implement
as the transition density of the SDE model is generally unknown. The Linear
Noise Approximation (LNA) is a first order Taylor expansion of the
approximating SDE about a deterministic solution and can be viewed as a
compromise between the ODE and SDE models. It is a stochastic model, but
discrete time transition probabilities for the LNA are available through the
solution of a series of ordinary differential equations. We describe how a

the assumption of bounded context-switching defined by Qadeer and Rehof, and of
phase-boundedness proposed by La Torre et al. On the model checking of such
systems against temporal logics and in particular branching time logics such as
the modal $\mu$-calculus or CTL has received little attention. It is known that
parity games, which are closely related to the modal $\mu$-calculus, are
decidable for the class of bounded-phase systems (and hence for bounded-context

question is whether this high complexity is inevitable and what are the ways to
get around it. This paper addresses these questions and unfortunately, and
somewhat surprisingly, it shows that branching model checking for MPDSs is
inherently an hard problem with no easy solution. We show that parity games on
MPDS under phase-bounding restriction is non-elementary. Our main result shows
that model checking a $k$ context bounded MPDS against a simple fragment of

the radius of a star is a critical parameter for the calculation of stellar

the corona could indeed survive at higher accretion rates and its radiation
power increases. The spectra composed of bremsstrahlung and Compton radiation
are also calculated. Our calculations show that the Compton dominated spectrum
becomes harder with the increase of energy fraction ($f$) liberating in the
corona, and the photon index for hard X-ray($2-10 \rm keV$) is $2.2 < \Gamma <
2.7 $. We discuss possible heating mechanisms for the corona. Combining the
energy fraction transported to the corona with the accretion rate by magnetic
heating, we find that the hard X-ray spectrum becomes steeper at larger
accretion rate and the bolometric correction factor ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm
2-10keV}$) increases with increasing accretion rate for $f<8/35$, which is
roughly consistent with the observational results.

path is much greater than the particle size.
  The linewidth of the plasmon resonance as a function of the particle radius,
shape, dielectric constant of the surrounding medium, and the light frequency
is studied in detail. It is found that the resonance plasmon linewidth
oscillates with increasing both the particle size and the dielectric constant
of surrounding medium.
  The main attention is paid to the electron surface-scattering contribution to
the plasmon decay.
  All calculations the plasmon resonance linewidth are illustrated by the
example of the Na nanoparticles with different radii.

boundary between tractable and intractable movement problems in a very general
set up: it turns out the complexity of the problem fundamentally depends on the
treewidth of the minimal configurations. Thus the complexity of a particular
problem can be determined by answering a purely combinatorial question. Using
our general tools, we determine the complexity of several concrete problems and
fortunately show that many movement problems of interest can be solved

an oblique rotator model can explain the strength of the magnetic field of 14

self-consistent density distributions where the elastic back-action balances

deformation, which exhibits a periodic change between stretching and
compression. This strongly deviates from qualitative expectations based on the

perform a virial stability analysis for each model cloud. We determine that the
neutral cloud temperatures derived by SED fitting are hotter than the dominant
neutral cloud temperature by 1 - 2 K due to emission from warm dust. This
translates into a change in the calculated cloud mass by 8-35 %. Using a
constant mass conversion factor (C{\nu}) for BRCs of different class is found
to give rise to errors in the cloud mass of up to a factor of 3.6. The ionized
boundary layer (IBL) electron temperature calculated using diagnostic line
ratios is more accurate than assuming the canonical value adopted for radio
diagnostics of 10^4 K. Both radio diagnostics and diagnostic line ratios are
found to underestimate the electron density in the IBL. Each system is
qualitatively correctly found to be in a state in which the pressure in the
ionized boundary layer is greater than the supporting cloud pressure, implying
that the objects are being compressed. We find that observationally derived
mass loss estimates agree with those on the simulation grid and introduce the
concept of using the mass loss flux to give an indication of the relative
strength of photo-evaporative flow between clouds. The effect of beam size on
these diagnostics in radio observations is found to be a mixing of the bright

the cloud properties relative to a control diagnostic.

Hb emission line <1200 km/s from the SDSS-DR7 galaxy spectroscopic catalogue,

which to investigate potential mismatches between optical diagnostics and X-ray

all at z<0.4, we find that 145 galaxies are diagnosed as AGNs, having 2-10 keV
X-ray luminosities that span a wide range, from 10^40 erg/s to above 10^44
erg/s. Out of the remaining 66 galaxies, which are instead diagnosed as SF, we
find a bimodal distribution in which 28 have X-ray luminosities in excess of

consistent with being simply SF galaxies. Those 28 galaxies exhibit the
broadest Hb line FWHMs, from ~300 to 1200 km/s, and their X-ray spectrum is
steeper than average and often displays a soft excess. We therefore conclude
that the population of X-ray luminous NELGs with optical lines consistent with
those of a starforming galaxy (which represent 19% of our whole sample) is
largely dominated by NLS1s. The occurrence of such sources in the overall
optically selected sample is small (<2%), hence the contamination of optically

component of the gravitational signal is well described using the stationary
phase approximation at next-to-leading post-Newtonian order, comparing
different contributions to the tidal phase. We also derive a semi-analytical

accommodate arbitrary degree distributions within communities. But since it
takes the vertex degrees as parameters rather than generating them, it cannot
use them to help it classify the vertices, and its natural generalization to
directed graphs cannot even use the orientations of the edges. In this paper,
we present variants of the block model with the best of both worlds: they can
use vertex degrees and edge orientations in the classification process, while
tolerating heavy-tailed degree distributions within communities. We show that

describe the set of all matched pairs $(H_4, H_4, \triangleright,

describe by generators and relations the associated bicrossed product,

cuprates and we adapt the spin-charge gauge approach, previously developed for
the t-J model, to describe the holes in terms of a spinless fermion carrying
the charge (holon) and a neutral boson carrying spin 1/2 (spinon), coupled by a
slave-particle gauge field. In this framework we consider the effects of a
finite density of incoherent holon pairs in the normal state. Below a crossover
temperature, identified as the experimental ""upper pseudogap"", the scattering
of the ""quanta"" of the phase of the holon-pair field against holons reproduces
the phenomenology of Fermi arcs coexisting with gap in the antinodal region. We
thus obtain a microscopic derivation of the main features of the hole spectra
due to pseudogap. This result is obtained through a holon Green function which
follows naturally from the formalism and analytically interpolates between a
Fermi liquid-like and a d-wave superconductor behavior as the coherence length
of the holon pair order parameter increases. By inserting the gauge coupling
with the spinon we construct explicitly the hole Green function and calculate
its spectral weight and the corresponding density of states. So we prove that
the formation of holon pairs induces a depletion of states on the hole Fermi
surface. We compare our results with ARPES and tunneling experimental data. In
our approach the hole preserves a finite Fermi surface until the
superconducting transition, where it reduces to four nodes. Therefore we
propose that the gap seen in the normal phase of cuprates is due to the thermal
broadening of the SC-like peaks masking the Fermi-liquid peak. The Fermi arcs
then correspond to the region of the Fermi surface where the Fermi-liquid peak
is unmasked.

messages that can be transmitted per unit time from a given source to all other
nodes when time goes to infinity.
  Classical broadcast algorithms treat messages as atomic tokens and route them
from the source to the receivers by making intermediate nodes store and forward
messages. The more recent network coding approach, in contrast, prompts
intermediate nodes to mix and code together messages. It has been shown that
certain wired networks have an asymptotic network coding gap, that is, they
have asymptotically higher broadcast throughput when using network coding
compared to routing. Whether such a gap exists for wireless networks has been
an open question of great interest. We approach this question by studying the
broadcast throughput of the radio network model which has been a standard
mathematical model to study wireless communication.
  We show that there is a family of radio networks with a tight $\Theta(\log
\log n)$ network coding gap, that is, networks in which the asymptotic
throughput achievable via routing messages is a $\Theta(\log \log n)$ factor
smaller than that of the optimal network coding algorithm. We also provide new
tight upper and lower bounds that show that the asymptotic worst-case broadcast
throughput over all networks with $n$ nodes is $\Theta(1 / \log n)$

$\eta$, tends to zero. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are determined either
analytically or numerically as functions of $\eta$, both in the continuous case
and after applying Fourier or finite difference discretization schemes. For
fixed $\eta$, we find that only the part of the spectrum corresponding to
eigenvalues $\lambda \lesssim \eta^{-1}$ approaches Dirichlet boundary
conditions, while the remainder of the spectrum is made of uncontrolled,
spurious wall modes. The penalization error for the controlled eigenfunctions
is estimated as a function of $\eta$ and $\lambda$. Surprisingly, in the Stokes
case, we show that the eigenfunctions approximately satisfy, with a precision
$O(\eta)$, Navier slip boundary conditions with slip length equal to
$\sqrt{\eta}$. Moreover, for a given discretization, we show that there exists
a value of $\eta$, corresponding to a balance between penalization and
discretization errors, below which no further gain in precision is achieved.
These results shed light on the behavior of volume penalization schemes when
solving the Navier-Stokes equations, outline the limitations of the method, and
give indications on how to choose the penalization parameter in practical
cases.

ripples spread outwards and fade away. But now there is a way to reverse the
process, and make those ripples turn around and reconverge again, ... and
again, and again. To do this we have designed the Maxwell's Fishpond, a water
wave or ""Transformation Aquatics"" version of the Maxwell's Fisheye lens [Tyc et
al. 2011, Luneberg 1964] that is now well-known from transformation optics.
These are transformation devices where wave propagation on the surface of a
sphere is not modelled on an actual sphere, but in a flat device with carefully
designed spatially varying properties. And just as for rays from a point source
on a sphere, a wave disturbance in a Maxwell's Fisheye or Fishpond spreads out
at first, but then reforms itself at its opposing point in the device. Here we
show how such a device can be made for water waves, partly in friendly
competition with comparable electromagnetic devices [Ma et al. 2011] and partly
as an accessible and fun demonstration of the power of transformation
mechanics. To the eye, our Maxwell's Fishpond was capable of reforming a
disturbance up to five times, although such a feat required taking considerable
care, close observation, and a little luck.

M-ary rooted tree, common in enterprise and military organizational structures.
The goal is to aggregate information to solve a binary hypothesis testing
problem. Each agent at a leaf of the tree, and only such an agent, makes a
direct measurement of the underlying true hypothesis. The leaf agent then makes
a decision and sends it to its supervising agent, at the next level of the
tree. Each supervising agent aggregates the decisions from the M members of its
group, produces a summary message, and sends it to its supervisor at the next
level, and so on. Ultimately, the agent at the root of the tree makes an
overall decision. We derive upper and lower bounds for the Type I and II error
probabilities associated with this decision with respect to the number of leaf
agents, which in turn characterize the converge rates of the Type I, Type II,
and total error probabilities. We also provide a message-passing scheme
involving non-binary message alphabets and characterize the exponent of the
error probability with respect to the message alphabet size.

  dragging and gravitational clock effect","minor revision and 1 Addendum",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gravitomagnetism resulting from SR has been applied to geodetic precession
and frame dragging. The substantial contribution of the ""fictitious"" Coriolis
force, due to the relative rotation of the rest of the Universe in the non
inertial frame of the free falling but rotating satellite, has to be taken into
account, giving another quantitative confirmation of Mach's arguments and of
the black hole nature of our Universe. Also the gravitational clock effect has
an elementary prediction in the present post Newtonian formulation. A
derivation of the centrifugal force from an effective vector formulation of
gravitation is attempted. The centrifugal force appears to be due to a
relativistic effect of the counter-rotating Universe. Gravitomagnetic energy
effects, a million times stronger than the self energy effects responsible for
curvature in the GR language, would thus produce the centrifugal acceleration.
The Machian picture, already successful in the case of the Coriolis force, gets
an additional circumstantial support.

theory, and gravitational instantons. We conclude with the IRPG evolution
equations, which are shown to preserve the initial value constraints of the
theory.
