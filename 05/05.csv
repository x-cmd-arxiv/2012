dimension (1D) has been greatly advanced by the density-matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) algorithm, which is a variational approach using a class of
entanglement-restricted states called Matrix Product States (MPSs). However,
DRMG suffers from inherent accuracy restrictions when multiple states are
involved due to multi-state targeting and also the approximate representation
of the Hamiltonian and other operators. By formulating the variational approach
of DMRG explicitly for MPSs one can avoid errors inherent in the multi-state
targeting approach. Furthermore, by using the Matrix Product Operator (MPO)
formalism, one can exactly represent the Hamiltonian and other operators. The
MPO approach allows 1D Hamiltonians to be templated using a small set of finite
state automaton rules without reference to the particular microscopic degrees
of freedom. We present two algorithms which take advantage of these properties:
eMPS to find excited states of 1D Hamiltonians and tMPS for the time evolution
of a generic time-dependent 1D Hamiltonian. We properly account for
time-ordering of the propagator such that the error does not depend on the rate
of change of the Hamiltonian. Our algorithms use only the MPO form of the
Hamiltonian, and so are applicable to microscopic degrees of freedom of any
variety, and do not require Hamiltonian-specialized implementation. We
benchmark our algorithms with a case study of the Ising model, where the
critical point is located using entanglement measures. We then study the
dynamics of this model under a time-dependent quench of the transverse field
through the critical point. Finally, we present studies of a dipolar, or
long-range Ising model, again using entanglement measures to find the critical
point and study the dynamics of a time-dependent quench through the critical
point.

$\psi$ of the standard model by ${\psi}$D$^j_{mm'}$, where D$^{j}_{mm'}$ are

knot algebra. The D$^j_{mm'}$ lie in this algebra and carry the new degrees of
freedom of the field quanta. The D$^j_{mm'}$ are restricted jointly by
empirical constraints and by a postulated correspondence with classical knots.
The elementary fermions are described by elements of the trefoil
($j=\frac{3}{2}$) representation and the weak vector bosons by elements of the
ditrefoil ($j=3$) representation. The adjoint ($j=1$) and fundamental
($j=\frac{1}{2}$) representations define hypothetical bosonic and fermionic
preons. All particles described by higher representations may be regarded as
composed of the fermionic preons. This preon model unexpectedly agrees in
important detail with the Harari-Shupe model. The new Lagrangian, which is
invariant under gauge transformations of the SLq(2) algebra, fixes the relative
masses of the elementary fermions within the same family. It also introduces
form factors that modify the electroweak couplings and provide a
parametrization of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. It is additionally
postulated that the preons carry gluon charge and that the fermions, which are
three preon systems, are in agreement with the color assignments of the
standard model.

of eruption of a coronal flux rope. The simulation begins with a twisted flux
rope emerging at the lower boundary and pushing into a pre-existing coronal
potential arcade field. At a chosen time the emergence is stopped with the
lower boundary taken to be rigid. Then the coronal flux rope settles into a
quasi-static rise phase during which an underlying, central sigmoid-shaped
current layer forms along the so called hyperbolic flux tube (HFT), a
generalization of the X-line configuration. Reconnections in the dissipating
current layer effectively add twisted flux to the flux rope and thus allow it
to rise quasi-statically, even though the magnetic energy is decreasing as the
system relaxes. We examine the thermal features produced by the current layer
formation and the associated ""tether-cutting"" reconnections as a result of
heating and field aligned thermal conduction. It is found that a central hot,
low-density channel containing reconnected, twisted flux threading under the
flux rope axis forms on top of the central current layer. When viewed in the
line of sight roughly aligned with the hot channel (which is roughly along the
neutral line), the central current layer appears as a high-density vertical
column with upward extensions as a ""U"" shaped dense shell enclosing a central
hot, low-density void. Such thermal features have been observed within coronal
prominence cavities. Our MHD simulation suggests that they are the signatures
of the development of the HFT topology and the associated tether-cutting
reconnections, and that the central void grows and rises with the
reconnections, until the flux rope reaches the critical height for the onset of
the torus instability and dynamic eruption ensues.

related to the sign problem in finite-density QCD. Recently it has been shown
that ignoring the complex phase -- the phase quenching -- does not change
physics in a certain region of the phase diagram when a number of colors N_c is
large. In this paper we study the effect of the phase quenching within the
frameworks of effective models and holographic models. We show, in a unified
manner, that the phase quenching gives exact results for any fermionic
observables (e.g., chiral condensate) in the mean-field approximation and for
gauge-invariant gluonic observables (e.g., Polyakov loop) to one-meson-loop
corrections beyond mean field. We also discuss implications for the lattice
simulations and confirm good quantitative agreement between our prediction and
existing lattice QCD results. Therefore the phase quenching provides rather
accurate answer already at N_c=3 with small 1/N_c corrections which can be
taken into account by the phase reweighting.

strictly less than 1. Using semidefinite programming, we show a tight bound of
7/8 on this probability (3/4 for the case of unambiguous PPT measurements). We
generalize this result by demonstrating a simple construction of a set of k

model is then quantized and a good correspondence is shown between the
classical and quantum cosmology indicating that the noncommutativity does not
destruct the classical-quantum correspondence. It is also shown that the
quantum cosmology supports a signature transition where the bare cosmological
constant takes a vast continuous spectrum of negative values. The bounds of
bare cosmological constant are limited by the values of noncommutative
parameters. Moreover, it turns out that the physical parameters are constrained
by the noncommutativity parametres.

$> 10^{-2}$) are rare. Those with ages between 30 and 130 Myr are of interest
because their evolution has progressed well beyond that of protoplanetary disks
(which dissipate with a timescale of order 3 Myr), yet they represent a period
when dynamical models suggest that terrestrial planet building may still be
progressing through large, violent collisions that could yield large amounts of
debris and large infrared excesses. For example, our Moon was formed through a
violent collision of two large proto-planets during this age range. We report
two disks around the solar-like stars ID8 and HD 23514 in this age range where
the 24 {\mu}m infrared excesses vary on timescales of a few years, even though
the stars are not variable in the optical. Variations this rapid are difficult
to understand if the debris is produced by collisional cascades, as it is for
most debris disks. It is possible that the debris in these two systems arises
in part from condensates from silicate-rich vapor produced in a series of
violent collisions among relatively large bodies. If their evolution is rapid,
the rate of detection of extreme excesses would indicate that major collisions
may be relatively common in this age range.

Additionally, SPn equations of arbitrary order are derived in an ad hoc way.
The resulting SPn equations are hyperbolic and differ from those investigated
in a previous work by some of the authors. In two space dimensions, numerical
calculations for the Pn and SPn equations are performed. We simulate neutron
distributions of a moving rod and present results for a benchmark problem,
known as the checkerboard problem. The SPn equations are demonstrated to yield
significantly more accurate results than diffusion approximations. In addition,
for sufficiently low values of n, they are shown to be more efficient than Pn

its asymptotic behaviour in the limit of many dislocations. The dislocations
are represented by points in a plane, and they are arranged in vertical walls;
each wall is free to move in the horizontal direction. The system is described
by a discrete energy depending on the one-dimensional horizontal positions of
the n walls; the energy contains contributions from repulsive pairwise
interactions between all walls, a global shear stress forcing the walls to the
left, and a pinned wall at x=0 that prevents the walls from leaving through the
left boundary.
  We study the behaviour of the energy as the number n of walls tends to
infinity, and characterise this behaviour in terms of Gamma-convergence. There
are five different cases, depending on the asymptotic behaviour of a single
dimensionless parameter. As a consequence we obtain characterisations of the
limiting behaviour of stationary states in each of these five regimes.
  The results shed new light on the open problem of upscaling large numbers of
dislocations. We show how various existing upscaled models arise as special
cases of the theorems of this paper. The wide variety of behaviour suggests
that upscaled models should incorporate more information than just dislocation
densities. This additional information is encoded in the limit of the
dimensionless parameter.

continuum surveys, with the inclusion of some degree of redshift information,
can constrain cosmological parameters. By cross-matching these radio surveys
with shallow optical to near-infrared surveys, we can essentially separate the
source distribution into a low- and a high-redshift sample, thus providing a
constraint on the evolution of cosmological parameters such as those related to
dark energy. We examine two radio surveys, the Evolutionary Map of the Universe
(EMU) and the Westerbork Observations of the Deep APERTIF Northern sky (WODAN).
A crucial advantage is their combined potential to provide a deep, full-sky
survey. The surveys used for the cross-identifications are SkyMapper and SDSS,
for the southern and northern skies, respectively. We concentrate on the galaxy
clustering angular power spectrum as our benchmark observable, and find that
the possibility of including such low redshift information yields major
improvements in the determination of cosmological parameters. With this
approach, and provided a good knowledge of the galaxy bias evolution, we are
able to put strict constraints on the dark energy parameters, i.e.
w_0=-0.9+/-0.041 and w_a=-0.24+/-0.13, with type Ia supernovae and CMB priors
(with a one-parameter bias in this case); this corresponds to a Figure of Merit
(FoM) > 600, which is twice better than what is obtained by using only the
cross-identified sources and greater than four time better than the case
without any redshift information at all.

collapsed-core globular star cluster M15, which directly address the issue of
whether a central black hole is required to fit Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
observations of the stellar spatial distribution and kinematics. As in our
previous work reported by Dull et al., we find that a central black hole is not
needed. Using local mass-function data from HST studies, we have also inferred
the global initial stellar mass function. As a consequence of extreme mass
segregation, the local mass functions differs from the global mass function at
every location. In addition to reproducing the observed mass functions, the
models also provide good fits to the star-count and velocity-dispersion
profiles, and to the millisecond pulsar accelerations. We address concerns
about the large neutron star populations adopted in our previous Fokker-Planck
models for M15. We find that good model fits can be obtained with as few as
1600 neutron stars; this corresponds to a retention fraction of 5% of the
initial population for our best fit initial mass function. The models contain a
substantial population of massive white dwarfs, that range in mass up to 1.2
solar masses. The combined contribution by the massive white dwarfs and neutron
stars provides the gravitational potential needed to reproduce HST measurements
of the central velocity dispersion profile.

this traditionally defines habitability. One proposed signature of oceans is
specular reflection (""glint""), which increases the apparent albedo of a planet
at crescent phases. We post-process a global climate model of an Earth-like
planet to simulate reflected lightcurves. Significantly, we obtain glint-like
phase variations even though we do not include specular reflection in our
model. This false positive is the product of two generic properties: 1) for
modest obliquities, a planet's poles receive less orbit-averaged stellar flux
than its equator, so the poles are more likely to be covered in highly
reflective snow and ice, and 2) we show that reflected light from a
modest-obliquity planet at crescent phases probes higher latitudes than at
gibbous phases, therefore a planet's apparent albedo will naturally increase at
crescent phase. We suggest that this ""latitude-albedo effect"" will operate even
for large obliquities: in that case the equator receives less orbit-averaged
flux than the poles, and the equator is preferentially sampled at crescent
phase. Using rotational and orbital color variations to map the surfaces of
directly imaged planets and estimate their obliquity will therefore be a
necessary pre-condition for properly interpreting their reflected phase
variations. The latitude-albedo effect is a particularly convincing glint false
positive for zero-obliquity planets, and such worlds are not amenable to
latitudinal mapping. This effect severely limits the utility of specular
reflection for detecting oceans on exoplanets.

estimated. Our study is relevant to astrobiology as it addresses whether life
on Earth could have been transferred to other planetary systems in the solar
system's birth cluster and whether life on Earth could have been transferred
here from beyond the solar system. In the solar system, the timescale over
which solid material was delivered to the region from where it could be
transferred via this mechanism likely extended to several hundred million years
(as indicated by the 3.8-4.0 Ga epoch of the Late Heavy Bombardment). This
timescale could have overlapped with the lifetime of the Solar birth cluster
(~100-500 Myr). Therefore, we conclude that lithopanspermia is an open
possibility if life had an early start. Adopting parameters from the minimum
mass solar nebula, considering a range of planetesimal size distributions
derived from observations of asteroids and Kuiper Belt Objects and theoretical
coagulation models, and taking into account Oort Cloud formation models, the
expected number of bodies with mass > 10 kg that could have been transferred
between the Sun and its nearest cluster neighbor could be of the order of
1E14-3E16, with transfer timescales of 10s Myr. We estimate that of the order
of 3E8 x l(km) could potentially be life-bearing, where l(km) is the depth of
the Earth crust in km that was ejected as the result of the early bombardment.

GeV, which is relevant to current and coming experiments (MINOS, NOvA, and

noticeably change the spectra of the outgoing hadrons. In the Minerva and NOvA

number of studies focusing on reconstructing the 3D dark matter density field.
Typically, these studies have focused on one given method or tracer. In this
paper, we reconstruct the distribution of mass in the COSMOS field out to a
redshift z=1 by combining Hubble Space Telescope weak lensing measurements with
zCOSMOS spectroscopic measurements of galaxy clustering. The distribution of
galaxies traces the distribution of mass with high resolution (particularly in
redshift, which is not possible with lensing), and the lensing data empirically
calibrates the mass normalisation (bypassing the need for theoretical models).
Two steps are needed to convert a galaxy survey into a density field. The first
step is to create a smooth field from the galaxy positions, which is a point
field. We investigate four possible methods for this: (i) Gaussian smoothing,
(ii) convolution with truncated isothermal sphere, (iii) fifth nearest
neighbour smoothing and (iv) a muliti-scale entropy method. The second step is
to rescale this density field using a bias prescription. We calculate the
optimal bias scaling for each method by comparing predictions from the smoothed
density field with the measured weak lensing data, on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis.
In general, we find scale-independent bias for all the smoothing schemes, to a
precision of 10%. For the nearest neighbour smoothing case, we find the bias to
be 2.51\pm 0.25. We also find evidence for a strongly evolving bias, increasing
by a factor of ~3.5 between redshifts 0<z<0.8. We believe this strong evolution
can be explained by the fact that we use a flux limited sample to build the
density field.

history was roughly constant from 0.5-1.5 Gyr (at 3-5x10^(-4) Msun/yr), but
decreased by a factor of several in the past 0.3 Gyr. Most star clusters have a
mass between 10^2 - 10^4 Msun. The specific star formation rates of ~10^(-16)
yr^(-1) (at the present day) or ~10^(-14) yr^(-1) (when averaging over the past
Gyr) imply that a fraction 10^(-8) of the stellar mass is younger than 100 Myr
and 10^(-5) is younger than 1 Gyr, quantifying the level of frosting of recent
star formation over the otherwise passive stellar population. There is no
obvious correlation between either the presence or spatial distribution of
postulated star formation indicators and the star formation we detect.

first clear detection of a bridge associated both with an outlying cluster
relic and X-ray diffuse emission. All the indicators point toward the
synchrotron bridge being related to the post-shock turbulent wake trailing the
shock front generated by a major merger in a massive cluster. Although
predicted by simulations, this is the first time such emission is detected with
high significance and clearly associated with the path of a confirmed shock.
Although the origin of the relativistic electrons is still unknown, the
turbulent re-acceleration model provides a natural explanation for the

hydrodynamic memory. The noise characteristic time scale is typically of the

friction (inertial time scale). We demonstrate theoretically that, in the
presence of a temperature gradient, the interplay between these two
characteristic time scales can have measurable consequences on the particle
long-time behaviour. Using homogenization theory, we analyse the infinitesimal
generator of the stochastic differential equation describing the system in the
limit where the two characteristic times are taken to zero; from this
generator, we derive the thermophoretic transport coefficient, which, we find,
can vary in both magnitude and sign, as observed in experiments. Furthermore,
studying the long-term stationary particle distribution, we show that particles
can accumulate towards the colder (positive thermophoresis) or the warmer
(negative thermophoresis) regions depending on the dependence of their physical
parameters and, in particular, their mobility on the temperature.

for the Kantorovich potential (which determines the map), with a subtle initial
condition. The proof requires the use of the Nash-Moser inverse function

been verified to low genus for several toric CY3folds, and proved to all genus

the fact that both sides of the conjecture can be naturally written in terms of
combinatorial sums of weighted graphs: on the A-model side this is the
localization formula, and on the B-model side the graphs encode the recursive
algorithm of the topological recursion. One can slightly reorganize the set of
graphs obtained in the B-side, so that it coincides with the one obtained by
localization in the A-model.Then it suffices to compare the weights of vertices
and edges of graphs on each side, which is done in 2 steps: the weights
coincide in the large radius limit, due to the fact that the toric graph is the
tropical limit of the mirror curve. Then the derivatives with respect to
K\""ahler radius coincide due to special geometry property implied by the
topological recursion.

related likelihoods are unavailable. A composite likelihood approach based on
the bivariate distribution of block maxima has been recently proposed in the
literature. However modeling block maxima is a wasteful approach provided that
other information is available. Moreover an approach based on block, typically
annual, maxima is unable to take into account the fact that maxima occur or not
simultaneously. If time series of, say, daily data are available, then
estimation procedures based on exceedances of a high threshold could mitigate
such problems. In this paper we focus on two approaches for composing
likelihoods based on pairs of exceedances. The first one comes from the tail
approximation for bivariate distribution proposed by Ledford and Tawn (1996)
when both pairs of observations exceed the fixed threshold. The second one uses
the bivariate extension (Rootzen and Tajvidi, 2006) of the generalized Pareto
distribution which allows to model exceedances when at least one of the
components is over the threshold. The two approaches are compared through a
simulation study according to different degrees of spatial dependency. Results
show that both the strength of the spatial dependencies and the threshold
choice play a fundamental role in determining which is the best estimating
procedure.

area of 10x10 deg^2.We compare statistically the changes in their residual maps
with/without inclusion of the SSA after the bright sources of S_150MHz>=100mJy
are excised and the best-fitted polynomials in frequency domain on each pixel
are further subtracted.It has been shown that the effect of SSA on the
detection of EOR depends sensitively on the spectral profiles of radio sources
around the turnover frequencies: A hard transition model described by the
broken power law with the turnover of spectral index at nu_m would leave
pronounced imprints on the residual background and cause serious confusion with
the EOR signal.However,the spectral signatures on the angular power spectrum of
extragalactic foreground generated by a soft transition model,in which the rise
and fall power laws of spectral distribution around nu_m are connected through
a smooth transition spanning >=200 MHz in characteristic width,can be fitted
and consequently subtracted by employment of polynomials to an acceptable
degree(delta T<1mK).As this latter scenario seems to be favored by both
theoretical expectation and radio spectral observations,we conclude that the
influence of SSA on the 21cm experiments is probably very minor.

Hermitian manifold. The supercharge transforms as a scalar on M. We then
consider the restrictions imposed by the presence of additional supercharges.
Two supercharges of opposite R-charge exist on certain fibrations of a
two-torus over a Riemann surface. Upon dimensional reduction, these give rise
to an interesting class of supersymmetric geometries in three dimensions. We
further show that compact manifolds admitting two supercharges of equal
R-charge must be hyperhermitian. Finally, four supercharges imply that M is

years has led to the discovery of more than a thousand sources at GeV energies
and more than a hundred sources at TeV energies. A few different classes of
compact objects in the Galaxy have been established. They show many unexpected
features at high energies the physics of which remains mainly unknown. At
present it is clear that detailed investigation of these new phenomena can be
performed only with the technical equipment which offer an order of magnitude
better sensitivity, and a few times better energy, angular and time resolution
in the broad energy range staring from a few tens of GeV up to a few hundreds
TeV. Such facilities can be realized by the next generation of instruments such
as the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).
  The aim of this report is to summarize up to date observational results on
the compact galactic sources in the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray energy range, discuss
their theoretical implications, and indicate which hypothesis considered at
present might be verified with the next generation of telescopes. We point out
which of the observational features of the $\gamma$-ray sources are important
to investigate with special care with the planned CTA in order to put a new
light on physical processes involved. Their knowledge should finally allow us
to answer the question on the origin of energetic particles in our Galaxy.

the carrier density and also other relevant quantities such as the

renormalized with respect to its non-interacting (or
random-phase-approximation) value and that the renormalization is tied to the
quasiparticle velocity enhancement. This finding is in agreement with recent
theoretical predictions, which attribute the renormalization of the Drude
weight in graphene to the interplay between broken Galilean invariance and
electron-electron interactions.

special if it admits a multiple Weyl Aligned Null Direction (WAND). The
algebraically special property restricts the form of the ""optical matrix"" that
defines the expansion, rotation and shear of the multiple WAND. After working
out some general constraints that hold in arbitrary dimensions, we determine
necessary algebraic conditions on the optical matrix of a multiple WAND in a
five-dimensional Einstein spacetime. We prove that one can choose an
orthonormal basis to bring the 3 x 3 optical matrix to one of three canonical
forms, each involving two parameters, and we discuss the existence of an
""optical structure"" within these classes. Examples of solutions corresponding
to each form are given. We give an example which demonstrates that our
necessary algebraic conditions are not sufficient for a null vector field to be
a multiple WAND, in contrast with the 4d result.

gravitational-wave (GW) transient events recorded by LIGO and Virgo in their
2009-2010 science run. The events were selected with low latency by the network
of GW detectors and their candidate sky locations were observed by the Swift
observatory. Image transient detection was used to analyze the collected
electromagnetic data, which were found to be consistent with background.
Off-line analysis of the GW data alone has also established that the selected
GW events show no evidence of an astrophysical origin; one of them is
consistent with background and the other one was a test, part of a ""blind
injection challenge"". With this work we demonstrate the feasibility of rapid
follow-ups of GW transients and establish the sensitivity improvement joint
electromagnetic and GW observations could bring. This is a first step toward an
electromagnetic follow-up program in the regime of routine detections with the
advanced GW instruments expected within this decade. In that regime
multi-wavelength observations will play a significant role in completing the
astrophysical identification of GW sources. We present the methods and results
from this first combined analysis and discuss its implications in terms of
sensitivity for the present and future instruments.

empirically well-constrained velocity and magnetic fields. The basic evolution
of the Sun's large-scale surface magnetic field is well described by this

the surface evolution of the flux transport dynamo (FTD), and the evolution of
the SFT model can be used to constrain several near-surface properties of the
FTD model.
  We compared the results of the FTD model with different upper boundary
conditions and diffusivity profiles against the results of the SFT model. Among
the ingredients of the FTD model, downward pumping of magnetic flux, related to
a positive diffusivity gradient, has a significant effect in slowing down the
diffusive radial transport of magnetic flux through the solar surface. Provided
the pumping was strong enough to give rise to a downflow of a magnetic Reynolds
number of 5 in the near-surface boundary layer, the FTD using a vertical
boundary condition matches the SFT model based on the average velocities above
the boundary layer. The FTD model with a potential field were unable to match
the SFT results.

applications. In particular, a pair of matrices (E,A) may be interpreted as the
differential equation E x' + A x = 0. Such an equation is invariant by changes
of variables, or linear combination of the equations. This change of variables
or equations is associated to a group action. The invariants corresponding to
this group action are well known, namely the Kronecker indices and divisors.
Similarly, for another group action corresponding to the weak equivalence, a
complete set of invariants is also known, among others the strangeness.
  We show how to define those invariants in a directly invariant fashion, i.e.
without using a basis or an extra Euclidean structure. To this end, we will
define a reduction process which produces a new system out of the original one.
The various invariants may then be defined from operators related to the
repeated application of the reduction process. We then show the relation
between the invariants and the reduced subspace dimensions, and the relation
with the regular pencil condition. This is all done using invariant tools only.
  Making special choices of basis then allows to construct the Kronecker
canonical form. In a related manner, we construct the strangeness canonical

contribution to science. As the number of published papers increases every
year, a manual search becomes more exhaustive even with the help of today's
search engines since they are not specialized for this task. In academics, two
relevant papers do not always have to share keywords, cite one another, or even
be in the same field. Although a well-known paper is usually an easy pray in
such a hunt, relevant papers using a different terminology, especially recent
ones, are not obvious to the eye.
  In this work, we propose paper recommendation algorithms by using the
citation information among papers. The proposed algorithms are direction aware
in the sense that they can be tuned to find either recent or traditional
papers. The algorithms require a set of papers as input and recommend a set of
related ones. If the user wants to give negative or positive feedback on the
suggested paper set, the recommendation is refined. The search process can be
easily guided in that sense by relevance feedback. We show that this slight
guidance helps the user to reach a desired paper in a more efficient way. We
adapt our models and algorithms also for the venue and reviewer recommendation
tasks. Accuracy of the models and algorithms is thoroughly evaluated by
comparison with multiple baselines and algorithms from the literature in terms
of several objectives specific to citation, venue, and reviewer recommendation
tasks. All of these algorithms are implemented within a publicly available

we call rakeness, accounting for the amount of energy that the measurements
capture from the signal to be acquired. Hence, for localized signals a proper
system tuning increases the rakeness as well as the average SNR of the samples
used in its reconstruction. Yet, maximizing average SNR may go against the need
of capturing all the components that are potentially non-zero in a sparse
signal, i.e., against the restricted isometry requirement ensuring
reconstructability. What we propose is to administer the trade-off between
rakeness and restricted isometry in a statistical way by laying down an
optimization problem. The solution of such an optimization problem is the
statistic of the process generating the random waveforms onto which the signal
is projected to obtain the measurements. The formal definition of such a
problems is given as well as its solution for signals that are either localized
in frequency or in more generic domain. Sample applications, to ECG signals and
small images of printed letters and numbers, show that rakeness-based design
leads to non-negligible improvements in both cases.

points P and Q with respect to a given triangle. This formula implies Blundon
type inequalities generated by the points P and Q (Theorem 3.2). Some
applications are given in the last section by choosing special points P and Q.

crystal structure of Cs$_2$CuCl$_2$Br$_2$ should contain elongated in the
$ab-$plane CuCl$_4$Br$_2$ octahedra, in contrast to the experimentally observed
compression in $c-$direction. We also predict that the spins on Cu$^{2+}$ ions
should be ferromagnetically ordered in $ab-$plane, while the exchange
interaction along $c-$direction is small and its sign is uncertain.

Special Relativity and should be amended in the presence of magnetization and
polarization in order to avoid a paradox involving a magnet in the presence of
an electric field. Here we stress the well-known fact among relativists that
such an incompatibility is simply impossible and show that the appearance of
such a ""paradox"" is a mere consequence of not fully considering the
relativistic consequences of the covariant form of the Lorentz force. It should
be mentioned, though, that this criticism does not invalidate the debate on
which is the law of force followed by Nature, which is an experimental issue.

Yukawa coupling of right-handed neutrinos can be of order one. This implies
that the out of equilibrium condition for leptogenesis within standard
cosmology is not satisfied. We provide two scenarios for overcoming this
problem and generating the desired value of the baryon asymmetry of the
Universe. The first scenario is based on extra-dimensional braneworld effects
that modify the Friedman equation. We show that in this case the value of the
baryon asymmetry of the Universe constrains the five-dimensional Planck mass to
be of order O(100) TeV. In the second scenario a non-thermal right-handed
neutrino produced by the decay of inflaton is assumed. We emphasize that in
this case, it is possible to generate the required baryon asymmetry of the
Universe for TeV scale right-handed neutrinos.

Finsler-Cartan spaces modelled on tangent Lorentz bundles. Nonholonomic
(Finsler) twistors are defined as solutions of generalized twistor equations
determined by spin connections and frames adapted to nonlinear connection
structures. We show that the constructions for local twistors can be globalized
using nonholonomic deformations with ""auxiliary"" metric compatible connections
completely determined by the metric structure and/or the Finsler fundamental
function. We explain how to perform such an approach in the Einstein gravity
theory formulated in Finsler like variables with conventional nonholonomic 2+2
splitting.
