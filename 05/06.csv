Two requirements are imposed by the engineering constraints of existing quantum
hardware: training problems are formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization; and model parameters are represented as binary expansions of low
bit-depth. In the present work we validate this approach by using a heuristic
classical solver as a stand-in for quantum hardware. Testing on several popular
data sets and comparing with a number of existing losses we find substantial
advantages in robustness as measured by test error under increasing label

form of an organism, is one of the most intriguing mysteries in the life
sciences. It is clear, that gene expression patterns cannot explain the
development of the precise geometry of an organism and its parts in space.
Here, we suggest a set of postulates and possible approaches for discovering
the correspondence between molecular biological information and its realization
in a given geometry of an organism in space-time. First, we suggest that the
geometry of the organism and its parts is coded by a molecular code located on
the cell surfaces in such a way that, with each cell, there can be associated a
corresponding matrix, containing this code. As a particular model, we propose
coding by several types of oligosaccharide residues of glycoconjugates. Second,
we provide a notion of cell event, and suggest a description of development as
a tree of cell events, where under cell event we understand the changing of
cell state, e.g. the processes of cell division, cell growth/death, shift or
differentiation. Next we suggest describing these cell motion laws using the
notion of a ""morphogenetic field"", meaning by the field an object in an ""event
space"" over a ""cell space"", which govern the transformation of the coded
biological information into an instructive signal for a cell event for a given
cell, depending on the position of a cell in the developing embryo. The matrix
on a cell surface will be changed after each cell event according to the
rule(s) dictated by the morphogenetic field of an organism. Finally, we provide
some ideas on the connection between morphogenetic code on a cell surface, cell
motion law(s) and the geometry of an embryo.

larger class of monoids called left regular bands. In both cases, the
representation theory of these monoids played a prominent role. In particular,
it was used to compute the spectrum of the transition operators of the Markov
chains and to prove diagonalizability of the transition operators.
  In this paper, we establish a close connection between algebraic and
combinatorial invariants of a left regular band: we show that certain
homological invariants of the algebra of a left regular band coincide with the
cohomology of order complexes of posets naturally associated to the left
regular band. For instance, we show that the global dimension of these algebras
is bounded above by the Leray number of the associated order complex.
Conversely, we associate to every flag complex a left regular band whose

ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions have led to further understanding of the
properties of the medium created in such collisions. Measurements of the
correlations between the axes of reconstructed jets and the reaction plane or
second-order participant plane of the bulk medium (defined as jet $v_2$), as
well as the higher-order participant planes (jet $v_n$), provide information on
medium-induced parton energy loss. Additionally, knowledge of jet $v_n$ as well
as the ability to reconstruct the event plane in the presence of a jet are
necessary in analyses of jet-triggered particle correlations, which are used to
study medium-induced jet shape modification. However, the presence of a jet can
bias the event plane calculation, leading to an overestimation of jet $v_2$.
This paper proposes a method for calculating jet $v_2$ (and by extension, the
higher jet $v_n$ harmonics) and the event plane in an unbiased way, using
knowledge of the azimuthal angle of the jet axis from full jet reconstruction.

codebooks of N correlated random variables are generated according to their
respective marginals. The problem of determining the conditions on the rates of
codebooks to ensure the existence of at least one codeword tuple which is
jointly typical with respect to a given joint density (called the multivariate
covering lemma) has been studied fairly well and the associated rate regions
have found applications in several source coding scenarios. However, several
multiterminal source coding applications, such as the general multi-user
Gray-Wyner network, require joint typicality only within subsets of codewords
transmitted. Motivated by such applications, we ask ourselves the conditions on
the rates to ensure the existence of at least one codeword tuple which is
jointly typical within subsets according to given per subset joint densities.
This report focuses primarily on deriving a new achievable rate region for this
problem which strictly improves upon the direct extension of the multivariate
covering lemma, which has quite popularly been used in several earlier work.
Towards proving this result, we derive two important results called `subset
typicality lemmas' which can potentially have broader applicability in more
general scenarios beyond what is considered in this report. We finally apply
the results therein to derive a new achievable region for the general
multi-user Gray-Wyner network.

computer science, in which the objects under investigation are not accessible
because of various limitations, we propose a trial-and-error model to examine
algorithmic issues in such situations. Given a search problem with a hidden
input, we are asked to find a valid solution, to find which we can propose
candidate solutions (trials), and use observed violations (errors), to prepare
future proposals. In accordance with our motivating applications, we consider
the fairly broad class of constraint satisfaction problems, and assume that
errors are signaled by a verification oracle in the format of the index of a
violated constraint (with the content of the constraint still hidden).
  Our discoveries are summarized as follows. On one hand, despite the seemingly
very little information provided by the verification oracle, efficient
algorithms do exist for a number of important problems. For the Nash, Core,
Stable Matching, and SAT problems, the unknown-input versions are as hard as
the corresponding known-input versions, up to a factor of polynomial. We
further give almost tight bounds on the latter two problems' trial
complexities. On the other hand, there are problems whose complexities are
substantially increased in the unknown-input model. In particular, no
time-efficient algorithms exist (under standard hardness assumptions) for Graph
Isomorphism and Group Isomorphism problems. The tools used to achieve these
results include order theory, strong ellipsoid method, and some non-standard
reductions.
  Our model investigates the value of information, and our results demonstrate
that the lack of input information can introduce various levels of extra
difficulty. The model exhibits intimate connections with (and we hope can also
serve as a useful supplement to) certain existing learning and complexity
theories.

probe the interplay of light and electricity in organic solar cells and
light-emitting diodes, and the origin of decoherence in condensed matter, which
is of fundamental importance to the development of quantum information
processors. Like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), EPR spectroscopy becomes
more powerful at high magnetic fields and frequencies, and with excitation by
coherent pulses rather than continuous waves. However, the difficulty of
generating sequences of powerful pulses at frequencies above 100 GHz has, until
now, confined high-power pulsed EPR to magnetic fields of 3.5 T and below. Here
we demonstrate that ~1 kW pulses from a free-electron laser (FEL) can power a
pulsed EPR spectrometer at 240 GHz (8.5 T), providing transformative
enhancements over the alternative, a state-of-the-art ~30 mW solid state
source. Using the UC Santa Barbara FEL as a source, our 240 GHz spectrometer
can rotate spin-1/2 electrons through pi/2 in only 6 ns (vs. 300 ns with the
solid state source). Fourier transform EPR on nitrogen impurities in diamond
demonstrates excitation and detection of EPR lines separated by ~200 MHz.
Decoherence times for spin-1/2 systems as short as 63 ns are measured, enabling
measurement of the decoherence time in a frozen solution of nitroxide
free-radicals at temperatures as high as 190 K. Both FELs and the quasi-optical
technology developed for the spectrometer are scalable to frequencies well in

found that the bimodal feature is well observed in the 50-100 and 100-350 keV

with those observed by missions with similar energy bands. The parameter T90 as
a function of energy follows \bar T90 \propto E^{-0.20\pm 0.02} for long GRBs.
Considering the erratic X-ray and optical flares, the duration of a burst would
be even much longer for most GRBs. Our results, together with the observed
extended emission of some short GRBs, indicate that the central engine activity
time scale would be much longer than T90} for both long and short GRBs and the
observed bimodal T90 distribution may be due to an instrumental selection

theory are explored through perturbative viewpoint. Following the recent work
of Green and Shih, in which a conjecture involved this issue is verified at the
NLO, we consider the NNLO corrections to the bounds, which are important in
some situations and can be divided into two cases where
$\mathcal{O}(\lambda^{4})$ or $\mathcal{O}(y^2)$ effects dominate respectively.
In the former case, we find that the conjecture is maintained at NNLO, while in
the later case, the statement still holds due to the null corrections arising
from $\mathcal{O}(y^{2})$.

successive generations of gamma-ray telescopes through a bright annihilation
emission from the bulge region, with a fainter contribution from the inner
disk. The exact origin of these particles remains currently unknown. We
estimate the contribution to the annihilation signal of positrons generated in
the decay of radioactive 26Al, 56Ni and 44Ti. We adapted the GALPROP
propagation code to simulate the transport and annihilation of radioactivity
positrons in a model of our Galaxy. Using plausible source spatial
distributions, we explored several possible propagation scenarios to account
for the large uncertainties on the transport of ~1MeV positrons in the
interstellar medium. We then compared the predicted intensity distributions to
the INTEGRAL/SPI observations. We obtain similar intensity distributions with
small bulge-to-disk ratios, even for extreme large-scale transport
prescriptions. At least half of the positrons annihilate close to their
sources, even when they are allowed to travel far away. In the high-diffusion,
ballistic case, up to 40% of them escape the Galaxy. In proportion, this
affects bulge positrons more than disk positrons because they are injected
further off the plane in a tenuous medium, while disk positrons are mostly
injected in the dense molecular ring. The predicted intensity distributions are
fully consistent with the observed longitudinally-extended disk-like emission,
but the transport scenario cannot be strongly constrained by the current data.
Nucleosynthesis positrons alone cannot account for the observed annihilation
emission in the frame of our model. An additional component is needed to
explain the strong bulge contribution, and the latter is very likely
concentrated in the central regions if positrons have initial energies in the
100keV-1MeV range.

solution, femtocell technology, has been rapidly developed and deployed over
the past few years. One of the biggest challenges for femtocell deployment is
lack of a clear business model. This paper investigates the economic incentive
for the cellular operator (also called macrocell operator) to enable femtocell
service by leasing spectrum resource to an independent femtocell operator. On
the one hand, femtocell services can increase communication service quality and
thus increase the efficiency of the spectrum resource. On the other hand,
femtocell services may introduce more competition to the market. We model the
interactions between a macrocell operator, a femtocell operator, and users as a
three-stage dynamic game, and derive the equilibrium pricing and capacity
allocation decisions. We show that when spectrum resources are very limited,
the macrocell operator has incentive to lease spectrum to femtocell operators,
as femtocell service can provide access to more users and efficiently increase
the coverage. However, when the total spectrum resource is large, femtocell
service offers significant competition to macrocell service. Macrocell operator
thus has less incentive to enable femtocell service. We also investigate the
issue of additional operational cost and limited coverage of femtocell service
on equilibrium decisions, consumer surplus and social welfare.

Ts measurements exist for samples of DLAs with z <0.6 and z >1.7, the
intermediate redshift regime currently contains only 2 HI 21cm detections,
leading to a `redshift desert' that spans 4 Gyrs of cosmic time. To connect the
low and high z regimes, we present observations of the Lya line of six
0.6<z<1.7 HI 21cm absorbers. The dataset is complemented by both VLBA
observations (to derive the absorber covering factor, f), and optical echelle
spectra from which metal abundances are determined. Our dataset therefore not
only offers the largest statistical study of HI 21cm absorbers to date, and
bridges the redshift desert, but is also the first to use a fully f-corrected
dataset to look for metallicity-based trends. In agreement with trends found in
Galactic sightlines, we find that the lowest N(HI) absorbers tend to be
dominated by warm gas. In the DLA regime, spin temperatures show a wider range
of values than Galactic data, as may be expected in a heterogenous galactic
population. However, we find that low metallicity DLAs are dominated by small
cold gas fractions and only absorbers with relatively high metallicities
exhibit significant fractions of cold gas. Using a compilation of HI 21cm
absorbers which are selected to have f-corrected spin temperatures, we confirm
an anti-correlation between metallicity and Ts at 3.4 sigma significance.
Finally, one of the DLAs in our sample is a newly-discovered HI 21cm absorber
(at z=0.602 towards J1431+3952), which we find to have the lowest f-corrected
spin temperature yet reported in the literature: Ts=90+-23 K. The observed

turnaround to virialization. We find that in the presence of decaying dark
matter both thermal and dynamical evolution of minihaloes demonstrate
significant deviation from those in the model without dark matter decay
(standard recombination). We show that optical depth in 21 cm line is strongly
suppressed in the presence of decaying particles: for $M=10^5-10^6\msun$
decaying dark matter with the energy rate deposited in baryonic gas $\xi_{L} =
0.59\times 10^{-25}$ s$^{-1}$ - the current upper limit of the energy deposit -
decreases the optical depth and the equivalent width by an order of magnitude
compared to the standard recombination. Thus additional ionization and heating
from decaying DM particles almost ""erases"" absorption features from minihaloes
with $M=10^5-10^6\msun$ for $\xi \simgt 0.3\xi_L$, which consequently
considerably decreases the number of strong absorptions: for example, the
number of absorptions with the equivalent width $W_\nu^{obs} \simgt 0.3$ kHz at
$z\simeq10$ decreases more than 2.5 times for $\xi/\xi_{L} = 0.3$ and
$\simgt$4.5 times for $\xi/\xi_{L} = 1$. We argue that ""21 cm forest""

via the cohomology of ambient semisimple algebraic groups was first shown to be
viable in the papers [CPS75] and [CPSvdK77]. The second paper introduced,
through a limiting process, the notion of generic cohomology, as an
intermediary between finite Chevalley group and algebraic group cohomology. The
present paper shows that, for irreducible modules as coefficients, the limits
can be eliminated in all but finitely many cases. These exceptional cases
depend only on the root system and cohomological degree. In fact, we show that,
for sufficiently large r, depending only on the root system and m, and not on
the prime p or the irreducible module L, there are isomorphisms H^m(G(p^r),L)
-> H^m(G(p^r),L') -> H^m_gen(G,L') -> H^m(G,L'), where the subscript ""gen""
refers to generic cohomology and L' is a constructibly determined irreducible
""shift"" of the (arbitrary) irreducible module L for the finite Chevalley group
G(p^r). By a famous theorem of Steinberg, both L and L' extend to irreducible
modules for the ambient algebraic group G with p^r-restricted highest weights.
This leads to the notion of a module or weight being ""shifted m-generic,"" and
thus to the title of this paper. Our approach is based on questions raised by
the third author in [Stea], which we answer here in the cohomology cases. We
obtain many additional results, often with formulations in the more general
context of Ext^m_G(q) with irreducible coefficients.

$\eta^{(\prime)}$ meson. These decays are studied in the perturbative QCD
(PQCD) approach, considering the $\eta$-$\eta'$-$G$ mixing, where $G$
represents the pseudoscalar glueball. It is shown that the PQCD predictions for
the $B_{d/s} \to J/\Psi \eta^{(')}$ branching ratios agree well with the data
for the mixing angle $\phi_G\approx 30^\circ$ between the flavor-singlet state
and the pure pseudoscalar glueball. Extending the formalism to the
$\eta$-$\eta'$-$G$-$\eta_c$ tetramixing, the abnormally large observed $B_d\to
K\eta'$ branching ratios are also explained. The proposed mixing formalism is
applicable to other heavy meson decays into $\eta^{(\prime)}$ mesons, and could
be tested by future LHCb and Super-$B$ factory data.

code NBODY6 which is widely used for direct $N$-body simulations. Over the
years, the $N^2$ nature of the direct force calculation has proved a barrier
for extending the particle number. Following an early introduction of force
polynomials and individual time-steps, the calculation cost was first reduced
by the introduction of a neighbour scheme. After a decade of GRAPE computers
which speeded up the force calculation further, we are now in the era of GPUs
where relatively small hardware systems are highly cost-effective. A
significant gain in efficiency is achieved by employing the GPU to obtain the
so-called regular force which typically involves some 99 percent of the
particles, while the remaining local forces are evaluated on the host. However,
the latter operation is performed up to 20 times more frequently and may still
account for a significant cost. This effort is reduced by parallel SSE/AVX
procedures where each interaction term is calculated using mainly single
precision. We also discuss further strategies connected with coordinate and
velocity prediction required by the integration scheme. This leaves hard
binaries and multiple close encounters which are treated by several
regularization methods. The present nbody6-GPU code is well balanced for
simulations in the particle range $10^4-2 \times 10^5$ for a dual GPU system
attached to a standard PC.
