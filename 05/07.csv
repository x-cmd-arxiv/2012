quasi-localized magnetic moment formation in mono-layer graphene starting with
the Dirac Hamiltonian, which focuses on the {\pi}- orbitals only, involving the
nearest neighbor(NN)(t) and moderate second neighbor(SN)(t' < t/3) hopping
integrals. The vacancy defect is modeled by the addition of the on-site
perturbation potential to the Hamiltonian. We find that, when (t'/t) << 1, the
vacancy induced {\pi}-state at the zero of energy(zero-mode state(ZMS)) does
not inhabit the minority sub-lattice due to the strong scalar potential induced
by the vacancy(the ZMSs get lodged in the majority sub-lattice) whereas, when
(t'/t) is increased, the ZMS is somewhat suppressed. This shows that, not only
the shift of the Fermi energy away from the linearly-dispersive Dirac points,
the issue of this topological localization is also hinged on the ratio (t'/t).
Furthermore, when a vacancy is present, the three sp2- hybridized {\sigma}
states of each of the three nearest-neighbor carbon atoms, forming a carbon
triangle surrounding the vacancy, are close to the Fermi energy (EF). The
Hund's coupling between these {\sigma} electrons and the remaining electron
which occupies the {\pi} state spin polarizes the {\pi} state leading to local
moment formation close to EF. Since the system at the Fermi level has low
electronic density, there is poor screening of such magnetic moments. This may
lead to a high Curie temperature for such vacancy-induced moments.

Maximum Conformality (PMC) in a systematic scheme-independent way. Applying the
PMC for the $t\bar{t}$-pair hadroproduction at the NNLO level, we have found
that the total cross-sections $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ at both the Tevatron and LHC
remain almost unchanged when taking very disparate initial scales $\mu^{\rm
init}_R$ equal to $m_t$, $10\,m_t$, $20\,m_t$ and $\sqrt{s}$, which is
consistent with renormalization group invariance. As an important new
application, we apply PMC scale-setting to study the top-quark forward-backward
asymmetry. We observe that the more convergent perturbative series after PMC
scale-setting leads to a more accurate top-quark forward-backward asymmetry.
The resulting PMC prediction on the asymmetry is also free from the initial
renormalization scale-dependence. Because the NLO PMC scale has a dip behavior
for the $(q\bar{q})$-channel at small subprocess collision energies, the
importance of this channel to the asymmetry is increased. We observe that the
asymmetries $A_{FB}^{t\bar{t}}$ and $A_{FB}^{p\bar{p}}$ at the Tevatron will be
increased by 42% in comparison to the previous estimates obtained by using
conventional scale-setting; i.e. we obtain $A_{FB}^{t\bar{t},{\rm PMC}} \simeq
12.5%$ and $A_{FB}^{p\bar{p},{\rm PMC}} \simeq 8.28%$. Moreover, we obtain
$A_{FB}^{t\bar{t},{\rm PMC}}(M_{t\bar{t}}>450 \;{\rm GeV}) \simeq 35.0%$. These
predictions have a $1\sigma$-deviation from the present CDF and D0
measurements; the large discrepancies of the top-quark forward-backward
asymmetry between the Standard Model estimate and the CDF and D0 data are thus
greatly reduced.

sigma-model, whose target manifold is a Lorentzian coset U[D=3]/H* and the
extremal ones are associated with H* nilpotent orbits in the K* representation
emerging from the orthogonal decomposition of the algebra U[D=3] with respect
to H*. It is shown that the classification of such orbits can always be reduced
to the Tits-Satake projection and it is a class property of the Tits Satake
universality classes. The construction procedure of Bossard et al of extremal
multicenter solutions by means of a triangular hierarchy of integrable
equations is completed and converted into a closed algorithm by means of a
general formula that provides the transition from the symmetric to the solvable
gauge. The question of the relation between H* orbits and charge orbits W of
the corresponding black holes is addressed and also reduced to the
corresponding question within the Tits Satake projection. It is conjectured
that on the vanishing locus of the Taub-NUT current the relation between
H*-orbit and W-orbit is rigid and one-to-one. All black holes emerging from
multicenter solutions associated with a given H* orbit have the same W-type.
For the S^3 model we provide a complete survey of its multicenter solutions

We derive the quantum phase transition with identical critical behavior in the

the oscillator degrees of freedom. With numerical data for the full quantum

a massive body contains information about the body's composition, and can
therefore be used as a probe of internal structure. We explore this theme by
computing the (scalar or electromagnetic) self-force when the body is a
spherical ball of perfect fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium, under the
assumption that its rest-mass density and pressure are related by a polytropic
equation of state. The body is strongly self-gravitating, and all computations
are performed in exact general relativity. The dependence on internal structure
is best revealed by expanding the self-force in powers of 1/r, with r denoting
the radial position of the charge outside the body. To the leading order, the
self-force scales as 1/r^3 and depends only on the square of the charge and the
body's mass; the leading self-force is universal. The dependence on internal
structure is seen at the next order, 1/r^5, through a structure factor that
depends on the equation of state. We compute this structure factor for
relativistic polytropes, and show that for a fixed mass, it increases linearly
with the body's radius in the case of the scalar self-force, and quadratically
with the body's radius in the case of the electromagnetic self-force. In both
cases we find that for a fixed mass and radius, the self-force is smaller if
the body is more centrally dense, and larger if the mass density is more
uniformly distributed.

prove a quantitative rate of convergence. Then, we investigate a stronger
notion of chaos, namely entropic chaos introduced in \cite{CCLLV}, and we

(EMRI) binaries, comprising a stellar-mass compact object orbiting around a
massive black hole, is one of the main targets for low-frequency
gravitational-wave detectors in space, like the Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA or eLISA/NGO). The long-duration gravitational-waveforms emitted
by such systems encode the structure of the strong field region of the massive
black hole, in which the inspiral occurs. The detection and analysis of EMRIs
will therefore allow us to study the geometry of massive black holes and
determine whether their nature is as predicted by General Relativity and even
to test whether General Relativity is the correct theory to describe the
dynamics of these systems. To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative
theories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational
waves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or
eLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a
particular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified
Gravity. Our analysis is based on a parameter estimation study that uses
approximate gravitational waveforms obtained via a radiative-adiabatic method
and is restricted to a five-dimensional subspace of the EMRI configuration
space. This includes a Chern-Simons parameter that controls the strength of
gravitational deviations from General Relativity. We find that, if Dynamical
Chern-Simons Modified Gravity is the correct theory, an observatory like LISA
or even eLISA/NGO should be able to measure the Chern-Simons parameter with
fractional errors below 5%. If General Relativity is the true theory, these
observatories should put bounds on this parameter at the level xi^(1/4) < 10^4
km, which is four orders of magnitude better than current Solar System bounds.

different Leibniz--Mach--Barbour (LMB) and Rovelli--Crane (RC) uses of the word
`relational'. Leibniz advocated primary timelessness and Mach that `time is to
be abstracted from change'. I consider 3 distinct viewpoints on Machian time:
Barbour's, Rovelli's and my own. I provide four expansions on Barbour's taking
configuration space to be primary: to (perhaps a weakened notion of) phase
space, categorizing, perspecting and propositioning. Categorizing means
considering not only object spaces but also the corresponding morphisms and
then functors between such pairs. Perspecting means considering the set of
subsystem perspectives; this is an arena in which the LMB and Rovelli
approaches make contact. By propositioning, I mean considering the set of
propositions about a physical (sub)system. I argue against categorization being
more than a formal pre-requisite for quantization in general; however,
perspecting is a categorical operation, and propositioning leads one to
considering topoi, with Isham and Doering's work represents one possibility for
a mathematically sharp implementation of propositioning. Further applications
of this article are arguing for Ashtekar variables as being relational in LMB
as well as just the usually-ascribed RC sense, relationalism versus
supersymmetry, string theory and M-theory. The question of whether scale is
relational is also considered, with quantum cosmology in mind.

systems is developed, starting from the microscopic thermostatted SLLOD
equation, and the corresponding Liouville equation. Special attention is paid
to the translational invariance in the sheared frame, which requires an
appropriate definition of the transient time-correlators. The derived MCT
equation satisfies the alignment of the wavevectors, and is manifestly
translationally invariant. Isothermal condition is implemented by the
introduction of the current fluctuation in the dissipative coupling to the
thermostat. This current fluctation grows in the $\alpha$-relaxation regime,
which generates a deviation of the yield stress in the glassy phase from the
overdamped case. Response to a perturbation of the shear rate demonstrates an
inertia effect which is not observed in the overdamped case. Our theory turns
out to be a non-trivial extension of the theory by Fuchs and Cates (J. Rheol.

an integer k and the goal is the find a subgraph of minimum cost such that
there are at least k-arc disjoint paths between any pair of vertices. We give a
simple (1 + 1/k)-approximation to the unweighted variant of the problem, where
all arcs of G have the same cost. This improves on the 1 + 2/k approximation of
Gabow et al. [GGTW09].
  Similar to the 2-approximation algorithm for this problem [FJ81], our
algorithm simply takes the union of a k in-arborescence and a k
out-arborescence. The main difference is in the selection of the two
arborescences. Here, inspired by the recent applications of the rounding by
sampling method (see e.g. [AGM+ 10, MOS11, OSS11, AKS12]), we select the
arborescences randomly by sampling from a distribution on unions of k
arborescences that is defined based on an extreme point solution of the linear
programming relaxation of the problem. In the analysis, we crucially utilize
the sparsity property of the extreme point solution to upper-bound the size of
the union of the sampled arborescences.
  To complement the algorithm, we also show that the integrality gap of the
minimum cost strongly connected subgraph problem (i.e., when k = 1) is at least
3/2 - c, for any c > 0. Our integrality gap instance is inspired by the
integrality gap example of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem [CGK06],
hence providing further evidence of connections between the approximability of
the two problems.

analysed in a new way. We divide the kinetic energy space of the molecules of P
into two regions F and D, and show that the molecules of P randomly switch
(`oscillate') between the two states as time proceeds due to collisions with
the molecules of Q. Initially, the molecules of P are all in the state D,
however because each molecule in P collides with the molecules of Q at
different times, the oscillations occur out of step with each other. There is a
net destructive interference between the oscillations, and so they are not
observed when monitoring the average kinetic energy of the molecules of P as a
function of time. We will explain the similarities and differences between this
observation and transverse relaxation processes that occur in magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. This study employs a stochastic model of elastic
collisions between the molecules of P and Q, and for completeness we examine
its relationship with the two major models of thermal equilibration in
statistical physics, namely the Boltzmann equation and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck

for supersymmetric events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We have divided
our endeavours into three separate projects. First, we consider SUSY models
where the gluino production at the LHC should be rich in top and bottom quark
jets. Requiring $b$-jets in addition to missing energy $\eslt$ should,
therefore, enhance the supersymmetry signal relative to Standard Model
backgrounds. We quantify the increase in the supersymmetry reach of the LHC
from $b$-tagging in a variety of well-motivated models of supersymmetry. We
also explore $top$-tagging at the LHC. Second, we explore the prospects for
detecting the direct production of third generation squarks in models with an
inverted squark mass hierarchy. This is signalled by $b$-jets + $\eslt$ events
harder than in the Standard Model, but softer than those from the production of
gluinos and heavier squarks. We find that these events can be readily separated
from SM background (for third generation squark masses in the 200-400 GeV

assuming only the particle content of the MSSM and that all two-body neutralino

yielding a sufficient cross section. We show that the Lorentz invariant
dilepton mass distribution encodes clear information about the relative sign of
the mass eigenvalues of the parent and daughter neutralinos. We show that we
can extract most neutralino mass matrix parameters if there is a double mass

the classic Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (UFL). In FTFP we are given
a set of facility sites and a set of clients. Opening a facility at site $i$
costs $f_i$ and connecting client $j$ to a facility at site $i$ costs $d_{ij}$.
We assume that the connection costs (distances) $d_{ij}$ satisfy the triangle
inequality. Multiple facilities can be opened at any site. Each client $j$ has
a demand $r_j$, which means that it needs to be connected to $r_j$ different
facilities (some of which could be located on the same site). The goal is to
minimize the sum of facility opening cost and connection cost.
  The main result of this paper is a 1.575-approximation algorithm for FTFP,
based on LP-rounding. The algorithm first reduces the demands to values
polynomial in the number of sites. Then it uses a technique that we call
adaptive partitioning, which partitions the instance by splitting clients into
unit demands and creating a number of (not yet opened) facilities at each site.
It also partitions the optimal fractional solution to produce a fractional
solution for this new instance. The partitioned instance satisfies a number of
properties that allow us to exploit existing LP-rounding methods for UFL to
round our partitioned solution to an integral solution, preserving the
approximation ratio. In particular, our 1.575-approximation algorithm is based
on the ideas from the 1.575-approximation algorithm for UFL by Byrka et al.,
with changes necessary to satisfy the fault-tolerance requirement.

design of a telemonitoring system via a wireless body-area network with low
energy consumption for ambulatory use is highly desirable. As an emerging
technique, compressed sensing (CS) shows great promise in
compressing/reconstructing data with low energy consumption. However, due to
some specific characteristics of raw FECG recordings such as non-sparsity and
strong noise contamination, current CS algorithms generally fail in this
application.
  This work proposes to use the block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) framework
to compress/reconstruct non-sparse raw FECG recordings. Experimental results
show that the framework can reconstruct the raw recordings with high quality.
Especially, the reconstruction does not destroy the interdependence relation
among the multichannel recordings. This ensures that the independent component
analysis decomposition of the reconstructed recordings has high fidelity.
Furthermore, the framework allows the use of a sparse binary sensing matrix
with much fewer nonzero entries to compress recordings. Particularly, each
column of the matrix can contain only two nonzero entries. This shows the
framework, compared to other algorithms such as current CS algorithms and

describe the evolution of the electron density, electric field and the complex

mean energy density. These equations contain averages over the Bloch phase
which are integrals of the unknown electric field and are derived by singular
perturbation methods. Among the solutions of the hydrodynamic equations, at a
70 K lattice temperature, there are spatially inhomogeneous Bloch oscillations
coexisting with moving electric field domains and Gunn-type oscillations of the
current. At higher temperature (300 K) only Bloch oscillations remain. These
novel solutions are found for restitution coefficients in a narrow interval
below their critical values and disappear for larger values. We use an
efficient numerical method based on an implicit second-order finite difference
scheme for both the electric field equation (of drift-diffusion type) and the
parabolic equation for the complex amplitude. Double integrals appearing in the
nonlocal hydrodynamic equations are calculated by means of expansions in
modified Bessel functions. We use numerical simulations to ascertain the
convergence of the method. If the complex amplitude equation is solved using a
first order scheme for restitution coefficients near their critical values, a
spurious convection arises that annihilates the complex amplitude in the part
of the superlattice that is closer to the cathode. This numerical artifact
disappears if the space step is appropriately reduced or we use the
second-order numerical scheme.

the scatter plot of core component pulse-widths versus pulsar period W50 sim
2.5 P^{-0.5}[deg], first discovered by Rankin using much smaller number of
interpulse cases. In this paper we show that the same lower boundary also
exists for conal profile components. Rankin proposed a very simple method of
estimation of pulsar inclination angle based on comparing the width W50 of its
core component with the period dependent value of the lower boundary. We claim
that this method can be extended to conal components as well. To explain an
existence of the lower boundary Rankin proposed that the core emission
originates at or near the polar cap surface. We demonstrated clearly that no
coherent pulsar radio emission can originate at altitudes lower than 10 stellar
radii, irrespective of the actual mechanism of coherence. We argue that the
lower boundary reflects the narrowest angular structures that can be
distinguished in the average pulsar beam. These structures represent the core
and the conal components in mean pulsar profiles. The P^{-0.5} dependence
follows from the dipolar nature of magnetic field lines in the radio emission
region, while the numerical factor of about 2.5 deg reflects the curvature
radius of a non-dipolar surface magnetic field in the partially screened gap
above the polar cap, where dense electron-positron plasma is created. Both core
and conal emission should originate at altitudes of about 50 stellar radii in a
typical pulsar, with a possibility that the core beam is emitted at a slightly
lower heights than the conal ones.

utilization of quantum correlations in quantum information-based applications
is limited by the problem of decoherence, i.e., the loss of coherence due to
the inevitable interaction of a quantum system with its environment. The
dynamics of quantum correlations due to decoherence may be studied in the Kraus
operator formalism for different types of quantum channels representing
system-environment interactions. In this review, we describe the salient
features of the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations in a two-qubit
system under Markovian (memoryless) time evolution. The two-qubit state
considered is described by the reduced density matrix obtained from the ground
state of a spin model. The models considered include the transverse-field XY
model in one dimension, a special case of which is the transverse-field Ising
model, and the $XXZ$ spin chain. The quantum channels studied include the
amplitude damping, bit-flip, bit-phase-flip and phase-flip channels. The Kraus
operator formalism is briefly introduced and the origins of different types of
dynamics discussed. One can identify appropriate quantities associated with the
dynamics of quantum correlations which provide signatures of quantum phase
transitions in the spin models. Experimental observations of the different
types of dynamics are also mentioned.

the measured dynamical mass runs (apart from a possible minor tension in the
inner few kpc of NGC 720, which might be due to departure from hydrostatic
equilibrium): The predicted mass discrepancy increases outward from none, near
the center, to ~10 at the outermost radii. The implications for the
MOND-vs-dark-matter controversy go far beyond the simple fact of two more
galaxies conforming to MOND.

gives several local load balancing algorithms which achieve the same

isolated mass systems even when they are deep in the Newtonian regime: systems
whose extent R<<Rm, where Rm=sqrt(GM/a0) is the MOND radius, and M the total
mass. Interestingly, even if the MOND equations approach Newtonian dynamics
arbitrarily fast at high accelerations, this correction decreases only as a
power of R/Rm. The effect appears in formulations of MOND as modified gravity,
governed by generalizations of the Poisson equation. The MOND correction to the
potential is a quadrupole field G*Pij*Ri*Rj, where R is the radius from the
center of mass. In QUMOND (quasilinear MOND), Pij=-qQij/Rm^5, where Qij is the
quadrupole moment of the system, and q>0 is a numerical factor that depends on
the interpolating function. For example, the correction to the Newtonian force
between two masses, m and M, a distance L apart (L<<Rm), is
Fa=2q(L/Rm)^3(mM)^2(M+m)^{-3}a0 (attractive). For generic MOND theories, which
approach Newtonian dynamics quickly for accelerations beyond a0, the predicted
strength of the effect in the Solar system is rather much below present testing
capabilities. In MOND theories that become Newtonian only beyond k*a0, the
effect is enhanced by k^2.

stars, including the effects of radiative levitation and external turbulence,
by solving Boussinesq equations in a quasi-incompressible fluid with a linear
approximation. It is well known that radiative levitation of individual
elements can lead to their accumulation in specific stellar layers. In some
cases, it can induce important effects on the stellar structure. Here we
confirm that this accumulation is moderated by thermohaline convection due to
the resulting inverse $\mu$-gradient. The new coefficient that we have derived
shows that the effect of radiative accelerations on the thermohaline
instability itself is small. This effect must however be checked in all
computations. We also confirm that the presence of large horizontal turbulence
can reduce or even suppress the thermohaline convection. These results are
important as they concern all the cases of heavy element accumulation in stars.
The computations of radiative diffusion have to be revisited including
thermohaline convection and its consequences. It may be one of the basic
reasons for the fact that the observed abundances are always smaller than those
predicted by pure atomic diffusion. In any case, these processes have to
compete with rotation-induced mixing, but this competition is more complex than
previously thought due to their mutual interaction.

  Rates",,,,,"cs.NI cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider scheduling problems in wireless networks with respect to flexible
data rates. That is, more or less data can be transmitted per time depending on
the signal quality, which is determined by the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Each wireless link has a
utility function mapping SINR values to the respective data rates. We have to
decide which transmissions are performed simultaneously and (depending on the
problem variant) also which transmission powers are used.
  In the capacity-maximization problem, one strives to maximize the overall
network throughput, i.e., the summed utility of all links. For arbitrary
utility functions (not necessarily continuous ones), we present an O(log
n)-approximation when having n communication requests. This algorithm is built
on a constant-factor approximation for the special case of the respective
problem where utility functions only consist of a single step. In other words,
each link has an individual threshold and we aim at maximizing the number of
links whose threshold is satisfied. On the way, this improves the result in
[Kesselheim, SODA 2011] by not only extending it to individual thresholds but
also showing a constant approximation factor independent of assumptions on the
underlying metric space or the network parameters.
  In addition, we consider the latency-minimization problem. Here, each link
has a demand, e.g., representing an amount of data. We have to compute a
schedule of shortest possible length such that for each link the demand is
fulfilled, that is the overall summed utility (or data transferred) is at least

picture in the far infrared(FIR)/submillimetre(submm)wavelengths than the more
metal-rich galaxies. Excess emission is often found in the submm beginning at
or beyond 500 mu. Even without taking this excess emission into account as a
possible dust component, higher dust-to-gas mass ratios (DGR) are often
observed compared to that expected from their metallicity for moderately
metal-poor galaxies.
  The SEDs of the lowest metallicity galaxies, however, give very low dust
masses and excessively low values of DGR, inconsistent with the amount of
metals expected to be captured into dust if we presume the usual linear
relationship holding for all metallicities, including the more metal-rich
galaxies. This transition seems to appear near metalllicities of 12 + log(O/H)
~ 8.0 - 8.2. These results rely on accurately quantifying the total molecular
gas reservoir, which is uncertain in low metallicity galaxies due to the
difficulty in detecting CO(1-0) emission. Dwarf galaxies show an exceptionally
high [CII] 158 mu/CO (1-0) ratio which may be indicative of a significant
reservoir of 'CO-free' molecular gas residing in the photodissociated envelope,
and not traced by the small CO cores.

so far, the RRab star V445 Lyr (KIC 6186029) which was observed with the Kepler
space mission. V445 Lyr shows very strong cycle-to-cycle changes in its Blazhko
modulation, which are caused both by a secondary long-term modulation period as
well as irregular variations. In addition to the complex Blazhko modulation,
V445 Lyr also shows a rich spectrum of additional peaks in the frequency range
between the fundamental pulsation and the first harmonic. Among those peaks,
the second radial overtone could be identified, which, combined with a
metallicity estimate of [Fe/H]=-2.0 dex from spectroscopy, allowed to constrain
the mass (0.55-0.65 M_sun) and luminosity (40-50 L_sun) of V445 Lyr through
theoretical Petersen diagrams. A non-radial mode as well as possibly the first
overtone are also excited. Furthermore, V445 Lyr shows signs of the period
doubling phenomenon and a long term period change. A detailed Fourier analysis
along with a study of the O-C variation of V445 Lyr is presented, and the
origin of the additional peaks and possible causes of the changes in the
Blazhko modulation are discussed. The results are then put into context with
those of the only other star with a variable Blazhko effect for which a long

zero, T \rightarrow 0. A continuous model of a quantum refrigerator is employed
consisting of a working medium composed either by two coupled harmonic
oscillators or two coupled 2-level systems. The refrigerator is a nonlinear
device merging three currents from three heat baths: a cold bath to be cooled,
a hot bath as an entropy sink, and a driving bath which is the source of
cooling power. A heat driven refrigerator (absorption refrigerator) is compared
to a power driven refrigerator. When optimized both cases lead to the same
exponent {\zeta}, showing a lack of dependence on the form of the working
medium and the characteristics of the drivers. The characteristic exponent is
therefore determined by the properties of the cold reservoir and its
interaction with the system. Two generic heat baths models are considered, a
bath composed of harmonic oscillators and a bath composed from ideal Bose/Fermi
gas. The restrictions on the interaction Hamiltonian imposed by the III-law are

1.5. We find that the 'cool' dust grains are heated at temperatures between 11
and 28 K with the lowest temperatures found in the outskirts of the galaxy and
the highest ones in the center and in the bright HII regions. The
infrared/submillimeter total luminosity (5 - 1000 micron) is estimated to be
1.9x10^9 Lsun. 59% of the total luminosity of the galaxy is produced by the
'cool' dust grains (~15 K) while the rest 41% is produced by 'warm' dust grains
(~55 K). The ratio of the cool-to-warm dust luminosity is close to unity
(within the computed uncertainties), throughout the galaxy, with the luminosity
of the cool dust being slightly enhanced in the center of the galaxy.
Decomposing the emission of the dust into two components (one emitted by the
diffuse disk of the galaxy and one emitted by the spiral arms) we find that the
fraction of the emission in the disk in the mid-infrared (24 micron) is 21%,
while it gradually rises up to 57% in the submillimeter (500 micron). We find
that the bulk of the luminosity comes from the spiral arm network that produces
70% of the total luminosity of the galaxy with the rest coming from the diffuse
dust disk. The 'cool' dust inside the disk is heated at a narrow range of
temperatures between 18 and 15 K (going from the center to the outer parts of
the galaxy).

the dynamics of DBI inflation. We find two significant features of

is prohibited to cause inflation, which leads to order of unity sound velocity
squared and hence small non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature
perturbations. The second one is that the relation between the tensor-to-scalar
ratio and the field variation is modified. Then, significant tensor-to-scalar
ratio $r \gtrsim 0.01$ is possible even for sub-Planck variation of the field.
These new features are in sharp contrast with those of the standard
non-supersymmetric DBI inflation and hence have a lot of interest implications

the Planck satellite as well as direct detection experiments of gravitational

build a model that predicts the \emph{spammingness} of mail transfer agents in

Experiments show that proposed method detects more than 94% of the Spam emails
that escaped the blacklist (i.e., TPR), while having less than 0.5%

higher than of previously reported reputation mechanisms, which rely on emails

It

discover qualitatively new phenomena. A large particle is bound to surface in a
deep and broad potential well formed by van der Waals/ Casimir-Polder forces.
The well depth is significantly larger than the characteristic thermal energy.
Nanoparticles in high-excited bound states form two-dimensional gas of objects
quasi-freely traveling along surface. A particularly interesting prediction is
small-energy-transfer scattering of UCN on solid/ liquid surfaces covered by
such levitating nanoparticles/ nano-droplets. The change in UCN energy is due
to the Doppler shift induced by UCN collisions with nanoparticles; the energy
change is about as small as the UCN initial energy. We compare theoretical
estimations of our model to all relevant existing data and state that they
agree quite well. As our theoretical formalism provides robust predictions and
the experimental data are rather precise, we conclude that the recently
discovered intriguing phenomenon of small heating of UCN in traps is due to
their collisions with such levitating nanoparticles. Moreover, this new
phenomenon might be relevant to the striking contradiction between results of
the neutron lifetime measurements with smallest reported uncertainties as it
might cause major false effects in these experiments; thus it affects
fundamental conclusions concerning precision checks of unitarity of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, cosmology, astrophysics. Dedicated

constructed the best resolved spectral index map of its jet-counterjet system
revealing multiple possible production sites of gamma-rays recently detected by

rule proposing some improvements. We discuss some general features of the
central extensions of the Galileian group used in Giulini's programme,
focussing on the interplay of classical and quantum picture, without making any
particular choice for the multipliers. Preserving other features of Giulini's
approach, we modify the mass operator of a Galilei invariant quantum system to
obtain a mass spectrum that is positive and discrete, giving rise to a standard
(non-continuous) superselection rule. The model is invariant under time
reversal but a further degree of freedom appears, interpreted as an internal
conserved charge. (However, adopting a POVM approach a positive mass operator
arises without assuming the existence of such a charge.) The effectiveness of
Bargmann rule is shown to be equivalent to an averaging procedure over the
unobservable degrees of freedom of the central extension of Galileo group.
Moreover, viewing the Galileian invariant quantum mechanics as a
non-relativistic limit, we prove that the above-mentioned averaging procedure
giving rise to Bargmann superselection rule is nothing but an effective
de-coherence phenomenon due to time evolution if assuming that real
measurements includes a temporal averaging procedure. It happens when the added
term $Mc^2$ is taken in the due account in the Hamiltonian operator since, in
the dynamical approach, the mass $M$ is an operator and cannot be trivially
neglected as in classical mechanics. The presented results are quite general
and rely upon the only hypothesis that the mass operator has point-wise
spectrum. These results explicitly show the interplay of the period of time of
the averaging procedure, the energy content of the considered states, and the
minimal difference of the mass operator eigenvalues.

discuss the limitations of a previously published method to estimate

the reliability of this method and to avoid misinterpretations, we extend it by
the computation of error estimates for estimated parameters using a Monte Carlo

set of an optical trapping experiment yielding estimations of the forces acting
on a Brownian particle trapped by optical tweezers. We find an increased
Markov-Einstein time scale of the order of the relaxation time of the process
which can be traced back to memory effects caused by the interaction of the

be very well described by the classical overdamped Markov model for Brownian

simulation tool. The continuum approach is a powerful tool for modeling the
evolution of irradiated large systems consisting of more than a few hundred
thousand atoms. However, this method follows the evolution of average
single-particle densities, and the experimentally recorded intensities reflect
the spatial two-particle correlations. The information on these correlations is
then inherently not accessible within the continuum approach. In this paper we
analyze this limitation of continuum models and discuss the applicability of
continuum models for imaging studies. We propose a formula to calculate
scattered intensities (including both elastic and inelastic scattering) from
the estimates obtained with a single-particle continuum model. We derive this
formula for systems under conditions typical for CDI studies with XFELs.

sampled light curves for many thousands of QSOs. We explore the potential of
stacking samples to produce composite cross-correlations for groups of objects
that have well sampled continuum light curves, but only a few (~2)
emission-line measurements. This technique exploits current and future
wide-field optical monitoring surveys (e.g. Pan-STARRS, LSST) and the
multiplexing capability of multi-object spectrographs (e.g. 2dF, Hectospec) to
significantly reduce the observational expense of reverberation mapping, in
particular at high redshift (0.5 to 2.5).
  We demonstrate the technique using simulated QSO light curves and explore the
biases involved when stacking cross-correlations in some simplified situations.
We show that stacked cross correlations have smaller amplitude peaks compared
to well sampled correlation functions as the mean flux of the emission light
curve is poorly constrained. However, the position of the peak remains intact.
We find there can be `kinks' in stacked correlation functions due to different
measurements contributing to different parts of the correlation function.
  Using the Pan-STARRS Medium-Deep Survey (MDS) as a template we show that
cross-correlation lags should be measurable in a sample size of 500 QSOs that
have weekly photometric monitoring and two spectroscopic observations. Finally
we apply the technique to a small sample (42) of QSOs that have light curves
from the MDS. We find no indication of a peak in the stacked cross-correlation.
A larger spectroscopic sample is required to produce robust reverberation lags.

the $L^p$ norms of the restrictions of eigenfunctions to geodesics. Our proof
uses the fact that, the exponential map from any point in $x\in M$ is a
universal covering map from $\mathbb{R}^2\backsimeq T_{x}M$ to $M$, which
allows us to lift the calculations up to the universal cover
$(\mathbb{R}^2,\tilde{g})$, where $\tilde{g}$ is the pullback of $g$ via the
exponential map. Then we prove the main estimates by using the Hadamard
parametrix for the wave equation on $(\mathbb{R}^2,\tilde{g})$, the stationary
phase estimates, and the fact that the principal coefficient of the Hadamard
parametrix is bounded, by observations of Sogge and Zelditch in \cite{SZ}. The
improved estimates also work for $n\geq 3$, with $p>\frac{4k}{n-1}$. We can
then get the full result by interpolation.

and discuss the new contributions to $R_{K}$ arising in the context of
different constrained (minimal supergravity inspired) models which succeed in
accounting for neutrino data, further considering the possibility of
accommodating a near future observation of a $\mu\to e\gamma$ transition. We
also re-evaluate the prospects for $R_{K}$ in the framework of unconstrained
supersymmetric models. In all cases, we address the question of whether it is
possible to saturate the current experimental sensitivity on $R_{K}$ while in
agreement with the recent limits on $B$-meson decay observables (in particular
BR($B_{s}\to\mu^+\mu^-$) and R($B_{u}\to\tau\nu$)), as well as BR($\tau\to e

of the recent bounds, and even when enhanced by effective sources of flavour
violation in the right-handed $\tilde{e}-\tilde{\tau}$ sector, constrained
supersymmetric (seesaw) models typically provide excessively small
contributions to $R_{K}$. Larger contributions can be found in more general
settings, where the charged Higgs mass can be effectively lowered, and even
further enhanced in the unconstrained MSSM. However, our analysis clearly shows
that even in this last case SUSY contributions to $R_{K}$ are still unable to
saturate the current experimental bounds on this observable, especially due to
a strong tension with the $B_{u}\to\tau\nu$ bound.

  Regular arrays offer the possibility to use redundant visibility information

models of the station elements. It requires a regular arrangement in the
configuration of array elements and identical beam patterns.
  We revised a calibration method for phased array stations using the redundant
visibility information in the system and applied it successfully to a LOFAR
station. The performance and limitations of the method were demonstrated by
comparing its use on real and simulated data. The main limitation is the mutual
coupling between the station elements, which leads to non-identical beams and
stronger baseline dependent noise. Comparing the variance of the estimated
complex gains with the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) indicates that redundancy is a
stable and optimum method for calibrating the complex gains of the system.
  Our study shows that the use of the redundant visibility does improve the
quality of the calibration in phased array systems. In addition it provides a
powerful tool for system diagnostics. Our results demonstrate that designing
redundancy in both the station layout and the array configuration of future

development of tissues, but little is known about how movement affects
signaling. Previous theoretical studies have shown that faster moving cells
favor synchronization across a population of locally coupled genetic
oscillators. An important assumption in these studies is that cells can
immediately interact with their new neighbors after arriving at a new location.
However, intercellular interactions in cellular systems may need some time to
become fully established. How movement affects synchronization in this
situation has not been examined. Here we develop a coupled phase oscillator
model in which we consider cell movement and the gradual recovery of
intercellular coupling experienced by a cell after movement, characterized by a
moving rate and a coupling recovery rate respectively. We find (1) an optimal
moving rate for synchronization, and (2) a critical moving rate above which
achieving synchronization is not possible. These results indicate that the
extent to which movement enhances synchrony is limited by a gradual recovery of
coupling. These findings suggest that the ratio of time scales of movement and
signaling recovery is critical for information transfer between moving cells.

sensitive to fine-scale structure (~10 km and <0.001 TECU in amplitude) along
the line of sight to Virgo A as well as larger structures (hundreds of km)
observed using several (~30) moderately bright sources in the field of view.
The observations span a time period from midnight to dawn local time during 1
March 2001. Several groups of magnetic eastward directed (MED), wavelike
disturbances were identified and determined to be located within the
plasmasphere (2.1<L<2.9). We have also detected evidence of non-wavelike
structures associated with these disturbances which are propagating roughly
toward magnetic north. These likely represent a non-uniform density flow from
the plasmasphere toward the nighttime ionosphere. AE and Kp indices and GPS TEC
data indicate that during the observations, there were low levels of
geomagnetic activity accompanied by somewhat localized depletions in
ionospheric density. Thus, the observed plasmaspheric disturbance may be part
of a flow triggered by these ionospheric depletions, likely associated with
forcing from the lower atmosphere which is typically more prominent during
quiet geomagnetic conditions. In addition, we have also observed several
roughly westward directed and southeast directed waves located within the
ionosphere. They are coincident in time with the plasmaspheric disturbances and
may be related to the deposition of material onto the nighttime ionosphere.

Moderate-amplitude perturbations can collapse shortly after matter-radiation

abundance than PBHs. If dark matter self-annihilates, UCMHs become excellent

Westerlund 1, and 2 in the Milky Way are dynamically more evolved than expected
based on their current relaxation times. In particular, the combination of a
high degree of mass segregation, a relatively low central density, and the
large number of massive runaway stars in their vicinity are hard to explain
with the monolithic formation of these clusters. Young star clusters can
achieve such a mature dynamical state if they formed through the mergers of a
number of less massive clusters. The shorter relaxation times of less massive
clusters cause them to dynamically evolve further by the time they merge, and
the merger product preserves the memory of the dynamical evolution of its
constituent clusters. With a series of $N$-body simulations, we study the
dynamical evolution of single massive clusters and those that are assembled
through merging smaller clusters together. We find that the formation of
massive star clusters through the mergers of smaller clusters can reproduce the
currently observed spatial distribution of massive stars, the density, and the
characteristics (number and mass distribution) of the stars ejected as runaways
from young dense clusters. We therefore conclude that these clusters and
possibly other young massive star clusters formed through the mergers of
smaller clusters.

the structural order parameter. The angle and temperature dependence of the

investigated by Lattice Boltzmann simulations in two and three dimensions. We
find that, in the viscous regime, the bridge radius obeys a t^{1/2}-scaling law
in time with the characteristic time scale given by the viscous time. Our
results differ significantly from the predictions of existing analytical
theories of viscous coalescence as well as from experimental observations.
While the underlying reason for these deviations is presently unknown, a simple
scaling argument is given that describes our results well.

equilibrium spontaneously bifurcate as a result of chaotic scattering of
electrons at fluctuating magnetic fields near the center of the sheet, as
demonstrated by a 2D kinetic particle-in-cell simulation. For this effect to be
simulated explicit particle advancing is necessary, since the details of the
electron motion have to be resolved. Unlike previous investigations of
triggering bifurcated current sheet (BCS) where initial perturbations or
external pressure was applied the bifurcation is spontaneous if thermal noise
is taken into account. A spontaneous current sheet bifurcation develops quicker
than a tearing mode or other plasma instabilities. It is shown that in the
course of the current sheet bifurcation the Helmholtz free energy decreases
while the entropy increases, i.e. the new, bifurcated current sheet is in a
more propable state than the single-peaked one.

mesons via virtual processes during its decays. The discovery of New Physics,
using such decays is made difficult due to intractable strong interaction
effects needed to describe it. Modes such as B -> K^* l^+ l^- offer an
advantage as they provide a multitude of observables via angular analysis. We
show how the multitude of ""related observables"" obtained from B -> K^* l^+ l^-,
can provide many new ""clean tests"" of the Standard Model. The hallmark of these
tests is that several of them are independent of the unknown universal form
factors in heavy quark effective theory. We derive a relation between
observables that is free of form factors and Wilson coefficients, the violation
of which will be an unambiguous signal of New Physics. We also derive relations
between observables and form factors that are independent of Wilson
coefficients and enable verification of hadronic estimates. We show how form
factor ratios can be measured directly from helicity fraction with out any
assumptions what so ever. We find that the allowed parameter space for
observables is very tightly constrained in Standard Model, thereby providing
clean signals of New Physics. We examine both the large-recoil and low-recoil
regions of the K^* meson and point out special features and derive relations
between observables valid in the two limits. In the large-recoil regions
several of the relations are unaffected by corrections to all orders in
\alpha_s. We present yet another new relation involving only observables that
would verify the validity of the relations between form-factors assumed in the
low-recoil region. The several relations and constraints derived will provide
unambiguous signals of New Physics if it contributes to these decays.

underlying variables. Each value these variables can take represents an ontic
state (a particular state of reality). The preparation of a quantum state
corresponds to a distribution over the ontic states. If we make three basic
assumptions, we can show that the distributions over ontic states corresponding
to distinct pure states are non-overlapping. This means that we can deduce the
quantum state from a knowledge of the ontic state. Hence, if these assumptions
are correct, we can claim that the quantum state is a real thing (it is written
into the underlying variables that describe reality). The key assumption we use
in this proof is ontic indifference - that quantum transformations that do not
affect a given pure quantum state can be implemented in such a way that they do
not affect the ontic states in the support of that state. In fact this
assumption is violated in the Spekkens toy model (which captures many aspects
of quantum theory and in which different pure states of the model have
overlapping distributions over ontic states). This paper proves that ontic
indifference must be violated in any model reproducing quantum theory in which
the quantum state is not a real thing. The argument presented in this paper is
different from that given in a recent paper by Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph. It
uses a different key assumption and it pertains to a single copy of the system
in question.

consistently with these laws and such that addition turns out to be an
iteration of incrementations. Incrementation turns out to be consistent with
Ackermann's function. After defining the inverse operation of incrementation
(named decrementation), we observe that R is not closed under it. So a new set
of numbers is defined (named E, Escherian numbers), such that decrementation is
closed on it. After defining the concept of pseudoorder (analogous to the
order, but not transitive), it is shown that Escherian numbers are not
transitive. Then addition and multiplication on E are analysed, and a
correspondence between E and C is found. Finally, incrementation is extended to

up a block-spin Gaussian model and get a formula connecting the critical point

uniqueness of a fixed point corresponding to the critical point, changing the
complicated calculation of critical point into the simple one of the minimal

may be suitable to all lattice-Ising models. The origin of fluctuations in
