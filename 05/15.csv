spatially extended neural fields. The dynamics of a neural field is described
by an integrodifferential equation whose integral term characterizes synaptic
interactions between neurons in different spatial locations of the network.
Translationally symmetric neural fields support a continuum of stationary bump
solutions, which may be centered at any spatial location. Random fluctuations
are introduced by modeling the system as a spatially extended Langevin equation
whose noise term we take to be multiplicative or additive. For nonzero noise,
these bumps are shown to wander about the domain in a purely diffusive way. We
can approximate the effective diffusion coefficient using a small noise
expansion. Upon breaking the (continuous) translation symmetry of the system
using a spatially heterogeneous inputs or synapses, bumps in the stochastic
neural field can become temporarily pinned to a finite number of locations in
the network. In the case of spatially heterogeneous synaptic weights, as the
modulation frequency of this heterogeneity increases, the effective diffusion
of bumps in the network approaches that of the network with spatially
homogeneous weights.

mid-spectral type supergiants (from O4 to O7.5). These posses the highest
mass-loss rates among the O stars, and exhibit conspicuous wind profiles. Using
the non-LTE wind code CMFGEN, we simultaneously analyzed the FUV-UV and optical
spectral range to determine the photospheric properties and wind parameters. We
derived effective temperatures, luminosities, surface gravities, surface
abundances, mass-loss rates, wind terminal velocities, and clumping filling
factors. The supergiants define a very clear evolutionary sequence, in terms of
ages and masses, from younger and more massive stars to older stars with lower
initial masses. O4 supergiants cluster around the 3 Myr isochrone and are more
massive than 60 Msun, while the O5 to O7.5 stars have masses in the range 50 -
40 Msun and are 4 +/- 0.3 Myr old. The surface chemical composition is typical
of evolved O supergiants (nitrogen-rich, carbon- and oxygen-poor). While the
observed ranges of carbon and nitrogen mass-fractions are compatible with those
expected from evolutionary models for the measured stellar masses, the N/C
ratios as a function of age are inconsistent with the theoretical predictions
for the four earliest (O4 spectral type) stars of the sample. We question the
efficiency of rotational mixing as a function of age for these stars and
suggest that another mechanism may be needed to explain the observed abundance
patterns. Mass-loss rates derived with clumped-models range within a factor of
three of the theoretical mass-loss rates. The corresponding volume-filling
factors associated with small-scale clumping are 0.05 +/- 0.02. Clumping is
found to start close to the photosphere for all but three stars, two of which
are fast rotators.

a sharp separation between quantum mechanics and other more general physical

and quantum information theory, related to Gleason's theorem, and to bound

the two criteria, that is, auctions that optimize, say, revenue under the
constraint that the welfare is above a given level. If one allows for
randomized mechanisms, it is easy to see that there are polynomial-time
mechanisms that achieve any point in the trade-off (the Pareto curve) between

provide polynomial-time deterministic mechanisms that approximate with

located in the core of the Virgo B subcluster. Owing to a recent interaction
between the dwarf galaxy VCC1249 and the halo gas of the gE M49, neutral
hydrogen has been displaced from the interstellar medium of this dwarf into the
Virgo ICM. Observations also reveal multiple compact star-forming regions that
are embedded in this HI cloud, with a projected separation up to 13 kpc from
VCC1249 in the northwest direction.
  Aims: Motivated by recent NUV imaging from GUViCS of the VCC1249/M49 system
that shows significant ongoing/recent star formation in the compact regions, we
aim to constrain the origin of these outlying HII regions with a
multi-wavelength approach.
  Methods: Using deep optical (u, g, i, z) imaging from NGVS and new Halpha
imaging obtained at the San Pedro Martir observatory together with Keck
long-slit spectroscopy, we characterize the SFR, ages, and metallicity of
VCC1249 and its outlying compact regions. Moreover, we analyze the color and
luminosity profile of the galaxy to investigate its recent interaction with
M49.
  Results: Our new observations indicate that VCC1249 underwent a recent
interaction with M49 in which both ram-pressure stripping and tidal interaction
occured. The joint action of the two mechanisms led to the removal of the HI
gas from the ISM of VCC1249, while the gravitational tides triggered the
stellar tail and counter-tail of VCC1249. Our SED analysis reveals that the
star formation in this galaxy was truncated around 200 Myr ago and that the
outlying HII regions were born in situ about 10 Myr ago out of pre-enriched gas
removed from the dwarf galaxy. These observations also reveal that interactions
between central and satellite galaxies similar to the one between VCC1249/M49
may be an effective way of dispersing metals into the halos of massive
galaxies.

the Navier--Stokes momentum equation is linear in the size of the time step

mass estimates. The clusters span redshifts 0.28 < z < 0.43 and have masses
M_500 > 2 x 10^14 h^-1 M_sun, and three of the five clusters were discovered by
the SPT survey. We observed the clusters in the g'r'i' passbands with the
Megacam imager on the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope. We measure a mean ratio of
weak lensing (WL) aperture masses to inferred aperture masses from the SZ data,
both within an aperture of R_500,SZ derived from the SZ mass, of 1.04 +/- 0.18.
We measure a mean ratio of spherical WL masses evaluated at R_500,SZ to
spherical SZ masses of 1.07 +/- 0.18, and a mean ratio of spherical WL masses
evaluated at R_500,WL to spherical SZ masses of 1.10 +/- 0.24. We explore
potential sources of systematic error in the mass comparisons and conclude that
all are subdominant to the statistical uncertainty, with dominant terms being
cluster concentration uncertainty and N-body simulation calibration bias.
Expanding the sample of SPT clusters with WL observations has the potential to
significantly improve the SPT cluster mass calibration and the resulting
cosmological constraints from the SPT cluster survey. These are the first WL
detections using Megacam on the Magellan Clay telescope.

multilevel systems is a pressing challenge nowadays. In this paper, we use a
semi-annealed approximation to study the stability properties of Random Boolean
Networks in multiplex (multi-layered) graphs. Our main finding is that the
multilevel structure provides a mechanism for the stabilization of the dynamics
of the whole system even when individual layers work on the chaotic regime,
therefore identifying new ways of feedback between the structure and the
dynamics of these systems. Our results point out the need for a conceptual
transition from the physics of single layered networks to the physics of
multiplex networks. Finally, the fact that the coupling modifies the phase
diagram and the critical conditions of the isolated layers suggests that
interdependency can be used as a control mechanism.

to systematic errors which must be accounted for in setting limits on the

from a pair of instruments, as in searches for a stochastic GW background, the
calibration uncertainties of the individual instruments can be combined into an

retransmitted by a remote and inaccessible transponder and the propagation

delays for every single pulsed signal transmission. The process utilizes four
ground-based reference stations, synchronized in time and installed at well
known geodesic coordinates. The repeater station is located within the fields
of view common to the four reference bases, such as in a platform transported
by a satellite, balloon, aircraft, etc. Signal transmitted by one of the
reference bases is retransmitted by the transponder, received back by the four
bases, producing four ranging measurements which are processed to determine
uniquely the time delays undergone in every retransmission process. The
repeater's positions with respect to each group of three out of four reference
bases are given by a system of equations. A minimization function is derived
comparing repeater's positions referred to at least two groups of three
reference bases. The minimum found by iterative methods provide the signal
transit time at the repeater and propagation delays, providing the correct
repeater position. The method is applicable to the transponder platform
positioning and navigation, time synchronization of remote clocks, and location
of targets. The algorithm has been fully demonstrated simulated for practical
situation with the transponder carried by an aircraft moving over bases on the

only now emerging. Here, we analyze foraging choices of a cohort of

multiple times in a row---patch exploitation---or switching to a different
stock---patch exploration---with potentially higher returns. We measure the
difference between a trader's resource intake and the competitors' expected
intake within a short period of time---a difference we call short-term
comparative returns. We find that traders' choices can be explained by foraging
heuristics that maximize their daily short-term comparative returns. However,
we find no one-best relationship between different trading choices and net

oriented and, paradoxically, maybe maladaptive for absolute market returns.

and non-classical correlations as compared to other related measures. Geometric
measure of quantum discord is another measure of quantum correlations.
Recently, the geometric quantum discord for multipartite states has been
introduced by Jianwei Xu [arxiv:quant/ph.1205.0330]. Motivated from the recent
study [Ann. Phys. 327 (2012) 851] for the bipartite systems, I have
investigated global quantum discord (QD) and geometric quantum discord (GQD)
under the influence of external environments for different multipartite states.
Werner-GHZ type three-qubit and six-qubit states are considered in inertial and
non-inertial settings. The dynamics of QD and GQD is investigated under
amplitude damping, phase damping, depolarizing and flipping channels. It is
seen that the quantum discord vanishes for p>0.75 in case of three-qubit GHZ
states and for p>0.5 for six qubit GHZ states. This implies that multipartite
states are more fragile to decoherence for higher values of N. Surprisingly, a
rapid sudden death of discord occurs in case of phase flip channel. However,
for bit flip channel, no sudden death happens for the six-qubit states. On the
other hand, depolarizing channel heavily influences the QD and GQD as compared
to the amplitude damping channel. It means that the depolarizing channel has
the most destructive influence on the discords for multipartite states. From
the perspective of accelerated observers, it is seen that effect of environment
on QD and GQD is much stronger than that of the acceleration of non-inertial
frames. The degradation of QD and GQD happens due to Unruh effect. Furthermore,
QD exhibits more robustness than GQD when the multipartite systems are exposed
to environment.

external gravitational field in the post-Newtonian approximation of the General
Relativity does not commute with its energy operator, taken in the absence of
the field. Nevertheless, the weak equivalence between the expectations values
of weight and energy is shown to survive at a macroscopic level for stationary
quantum states for the simplest composite quantum body - a hydrogen atom.
Breakdown of the weak equivalence between weight and energy at a microscopic
level for stationary quantum states can be experimentally detected by studying
unusual electromagnetic radiation, emitted by the atoms, supported and moved in
the Earth gravitational field with constant velocity, using spacecraft or
satellite. For superpositions of stationary quantum states, a breakdown of the
above mentioned equivalence at a macroscopic level leads to time dependent
oscillations of the expectation values of weight, where the equivalence
restores after averaging over time procedure.

probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), being influenced by the extreme
value theory of mathematical statistics. Therein, we understand a GMR as a
random function. We derive mathematically the principle of area-equivalence;
wherein two alternative GMRs have an equivalent influence on the hazard if
these GMRs have equivalent area functions. This includes local biases. An
interpretation of the difference between these GMRs (an actual and a modeled
one) as a random component leads to a general overestimation of residual
variance and hazard. Beside this, we discuss important aspects of classical
approaches and discover discrepancies with the state of the art of stochastics
and statistics (model selection and significance, test of distribution
assumptions, extreme value statistics). We criticize especially the assumption
of logarithmic normally distributed residuals of maxima like the peak ground
acceleration (PGA). The natural distribution of its individual random component
(equivalent to exp(epsilon_0) of Joyner and Boore 1993) is the generalized
extreme value. We show by numerical researches that the actual distribution can
be hidden and a wrong distribution assumption can influence the PSHA negatively
as the negligence of area equivalence does. Finally, we suggest an estimation
concept for GMRs of PSHA with a regression-free variance estimation of the
individual random component. We demonstrate the advantages of event-specific
GMRs by analyzing data sets from the PEER strong motion database and estimate
event-specific GMRs. Therein, the majority of the best models base on an
anisotropic point source approach. The residual variance of logarithmized PGA
is significantly smaller than in previous models. We validate the estimations
for the event with the largest sample by empirical area functions. etc.

alternates between clustering and training discriminative classifiers, while
applying careful cross-validation at each step to prevent overfitting. The
paper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of discriminative patches

than the chlorine-etched ones. We interpret the results by use of numerically
calculated filling factors and find that the silicon surface exhibits a higher
loss when chlorine-etched than when fluorine-etched. We also find from
microscopy that re-deposition of silicon onto the photoresist and side walls is
the probable cause for the high loss observed for the ion-milled resonators

Quantum Hall states to classify such `integer' topological phases. Our main
result is a general formalism that incorporates symmetries into the
{{K}}-matrix description. Remarkably, this simple analysis yields the same list
of topological phases as a recent group cohomology classification, and in
addition provides field theories and explicit edge theories for all these
phases. The bosonic topological phases, which only appear in the presence of
interactions and which remain well defined in the presence of disorder include
(i) bosonic insulators with a Hall conductance quantized to even integers (ii)
a bosonic analog of quantum spin Hall insulators and (iii) a bosonic analog of
a chiral topological superconductor, whose K matrix is the Cartan matrix of Lie
group E$_8$. We also discuss interacting fermion systems where symmetries are
realized in a projective fashion, where we find the present formalism can
handle a wider range of symmetries than a recent group super-cohomology
classification. Lastly we construct microscopic models of these phases from

their host galaxies. In this paper we present the survey design and summarize
the results of our observing program conducted at the ESO Very Large Telescope

galaxies for 80 % of the GRBs in the sample, although only 42 % have Ks-band
detections, which confirms that GRB-selected host galaxies are generally blue.
The sample is not uniformly blue, however, with two extremely red objects
detected. Moreover, galaxies hosting GRBs with no optical/NIR afterglows, whose
identification therefore relies on X-ray localizations, are significantly
brighter and redder than those with an optical/NIR afterglow. Our spectroscopic

redshift of 2.14 +- 0.18. TOUGH alone includes 17 detected z > 2 Swift GRB host

investigate the concentration-mass (c-M) relation in galaxy clusters. In
particular, we consider a reference \Lambda CDM model, two quintessence models
with inverse power-law potentials (RP and SUGRA), and two extended quintessence
models, one with positive and one with negative coupling with gravity (EQp and
EQn respectively). All the models are normalized in order to match CMB data
from WMAP3. We fit both the dark matter only and the total mass profile with a
NFW profile, and recover the concentration of each halo from the fit using
different definition. We consider both the complete catalog of clusters and
groups and subsamples of objects at different level of relaxation. We find that
the definition itself of the concentration can lead to differences up to 20% in
its value and that these differences are smaller when more relaxed objects are
considered. The c-M relation of our reference \Lambda CDM model is in good
agreement with the results in literature, and relaxed objects have a higher
normalization and a shallower slope with respect to the complete sample. The
inclusion of baryon physics is found to influence more high-mass systems than
low-mass ones, due to a higher concentration of baryons in the inner regions of
massive halos. For the different dark energy models, we find that for \Lambda
CDM, RP and SUGRA the normalization of the c-M relation is linked to the growth
factor, with models having a higher value of \sigma 8 D+ having also a higher
normalization. This simple scheme is no longer valid for EQp and EQn because in
these models a time dependent effective gravitational interaction, whose
redshift evolution depends on the sign of the coupling, is present. This leads
to a decrease (increase) of the expected normalization in the EQp (EQn) model.

handful of brown dwarfs and VLMS (M5-M8) for which an outflow has been detected

measure a spatial extension of the outflow of +/-190mas (+/-30AU) and
velocities of +/-40-50kms/s. We show that the velocity asymmetry between both
lobes is variable on timescales of a few years and that the strong asymmetry of
a factor of 2 found in 2007 might be smaller than originally anticipated when
using a more realistic stellar rest-velocity. We also detect forbidden
[FeII]7155 emission, for which we propose as potential origin the hot inner
regions of the outflow. To understand the ISO217 system, we determine the disk
properties based on radiative transfer modeling of the SED. This disk model
agrees very well with Herschel/PACS data at 70mu. We find that the disk is
flared and intermediately inclined (~45deg). The total disk mass (4e-6 Msun) is
small compared to the accretion and outflow rate of ISO217 (~1e-10 Msun/yr). We
propose that this discrepancy can be explained by either a higher disk mass
than inferred from the model (strong undetected grain growth) and/or by an on
average lower accretion and outflow rate than the determined values. We show
that a disk inclination significantly exceeding 45deg, as suggested from Halpha
modeling and from both lobes of the outflow being visible, is inconsistent with
the SED data. Thus, despite its intermediate inclination angle, the disk of
this brown dwarf does not appear to obscure the red outflow component, which is
very rarely seen for T Tauri objects (only one other case).

detection of ex-companion stars in several SNe Ia remnants. These studies,
however, usually ignore the angular momentum gain of the progenitor WD, which
leads to a spin-up phase and a subsequent spin-down phase before explosion. For
spin-down timescales greater than 10^5 years, the donor star could be too dim

powerful tools for analyzing the chromosphere of active regions. The
applicability of inversions to infer the stratification of the physical

detail.
  This study aims to establish the diagnostic capabilities of non-local
thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE) inversion techniques of Stokes profiles
induced by the Zeeman effect in the Ca II 8542 line.
  We computed the Ca II atomic level populations in a snapshot from a 3D
radiation-MHD simulation of the quiet solar atmosphere in non-LTE using the 3D
radiative transfer code Multi3d. These populations were used to compute
synthetic full-Stokes profiles in the Ca II 8542 line using 1.5D radiative
transfer and the inversion code Nicole. The profiles were then spectrally
degraded to account for finite filter width and Gaussian noise was added to
account for finite photon flux. These profiles were inverted using Nicole and
the results were compared with the original model atmosphere.
  Our NLTE inversions applied to quiet-Sun synthetic observations provide
reasonably good estimates of the chromospheric magnetic field, line-of-sight
velocities and somewhat less accurate, but still very useful, estimates of the
temperature. Three dimensional scattering of photons cause cool pockets in the
chromosphere to be invisible in the line profile and consequently they are also
not recovered by the inversions. To successfully detect Stokes linear
polarization in this quiet snapshot, a noise level below 10^{-3.5} is

compact radio sources previously identified as radio supernovae or supernova
remnants. Aims. In order to search for an embedded radio AGN, or other possible
exotic objects, we have carried out a program of VLBI monitoring at 6 cm over
three epochs each separated by four months. Methods. Combining the new data
with existing data at 6 cm and 18 cm (spanning 4 and 12 years respectively) we
are able to characterise source flux density variability on a range of
time-scales. Additionally we analyse the variability of sources in shape and
position. Results. We detect rapid (< 4 months) variability in three sources
(W7, W26 and W29). These sources show possible superluminal motion (> 4c) of
jet-like features near rapidly varying almost stationary components. These
enigmatic sources might be associated with an AGN or a highly beamed
microquasar (i.e. microblazar). Other hypotheses include that the apparent
variability is intrinsic and is produced by neutron star powered central
components within a supernova remnant, by a sequence of several supernovae
within super star clusters, or is extrinsic and is produced by Galactic
interstellar scintillation of very compact non-varying objects. Conclusions. A
microquasar/microblazar origin seems to be the best explanation for the nature
of the variable sources in Arp220.

resolution hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on molecule-dominated regions

highly supersonic turbulence. In equilibrium the total midplane pressure,
dominated by turbulence, must balance the vertical weight of the ISM. Under
self-regulation, the momentum flux injected by feedback evolves until it
matches the vertical weight. We test this flux balance in simulations spanning
a range of parameters, including surface density $\Sigma$, momentum injected
per stellar mass formed ($p_*/m_*$), and angular velocity. The simulations are
2D radial-vertical slices, including both self-gravity and an external
potential that confines gas to the disk midplane. After the simulations reach a
steady state in all relevant quantities, including the star formation rate
$\Sigma_{SFR}$, there is remarkably good agreement between the vertical weight,
the turbulent pressure, and the momentum injection rate from supernovae. Gas
velocity dispersions and disk thicknesses increase with $p_*/m_*$. The
efficiency of star formation per free-fall time at the mid-plane density is
insensitive to the local conditions and to the star formation prescription in
very dense gas. We measure efficiencies $\sim$0.004-0.01, consistent with low
and approximately constant efficiencies inferred from observations. For
$\Sigma\in$(100--1000) \msunpc, we find $\Sigma_{SFR}\in$(0.1--4) \sfrunits,
generally following a $\Sigma_{SFR}\propto \Sigma^2$ relationship. The measured
relationships agree very well with vertical equilibrium and with turbulent
energy replenishment by feedback within a vertical crossing time. These
results, along with the observed $\Sigma_{SFR}-\Sigma$ relation in high density
environments, provide strong evidence for the self-regulation of star
formation.

nearby clusters. Whether these objects are primordial, or the recent
end-products of the different physical mechanisms that can transform galaxies
once they enter these high-density environments, is still a matter of debate.
Here we present a novel approach to test these scenarios by comparing the
properties of the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of Virgo dEs and their
potential progenitors with simple predictions from gravitational and
hydrodynamical interaction models. We show that low-mass (Mstar < 2E8 Msun) dEs
have GCSs consistent with being the descendants of gas-stripped late-type
dwarfs. On the other hand, higher mass dEs have properties -including the high
mass specific frequencies of their GCSs and their concentrated spatial
distribution within Virgo- incompatible with a recent, environmentally-driven
evolution. They mostly comprise nucleated systems, but also dEs with recent
star formation and/or disc features. Bright, nucleated dEs appear to be a
population that has long resided within the cluster potential well, but have
surprisingly managed to retain very rich and spatially extended GCSs - possibly
an indication of high total masses. Our analysis does not favour violent
evolutionary mechanisms that result in significant stellar mass losses, but
more gentle processes involving gas removal by a combination of internal and
external factors, and highlights the relevant role of initial conditions.
Additionally, we briefly comment on the origin of luminous cluster S0s.

lags allow the location and extent of the primary X-ray source to be
constrained. Comparing the emissivity profile determined from the broadened

abelian gauge groups and matter fields has provided many insights into string
theory on Calabi--Yau manifolds of a certain type: complete intersections in
toric varieties. In this paper, we consider two GLSM constructions with
nonabelian gauge groups and charged matter whose infrared CFTs correspond to
string propagation on determinantal Calabi-Yau varieties, furnishing another
broad class of Calabi-Yau geometries in addition to complete intersections. We
show that these two models -- which we refer to as the PAX and the PAXY model
-- are dual descriptions of the same low-energy physics. Using GLSM techniques,
we determine the quantum K\""ahler moduli space of these varieties and find no
disagreement with existing results in the literature.

that gap is particularly intuitive in the regime of strong coupling between
graphene and its substrate, when the low-energy physics is determined by the

where inversion symmetry is present, this network percolates through the system

zero energy modes to close into rings. The eigenstates of these rings hybridize
into flat bands with gaps in between. The size of this band gap can be tuned by
a gate voltage and it can reach the order of magnitude needed to confine

significantly from the behavior of non-relativistic electrons seen in
traditional atomic and impurity systems. Surprisingly, many key theoretical
predictions for this ultra-relativistic regime have yet to be tested in a
laboratory. Graphene, a 2D material in which electrons behave like massless
Dirac fermions, provides a unique opportunity to experimentally test such
predictions. The response of Dirac fermions to a Coulomb potential in graphene
is central to a wide range of electronic phenomena and can serve as a sensitive
probe of graphene's intrinsic dielectric constant, the primary factor
determining the strength of electron-electron interactions in this material.
Here we present a direct measurement of the nanoscale response of Dirac
fermions to a single Coulomb potential placed on a gated graphene device.
Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy were used to fabricate tunable
charge impurities on graphene and to measure how they are screened by Dirac
fermions for a Q = +1|e| impurity charge state. Electron-like and hole-like
Dirac fermions were observed to respond very differently to tunable Coulomb
potentials. Comparison of this electron-hole asymmetry to theoretical
simulations has allowed us to test basic predictions for the behavior of Dirac
fermions near a Coulomb potential and to extract the intrinsic dielectric
constant of graphene: {\epsilon}_g= 3.0 \pm 1.0. This small value of
{\epsilon}_g indicates that microscopic electron-electron interactions can
contribute significantly to graphene properties.

microscopy (AFM), in which the mechanical transducer is integrated with
near-field optical readout on a single chip. The motion of a nanoscale,
doubly-clamped cantilever was transduced by an adjacent high quality factor
silicon microdisk cavity. In particular, we show that displacement sensitivity
on the order of 1 fm/(Hz)^(1/2) can be achieved while the cantilever stiffness
is varied over four orders of magnitude (\approx 0.01 N/m to \approx 290 N/m).
The ability to transduce both very soft and very stiff cantilevers extends the
domain of applicability of this technique, potentially ranging from
interrogation of microbiological samples (soft cantilevers) to imaging with
high resolution (stiff cantilevers). Along with mechanical frequencies (> 250
kHz) that are much higher than those used in conventional AFM probes of similar
stiffness, these results suggest that our cavity optomechanical sensors may
have application in a wide variety of high-bandwidth AFM measurements.

in the surface. The ansatz we suggest consists of original surface plus a
variational parameter $t$ multiplying the numerator $H_{0}$ of mean curvature
function defined over the surface. We point out that the integral of the square
of the mean curvature with respect to the surface parameter becomes a
polynomial in this variational parameter. Finding a zero, if there is any, of
this polynomial would end up at the same (minimal) surface as obtained by
minimizing more complicated area functional itself. We have instead minimized
this polynomial. Moreover, our minimization is restricted to a search in the
class of all surfaces allowed by our ansatz. All in all, we have not yet
obtained the exact minimal but we do reduce the area for the same fixed
boundary. This reduction is significant for a surface (hemiellipsoid) for which
we know the exact minimal surface. But for the bilinear interpolation spanned
by four bounding straight lines, which can model the initial and final
configurations of re-arranging strings, the decrease remains less than 0.8
percent of the original area. This may suggest that bilinear interpolation is
already a near minimal surface.

confirm that Mg II and the Balmer lines share similar kinematics and that they
deliver mutually consistent black hole mass estimates with minimal internal
scatter (< 0.1 dex) using the latest virial mass estimators. Although no virial
mass formalism has yet been calibrated for C III], this line does not appear
promising for such an application because of the large spread of its velocity
width compared to lines of both higher and lower ionization; part of the
discrepancy may be due to the difficulty of deblending C III] from its
neighboring lines. The situation for C IV is complex and, because of the
limited statistics of our small sample, inconclusive. On the one hand, slightly
more than half of our sample (4/7) have C IV line widths that correlate
reasonably well with Halpha line widths, and their respective black hole mass
estimates agree to within ~0.15 dex. The rest, on the other hand, exhibit
exceptionally broad C IV profiles that overestimate virial masses by factors of

dimensional, fully implicit, and general relativistic. Multi-group,
multi-flavor neutrino transport is incorporated that makes use of variable
Eddington factors obtained from a formal solution of the static general

timescales of neutrino emission and spectral evolution obtained using the new
code are broadly consistent with previous results. Unlike other recent
calculations, however, the new code predicts that the neutrino-driven wind will
be characterized, at least for part of its existence, by a neutron excess. This
change, potentially consequential for nucleosynthesis in the wind, is due to an
improved treatment of the charged-current interactions of electron flavored
neutrinos and anti-neutrinos with nucleons. A comparison is also made between
the results obtained using either variable Eddington factors or simple
equilibrium flux-limited diffusion. The latter approximation, which has been
frequently used in previous studies of proto-neutron star cooling, accurately
describes the total neutrino luminosities (to within 10%) for most of the

candidates reported by Kepler. By combining the rotational period $P_s$
inferred from the flux variation due to starspots and the projected rotational
velocity $V\sin I_s$ and stellar radius obtained by a high resolution
spectroscopy, we attempt to estimate the inclination $I_s$ of the stellar spin
axis with respect to the line-of-sight. For transiting planetary systems, in
which planetary orbits are edge-on seen from us, the stellar inclination $I_s$
can be a useful indicator of a spin-orbit alignment/misalignment. We newly
conducted spectroscopic observations with Subaru/HDS for 15 KOI systems, whose
lightcurves show periodic flux variations. After detailed analyses of their
lightcurves and spectra, it turned out that some of them are binaries, or the
flux variations are too coherent to be caused by starspots, probably
representing ellipsoidal variations, and consequently we could constrain
stellar inclinations $I_s$ for eight systems. Among them, KOI-262 and 280 are
in good agreement with $I_s=90^\circ$ suggesting a spin-orbit alignment, while
at least one system, KOI-261, shows a possible spin-orbit misalignment. We also
obtain a small $I_s$ for KOI-1463, but the transiting companion seems to be a
star rather than a planet. The results for KOI-257, 269, 367, and 974 are
ambiguous, and can be explained with either misalignments or moderate

  Redundancy","35 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hierarchical parametric models consisting of observable and latent variables
are widely used for unsupervised learning tasks. For example, a mixture model
is a representative hierarchical model for clustering. From the statistical
point of view, the models can be regular or singular due to the distribution of
data. In the regular case, the models have the identifiability; there is
one-to-one relation between a probability density function for the model
expression and the parameter. The Fisher information matrix is positive
definite, and the estimation accuracy of both observable and latent variables
has been studied. In the singular case, on the other hand, the models are not
identifiable and the Fisher matrix is not positive definite. Conventional
statistical analysis based on the inverse Fisher matrix is not applicable.
Recently, an algebraic geometrical analysis has been developed and is used to
elucidate the Bayes estimation of observable variables. The present paper
applies this analysis to latent-variable estimation and determines its
theoretical performance. Our results clarify behavior of the convergence of the
posterior distribution. It is found that the posterior of the
observable-variable estimation can be different from the one in the
latent-variable estimation. Because of the difference, the Markov chain Monte
Carlo method based on the parameter and the latent variable cannot construct
the desired posterior distribution.

Using the electronic five-orbital Hubbard model, first principles techniques to

that the exotic block-AFM state is indeed stable at realistic electronic

applied to KFe$_2$Se$_3$. In addition, the present study unveils other
competing magnetic phases that could be experimentally stabilized varying
either $n$ chemically or the electronic bandwidth by pressure. Similar results

interest in recent years, as witnessed during outbreaks of influenza A (H1N1)
or SARS pandemics. One way to stop spreading over the airline network are
travel restrictions for major airports or network hubs based on the total
number of passengers of an airport. Here, we test alternative strategies using
edge removal, cancelling targeted flight connections rather than restricting
traffic for network hubs, for controlling spreading over the airline network.
We employ a SEIR metapopulation model that takes into account the population of
cities, simulates infection within cities and across the network of the top 500
airports, and tests different flight cancellation methods for limiting the
course of infection. The time required to spread an infection globally, as
simulated by a stochastic global spreading model was used to rank the candidate
control strategies. The model includes both local spreading dynamics at the
level of populations and long-range connectivity obtained from real global
airline travel data. Simulated spreading in this network showed that spreading
infected 37% less individuals after cancelling a quarter of flight connections
between cities, as selected by betweenness centrality. The alternative strategy
of closing down whole airports causing the same number of cancelled connections
only reduced infections by 18%. In conclusion, selecting highly ranked single
connections between cities for cancellation was more effective, resulting in
fewer individuals infected with influenza, compared to shutting down whole
airports. It is also a more efficient strategy, affecting fewer passengers
while producing the same reduction in infections.

Bayesian inferences based on a rejection algorithm method that applies a
tolerance of dissimilarity between summary statistics from observed and

proposed, none of these improvements avoid the following two sources of
approximation: 1) lack of sufficient statistics: sampling is not from the true
posterior density given data but from an approximate posterior density given
summary statistics; and 2) non-zero tolerance: sampling from the posterior
density given summary statistics is achieved only in the limit of zero
tolerance. The first source of approximation can be improved by adding a
summary statistic, but an increase in the number of summary statistics could
introduce additional variance caused by the low acceptance rate. Consequently,
many researchers have attempted to develop techniques to choose informative
summary statistics. The present study evaluated the utility of a kernel-based
ABC method (Fukumizu et al. 2010, arXiv:1009.5736 and 2011, NIPS 24: 1549-1557)

ABC was applied to population genetic inference. We demonstrate that, in
contrast to conventional ABCs, kernel ABC can incorporate a large number of
summary statistics while maintaining high performance of the inference.

correlation tracking (LCT) of these features shows presence of horizontal flows
directed away from the end-points of the PLFs, similar to the radial outward

X-ray emission, coincident with the location of the PLFs, is found in RHESSI
observations, suggesting a spatial correlation between the occurrence of the
flare and decay of the PLFs. Vector magnetic field derived from the
observations obtained by Hinode spectro-polarimeter SOT/SP instrument, before

the vertical component of the field, after the flare. The weakening of both the

outcome of supernova explosions. Here we investigate the consequences of such a
common outcome for the timing and spectral properties of the associated NS
population, using Monte Carlo population synthesis models. We find that the
long-term torque exerted by the fallback disc can substantially influence the
late-time period distribution, but with quantitative differences which depend
on whether the initial spin distribution is dominated by slow or fast pulsars.
For the latter, a single-peaked initial spin distribution becomes bimodal at
later times. Timing ages tend to underestimate the real age of older pulsars,
and overestimate the age of younger ones. Braking indices cluster in the range
1.5 <~ n <~ 3 for slow-born pulsars, and -0.5 <~ n <~ 5 for fast-born pulsars,
with the younger objects found predominantly below n <~ 3. Large values of n,
while not common, are possible, and associated with torque transitions in the
NS+disc system. The 0.1-10 keV thermal luminosity of the NS+disc system is
found to be generally dominated by the disc emission at early times, t <~ 10^3
yr, but this declines faster than the thermal surface emission of the NS.
Depending on the initial parameters, there can be occasional periods in which
some NSs switch from the propeller to the accretion phase, increasing their
luminosity up to the Eddington limit for ~ 10^3-10^4 years.

User (SU) equipped with a Cognitive Radio (CR) (together referred to as CR)
interweaves its transmission with that of the licensed or the Primary User
(PU). In this model, when the CR detects the PU to be (i) busy it does not
transmit and; (ii) PU to be idle it transmits. Two situations based on CR's
detection of PU are considered, where the CR detects PU (i) perfectly -
referred to as the ""ideal case"" and; (ii) imperfectly - referred to as ""non
ideal case"". For both the cases we bring out the rate region, sum capacity of
PU and CR and spectral efficiency factor - the ratio of sum capacity of PU and
CR to the capacity of PU without CR. We consider the Rayleigh fading channel to
provide insight to our results. For the ideal case we study the effect of PU
occupancy on spectral efficiency factor. For the non ideal case, in addition to
the effect of occupancy, we study the effect of false alarm and missed
detection on the rate region and spectral efficiency factor. We characterize
the set of values of false alarm and missed detection probabilities for which
the system benefits, in the form of admissible regions. We show that false
alarm has a more profound effect on the spectral efficiency factor than missed
detection. We also show that when PU occupancy is small, the effects of both
false alarm and missed detection decrease. Finally, for the standard detection
techniques viz. energy detection, matched filter and magnitude squared
coherence, we show that that the matched filter performs best followed by
magnitude squared coherence followed by energy detection with respect to
spectral efficiency factor.

systems, dN/dz (excluding `associated systems' having velocity beta*c relative
to the AGN of less than ~5000 km/s) is totally independent of the background
AGN, has been challenged by a recent finding that dN/dz for strong Mg II
absorption systems towards distant blazars is 2.2 \pm_{0.6}^{0.8} times the
value known for normal optically-selected quasars (QSOs). This has led to the
suggestion that a significant fraction of even the absorption systems with beta
as high as 0.1 may have been ejected by the relativistic jets in the blazars,
which are expected to be pointed close to our direction. Here we investigate
this scenario using a large sample of 115 flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars
(FSRQs) which too possess powerful jets, but are only weakly polarized. We
show, for the first time, that dN/dz towards FSRQs is, on the whole, quite
similar to that known for QSOs and the comparative excess of strong \mgii
absorption systems seen towards blazars is mainly confined to beta< 0.15. The
excess relative to FSRQs can probably result from a likely closer alignment of
blazar jets with our direction and hence any gas clouds accelerated by them are
more likely to be on the line of sight to the active quasar nucleus.

wireless relay networks. While most existing works focus on physical layer
approaches to exploit its capacity gain, the benefits of two-way relaying on
upper layers are much less investigated. In this paper, we study the
cross-layer design and optimization for delay quality-of-service (QoS)
provisioning in two-way relay systems. Our goal is to find the optimal
transmission policy to maximize the weighted sum throughput of the two users in
the physical layer while guaranteeing the individual statistical delay-QoS
requirement for each user in the datalink layer. This statistical delay-QoS
requirement is characterized by the QoS exponent. By integrating the concept of
effective capacity, the cross-layer optimization problem is equivalent to a
weighted sum effective capacity maximization problem. We derive the jointly
optimal power and rate adaptation policies for both three-phase and two-phase
two-way relay protocols. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive
transmission policies can efficiently provide QoS guarantees and improve the
performance. In addition, the throughput gain obtained by the considered
three-phase and two-phase protocols over direct transmission is significant
when the delay-QoS requirements are loose, but the gain diminishes at tight
delay requirements. It is also found that, in the two-phase protocol, the relay
node should be placed closer to the source with more stringent delay
requirement.

investigating the hybrid particles such as cavity polaritons. This application
corresponds to parametrically different intra-chain hopping integrals (a ""fast""
chain coupled to a ""slow"" chain). We show that the canonical
Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) equation is insufficient for this problem.
Indeed, the angular variables describing the eigenvectors of the transmission
matrix enter into an extended DMPK equation in a non-trivial way, being
entangled with the two transmission eigenvalues. This extended DMPK equation is
solved analytically and the two Lyapunov exponents are obtained as functions of
the parameters of the disordered ladder. The main result of the paper is that
near the resonance energy, where the dispersion curves of the two decoupled and
disorder-free chains intersect, the localization properties of the ladder are
dominated by those of the slow chain. Away from the resonance they are
dominated by the fast chain: a local excitation on the slow chain may travel a
distance of the order of the localization length of the fast chain.

and renormalized generating functionals, or generating functionals before and
after nonlinear changes of field variables. In this paper we investigate this
issue and work out a general field-covariant approach to quantum field theory,
which allows us to treat all perturbative changes of field variables, including
the relation between bare and renormalized fields, as true changes of variables
in the functional integral, under which the functionals Z and W = ln Z behave
as scalars. We investigate the relation between composite fields and changes of
field variables, and show that, if J are the sources coupled to the elementary

redefinitions of the sources L coupled to the composite fields. We also work
out the relation between the renormalization of variable-changes and the
renormalization of composite fields. Using our transformation rules it is
possible to derive the renormalization of a theory in a new variable frame from
the renormalization in the old variable frame, without having to calculate it

negligible over a wide range of collision energy. This leads to a factorization
of the distribution function of the proton, neutron, and their antiparticles in
the final state with binomial distribution functions. Using the factorization,
we derive formulas to determine nucleon number cumulants, which are not direct

experimentally observable in event-by-event analyses. With a simple treatment
for strange baryons, the nucleon number cumulants are further promoted to the
baryon number ones. Experimental determination of the baryon number cumulants

Several models have been proposed to describe the observed asymmetry which
grows with the rapidity difference of the top pairs and also with the
$t\bar{t}$ invariant mass. The presence of a heavy charged gauge boson $W'$
with the coupling $W'-t-d$ (left-handed, right-handed, and a mixture of left
and right-handed couplings) could generate the desired top forward-backward
asymmetry keeping the top pair cross section consistent with the standard model
prediction. Such $W'$-boson makes contribution to the electric dipole moment of
the neutron through contribution to the $d$-quark electric dipole moment,
recently measured charge asymmetry ($A_{C}$) by the LHC experiments, and the
total cross section of top pair at the LHC and Tevatron. We show that the upper
bounds on neutron and top electric dipole moments disfavour any $W'$ with a

rethinking: time, mass, quantum entanglement and non-locality, we hypothesise a
mechanism involving a quantum mechanical energy source and a new type of
'gravitational' field; neither of which lie within general relativity's domain
of formulation/application. By way of a systemic conservation of energy
principle, an internally inexpressible (aggregate) non-inertial energy
discrepancy/uncertainty -- involving a myriad of quantum (lunar/third-body
residing) atomic and molecular systems moving in analog curved spacetime -- is
(non-locally) re-expressed externally as a (rotating) non-Euclidean spatial
geometry perturbation. At a moving body each ""rotating space-warp"" induces
sinusoidal proper acceleration and speed perturbations, as well as a path-based
constant (per cycle) rate of speed shortfall relative to predictions that omit
the additional effect. 'Solutions' of the new model may extend to: the Earth
flyby anomaly, solar system related large-scale anomalies in the CMB radiation
data, the nature of dark energy, and how a theory of everything unification
agenda is inadvertently impeding a deeper understanding of physical reality and
quantum entanglement.

Monte-Carlo type algorithm is used for solving the particle collisions and
coalescence process. The model does not differentiate between aerosol
particles, cloud droplets, drizzle or rain drops. Consequently, it covers
representation of such cloud-microphysical processes as: CCN activation,
drizzle formation by autoconversion, accretion of cloud droplets,
self-collection of raindrops and precipitation including aerosol wet
deposition. Among the salient features of the SDM, there are: (i) the
robustness of the model formulation (i.e. employment of basic principles rather
than parametrisations) and (ii) the ease of comparison of the model results
with experimental data obtained with particle-counting instruments.
  The model set-up used in the study is based on observations from the Rain In
Cumulus over Ocean (RICO) field project (the GEWEX Cloud System Study Boundary
Layer Cloud Working Group RICO case). Cloud and rain droplet size spectrum
features obtained in the simulations are compared with previously published
aircraft observations carried out during the RICO field project. The analysis
covers height-resolved statistics of simulated cloud microphysical parameters
such as droplet number concentration, effective radius, and the width of the
cloud droplet size spectrum. The sensitivity of the results to the grid
resolution of the LES, as well as to the sampling density of the probabilistic

model supports tight guarantees of QoS to real-time interactive traffic without

input data rate of traffic has been proposed. In this model, A Differentiated
Service (DiffServ) based approach is proposed for QoS provisioning. The packets
are classified and distributed among finite number of queues with limited
buffer based on different priorities and total available bandwidth. The model
proposes a mechanism to derive the weighted service rates and queue length
distribution so as to meet the requirement of low packet loss and delay for
real time interactive traffic in the QoS engineered network. An adaptive
queuing strategy is proposed so that minimum bandwidth in used for real time
traffic. This ensures maximizing availability to best effort traffic. The model
assumes constrained bandwidth without having to over provision the network
resources and thus keeping the cost low. A modified version suitable for
testing on a real network is also presented. Experimental verification of these
in a test bed network in a laboratory as well as on a real network has been
carried out. The results of the QoS provisioning model for different sources of

are fundamental problems in database theory and artificial intelligence,
respectively. These problems are NP-hard, so that several research efforts have
been made in the literature for identifying tractable classes, known as islands
of tractability, as well as for devising clever heuristics for solving
efficiently real-world instances. Many heuristic approaches are based on
enforcing on the given instance a property called local consistency, where (in
database terms) each tuple in every query atom matches at least one tuple in
every other query atom. Interestingly, it turns out that, for many well-known
classes of queries, such as for the acyclic queries, enforcing local
consistency is even sufficient to solve the given instance correctly. However,
the precise power of such a procedure was unclear, but for some very restricted
cases. The paper provides full answers to the long-standing questions about the
precise power of algorithms based on enforcing local consistency. The classes
of instances where enforcing local consistency turns out to be a correct
query-answering procedure are however not efficiently recognizable. In fact,
the paper finally focuses on certain subclasses defined in terms of the novel
notion of greedy tree projections. These latter classes are shown to be
efficiently recognizable and strictly larger than most islands of tractability
known so far, both in the general case of tree projections and for specific
structural decomposition methods.

connected wireless networks is strongly governed by human behaviors as they are
basically human-centered. It has been shown that the users' moves can be
correlated and that the social ties shared by the users highly impact their
mobility patterns and hence the network structure. Tracking these correlations
and measuring the strength of social ties have led us to propose an efficient
distributed tensor-based link prediction technique. In fact, we are convinced
that the feedback provided by such a prediction mechanism can enhance
communication protocols such as opportunistic routing protocols. In this paper,
we aim to bring out that measuring the stabilities of the link and the
proximity at two hops can improve the efficiency of the proposed link
prediction technique. To quantify these two parameters, we propose an entropy
estimator in order to measure the two stability aspects over successive time
periods. Then, we join these entropy estimations to the tensor-based link
prediction framework by designing new prediction metrics. To assess the
contribution of these entropy estimations in the enhancement of tensor-based
link prediction efficiency, we perform prediction on two real traces. Our
simulation results show that by exploiting the information corresponding to the
link stability and/or to the proximity stability, the performance of the
tensor-based link prediction technique is improved. Moreover, the results
attest that our proposal's ability to outperform other well-known prediction

autonomous and make their own decisions. They also have limited energy
resources. Thus, a node tends to behave selfishly when it is asked to forward
the packets of other nodes. Indeed, it would rather choose to reject a
forwarding request in order to save its energy. To overcome this problem, the
nodes need to be motivated to cooperate. To this end, we propose a
self-learning repeated game framework to enforce cooperation between the nodes
of a network. This framework is inspired by the concept of ""The Weakest Link""
TV game. Each node has a utility function whose value depends on its
cooperation in forwarding packets on a route as well as the cooperation of all
the nodes that form this same route. The more these nodes cooperate the higher
is their utility value. This would establish a cooperative spirit within the
nodes of the networks. All the nodes will then more or less equally participate
to the forwarding tasks which would then eventually guarantee a more efficient
packets forwarding from sources to respective destinations. Simulations are run
and the results show that the proposed framework efficiently enforces nodes to
cooperate and outperforms two other self-learning repeated game frameworks
which we are interested in.

hops from one well to another in an erratic fashion. However, it is shown
analytically that there are two special classes of trajectories x(t) determined
only by the energy of the particle and not by the initial position of the

trajectories that return to their initial position x(0) after some real time T.
The second class consists of trajectories for which there exists a real time T
such that $x(t+T)=x(t) \pm2 \pi$. These two classes of classical trajectories
are analogous to valence and conduction bands in quantum mechanics, where the
quantum particle either remains localized or else tunnels resonantly (conducts)
through a crystal lattice. These two special types of trajectories are
associated with sets of energies of measure 0. For other energies, it is shown

a given quantum state is not uniquely determined by properties of the state,
but may depend on the choice of the factorization of the algebra of
observables. In the present work, we expose and systematize some recently
reported results about the possibility to represent a single quantum state as
either entangled or separable. We will distinguish in particular the cases of
pure and mixed states. For pure states, it has been shown that observables can
always be constructed such that any state has any amount of entanglement
possible. For mixed states, the situation is more complex and only partial
results are known: while it is always possible to choose a factorization such
that a state appears separable, a general criterion to determine whether a
state can be represented as entangled is not known. These results will be
illustrated by several examples, the phenomenon of quantum teleportation, and
the geometry of the states of two qubits.

nonuniform fields that implement a consensus rule among the neighborhood of the

currents to interfere thus implementing the thermal version of the electric
Josephson interferometer. The dissipative character of heat flux makes this
coherent phenomenon not less extraordinary than its electric (non-dissipative)
counterpart. Albeit weird, this striking effect has never been demonstrated so
far. Here we report the first experimental realization of a heat
interferometer. We investigate heat exchange between two normal metal
electrodes kept at different temperatures and tunnel-coupled to each other
through a thermal `modulator' in the form of a DC-SQUID. Heat transport in the
system is found to be phase dependent, in agreement with the original
prediction. With our design the Josephson heat interferometer yields
magnetic-flux-dependent temperature oscillations of amplitude up to ~21 mK, and
provides a flux-to-temperature transfer coefficient exceeding ~ 60mK/Phi_0 at
235 mK [Phi_0 2* 10^(-15) Wb is the flux quantum]. Besides offering remarkable
insight into thermal transport in Josephson junctions, our results represent a
significant step toward phase-coherent mastering of heat in solid-state
nanocircuits, and pave the way to the design of novel-concept coherent
caloritronic devices.

discuss how the cosmological constant can be measured in cosmology and
constrained with experiments such as measurements of planet orbits in our solar

artifact of the quantum field theory formalism. We investigate how experiments
on the universality of free fall can constrain the gravitational properties of

density. We show that the SFR-density trend is only visible when we include the
passive galaxy population along with the star-forming population. This
SFR-density relation is absent when we consider only the star-forming
population of galaxies, consistent with previous work. While there is a strong
dependence of the EWH?a on density we find, as in previous studies, that these
trends are largely due to the passive galaxy population and this relationship
is absent when considering a ""star-forming"" sample of galaxies. We find that
stellar mass has the strongest influence on SFR and EWH?a with the environment
having no significant effect on the star-formation properties of the star
forming population. We also show that the SFR-density relationship is absent
for both early and late-type star-forming galaxies. We conclude that the
stellar mass has the largest impact on the current SFR of a galaxy, and any
environmental effect is not detectable. The observation that the trends with
density are due to the changing morphology fraction with density implies that
the timescales must be very short for any quenching of the SFR in infalling
galaxies. Alternatively galaxies may in fact undergo predominantly in-situ
evolution where the infall and quenching of galaxies from the field into dense
environments is not the dominant evolutionary mode.

Planck galaxy cluster candidates. We observed 15 new candidates, detected with
signal-to-noise ratios between 4.0 and 6.1 in the 15.5-month nominal Planck
survey. The candidates were selected using ancillary data flags derived from
the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) and Digitized Sky Survey all-sky maps, with the
aim of pushing into the low SZ flux, high-z regime and testing RASS flags as
indicators of candidate reliability. 14 new clusters were detected by XMM,
including 2 double systems. Redshifts lie in the range 0.2 to 0.9, with 6
clusters at z>0.5. Estimated M500 range from 2.5 10^14 to 8 10^14 Msun. We
discuss our results in the context of the full XMM validation programme, in
which 51 new clusters have been detected. This includes 4 double and 2 triple
systems, some of which are chance projections on the sky of clusters at
different z. We find that association with a RASS-BSC source is a robust
indicator of the reliability of a candidate, whereas association with a FSC
source does not guarantee that the SZ candidate is a bona fide cluster.
Nevertheless, most Planck clusters appear in RASS maps, with a significance
greater than 2 sigma being a good indication that the candidate is a real
cluster. The full sample gives a Planck sensitivity threshold of Y500 ~ 4 10^-4
arcmin^2, with indication for Malmquist bias in the YX-Y500 relation below this
level. The corresponding mass threshold depends on z. Systems with M500 > 5
10^14 Msun at z > 0.5 are easily detectable with Planck. The newly-detected
clusters follow the YX-Y500 relation derived from X-ray selected samples.
Compared to X-ray selected clusters, the new SZ clusters have a lower X-ray
luminosity on average for their mass. There is no indication of departure from
standard self-similar evolution in the X-ray versus SZ scaling properties.

  Function and its Information Content","Accepted for publication in Physical Review E",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-point correlation functions provide crucial yet incomplete
characterization of microstructures because different microstructures may have
the same correlation function. In an earlier Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108,
080601 (2012)], we addressed the degeneracy question: What is the number of
microstructures compatible with a specified correlation function? We computed
this degeneracy, i.e., configurational entropy, in the framework of
reconstruction methods, which enabled us to map the problem to the
determination of ground-state degeneracies. Here, we provide a more
comprehensive presentation and additional results. Since the configuration
space of a reconstruction problem is a hypercube on which a Hamming distance is
defined, we can calculate analytically an energy profile corresponding to the
average energy of all microstructures at a given Hamming distance from a ground
state. The steepness of this profile is a measure of the roughness of the
energy landscape, which can be used as a proxy for ground-state degeneracy. The
relationship between roughness metric and ground-state degeneracy is calibrated
using a Monte Carlo algorithm for determining the degeneracy of a variety of
microstructures, including hard disks and Poisson point processes as well as
those with known degeneracies (single disks of various sizes and a particular
crystalline microstructure). We show that our results can be expressed in terms
of the information content of the two-point correlation functions. From this
perspective, the a priori condition for a reconstruction to be accurate is that
the information content, expressed in bits, should be comparable to the number
of pixels in the unknown microstructure. We provide a formula to calculate the
information content of any two-point correlation function, which makes our
results broadly applicable to any field in which correlation functions are
employed.

gas tracers, excess emission has been detected compared to expectations from
known neutral and atomic gas as traced by HI and CO measurements, respectively.
This excess might correspond to an additional gas component. This so-called
""dark gas"" (DG) has been observed in our Galaxy, as well as the Magellanic
Clouds. For the first time, we investigate the correlation between visible
extinction (Av) data and gas tracers on large scales in the solar neighborhood.
Our work focuses on both the solar neighborhood ($|b|>10\degr$), and the inner
and outer Galaxy, as well as on four individual regions: Taurus, Orion,
Cepheus-Polaris and Aquila-Ophiuchus. Thanks to the recent production of an
all-sky Av map, we first perform the correlation between Av and both HI and CO
emission over the most diffuse regions, to derive the optimal (Av/NH)^(ref)
ratio. We then iterate the analysis over the entire regions to estimate the
CO-to-H2 conversion factor as well as the DG mass fraction. The average
extinction to gas column-density ratio in the solar neighborhood is found to be
(Av/NH)^(ref)=6.53 10^(-22) mag. cm^2, with significant differences between the
inner and outer Galaxy. We derive an average XCO value of 1.67 10^(20) H2
cm^(-2)/(K km s^(-1)). In the solar neighborhood, the gas mass in the dark
component is found to be 19% relative to that in the atomic component and
164$%$ relative to the one traced by CO. These results are compatible with the
recent analysis using Planck data within the uncertainties of our measurements.
We estimate the ratio of dark gas to total molecular gas to be 0.62 in the
solar neighborhood. The HI-to-H2 and H2-to-CO transitions appear for Av
$\simeq$0.2 mag and Av$\simeq1.5$ mag, respectively, in agreement with
theoretical models of dark-H2 gas.

most fundamental problems in ecology. Aggregation is an emergent phenomenon
arising from the interactions between the individuals of the population, able
to sense only -at most- local densities of their cohorts. Thus, taking into
account the individual-level interactions and fluctuations is essential to
reach a correct description of the population. Classic deterministic equations
are suitable to describe some aspects of the population, but leave out features
related to the stochasticity inherent to the discreteness of the individuals.
Stochastic equations for the population do account for these
fluctuation-generated effects by means of demographic noise terms but, owing to
their complexity, they can be difficult (or, at times, impossible) to deal
with. Even when they can be written in a simple form, they are still difficult
to numerically integrate due to the presence of the ""square-root"" intrinsic
noise. In this paper, we discuss a simple way to add the effect of demographic
stochasticity to three classic, deterministic ecological examples where
aggregation plays an important role. We study the resulting equations using a
recently-introduced integration scheme especially devised to integrate
numerically stochastic equations with demographic noise. Aimed at scrutinizing
the ability of these stochastic examples to show aggregation, we find that the
three systems not only show patchy configurations, but also undergo a phase
transition belonging to the directed percolation universality class.

with results from perturbative QCD at an appropriate distance scale. This
matching is made possible by defining the perturbative potentials through
Fourier transforms with a low-momentum cutoff. The central (spin-independent)
potential is compared with potentials derived from an expansion in powers of
the inverse quark mass. A well-controlled continuation of the charmonium
spin-spin potential from lattice QCD to short distances is performed. The mass
splittings of the charmonium singlet and triplet states below the open charm
threshold, obtained from the matched spin-spin potential, are in good agreement
with the experimental values.

the numerical data up to contact and within their uncertainties. Remarkably, no

that the tidally-completed effective-one-body model provides nowadays the most

Young modulus is found to depend upon the loading direction for some specific
conformers, characterized by an anisotropic linear elastic behavior.

NonbinaryCycleKiller, the first methods to produce solutions verifiably close
to optimality for instances with hundreds or even thousands of reticulations.
Using simulations, we demonstrate that these algorithms run quickly for large
and difficult instances, producing solutions that are very close to optimality.
As a spin-off from our simulations we also present TerminusEst, which is the
fastest exact method currently available that can handle nonbinary trees: this
is used to measure the accuracy of the NonbinaryCycleKiller algorithm. All
three methods are based on extensions of previous theoretical work and are
publicly available. We also apply our methods to real data.

formally, and to all orders, by constructing an operator which projects
arbitrary forms to solutions. We also develop a product formula for solving
these asymptotic problems in general. The central tools of our approach are (i)
the conformal geometry of differential forms and the associated exterior
tractor calculus, and (ii) a generalised notion of scale which encodes the
connection between the underlying geometry and its boundary. The latter also
controls the breaking of conformal invariance in a very strict way by coupling
conformally invariant equations to the scale tractor associated with the
generalised scale. From this, we obtain a map from existing solutions to new
ones that exchanges Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Together, the
scale tractor and exterior structure extend the solution generating algebra of
[31] to a conformally invariant, Poincare--Einstein calculus on (tractor)
differential forms. This calculus leads to explicit holographic formulae for
all the higher order conformal operators on weighted differential forms,
differential complexes, and Q-operators of [9]. This complements the results of
Aubry and Guillarmou [3] where associated conformal harmonic spaces parametrise

proposed to describe stochastic financial processes. The generalized

independent, identically distributed increments in the general case, and
high-order correlations have been investigated. The cumulants of an
asymmetrically truncated Levy distribution have been found. The behaviors of
asymmetrically truncated Levy flight, as a particular case of a random walk,
are considered. It is shown that, in the Levy regime, high-order correlations
between values of asymmetrically truncated Levy flight exist. The source of
high-order correlations is the non-Gaussianity of the increments: the increment
skewness generates threefold correlation, and the increment kurtosis generates
fourfold correlation.

literature and we investigate their candidate crystal structures in a
systematic way. We compare two different algorithms for predicting crystal
structures: (i) an approach based on Monte Carlo simulations in the
isobaric-isothermal ensemble and (ii) an optimization technique based on ideas
of evolutionary algorithms. We show that the two methods are equally successful
and provide consistent results on crystalline phases of patchy particle
systems.

physics due to the many different definitions of the effective mass that are
routinely used. Also, the most commonly used theoretical definition of the
effective mass was derived from the assumption of a parabolic energy-momentum
relationship, E(p), and therefore should not be applied to non-parabolic
materials. In this paper, we use wave-particle duality to derive a definition
of the effective mass and the energy-mass approximation suitable for
non-parabolic materials. The new energy-mass relationship can be considered a
generalization of Einstein's E=mc^2 suitable for arbitrary E(p) and therefore
applicable to solid state materials and devices. We show that the resulting
definition of the effective mass seems suitable for non-paraboic solid state
materials such as HgCdTe, GaAs, and graphene.
