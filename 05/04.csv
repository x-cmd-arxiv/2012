key to understanding many aspects of these enigmatic systems. Complex
appearance of the Fourier phase lags related to QPOs is one of the most
puzzling observational effects in accreting black holes. In this Letter we show
that QPO properties, including phase lags, can be explained in a framework of a
simple scenario, where the oscillating media provides a feedback on the
emerging spectrum. We demonstrate that the QPO waveform is presented by the
product of a perturbation and a time delayed response factors, where the
response is energy dependent. The essential property of this effect is its
non-linear and multiplicative nature. Our multiplicative reverberation model
successfully describes the QPO components in energy dependent power spectra as
well as the appearance of the phase lags between signal in different energy
bands. We apply our model to QPOs observed by Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer in BH
candidate XTE J1550-564. We briefly discuss the implications of the observed
energy dependence of the QPO reverberation times and amplitudes to the nature
of the power law spectral component and its variability.

analytically, and therefore one has to rely on numerical procedures to extract
their analytic structures if needed. After describing the general outline of
the corresponding algorithm we demonstrate the procedure by providing a
completely worked-out example in four dimensions for which an exact solution

heterogeneous nodes such as sources and sinks. The survivability analysis of
such networks requires the analysis of the connectivity of the network
components for every possible combination of faults to determine a network
response to each combination of faults. From the computational complexity point
of view, the problem belongs to the class of exponential time problems at
least. Partially, the problem complexity can be reduced by mapping the initial
topology of a complex large-scale network with multiple sources and multiple
sinks onto a set of smaller sub-topologies with multiple sources and a single
sink connected to the network of sources by a single link. In this paper, the
mapping procedure is applied to the Florida power grid.

structure derives from interface-loading processes modulated by the underlying
mechanics of isostatic and flexural compensation in the shallow lithosphere.
Under this dual statistical-mechanistic viewpoint an estimation problem can be
formulated where the knowns are topography and gravity and the principal
unknown the elastic flexural rigidity of the lithosphere. In the guise of an
equivalent ""effective elastic thickness"", this important, geographically
varying, structural parameter has been the subject of many interpretative
studies, but precisely how well it is known or how best it can be found from
the data, abundant nonetheless, has remained contentious and unresolved
throughout the last few decades of dedicated study. The popular methods whereby
admittance or coherence, both spectral measures of the relation between gravity
and topography, are inverted for the flexural rigidity, have revealed
themselves to have insufficient power to independently constrain both it and
the additional unknown initial-loading fraction and load-correlation fac- tors,
respectively. Solving this extremely ill-posed inversion problem leads to
non-uniqueness and is further complicated by practical considerations such as
the choice of regularizing data tapers to render the analysis sufficiently
selective both in the spatial and spectral domains. Here, we rewrite the
problem in a form amenable to maximum-likelihood estimation theory, which we
show yields unbiased, minimum-variance estimates of flexural rigidity,
initial-loading frac- tion and load correlation, each of those separably
resolved with little a posteriori correlation between their estimates. We are
also able to separately characterize the isotropic spectral shape of the

difficult corner: either we must give up quantum mechanics or we must accept

the large entropy of the hole: the measure in the path integral competes with
the classical action, instead of giving a subleading correction. Putting this

deform these gauge theories by introducing an additional control parameter into

consider a large-d(R) expansion of the effective action, where d(R) denotes the
dimension of the representation R of the quark fields. We show how our
large-d(R) expansion can be extended in a systematic fashion and discuss the
effects of 1/d(R)-corrections on the dynamics close to the finite-temperature
phase boundary. Our analysis of the fixed-point structure of the theory
suggests that the order, in which the chiral and the deconfinement phase
transition occur, is dictated by the representation of the quark fields and by
the underlying gauge group. In particular, we find that the phase diagram in
the plane spanned by the temperature and our additional control parameter
exhibits an intriguing phase structure for quarks in the fundamental
representation. For SU(N) gauge theories with adjoint quarks, on the other
hand, the structure of this phase diagram appears to be less rich, at least in

the viability of inflationary models. They accomplish this by decreasing the
tensor-to-scalar ratio while simultaneously increasing the value of the scalar
spectral index, thereby redeeming models which are incompatible with the cosmic

non-canonical version of the chaotic inflationary potential, $V(\phi) \sim

CMB observations. A central result of this paper is that {\em steep potentials}

first construct an exact transform on the radial half-line using damped
Laguerre polynomials and develop a corresponding quadrature rule. Combined with
the spherical harmonic transform, this approach leads to a sampling theorem on
the ball and a novel three-dimensional decomposition which we call the
Fourier-Laguerre transform. We relate this new transform to the well-known
Fourier-Bessel decomposition and show that band-limitedness in the

through a harmonic tiling, which is exact thanks to the exactness of the
Fourier-Laguerre transform (from which the name flaglets is coined). The
corresponding wavelet kernels are well localised in real and Fourier-Laguerre
spaces and their angular aperture is invariant under radial translation. We
introduce a multiresolution algorithm to perform the flaglet transform rapidly,
while capturing all information at each wavelet scale in the minimal number of

family relatedness and population structure, a problem that is becoming more
important as larger data sets are used to increase power.
  Results: We introduce a new approach for set tests that handles confounders.
Our model is based on the linear mixed model and uses two random effects-one to
capture the set association signal and one to capture confounders. We also
introduce a computational speedup for two-random-effects models that makes this
approach feasible even for extremely large cohorts. Using this model with both
the likelihood ratio test and score test, we find that the former yields more
power while controlling type I error. Application of our approach to richly

which appear to be distinguished by jet structure, where low-efficiency
accreting systems produce `weak' jets which decelerate more rapidly than the
`strong' jets of black holes accreting near the Eddington limit. The two
classes are comprised of: (1) The weak jet sources, corresponding to FR I radio
galaxies, having a decelerating or spine-sheath jet with velocity gradients,
and (2) The strong jet sources, having fast, collimated jets, and typically
displaying strong emission lines. The dichotomy in the \nu_peak-L_peak plane
can be understood as a `broken power sequence' in which jets exist on one
branch or the other based on the particular accretion mode. We suggest that the
intrinsic kinetic power (as measured by low-frequency, isotropic radio
emission), the orientation, and the accretion rate of the SMBH system are the
the fundamental axes needed for unification of radio-loud AGN by studying a
well-characterized sample of several hundred Fermi-detected jets. Finally, we
present very recent findings that the most powerful strong jets produce
gamma-rays by external Compton rather than SSC emission, placing the

expanding the amplitude in a basis of master integrals and then determining the
coefficients by taking a number of generalized cuts. In this paper, we present
a complete classification of the solutions to the maximal cut of integrals with
the double-box topology. The ideas presented here are expected to be relevant
for all two-loop topologies as well. We find that these maximal-cut solutions
are naturally associated with Riemann surfaces whose topology is determined by
the number of states at the vertices of the double-box graph. In the case of
four massless external momenta we find that, once the geometry of these Riemann
surfaces is properly understood, there are uniquely defined master contours
producing the coefficients of the double-box integrals in the basis
decomposition of the two-loop amplitude. This is in perfect analogy with the
situation in one-loop generalized unitarity.
  In addition, we point out that the chiral integrals recently introduced by
Arkani-Hamed et al. can be used as master integrals for the double-box
contributions to the two-loop amplitudes in any gauge theory. The infrared
finiteness of these integrals allow for their coefficients as well as their
integrated expressions to be evaluated in strictly four dimensions, providing
significant technical simplification. We evaluate these integrals at four

success and satisfaction. This goes against widespread simulation practices of
evolutionary games, where players frequently consider changing their strategy
even though their payoffs may be marginally different than those of the other
players. Inspired by this observation, we introduce an aspiration-based
win-stay-lose-learn strategy updating rule into the spatial prisoner's dilemma
game. The rule is simple and intuitive, foreseeing strategy changes only by
dissatisfied players, who then attempt to adopt the strategy of one of their
nearest neighbors, while the strategies of satisfied players are not subject to
change. We find that the proposed win-stay-lose-learn rule promotes the
evolution of cooperation, and it does so very robustly and independently of the
initial conditions. In fact, we show that even a minute initial fraction of
cooperators may be sufficient to eventually secure a highly cooperative final
state. In addition to extensive simulation results that support our
conclusions, we also present results obtained by means of the pair
approximation of the studied game. Our findings continue the success story of
related win-stay strategy updating rules, and by doing so reveal new ways of
resolving the prisoner's dilemma.

set of issues to consider includes asymmetric beam functions, correlated noise,
and incomplete sky coverage. Presuming a simplified scanning strategy that
allows for an exact analytical treatment of the problem, we study the impact of
systematic effects on the likelihood function of the CMB power spectrum. We use
the Fisher matrix, a measure of the information content of a data set, for a
quantitative comparison of different experimental configurations. In addition,
for various power spectrum coefficients, we explore the functional form of the
likelihood directly, and obtain the following results: The likelihood function
can deviate systematically from a Gaussian distribution up to the highest
multipole values considered in our analysis. Treated exactly, realistic levels
of asymmetric beam functions and correlated noise do not by themselves decrease
the information yield of CMB experiments nor do they induce noticeable coupling
between multipoles. Masking large fractions of the sky, on the other hand,
results in a considerably more complex correlation structure of the likelihood
function. Combining adjacent power spectrum coefficients into bins can
partially mitigate these problems.

W1-W2 \geq 0.8 (i.e., [3.4]-[4.6] \geq 0.8, Vega), which identifies 61.9 \pm
5.4 AGN candidates per deg2 to a depth of W2 = 15.0. This implies a much larger
census of luminous AGN than found by typical wide-area surveys, attributable to
the fact that mid-infrared selection identifies both unobscured (type 1) and
obscured (type 2) AGN. Optical and soft X-ray surveys alone are highly biased
towards only unobscured AGN, while this simple WISE selection likely identifies
even heavily obscured, Compton-thick AGN. Using deep, public data in the COSMOS
field, we explore the properties of WISE-selected AGN candidates. At the
mid-infrared depth considered, 160 uJy at 4.6 microns, this simple criterion
identifies 78% of Spitzer mid-infrared AGN candidates according to the criteria
of Stern et al. (2005) and the reliability is 95%. We explore the demographics,
multiwavelength properties and redshift distribution of WISE-selected AGN
candidates in the COSMOS field.

imaging, we examine galaxies on a per-object basis in order to understand both
the prevalence of galactic winds at z~1 and the star-forming and structural
properties of objects experiencing outflows. Gas velocities, measured from the
centroids of FeII interstellar absorption lines, span the interval [-217, +155]
km/s. We find that ~40% (10%) of the sample exhibits blueshifted FeII lines at
the 1-sigma (3-sigma) level. We also measure maximal outflow velocities using
the profiles of the FeII and MgII lines, and show that MgII frequently traces
higher velocity gas than FeII. Quantitative morphological parameters derived
from the HST imaging suggest that mergers are not a prerequisite for driving
outflows. More face-on galaxies also show stronger winds than highly-inclined
systems, consistent with the canonical picture of winds emanating perpendicular
to galactic disks. Using star-formation rates calculated from GALEX data, and
areas estimated from HST imaging, we detect a ~3-sigma correlation between
outflow velocity and star-formation rate surface density, but only a weak
(~1-sigma) trend between outflow velocity and star-formation rate. Higher
resolution data are needed in order to test the scaling relations between
outflow velocity and both star-formation rate and star-formation rate surface
density predicted by theory.

defining features of its peculiarity are: high velocity, broad lines, and a
fast rising light curve, combined with the slowest known rate of decline. It is
one magnitude dimmer than would be predicted from its observed value of
Delta-m15, and shows broad spectral features. We base our analysis on detailed
calculations for the explosion, light curves, and spectra. We demonstrate that
consistency is key for both validating the models and probing the underlying
physics. We show that this SN can be understood within the physics underlying
the Delta-m15 relation, and in the framework of pulsating delayed detonation
models originating from a Chandrasekhar mass, white dwarf, but with a
progenitor core composed of 80% carbon. We suggest a possible scenario for
stellar evolution which leads to such a progenitor. We show that the unusual
light curve decline can be understood with the same physics as has been used to
understand the Delta-m15 relation for normal SNe Ia. The decline relation can
be explained by a combination of the temperature dependence of the opacity and
excess or deficit of the peak luminosity, alpha, measured relative to the
instantaneous rate of radiative decay energy generation. What differentiates SN
2001ay from normal SNe Ia is a higher explosion energy which leads to a shift
of the Ni56 distribution towards higher velocity and alpha < 1. This result is
responsible for the fast rise and slow decline. We define a class of SN
2001ay-like SNe Ia, which will show an anti-Phillips relation.

recoiling supermassive black hole (SMBH) at z=0.359 in the COSMOS survey.
CID-42 shows two optical compact sources resolved in the HST/ACS image embedded
in the same galaxy structure and a velocity offset of ~1300 km/s between the
H\beta\ broad and narrow emission line, as presented by Civano et al. (2010).
Two scenarios have been proposed to explain the properties of CID-42: a GW
recoiling SMBH and a double Type 1/ Type 2 AGN system, where one of the two is
recoiling because of slingshot effect. In both scenario, one of the optical
nuclei hosts an unobscured AGN, while the other one, either an obscured AGN or
a star forming compact region. The X-ray Chandra data allow to unambiguously
resolve the X-ray emission, and unveil the nature, of the two optical sources
in CID-42. We find that only one of the optical nuclei is responsible for the
whole X-ray unobscured emission observed and a 3sigma upper limit on the flux
of the second optical nucleus is measured. The upper limit on the X-ray
luminosity plus the analysis of the multiwavelength spectral energy
distribution indicate the presence of a starforming region in the second source
rather than an obscured SMBH, thus favoring the GW recoil scenario. However the
presence of a very obscured SMBH cannot be fully ruled-out. A new X-ray
feature, in a SW direction with respect to the main source, is discovered and
discussed.

large scales. We find that the galaxy is rapidly rotating and exhibits a sharp
central peak in the velocity dispersion. Using the kinematics and the stellar
luminosity density derived from imaging observations, we construct
three-integral, orbit-based, triaxial stellar dynamical models. We find the
black hole has a mass of M_BH = (8.1_{-1.9}^{+2.0}) x 10^8 M_sun, with an
I-band stellar mass-to-light ratio of M/L = 5.0_{-0.4}^{+0.3} M_sun/L_sun

measurement. Given that this cross-check has so far only been attempted on a
few galaxies with mixed results, carrying out similar studies in other objects
is essential for quantifying the magnitude and distribution of the cosmic

space, with narrow regions of regular motion. The dynamics are governed by a
dense net of three- and four-body mean motion resonances, forming the Arnold
web. Overlapping of these resonances is a main source of instability. We found
that the Kepler-11 system may be long-term stable only in particular multiple
resonant configurations with small relative inclinations. The mass-radius data

density of the planets with their distance from the star. This may reflect the

We first introduce a metric for quantum measurements, and show that it

the following classes of measurements can be efficiently tested: 1. the
stabilizer measurements, which play a crucial role for quantum error
correction; 2. the $k$-local measurements, i.e. measurements whose outcomes

a novel Enskog-type kinetic theory. In this model, N particles of constant
speed v0 try to align their travel directions with the average direction of a
fixed number of closest neighbors. At strong alignment a global flocking state
forms. The alignment is defined by a stochastic rule, not by a Hamiltonian. The
corresponding interactions are of genuine multi-body nature. The theory is
based on a Master equation in 3N-dimensional phase space, which is made
tractable by means of the molecular chaos approximation. The phase diagram for
the transition to collective motion is calculated and compared to direct
numerical simulations. A linear stability analysis of a homogeneous ordered
state is performed using the kinetic but not the hydrodynamic equations in
order to achieve high accuracy. In contrast to the regular metric Vicsek-model
no instabilities occur. This confirms previous direct simulations that for
Vicsek-like models with metric-free interactions, there is no formation of
density bands and that the flocking transition is continuous.

the metric-affine formalism where the connections are treated arbitrarily at

in redshift between `nodes', whose $w$-values and redshifts are allowed to
vary. The optimal number of nodes is chosen by the Bayesian evidence. In this

any features present in $w(z)$. We compare this node-based reconstruction with
some previously well-studied parameterisations: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder
(CPL), the Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP) and the Felice-Nesseris-Tsujikawa

indication towards possible time-dependence in the dark energy

strongly disfavoured, whilst the FNT is just significantly disfavoured, when

steps must be executed. Security requirements may impose constraints on which
groups of users are permitted to perform subsets of those steps. A workflow
specification is said to be satisfiable if there exists an assignment of users
to workflow steps that satisfies all the constraints. An algorithm for
determining whether such an assignment exists is important, both as a static
analysis tool for workflow specifications, and for the construction of run-time
reference monitors for workflow management systems. Finding such an assignment
is a hard problem in general, but work by Wang and Li in 2010 using the theory
of parameterized complexity suggests that efficient algorithms exist under
reasonable assumptions about workflow specifications. In this paper, we improve
the complexity bounds for the workflow satisfiability problem. We also
generalize and extend the types of constraints that may be defined in a
workflow specification and prove that the satisfiability problem remains
fixed-parameter tractable for such constraints. Finally, we consider
preprocessing for the problem and prove that in an important special case, in
polynomial time, we can reduce the given input into an equivalent one, where
the number of users is at most the number of steps. We also show that no such
reduction exists for two natural extensions of this case, which bounds the
number of users by a polynomial in the number of steps, provided a
widely-accepted complexity-theoretical assumption holds.

We argue that a class of large-N equivalences, which is known to hold in the 't
Hooft limit, can be extended to this very strongly coupled limit. Hence this
limit may lead to a new way of studying corrections to the 't Hooft limit,
while keeping nice properties of the latter. As a concrete example, we describe
large-N equivalences between the ABJM theory and its orientifold projection.
The equivalence implies that operators neutral under the projection symmetry
have the same correlation functions in two theories at large-N. Usual field
theory arguments are valid when 't Hooft coupling $\lambda\sim N/k$ is fixed
and observables can be computed by using a planar diagrammatic expansion. With
the help of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we argue that the equivalence extends
to stronger coupling regions, $N\gg k$, including the M-theory region $N\gg
k^5$. We further argue that the orbifold/orientifold equivalences between
certain Yang-Mills theories can also be generalized. Such equivalences can be
tested both analytically and numerically. Based on calculations of the free

about 1-2 km difference in predictions of the neutron star radius given

asymptotically optimal within the larger class of all causal control policies.
For multihypothesis testing in the fixed sample size setting, lower and upper

example with three hypotheses that the optimal causal control policy can be
strictly better than the optimal open-loop control policy. In the sequential
setting, a test based on earlier work by Chernoff for binary hypothesis
testing, is shown to be first-order asymptotically optimal for multihypothesis
testing in a strong sense, using the notion of decision making risk in place of
the overall probability of error. Another test is also designed to meet hard
risk constrains while retaining asymptotic optimality. The role of past

observable effects of the Z' from analogous ones due to competitor models with
anomalous trilinear gauge couplings (AGC) that can lead to the same or similar

probing the Z-Z' mixing and its capability to distinguish these two new physics

the Z' effects in the process e^+e^- \to W^+W^- allows to differentiate the
full class of vector Z' models from those with anomalous trilinear gauge
couplings, with one notable exception: the sequential SM (SSM)-like models can
in this process not be distinguished from anomalous gauge couplings. Results of

tilt angle for a given rotational frequency is determined self-consistently by
minimizing the total Routhian with respect to the tilt angle. In such a way,
the energy spectrum, total angular momenta, kinetic and dynamic moments of
inertia, and the B(E2) values for the AMR band in 105Cd are calculated. Good

thereby providing a natural solution to the horizon problem. Subsequently, due
to an instability provoked by the production of massless particles, the
Universe evolves smoothly to the standard radiation dominated era thereby
ending the production of radiation as required by the conformal invariance.
Next, the radiation becomes sub-dominant with the Universe entering in the cold
dark matter dominated era. Finally, the negative pressure associated with the
creation of cold dark matter (CCDM model) particles accelerates the expansion
and drives the Universe to a final de Sitter stage. The late time cosmic
expansion history of the CCDM model is exactly like in the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model, however, there is no dark energy. This complete scenario is
fully determined by two extreme energy densities, or equivalently, the
associated de Sitter Hubble scales connected by $\rho_I/\rho_f=(H_I/H_f)^{2}
\sim 10^{122}$, a result that has no correlation with the cosmological constant
problem. We also study the linear growth of matter perturbations at the final
accelerating stage. It is found that the CCDM growth index can be written as a
function of the $\Lambda$ growth index, $\gamma_{\Lambda} \simeq 6/11$. In this
framework, we also compare the observed growth rate of clustering with that
predicted by the current CCDM model. Performing a $\chi^{2}$ statistical test

classical correlation. This short review focuses on highlighting the

general system is still lacking. Such a comparison could lead to select the
most efficient algorithms given a certain dynamical problem. Furthermore, in
order to choose the appropriate numerical integrators to compute them, more
comparative studies among numerical integrators are also needed.
  This work deals with both problems. We first extend the work of Maffione et
al. (2011) for mappings to the 2D H\'enon & Heiles (1964) potential, and
compare several variational indicators of chaos: the Lyapunov Indicator (LI);
the Mean Exponential Growth Factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO); the Smaller
Alignment Index (SALI) and its generalized version, the Generalized Alignment
Index (GALI); the Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI) and its variant, the Orthogonal
Fast Lyapunov Indicator (OFLI); the Spectral Distance (D) and the Dynamical
Spectras of Stretching Numbers (SSNs). We also include in the record the
  Relative Lyapunov Indicator (RLI), which is not a variational indicator as
the others. Then, we test a numerical technique to integrate
  Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) based on the Taylor method implemented
by Jorba & Zou (2005) (called taylor), and we compare its performance with
other two well-known efficient integrators: the Prince & Dormand (1981)

explained by invoking some plasma processes occurring inside the magnetosphere.
Despite many detailed local investigations, the global electrodynamics around
those neutron stars remains poorly described. Better understanding of these
compact objects requires a deep and accurate knowledge of their immediate
electromagnetic surrounding within the magnetosphere and its link to the
relativistic pulsar wind.
  The aim of this work is to present accurate solutions to the nearly
stationary force-free pulsar magnetosphere and its link to the striped wind,
for various spin periods and arbitrary inclination. To this end, the
time-dependent Maxwell equations are solved in spherical geometry in the
force-free approximation using a vector spherical harmonic expansion of the
electromagnetic field. An exact analytical enforcement of the divergenceless of
the magnetic part is obtained by a projection method. Special care has been
given to design an algorithm able to look deeply into the magnetosphere with
physically realistic ratios of stellar $R_*$ to light-cylinder $\rlight$
radius. We checked our code against several analytical solutions, like the
Deutsch vacuum rotator solution and the Michel monopole field. We also retrieve
energy losses comparable to the magneto-dipole radiation formula and consistent
with previous similar works. Finally, for arbitrary obliquity, we give an
expression for the total electric charge of the system. It does not vanish
except for the perpendicular rotator. This is due to the often ignored point
charge located at the centre of the neutron star. It is questionable if such
solutions with huge electric charges could exist in reality except for

many areas of physics. Since the corresponding symmetry is a gauge symmetry,
its breaking is actually gauge-dependent. Thus, it is possible to design gauges
which restore the symmetry as good as possible. Such gauge constructions will
be detailed here, illustrated with the use of lattice gauge theory. Their use
will be discussed for the cases of the Higgs effect, high-baryon density color
superconductors, and BRST symmetry.

for many years now. Although first interpreted as upflows (Schrijver et al.
(1999)), they have been widely regarded as slow magnetoacoustic waves, due to
observed velocities and periods. However, recent observations have questioned
this interpretation, as periodic disturbances in Doppler velocity, line width
and profile asymmetry were found to be in phase with the intensity oscillations
(De Pontieu et al. (2010),Tian1 et al. (2011))}, suggesting the disturbances
could be quasi-periodic upflows. Here we conduct a detailed analysis of the
velocities of these disturbances across several wavelengths using the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). We analysed 41 examples, including both sunspot and non sunspot regions
of the Sun. We found that the velocities of propagating disturbances (PDs)
located at sunspots are more likely to be temperature dependent, whereas the
velocities of PDs at non sunspot locations do not show a clear temperature
dependence. We also considered on what scale the underlying driver is affecting
the properties of the PDs. Finally, we found that removing the contribution due
to the cooler ions in the 193 A wavelength suggests that a substantial part of
the 193 emission of sunspot PDs can be contributed to the cool component of
193\AA.

Force Microscopy is described. It is experimentally shown that a typical

adjusted to transfer the thermal noise of the cantilever motion from its
resonance frequency to a much lower frequency within the typical bandwidth of
the corresponding electronics. Therefore, the thermal noise measured in the
in-phase (""phase"") and out of phase (""amplitude"") output of such an electronics
can be related to the thermal energy $kT$. If the force constant of the
cantilever is known then the oscillation amplitude can be precisely calibrated
from the thermal power measured in these signals. Based on this concept, two
procedures for the calibration of the oscillation amplitude are proposed. One
is based on simple calculation of the Root Mean Square (RMS) measured at the
outputs of the electronics used to process the dynamic motion of the
cantilever, and the other one is based on analysis of the corresponding

analysis of the O-C residuals showed a dramatic evolution in Psh during the
outburst. During the first part of the plateau phase the period increased with
dPsh/dt = +2.67(15) x 10-4. There was then an abrupt change following which the
period decreased with dPsh/dt = -2.08(9)x 10-4. We found a signal in the power

the secure and convenient interoperability with other smartcards and smartcard

smartcard interoperability in such an environment. Here we discuss and
experimentally demonstrate one critical security problem: if several smartcards

Linial and Shraibman that problems with high mc-rigidity lie outside the

(arbitrary instead of uniform distribution), it is then evident that the class
$M^{cc}$ of problems with low mc-rigidity equals $BP\cdot PP^{cc}$. As $BP\cdot

Special emphasis is devoted to the influence of different possible cation

symmetry-lowering has only a negligible effect on the elastic constants of both

magnetoelastic response of CoFe2O4 depends more strongly on the specific cation

examine the memory of the network. In the case of unequal weights our model
does not lead to the catastrophic destruction of the memory due to its
overfilling (that is typical for the standard Hopfield model). The real memory

dynamic modulation by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). We observe a
characteristic transition of the modulation from one maximum to two maxima per
SAW cycle as the acoustic power is increased which we find in good agreement
with numer- ical calculations of the SAW controlled carrier dynamics. At low
acoustic powers the carrier mobilites limit electron-hole pair dissociation,
whereas at high power levels the induced electric fields give rise to efficient
acousto-electric carrier transport. The direct comparison between the
experimental data and the numerical simulations provide an absolute calibration
of the local SAW phase.

an infinite horizon discounted linear holding cost are studied. Diffusion
control problems, that have been proposed as approximate models for the study
of these critically loaded controlled stochastic networks, can be regarded as
formal scaling limits of such stochastic systems. However, to date, a rigorous
limit theory that justifies the use of such approximations for a general family
of controlled networks has been lacking. It is shown that, under broad
conditions, the value function of the suitably scaled network control problem
converges to that of the associated diffusion control problem. This scaling
limit result, in addition to giving a precise mathematical basis for the above
approximation approach, suggests a general strategy for constructing near
optimal controls for the physical stochastic networks by solving the associated
diffusion control problem.

whether there is equivalence between intermediate statistics, which may be
different from anyonic statistics, and q-deformed particle algebra. Also, a
model to be studied for addressing such an idea could possibly provide us some
new consequences about the interactions of particles as well as their internal
structures. Motivated mainly by this idea, in this work, we consider a
q-deformed Fermi gas model whose statistical properties enable effectively us
to study interpolating statistics. Starting with a generalized Fermi-Dirac
distribution function, we derive several thermostatistical functions of a gas
of these deformed fermions in the thermodynamical limit. We study the high
temperature behavior of the system by analyzing the effects of q-deformation on
the most important thermostatistical characteristics of the system such as the
entropy, specific heat, and equation of state. It is shown that such a deformed
fermion model in two and three spatial dimensions exhibits the interpolating
statistics in a specific interval of the model deformation parameter 0 < q < 1.
In particular, for two and three spatial dimensions, it is found from the
behavior of the third virial coefficient of the model that the deformation
parameter q interpolates completely between attractive and repulsive systems,
including the free boson and fermion cases. From the results obtained in this
work, we conclude that such a model could provide much physical insight into
some interacting theories of fermions, and could be useful to further study the
particle systems with intermediate statistics.

A Energy-Efficient Water-Filling (EEWF) algorithm that maximizes the ratio of

power allocation policy establishes a trade-off between the transmission rate
and the total transmit power under the total receive power constraint. The
static and the uncorrelated fast fading Rayleigh channels have been considered,
where the maximization is performed on the instantaneous realization of the

with equal number of antennas. We show, based on Monte Carlo simulations that
the energy-efficiency provided by the EEWF algorithm can be more than an order
of magnitude greater than the energy-efficiency corresponding to capacity
achieving Water-Filling (WF) algorithm. We also show that the energy-efficiency
increases with both the number of antennas and the signal-to-noise ratio. The
corresponding transmission rate also increases but at a slower rate than the
Shannon capacity, while the corresponding total transmit power decreases with

galaxies with redshifts between 0.01 and 0.05, selected from the seventh Data
Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. 1555 galaxies with bars are identified
using position angle and ellipticity profiles of the $i$-band light. We compare
the ratio of the specific star formation rate measured in the 1-3 kpc central
region of the galaxy to that measured for the whole galaxy. Galaxies with
strong bars have centrally enhanced star formation; the degree of enhancement
depends primarily on the ellipticity of the bar, and not on the size of the bar
or on the mass or structure of the host galaxy. The fraction of galaxies with
strong bars is highest at stellar masses greater than $3 \times 10^{10}
M_{\odot}$, stellar surface densities less than $3 \times 10^8 M_{\odot}$ and
concentration indices less than 2.5. In this region of parameter space,
galaxies with strong bars either have enhanced central star formation rates, or
star formation that is {\em suppressed} compared to the mean. This suggests
that bars may play a role in the eventual quenching of star formation in
galaxies. Only 50% of galaxies with strongly concentrated star formation have
strong bars, indicating that other processes such as galaxy interactions also
induce central star-bursts. We also find that the ratio of the size of the bar
to that of the disk depends mainly on the colour of the galaxy, suggesting that
the growth and destruction of bars are regulated by gas accretion, as suggested
by simulations.

Alfven waves and magneto-sonic waves are particular classes of MHD waves. These
wave modes are clearly different and have pure properties in uniform plasmas of
infinite extent only. Due to plasma non-uniformity MHD waves have mixed
properties and cannot be classified as pure Alfven or magneto-sonic waves.
However, vorticity is a quantity unequivocally related to Alfven waves as
compression is for magneto-sonic waves. Here, we investigate MHD waves
superimposed on a one-dimensional non-uniform straight cylinder with constant
magnetic field. For a piecewise constant density profile we find that the
fundamental radial modes of the non-axisymmetric waves have the same properties
as surface Alfven waves at a true discontinuity in density. Contrary to the
classic Alfveen waves in a uniform plasma of infinite extent, vorticity is zero
everywhere except at the cylinder boundary. If the discontinuity in density is
replaced with a continuous variation of density, vorticity is spread out over
the whole interval with non-uniform density. The fundamental radial modes of
the non-axisymmetric waves do not need compression to exist unlike the radial
overtones. In thin magnetic cylinders the fundamental radial modes of the
non-axisymmetric waves with phase velocities between the internal and the
external Alfven velocities can be considered as surface Alfven waves. On the
contrary, the radial overtones can be related to fast-like magneto-sonic modes.

lower diameter bound for compact manifolds with shrinking Ricci solitons. Such
a bound can be obtained from an eigenvalue estimate for a twisted Laplacian,

obtained for solutions in $\bfR^n$ or $\bfC^n$. We see that many of them extend
to cone manifolds, and in particular results on $\bfC^n$ for special
Lagrangians and self-shrinkers can be extended to toric Calabi-Yau cones. We
also see that a similar lower diameter bound can be obtained for self-shrinkers

We have identified local analogs of these HAEs using the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). At z<0.4, only 0.04% of galaxies are classified as HAEs with
Halpha equivalent widths (>500A) comparable to that of z~4 HAEs. Local HAEs
have lower stellar mass and lower ultraviolet (UV) luminosity than z~4 HAEs,
yet the Halpha-to-UV luminosity ratio as well as their specific star-formation
rate is consistent with that of z~4 HAEs indicating that they are scaled down
versions of high-z star-forming galaxies. Compared to the previously studied
local analogs of z~2 Lyman break galaxies selected using rest-frame UV, local
HAEs show similar UV luminosity surface density, weaker Dn(4000) breaks, lower
metallicity and lower stellar mass. This supports the idea that local HAEs are
less evolved galaxies than the traditional Lyman break analogs. We are not able
to constrain if the star-formation history in local HAEs is powered by mergers
or by cosmological cold flow accretion. However, in the stacked spectrum, local
HAEs show a strong HeII4686 emission line suggesting a population of young
(<10Myr), hot, massive stars similar to that seen in some Wolf-Rayet galaxies.
Low [NII]/[OIII] line flux ratios imply that local HAEs are inconsistent with
being systems that host bright AGN. Instead, it is highly likely that local
HAEs are galaxies with an elevated ionization parameter, either due to a high
electron density or large escape fraction of hydrogen ionizing photons as in
the case for Wolf-Rayet galaxies.

as an indicator for the location of the resonances, the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) used for determining what kind of resonances are present, and the
inspection of the orbital elements to classify the periodicity. We show that
the 2:1 resonance occurs the most frequently. Among other resonances, the 3:1
resonance is the second most common, and furthermore both 3:2 and 5:3
resonances occur more often than the 4:1 resonance. Moreover, the resonances in
the coplanar CR3BP are classified based on the behaviour of the orbits. We show
that orbital stability is ensured for high values of resonance (i.e., high
ratios) where only a single resonance is present. The resonances attained are
consistent with the previously established resonances for the Solar System,
i.e., specifically, in regards to the asteroid belt. Previous work employed
digital filtering and Lyapunov characteristic exponents to determine
stochasticity of the eccentricity, which is found to be consistent with our
usage of Lyapunov exponents as an alternate approach based on varying the mass
ratio instead of the eccentricity. Our results are expected to be of principal
interest to future studies, including augmentations to observed or proposed
resonances, of extra-solar planets in binary stellar systems.

models, in which the number of predictors is of the same or even larger order
of magnitude than the number of samples. Theory developed in recent years has
coined a paradigm according to which sparsity-promoting regularization is
regarded as a necessity in such setting. Deviating from this paradigm, we show
that non-negativity constraints on the regression coefficients may be similarly
effective as explicit regularization if the design matrix has additional
properties, which are met in several applications of non-negative least squares
(NNLS). We show that for these designs, the performance of NNLS with regard to
prediction and estimation is comparable to that of the lasso. We argue further
that in specific cases, NNLS may have a better $\ell_{\infty}$-rate in
estimation and hence also advantages with respect to support recovery when
combined with thresholding. From a practical point of view, NNLS does not
depend on a regularization parameter and is hence easier to use.

3C305. The X-ray observations reveal the details of the previously known
extended X-ray halo around the radio galaxy. We show using X-ray spectroscopy
that the X-ray emission is consistent with being shock-heated material and can
be modelled with standard collisional-ionization models, rather than being
photoionized by the active nucleus. On this basis, we can make a
self-consistent model in which the X-ray-emitting plasma is responsible for the
depolarization of some regions of the radio emission from the jets and
hotspots, and to place lower and upper limits on the magnetic field strength in
the depolarizing medium. On the assumption that the X-ray-emitting material,
together with the previously-known extended emission-line region and the
outflow in neutral hydrogen, are all being driven out of the centre of the
galaxy by an interaction with the jets, we derive a detailed energy budget for
the radio galaxy, showing that the X-ray-emitting gas dominates the other
phases in terms of its energy content. The power supplied by the jets must be ~
10^43 erg/s.

fraction -- in a mushy layer formed during directional solidification of a
binary alloy in two-dimensions. A large suite of numerical simulations is
combined with scaling analysis in order to study the parametric dependence of
the flow. Stability boundaries are calculated for states of finite-amplitude
convection with chimneys, which for a narrow domain can be interpreted in terms
of a modified Rayleigh number criterion based on the domain width and
mushy-layer permeability. For solidification in a wide domain with multiple
chimneys, it has previously been hypothesised that the chimney spacing will
adjust to optimise the rate of removal of potential energy from the system. For
a wide variety of initial liquid concentration conditions, we consider the
detailed flow structure in this optimal state and derive scaling laws for how
the flow evolves as the strength of convection increases. For moderate
mushy-layer Rayleigh numbers these flow properties support a solute flux that
increases linearly with Rayleigh number. This behaviour does not persist
indefinitely, however, with porosity-dependent flow saturation resulting in
sub-linear growth of the solute flux for sufficiently large Rayleigh numbers.
Finally, we consider the influence of the porosity dependence of permeability,
with a cubic function and a Carmen-Kozeny permeability yielding qualitatively
similar system dynamics and flow profiles for the optimal states.

invention of a number of techniques to lower bound randomized communication
complexity. The majority of these techniques involve properties of large

problem. The only technique that does not quite fit is information complexity,
which has been investigated over the last decade. Here, we connect information
complexity to one of the most powerful ""rectangular"" techniques: the
recently-introduced smooth corruption (or ""smooth rectangle"") bound. We show
that the former subsumes the latter under rectangular input distributions. We
conjecture that this subsumption holds more generally, under arbitrary
distributions, which would resolve the long-standing direct sum question for
randomized communication. As an application, we obtain an optimal $\Omega(n)$
lower bound on the information complexity---under the {\em uniform
distribution}---of the so-called orthogonality problem (ORT), which is in turn
closely related to the much-studied Gap-Hamming-Distance (GHD). The proof of
this bound is along the lines of recent communication lower bounds for GHD, but

well as observational indications of even more massive neutron stars, has
revived the question of the composition of matter at the high densities
prevailing inside neutron-star cores. We study the impact on the maximum
possible neutron-star mass of an ""exotic"" core consisting of non-nucleonic
matter. For this purpose, we study the occurrence of a first-order phase
transition in nucleonic matter. Given the current lack of knowledge of
non-nucleonic matter, we consider the stiffest possible equation of state
subject only to the constraints of causality and thermodynamic stability. The
case of a hadron-quark phase transition is discussed separately. The purely
nucleonic matter is described using a set of unified equations of state that
have been recently developed to permit a consistent treatment of both
homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases. We then compute the mass-radius relation
of cold nonaccreting neutron stars with and without exotic cores from the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. We find that even if there is a
significant softening of the equation of state associated with the actual
transition to an exotic phase, there can still be a stiffening at higher
densities closer to the center of the star that is sufficient to increase the
maximum possible mass. However with quarks the maximum neutron-star mass is
always reduced by assuming that the sound speed is limited by $c/\sqrt{3}$ as
suggested by QCD calculations. In particular, by invoking such a phase
transition, it becomes possible to support PSR J1614$-$2230 with a nucleonic
equation of state that is soft enough to be compatible with the kaon and pion
production in heavy-ion collisions.

always bears the challenge of filtering the environmental state out of raw
sensor readings. While most approaches use heuristics, biology suggests that
there must exist an unsupervised method to construct such filters
automatically. Besides the extraction of environmental states, the filters have
to represent them in a fashion that support modern reinforcement algorithms.
Many popular algorithms use a linear architecture, so one should aim at filters
that have good approximation properties in combination with linear functions.
This thesis wants to propose the unsupervised method slow feature analysis
(SFA) for this task. Presented with a random sequence of sensor readings, SFA
learns a set of filters. With growing model complexity and training examples,
the filters converge against trigonometric polynomial functions. These are
known to possess excellent approximation capabilities and should therfore
support the reinforcement algorithms well. We evaluate this claim on a robot.
The task is to learn a navigational control in a simple environment using the
least square policy iteration (LSPI) algorithm. The only accessible sensor is a
head mounted video camera, but without meaningful filtering, video images are
not suited as LSPI input. We will show that filters learned by SFA, based on a
random walk video of the robot, allow the learned control to navigate
successfully in ca. 80% of the test trials.

of nontrivial Cartesian products of graphs, i.e., whenever it is a subgraph of
a nontrivial Cartesian product graph it is a subgraph of one the factors. A
graph is S-composite if it is not S-prime. Although linear time recognition
algorithms for determining whether a graph is prime or not with respect to the
Cartesian product are known, it remained unknown if a similar result holds also
for the recognition of S-prime and S-composite graphs.
  In this contribution the computational complexity of recognizing S-composite
and S-prime graphs is considered. Klav{\v{z}}ar \emph{et al.} [\emph{Discr.\

whether there exists a path-$k$-coloring for a given graph is shown to be
NP-complete even for $k=2$. This in turn is utilized to show that determining
whether a graph is S-composite is NP-complete and thus, determining whether a

are two N -by-N random orthogonal projections. We relate the joint eigenvalue
distribution of this matrix to the Jacobi matrix ensemble and establish the
universal behavior of eigenvalues for large N. The limiting local behavior of
eigenvalues is governed by the sine kernel in the bulk and by either the Bessel
or the Airy kernel at the edge depending on parameters. We also study an
exceptional case when the local behavior of eigenvalues of P_N + Q_N is not
universal in the usual sense.

resonator arrays. Assuming each resonator is coupled with a two-level system
via a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, we calculate the many-body steady state
behavior of the system under coherent pumping and dissipation. We propose and
analyze the many-body phases using experimentally accessible quantities such as
the total excitation number, the emitted photon spectra and photon coherence
functions for different parameter regimes. In parallel, we also compare and
contrast the expected behavior of this system assuming the local nonlinearity
in the cavities is generated by a generic Kerr effect rather than a
Jaynes-Cummings interaction. We find that the behavior of the experimentally
accessible observables produced by the two models differs for realistic regimes
of interactions even when the corresponding nonlinearities are of similar
strength. We analyze in detail the extra features available in the
Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard (JCH) model originating from the mixed nature of the
excitations and investigate the regimes where the Kerr approximation would
faithfully match the JCH physics. We find that the latter is true for values of
the light-matter coupling and losses beyond the reach of current technology.
Throughout the study we operate in the weak pumping, fully quantum mechanical
regime where approaches such as mean field theory fail, and instead use a
combination of quantum trajectories and the time evolving block decimation
algorithm to compute the relevant steady state observables. In our study we
have assumed small to medium size arrays (from 3 up to 16 sites) and values of
the ratio of coupling to dissipation rate $g/\gamma \sim 20$ which makes our
results implementable with current designs in Circuit QED and with near future
photonic crystal set ups.

doublets and a discrete $S_3\otimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. The irreducible
representation of $S_3$ has a singlet and a doublet, and here we show that the
singlet corresponds to the SM-like Higgs and the two additional $SU(2)$
doublets forming a $S_3$ doublet are inert. In general, in a three scalar
doublet model, with or without $S_3$ symmetry, the diagonalization of the mass
matrices implies arbitrary unitary matrices. However, we show that in our model
these matrices are of the tri-bimaximal type. We also analyzed the scalar mass
spectra and the conditions for the scalar potential is bounded from below at
the tree level. We also discuss some phenomenological consequences of the
model.

double-spin cluster and quasiparticle of triple-spin cluster in a four-spin
quantum model. We constructed a four spin-1/2 model on a triangular star
lattice but added frustrated coupling terms of plaquette quasiparticles. The
eigenstates of this model are maximal entangled quantum states like
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and Yeo-Chua's genuine four-qubit entangled
state. We generalized the conventional definition for quantum statistics of two
elementary particles to composite particle of multispin clusters.
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and Yeo-Chua's genuine four-qubit entangled
state showed different behavior according to this generalized definition. The
quantum statistical behavior of the composite particle of double-spin cluster
is neither boson nor fermion in ground state and some intermediate excited
states. The triple-spin cluster of this model is eigen-quasiparticles. We
perform permutation operation on the eigenstates of triple-spin plaquette
operator according to this generalized definition for quantum statistics of
multi-spin clusters, the statistical matrix of exchanging two triple-spin
quasiparticles is far beyond fermion and boson. The von Neumann entropy of the
triple-spin quasiparticle is also highly nontrivial. These nontrivial quantum
statistical behavior of plaquette quasiparticles is helpful for decoding the
non-abelian anyons in Kitaev honeycomb model.

over the entire vocabulary. However, the vocabulary usually contains many words
that are not relevant in forming the topics. We adopt a variable selection
method widely used in statistical modeling as a dimension reduction tool and
combine it with LDA. In this variable selection model for LDA (vsLDA), topics
are multinomial distributions over a subset of the vocabulary, and by excluding
words that are not informative for finding the latent topic structure of the
corpus, vsLDA finds topics that are more robust and discriminative. We compare
three models, vsLDA, LDA with symmetric priors, and LDA with asymmetric priors,
on heldout likelihood, MCMC chain consistency, and document classification. The
performance of vsLDA is better than symmetric LDA for likelihood and
classification, better than asymmetric LDA for consistency and classification,
and about the same in the other comparisons.
