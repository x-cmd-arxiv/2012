energy of the infalling particles the energy excess must come from the
rotational energy of the black hole and hence this must involve a Penrose
process. However, while the center of mass energy diverges the position of the
collision makes it impossible for energetic particles to escape to infinity.
Following an earlier work on collisional Penrose processes (Piran & Shaham

maximal energy of an escaping particle is only a modest factor above the total
initial energy of the colliding particles. This implies that one shouldn't
expect collisions around a black hole to act as spectacular cosmic

$C^\infty$ functions vanishing at the endpoints. We offer a detailed interplay
between geometric configurations of unions of intervals and a spectral theory
for the corresponding selfadjoint extensions of $\Ds$ and for the associated
unitary groups of local translations. While motivated by scattering theory and
quantum graphs, our present focus is on the Fuglede-spectral pair problem.
Stated more generally, this problem asks for a determination of those bounded
Borel sets $\Omega$ in $\br^k$ such that $L^2(\Omega)$ has an orthogonal basis
of Fourier frequencies (spectrum), i.e., a total set of orthogonal complex
exponentials restricted to $\Omega$.
  In the general case, we characterize Borel sets $\Omega$ having this spectral

translations. The case of $k = 1$ is of special interest, hence the
interval-configurations. We give a characterization of those geometric
interval-configurations which allow Fourier spectra directly in terms of the
selfadjoint extensions of the minimal operator $\Ds$. This allows for a direct
and explicit interplay between geometry and spectra. As an application, we
offer a new look at the Universal Tiling Conjecture and show that the

steady state, but neglect transient dynamics. In this study, we pay attention
to the emergence of community structures in transient process and the effects
of community-based control strategies on epidemic spreading. First, by
normalizing modularity $Q$, we investigate the evolution of community
structures during the transient process, and find that very strong community
structures are induced by rewiring mechanism in the early stage of epidemic
spreading, which remarkably delays the outbreaks of epidemic. Then we study the
effects of control strategies started from different stages on the prevalence.
Both immunization and quarantine strategies indicate that it is not ""the
earlier, the better"" for the implementing of control measures. And the optimal
control effect is obtained if control measures can be efficiently implemented
in the period of strong community structure. For immunization strategy,
immunizing the S nodes on SI links and immunizing S nodes randomly have similar
control effects. Yet for quarantine strategy, quarantining the I nodes on SI
links can yield far better effects than quarantining I nodes randomly. More
significantly, community-based quarantine strategy plays more efficient
performance than community-based immunization strategy. This study may shed new
lights on the forecast and the prevention of epidemic among human population.

magnetic fields has opened access to the study of magnetic phenomena with
atomic resolution at surfaces. In the case of single atoms adsorbed on a
surface, the existence of different magnetic energy levels localized on the
adsorbate is due to the breaking of the rotational invariance of the adsorbate
spin by the interaction with its environment, leading to energy terms in the
meV range. These structures were revealed by STM experiments in IBM Almaden in
the early 2000's for atomic adsorbates on CuN surfaces. The experiments
consisted in the study of the changes in conductance caused by inelastic
tunnelling of electrons (IETS, Inelastic Electron Tunnelling Spectroscopy).
Manganese and Iron adatoms were shown to have different magnetic anisotropies
induced by the substrate. More experiments by other groups followed up, showing
that magnetic excitations could be detected in a variety of systems: e.g.
complex organic molecules showed that their magnetic anistropy was dependent on
the molecular environment, piles of magnetic molecules showed that they
interact via intermolecular exchange interaction, spin waves were excited on
ferromagnetic surfaces and in Mn chains, and magnetic impurities have been
analyzed on semiconductors. These experiments brought up some intriguing
questions: the efficiency of magnetic excitations was very high, the
excitations could or could not involve spin flip of the exciting electron and
singular-like behavior was sometimes found at the excitation thresholds. These
facts called for extended theoretical analysis; perturbation theories,
sudden-approximation approaches and a strong coupling scheme successfully
explained most of the magnetic inelastic processes. In addition, many-body
approaches were also used to decipher the interplay between inelas

iterative cascaded DF stages for mitigating the deleterious effects of error

between the MMSE achieved by the analyzed DF structures, including the novel

self-consistently as a third component. Herein, two different runs with
relative pickup ion density of 25% and 55% are presented in this paper. Present
preliminary results show that: (1) in the low percentage (25%) pickup ion case,
the shock front is nonstationary. During the evolution of this perpendicular
shock, a nonstationary foot resulting from the reflected solar wind ions is
formed in front of the old ramp, and its amplitude becomes larger and larger.
At last, the nonstationary foot grows up into a new ramp and exceeds the old
one. Such a nonstationary process can be formed periodically. hen the new ramp
begins to be formed in front of the old ramp, the Hall term mainly contributed
by the solar wind ions becomes more and more important. The electric field Ex
is dominated by the Hall term when the new ramp exceeds the old one.
Furthermore, an extended and stationary foot in pickup ion gyro-scale is
located upstream of the nonstationary/self-reforming region within the shock
front, and is always dominated by the Lorentz term contributed by the pickup
ions; (2) in the high percentage (55%) pickup ion case, the amplitude of the
stationary foot is increased as expected. One striking point is that the
nonstationary region of the shock front evidenced by the self-reformation
disappears. Instead, a stationary extended foot dominated by Lorentz term
contributed by the pickup ions, and a tationary ramp dominated by Hall term
contributed by the solar wind ions are clearly evidenced. The significance of
the cross electric field on ion dynamics is also discussed.

systems with a homogeneous rational potential $V(\vq)$. Strong necessary
conditions for the integrability of such systems were obtained by an analysis
of differential Galois group of variational equations along certain particular
solutions. These conditions have the form of arithmetic restrictions putted on
eigenvalues of Hessian $V""(\vd)$ calculated at a non-zero solution $\vd$ of
equation $\grad V(\vd)=\vd$. Such solutions are called proper Darboux points.
It was recently proved that for generic polynomial homogeneous potentials there
exist universal relations between eigenvalues of Hessians of the potential
taken at all proper Darboux points. The question about the existence of such
relations for rational potentials seems to be hard. One of the reason of this
fact is the presence of indeterminacy points of the potential and its gradient.
Nevertheless, for two degrees of freedom we prove that such relation exists.
This result is important because it allows to show that the set of admissible
values for eigenvalues of Hessian at a proper Darboux point for potentials
satisfying necessary conditions for the integrability is finite. In turn, it
gives a tool for classification of integrable rational potentials. Also, quite
recently, it was shoved that for polynomial homogeneous potentials additional
necessary conditions for the integrability can be deduced from the existence of
improper Darboux points, i.e., points $\vd$ which are non-zero solution of
equation $\grad V(\vd)=\vzero$. These new conditions have also the form of
arithmetic restrictions imposed on eigenvalues of $V""(\vd)$. In this paper we
prove that for rational potentials improper Darboux points give the same

exchange as well as dipole-dipole interactions to calculate the magnon spectrum

space have received much attention due to various applications in Anti-de

behavior of quark-gluon plasma to superconductor. Crucial to the physics on the
dual field theory is the fact that when embedded in string theory, black holes
in the bulk may become vulnerable to instability caused by brane
pair-production. Since dilaton arises naturally in the context of string
theory, we study the effect of coupling dilaton to Maxwell field on the
stability of flat charged AdS black holes. In particular, we study the
stability of Gao-Zhang black holes, which are locally asymptotically anti-de
Sitter. We find that for dilaton coupling parameter $\alpha$ > 1, flat black
holes are stable against brane pair production, however for 0 < $\alpha$ < 1,
the black holes eventually become unstable as the amount of electrical charges
is increased. Such instability however, behaves somewhat differently from that
of flat Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes. In addition, we prove that the
Seiberg-Witten action of charged dilaton AdS black hole of Gao-Zhang type with
flat event horizon (at least in 5-dimension) is always logarithmically

curves with unprecedented accuracy. We find that above ~5 keV, the modulation
depth decreases with the increasing energy, which is consistent with the
modulation being caused by both bound-free absorption and Compton scattering in
the stellar wind of the donor, with minima corresponding to the highest optical
depth, which occurs around the superior conjunction. We find a decrease of the
depth below ~3 keV, which appears to be due to re-emission of the absorbed
continuum by the wind in soft X-ray lines. Based on the shape of the folded
light curves, any X-ray contribution from the jet in Cyg X-3, which emits
gamma-rays detected at energies >0.1 GeV in soft spectral states, is found to
be minor up to ~100 keV. This implies the presence of a rather sharp low-energy
break in the jet MeV-range spectrum. We also calculate phase-resolved RXTE

value of the leptonic mixing angle theta_13 and CP-violation in neutrino
oscillation experiments. This is an application of the well-established method
of Bayesian model selection, of which we give a concise and pedagogical
overview. When comparing the hypothesis theta_13 = 0 with hypotheses where
theta_13 > 0 using global data but excluding the recent reactor measurements,
we obtain only a weak preference for a non-zero theta_13, even though the
significance is over 3 sigma. We then add the reactor measurements one by one
and show how the evidence for theta_13 > 0 quickly increases. When including
the Double Chooz, Daya Bay, and RENO data, the evidence becomes overwhelming
with a posterior probability of the hypothesis theta_13 = 0 below 10^-11 .
Owing to the small amount of information on the CP-phase delta, very similar
evidences are obtained for the CP-conserving and CP-violating hypotheses.
Hence, there is, not unexpectedly, neither evidence for nor against leptonic
CP-violation. However, when future experiments aiming to search for
CP-violation have started taking data, this question will be of great
importance and the method described here can be used as an important complement
to standard analyses.

$R^h$-recurrent Finsler space and consircularly recurrent Finsler space. The
defining properties of these spaces are formulated in terms of the first
curvature tensor of Cartan connection. The following three results constitute
the main object of the present paper: 1. A concircularly flat Finsler manifold
is necessarily of constant curvature (Theorem A); 2. Every $R^h$-recurrent
Finsler manifold is concirculaly recurrent with the same recurrence form
(Theorem B); 3. Every horizontally integrable concircularly recurrent Finsler
manifold is $R^h$-recurrent with the same recurrence form (Theorem C). The

e^{-r}r^{\gamma}$ were studied using the recently developed critical parameter
technique. The particular cases of $\gamma=0$ and $\gamma=-1$ yield,
respectively, the exponential and Yukawa potentials widely used in the atomic,
molecular and nuclear physics. We found different behavior of the energy levels
of this potential for three different ranges of the value of $\gamma$. For
$\gamma\geq0$ it was found that the energy of bound states with the same
principal quantum number $N$ decreases with increasing angular momentum $\ell$.
The Gaussian and Woods-Saxon potentials also show this behavior. On the
contrary, for $-2\leq\gamma\leq-1$ increasing $\ell$ gives a higher energy,
resembling the Hulthen potential. However, a potential with $-1<\gamma<0$
possesses mixed properties, which give rise to several interesting results. For
one, the order of energy levels with different quantum numbers is not preserved
when varying the parameter $\beta$. This leads to a quantum degeneracy of the
states, and in fact, for a given value of $\gamma$ we can find the values
$\beta_{thr}$ for which two energy levels with different quantum numbers
coincide. Another interesting phenomena is the possibility, for some values of
$\gamma$ in this range, for two new energy levels with different quantum
numbers to appear simultaneously when $\beta$ reaches their common critical
value.

collisions that produce two other particles. We show that for a generic dirty

mass of product particles which can be detected at infinity. As a result, the
positive energy gain is possible but is quite modest. It mainly depends on two

results suggest astrophysical limits on the possibility of observation of the

the photometric annual, seasonal, and rotational variability of the thermal
emission of the Earth to determine which properties can be inferred from the
point-like signal. We find that the analysis of the time series allows us to
determine the 24 hr rotational period of the planet for most observing
geometries, due to large warm and cold areas, identified with geographic
features, which appear consecutively in the observer's planetary view. However,
the effects of global-scale meteorology can effectively mask the rotation for
several days at a time. We also find that orbital time series exhibit a
seasonal modulation, whose amplitude depends strongly on the latitude of the
observer but weakly on its ecliptic longitude. As no systematic difference of
brightness temperature is found between the dayside and nightside, the phase
variations of the Earth in the infrared range are negligible. Finally, we also
conclude that the phase variation of a spatially unresolved Earth-Moon system
