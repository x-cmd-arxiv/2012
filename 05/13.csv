hydrodynamics simulations covering a period of 3 s after the formation of a
protoneutron star in a core-collapse supernova explosion. Our results show that
a treatment of charged-current neutrino interactions in hot and dense matter as
suggested by Reddy et al. [Phys. Rev. D 58, 013009 (1998)] has a strong impact
on the luminosities and spectra of the emitted neutrinos. When compared with
simulations that neglect mean field effects on the neutrino opacities, we find
that the luminosities of all neutrino flavors are reduced while the spectral
differences between electron neutrino and antineutrino are increased. Their
magnitude depends on the equation of state and in particular on the symmetry
energy at sub-nuclear densities. These modifications reduce the
proton-to-nucleon ratio of the outflow, increasing slightly their entropy. They
are expected to have a substantial impact on the nucleosynthesis in
neutrino-driven winds, even though they do not result in conditions that favor
an r-process. Contrarily to previous findings, our simulations show that the
spectra of electron neutrinos remain substantially different from those of
other (anti)neutrino flavors during the entire deleptonization phase of the
protoneutron star. The obtained luminosity and spectral changes are also
expected to have important consequences for neutrino flavor oscillations and
neutrino detection on Earth.

a new level, where conversation across continents can be much cheaper & faster.
However, as IP networks are not designed for real-time applications, the
network impairments such as packet loss, jitter and delay have a severe impact
on speech quality. The playout buffer at the receiver side is used to
compensate jitter at a trade-off of delay and loss. We found the

investigate to the understanding how network impairments and existing adaptive

type firstly proposed in \cite{Grad}. The Grad's moment method was originally
developed for the Boltzmann equation. In \cite{Fan_new}, a regularization
method for the Grad's moment system of the Boltzmann equation was proposed to
achieve the globally hyperbolicity so that the local well-posedness of the
moment system is attained. With the moment expansion of the Wigner function,
the drift term in the Wigner equation has exactly the same moment
representation as in the Boltzmann equation, thus the regularization in
\cite{Fan_new} applies. The moment expansion of the nonlocal Wigner potential
term in the Wigner equation is turned to be a linear source term, which can
only induce very mild growth of the solution. As the result, the local
well-posedness of the regularized moment system for the Wigner equation remains
as for the Boltzmann equation.

which we see in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Therefore the
last phases of inflation must be embedded within a beyond the Standard Model
(SM) sector where the inflaton can directly excite the SM quarks and leptons.
In this paper we consider two inflaton candidates LLe and udd whose decay can
naturally excite all the relevant degrees of freedom besides thermalizing the
lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) during and after reheating. In
particular, we present the regions of the parameter space which can yield
successful inflation with the right temperature anisotropy in the CMB, the
observed relic density for the neutralino LSP, and the recent Higgs mass
constraints from LHC within the MSSM with non-universal Higgs masses --
referred to as the NUHM2 model. We found that in most scenarios, the LSP seems
strongly mass degenerated with the next to lightest LSP (NLSP) and the
branching ratio B_s -> mu^+ mu^- very close to the present bound, thus leading
to falsifiable predictions. Also the dark matter interactions with XENON nuclei
would fall within the projected range for the XENON1T experiment. In the case
of a positive signal of low scale supersymmetry at the LHC, one would be able
to potentially pin down the inflaton mass by using the associated values for
the mass of the stau, the stop and the neutralino.

At each time point, a sample of individuals provide responses to a set of

there tends to be abundant missing data and the variables being measured may
change over time. At each time point, one obtains a large sparse contingency

hybridization parameter selection for different recommendation focuses. In this
article, based on a user-item bipartite network, we propose a data
characteristic based algorithm, by relating the hybridization parameter to the
data characteristic. Different from previous hybrid methods, the present
algorithm adaptively assign the optimal parameter specifically for each
individual items according to the correlation between the algorithm and the
item degrees. Compared with a highly accurate pure method, and a hybrid method
which is outstanding in both the recommendation accuracy and the diversity, our
method shows a remarkably promotional effect on the long-standing challenging
problem of the cold start, as well as the recommendation diversity, while
simultaneously keeps a high overall recommendation accuracy. Even compared with
an improved hybrid method which is highly efficient on the cold start problem,
the proposed method not only further improves the recommendation accuracy of
the cold items, but also enhances the recommendation diversity. Our work might
provide a promising way to better solving the personal recommendation from the
perspective of relating algorithms with dataset properties.

players having good reputations is a mechanism for cooperation in relatively
large populations subjected to social dilemma situations. When the population
has group structure, as is often found in social networks, players in
experiments are considered to show behavior that deviates from existing
theoretical models of indirect reciprocity. First, players often show ingroup
favoritism (i.e., cooperation only within the group) rather than full
cooperation (i.e., cooperation within and across groups), even though the
latter is Pareto efficient. Second, in general, humans approximate outgroup
members' personal characteristics, presumably including the reputation used for
indirect reciprocity, by a single value attached to the group. Humans use such
a stereotypic approximation, a phenomenon known as outgroup homogeneity in
social psychology. I propose a model of indirect reciprocity in populations
with group structure to examine the possibility of ingroup favoritism and full
cooperation. In accordance with outgroup homogeneity, I assume that players
approximate outgroup members' personal reputations by a single reputation value
attached to the group. I show that ingroup favoritism and full cooperation are
stable under different social norms (i.e., rules for assigning reputations)
such that they do not coexist in a single model. If players are forced to
consistently use the same social norm for assessing different types of
interactions (i.e., ingroup versus outgroup interactions), only full
cooperation survives. The discovered mechanism is distinct from any form of
group selection. The results also suggest potential methods for reducing
ingroup bias to shift the equilibrium from ingroup favoritism to full
cooperation.

tower-based cellular networks, mobile users will need to be actively pushed
onto the more lightly loaded tiers (corresponding to, e.g., pico and
femtocells), even if they offer a lower instantaneous SINR than the macrocell
base station (BS). Optimizing a function of the long-term rates for each user
requires (in general) a massive utility maximization problem over all the SINRs
and BS loads. On the other hand, an actual implementation will likely resort to
a simple biasing approach where a BS in tier j is treated as having its SINR
multiplied by a factor A_j>=1, which makes it appear more attractive than the
heavily-loaded macrocell. This paper bridges the gap between these approaches
through several physical relaxations of the network-wide optimal association
problem, whose solution is NP hard. We provide a low-complexity distributed
algorithm that converges to a near-optimal solution with a theoretical
performance guarantee, and we observe that simple per-tier biasing loses
surprisingly little, if the bias values A_j are chosen carefully. Numerical

Motivated by this, we here study the dispersion of gyrotactic algae in laminar

analytical swimming dispersion theory of Bees and Croze (2010). Time-resolved
dispersion measures are evaluated as functions of the Peclet and Reynolds
numbers in upwelling and downwelling flows. For laminar flows, DNS results are
compared with theory using competing descriptions of biased swimming cells in
shear flow. Excellent agreement is found for predictions that employ
generalized-Taylor-dispersion. The results highlight peculiarities of
gyrotactic swimmer dispersion relative to passive tracers. In laminar
downwelling flow the cell distribution drifts in excess of the mean flow,
increasing in magnitude with Peclet number. The cell effective axial
diffusivity increases and decreases with Peclet number (for tracers it merely
increases). In turbulent flows, gyrotactic effects are weaker, but discernable
and manifested as non-zero drift. These results should significantly impact
photobioreactor design.

determined by the dark matter asymmetry generated through the same mechanism as
leptogenesis when the dark matter was the Dirac fermion. After efficient dark
matter annihilation processes have frozen out, a phase transition of a scalar
field takes place and generates Majorana mass terms to turn the dark matter
particle into the Majorana fermion. In order to address this scenario in
detail, we propose two simple models. The first one is based on the Standard
Model (SM) gauge group and the dark matter originates the $SU(2)_L$ doublet
Dirac fermion, analogous to the Higgsino-like neutralino in supersymmetric
models. We estimate the spin-independent/dependent elastic scattering cross
sections of this late-time Majorana dark matter with a proton and find the
possibility to discover it by the direct and/or indirect dark matter search

is similar to the so-called Higgs portal dark matter scenario, the

X-ray binaries. Based on the transient nature of the X-ray emission, the
detection of pulsations, and the early-type companion, it has been classified
as a Be X-ray binary (Be/XRB). However, the flaring activity covering a large
fraction of a giant outburst is somehow peculiar. Our goal is to investigate
the multiwavelength variability of the high-mass X-ray binary MXB 0656-072. We
carried out optical spectroscopy and analysed all RXTE archive data, performing
a detailed X-ray-colour, spectral, and timing analysis of both normal (type-I)
and giant (type-II) outbursts from MXB 0656-072 This is the first detailed
analysis of the optical counterpart in the classification region (4000-5000 A).
From the strength and ratio of the elements and ions, we derive an O9.5Ve
spectral type, in agreement with previous classification. This confirms its Be
nature. The characterisation of the Be/XRB system relies on Balmer lines in
emission in the optical spectra, long-term X-ray variability, and the orbital
period vs. spin period and EW(H\alpha) relation. The peculiar feature that
distinguishes the type-II outburst is flaring activity, which occurs during the
whole outburst peak, before a smoother decay. We interpret it in terms of
magneto-hydrodynamic instability. Colour and spectral analysis reveal a
hardening of the spectrum as the flux increases. We explored the aperiodic
X-ray variability of the system for the first time, finding a correlation of
the central frequency and rms of the main timing component with luminosity,
which extends up to a ""saturation"" flux of 1E-8 erg/cm^2/s. A correlation
between timing and spectral parameters was also found, pointing to an
interconnection between the two physical regions responsible for both
phenomenologies.

i.e. transition from microscopic MEs to their macroscopic counterparts, is one
of the main steps in electrodynamics of materials. In spite of the fundamental
importance of the averaging procedure, it is quite rarely properly discussed in
university courses and respective books; up to now there is no established
consensus about how the averaging procedure has to be performed. In this paper
we show that there are some basic principles for the averaging procedure
(irrespective to what type of material is studied) which have to be satisfied.
Any homogenization model has to be consistent with the basic principles. In
case of absence of this correlation of a particular model with the basic
principles the model could not be accepted as a credible one. Another goal of
this paper is to establish the averaging procedure for bulk MM, which is rather
close to the case of compound materials but should include magnetic response of
the inclusions and their clusters. In the vast majority of cases the
consideration of bulk materials means that we consider propagation of an
electromagnetic wave far from the interfaces, where the eigenwave in the medium
has been already formed and stabilized. In other words, in this paper we
consider the possible eigenmodes, which could exist in the equivalent
homogenized media, and the necessary math apparatus for an adequate description

can dissociate and leave behind charge patches on the surface. Although the
charges are distributed heterogeneously on the surface, most of the theoretical
models treat them as homogeneous. For overall non-neutral surfaces, the
assumption of surface charge homogeneity is rather reasonable, since the
leading terms of two such interacting surfaces depend on the non-zero average
charge. However, for overall neutral surfaces, the nature of the surface charge
distribution is crucial in determining the inter-surface interaction. In the
present work we study the interaction between two charged surfaces across an
aqueous solution for several charge distributions. The analysis is preformed
within the framework of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann theory. For periodic
charge distributions the interaction is found to be repulsive at small
separations, unless the two surface distributions are completely out-of-phase
with respect to each other. For quenched random charge distributions we find
that due to the presence of the ionic solution in between the surfaces, the
inter-surface repulsion dominates over the attraction in the linear regime of
the Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The effect of quenched charge heterogeneity is
found to be particularly substantial in the case of large charge domains.

What will be the impact of such large shocks on Italian healthcare finances? An
empirical model for estimating the impact of the crisis on Italian public
healthcare expenditure is presented. Based on data from epidemiological studies
related to past economic crisis, the financial impact is estimated to be
comparable to the healthcare deficit of Italian Regions (EUR 3-5 bn). According
to current agreements between the Italian State and its Regions, public funding
of regional National Health Services (NHSs) is limited to the amount of
regional deficit and is subject to previous assessment of strict adherence to
constraint on regional healthcare balance-sheet. Those Regions that will fail
to comply to balance-sheet constraints will suffer cuts on their public NHS
financing with foreseeable bad consequences for the health of their regional
population. The current crisis could be a good timing for a large-scale
re-engineering of the Italian NHS, probably the only way for
self-sustainability of the public system.

distortion which, at lowest order, is a y-type distortion, indistinguishable
from the thermal y-type distortion produced by the scattering of CMB photons by
hot electrons residing in clusters of galaxies. This process occurs in the
radiation-pressure dominated early Universe, when the primordial perturbations
excite standing sound waves on entering the sound horizon. Photons from
different phases of the sound waves, having different temperatures, diffuse
through the electron-baryon plasma and mix together. This diffusion, with the
length defined by Thomson scattering, dissipates sound waves and creates
spectral distortions in the CMB. Of the total dissipated energy, 2/3 raises the
average temperature of the blackbody part of spectrum, while 1/3 creates a
distortion of y-type. It is well known that at redshifts 10^5< z< 2x10^6,
comptonization rapidly transforms y-distortions into a Bose-Einstein spectrum.
The chemical potential of the Bose-Einstein spectrum is again 1/3 the value we
would get if all the dissipated energy was injected into a blackbody spectrum
but no extra photons were added. We study the mixing of blackbody spectra,
emphasizing the thermodynamic point of view, and identifying spectral
distortions with entropy creation. This allows us to obtain the main results
connected with the dissipation of sound waves in the early Universe in a very
simple way. We also show that mixing of blackbodies in general, and dissipation
of sound waves in particular, leads to creation of entropy.

$\mu$, namely $\mu \geq 3.553$, and we conjecture that indeed $\mu=3.627$, the
parameter for the binary erasure channel.

scale-free random graphs generated by the configuration model with degree
distribution exponent $2<\gamma<3$. Degree heterogeneity increases the presence
of triangles in the network up to levels that compare to those found in many
real networks even for extremely large nets. We also find that for values of
$\gamma \approx 2$, clustering is virtually size independent and, at the same
time, becomes a {\it de facto} non self-averaging topological property. This
implies that a single instance network is not representative of the ensemble
even for very large network sizes.

those between young and small firms and large and MNEs firms for knowledge
exploration and/or exploitation, requires the adoption of a coopetitive
framework which consider both collaboration and competition. We draw upon the
literature on asymmetric R&D collaboration and coopetition to propose a
mathematical model for the coopetitive games which is particularly suitable for
exploring asymmetric R&D alliances.

$\mathrm{conv}_2(X)$ of the Banach space $% X$.

means of symplectic gradient-holonomic and differential-algebraic tools. A
compatible pair of polynomial Poissonian structures, Lax type representation
and related infinite hierarchies of conservation laws are constructed. A new
bi-infinite hierarchy of completely Lax type integrable Riemann type
hydrodynamical systems is proposed. It is demonstrated that at s=3 the
corresponding Riemann type hydrodynamical equation is related with the
Degasperis-Processi equation, whose reduction gives rise to the
Ostrovsky-Vakhnenko equation.
