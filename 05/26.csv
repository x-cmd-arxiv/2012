in a dense nuclear medium is studied in the framework of deep-inelastic
scattering (DIS) off a large nucleus. Power counting arguments based on the
Glauber improved Soft-Collinear-Effective-Theory are used to identify the class
of leading power corrections to the process of a single parton traversing the
extended medium without emission. It turns out that the effect of longitudinal
drag and diffusion (often referred to as straggling) is as important as
transverse scattering, when relying solely on power counting arguments. With
the inclusion of momentum exchanges in both transverse and longitudinal
directions between the traversing hard parton and the constituents of the
medium, we derive a differential equation for the time (or distance) evolution
of the hard parton momentum distribution. Keeping up to the second order in a
momentum gradient expansion, this equation describes in-medium evolution of
hard jets which experience longitudinal drag and diffusion plus the transverse
broadening caused by multiple scatterings from the medium.

allows the operator on the ground to select the interest object for the UAV to

Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of the large ($\sim$15000 AU) putative
circumstellar disk associated with the O-type protostar NGC 7538 S.
Observations of the continuum resolve this putative circumstellar disk into
five compact sources, with sizes $\sim$ 3000 AU and masses $\sim10 M_\odot$.
This confirm the results of recent millimeter observations made with CARMA/BIMA
towards this object. However, we find that from most of these compact sources
eject collimated bipolar outflows, revealed by our silicon monoxide (SiO {\it
J}=5-4) observations and confirm that these sources have a (proto)stellar
nature. All outflows are perpendicular to the large and rotating dusty
structure. We propose therefore that, rather than being a single massive
circumstellar disk, NGC 7538 S could be instead a large and massive contracting
or rotating filament that is fragmenting at scales of 0.1 to 0.01 pc to form
several B-type stars, via the standard process involving outflows and disks. As
in recent high spatial resolution studies of dusty filaments, our observations
also suggest that thermal pressure does not seem to be sufficient to support
the filament, so that either additional support needs to be invoked, or else
the filament must be in the process of collapsing. An SPH numerical simulation
of the formation of a molecular cloud by converging warm neutral medium flows
produces contracting filaments whose dimensions and spacings between the stars
forming within them, as well as their column densities, strongly resemble those
observed in the filament reported here.

the existence of a topologically non-trivial thermal circle leaves open the
possibility that a gauge flux can pierce this circle --- i.e., that a
non-trivial Wilson line (or equivalently a non-zero chemical potential) might
be involved in the finite-temperature extension. In this paper, we concentrate
on the zero-temperature heterotic and Type I strings in ten dimensions, and
survey the possible Wilson lines which might be introduced in their
finite-temperature extensions. We find a rich structure of possible thermal
string theories, some of which even have non-traditional Hagedorn temperatures,
and we demonstrate that these new thermal string theories can be interpreted as
extrema of a continuous thermal free-energy ""landscape"". Our analysis also
uncovers a unique finite-temperature extension of the heterotic SO(32) and
$E_8\times E_8$ strings which involves a non-trivial Wilson line, but which ---
like the traditional finite-temperature extension without Wilson lines --- is
metastable in this thermal landscape.

cascades induced by gamma-rays and/or cosmic rays (CRs) to the diffuse
gamma-ray background (DGB) in view of the latest Fermi data. We identify a
possible VHE Excess from the fact that the Fermi data are well above
expectations for an attenuated power law, and show that cascades induced by VHE
gamma rays (above ~10 TeV) and/or VHECRs (below ~10^19 eV) may significantly
contribute to the DGB above ~100 GeV. The relevance of the cascades is also
motivated by the intergalactic cascade interpretations of extreme TeV blazars
such as 1ES 0229+200, which suggest very hard intrinsic spectra. This
strengthens the importance of future detailed VHE DGB measurements. Then, more
conservatively, we derive general constraints on the cosmic energy budget of
high-energy gamma rays and neutrinos based on recent Fermi and IceCube
observations of extragalactic background radiation. We demonstrate that these
multi-messenger constraints are useful and the neutrino limit is very powerful
for VHE/UHE hadronic sources. Furthermore, we show the importance of
constraints from individual source surveys by future imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes such as Cherenkov Telescope Array, and demonstrate that
the cascade hypothesis for the VHE DGB can be tested by searching for distant

the transverse-momentum range of 4 GeV/c < p_T < 22 GeV/c, using a statistical
method to subtract decay photons from the inclusive-photon sample. The
direct-photon nuclear-modification factor R_AA was calculated as a function of
p_T for different Au+Au collision centralities using the measured p+p
direct-photon spectrum and compared to theoretical predictions. R_AA was found
to be consistent with unity for all centralities over the entire measured p_T

initial-direct-photon production due to modified-parton-distribution functions
in Au and the different isospin composition of the nuclei, predict a modest
change of R_AA from unity and are consistent with the data. Models with
compensating effects of the quark-gluon plasma on high-energy photons, such as
suppression of jet-fragmentation photons and induced-photon bremsstrahlung from
partons traversing the medium, are also consistent with this measurement.

emission from the young binary system Haro 6-10. Haro 6-10 lies in the Taurus
molecular cloud and contains a visible T Tauri star with an infrared companion
1.3"" north. Using the Very Long Baseline Array, we obtained five observations
spanning 3 months and derived absolute positions for 20 distinct maser spots.
Three of the masers can be traced over 3 or more epochs, enabling us to extract
absolute proper motions and tangential velocities. We deduce that the masers
represent one side of a bipolar outflow that lies nearly in the plane of the
sky with an opening angle of ~45\deg. They are located within 50 mas of the
southern component of the binary, the visible T Tauri star Haro 6-10S. The mean
position angle on the sky of the maser proper motions (~220\deg) suggests they
are related to the previously observed giant Herbig-Haro (HH) flow which
includes HH410, HH411, HH412, and HH184A-E. A previously observed HH jet and
extended radio continuum emission (mean position angle of ~190\deg) must also
originate in the vicinity of Haro6-10S and represent a second, distinct outflow
in this region. We propose that a yet unobserved companion within 150 mas of
Haro6-10S is responsible for the giant HH/maser outflow while the visible star
is associated with the HH jet. Despite the presence of H_2 emission in the
spectrum of the northern component of the binary, Haro6-10N, none of
outflows/jets can be tied directly to this young stellar object.

no extracellular fixed-nitrogen, consistent with recent experimental studies of

years. The same frequencies are found in proxy and instrumental global surface
temperature records since 1650 and 1850, respectively and in several planetary
and solar records. Thus, the aurora records reveal a physical link between
climate change and astronomical oscillations. Likely, there exists a modulation
of the cosmic ray flux reaching the Earth and/or of the electric properties of
the ionosphere. The latter, in turn, have the potentiality of modulating the
global cloud cover that ultimately drives the climate oscillations through
albedo oscillations. In particular, a quasi 60-year large cycle is quite
evident since 1650 in all climate and astronomical records herein studied,
which also include an historical record of meteorite fall in China from 619 to
1943. These findings support the thesis that climate oscillations have an
astronomical origin. We show that a harmonic constituent model based on the
major astronomical frequencies revealed in the aurora records is able to
forecast with a reasonable accuracy the decadal and multidecadal temperature
oscillations from 1950 to 2010 using the temperature data before 1950, and vice
versa. The existence of a natural 60-year modulation of the global surface
temperature induced by astronomical mechanisms, by alone, would imply that at
least 60-70% of the warming observed since 1970 has been naturally induced.
Moreover, the climate may stay approximately stable during the next decades
because the 60-year cycle has entered in its cooling phase.

study of the Galactic supernova remnant G292.2-0.5, associated with the
high-magnetic field radio pulsar J1119-6127, using Chandra and XMM-Newton. The
high-resolution X-ray images reveal a partially limb-brightened morphology in
the west, with diffuse emission concentrated towards the interior of the
remnant unlike the complete shell-like morphology observed at radio
wavelengths. The spectra of most of the diffuse emission regions within the
remnant are best described by a thermal+non-thermal model. The thermal
component is described by a plane-parallel, non-equilibrium ionization plasma
model with a temperature ranging from 1.3 keV in the western side of the
remnant to 2.3 keV in the east, a column density increasing from 1.0e22 cm^-2
in the west to 1.8e22 cm^-2 in the east, and a low ionization timescale ranging
from 5.7e9 cm^-3 s in the SNR interior to 3.6e10 cm^-3 s in the western side -
suggestive of expansion of a young remnant in a low-density medium. The spatial
and spectral differences across the SNR are consistent with the presence of a
dark cloud in the eastern part of the SNR, absorbing the soft X-ray emission.
The spectra from some of the regions also show slightly enhanced metal
abundances from Ne, Mg and Si, hinting at the first evidence for ejecta heated
by the reverse shock. Comparing our inferred metal abundances to core-collapse
nucleosynthesis models yields, we estimate a high progenitor mass of ~30 solar
mass suggesting a type Ib/c supernova. We confirm the presence of non-thermal
hard X-ray emission from regions close to the pulsar. We estimate an SNR age
range between 4.2 kyr (free expansion phase) and 7.1 kyr (Sedov phase), a
factor of a few higher than the measured pulsar's age upper limit of 1.9 kyr.

modified gravity scenarios where a change of regime appears at acceleration
scales $a<a_{0}$ have been proposed. This modified regime at $a<a_{0}$ will
generically be characterised by equilibrium velocities which become independent
of distance. Here we identify a critical test in this debate and we propose its
application to samples of wide binary stars. Since for $1 M_{\odot}$ systems
the acceleration drops below $a_{0}$ at scales of around 7000 AU, a statistical
survey of wide binaries with relative velocities and separations reaching
$10^{4}$ AU and beyond should prove useful to the above debate. We apply the
proposed test to the best currently available data. Results show a constant
upper limit to the relative velocities in wide binaries which is independent of
separation for over three orders of magnitude, in analogy with galactic flat
rotation curves in the same $a<a_{0}$ acceleration regime. Our results are
suggestive of a breakdown of Kepler's third law beyond $a \approx a_{0}$
scales, in accordance with generic predictions of modified gravity theories
designed not to require any dark matter at galactic scales and beyond.

3.5 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at 1.5 GHz and 6 GHz, respectively. New disk-halo
features have been detected, among them two at 1.5 GHz that appear as loops in
projection. We present the first 1.5 GHz spectral index map of NGC 4631 to be
formed from a single wide-band observation in a single array configuration.
This map represents tangent slopes to the intensities within the band centered
at 1.5 GHz, rather than fits across widely separated frequencies as has been
done in the past and is also the highest spatial resolution spectral index map
yet presented for this galaxy. The average spectral index in the disk is
$\bar\alpha_{1.5 GHz}\,=\,-0.84\,\pm\,0.05$ indicating that the emission is
largely non-thermal, but a small global thermal contribution is sufficient to
explain a positive curvature term in the spectral index over the band. Two
specific star forming regions have spectral indices that are consistent with
thermal emission. Polarization results (uncorrected for internal Faraday
rotation) are consistent with previous observations and also reveal some new
features. On broad scales, we find strong support for the notion that magnetic

negative quadratic term and alternating signs in the nonlinear terms which
correctly reproduces the correlation functions of the singlet sector. Assuming
the validity of the connection between O(N) collective fields and higher spin

double analytic continuation, leading to the dS/CFT correspondence proposed by
Anninos, Hartman and Strominger. The bi-local construction gives a map into the
bulk of de Sitter space-time. Its geometric pseudospin-representation provides
a framework for quantization and definition of the Hilbert space. We argue that
this is consistent with finite N grassmanian constraints, establishing the
bi-local representation as a nonperturbative framework for quantization of
Higher Spin Gravity in de Sitter space.

dimensional reduction of Schroedinger space-times with critical exponent z=0.
The latter space-times are asymptotically AdS solutions of AdS gravity coupled
to an axion-dilaton system and can be uplifted to solutions of type IIB
supergravity. This basic observation is used to perform holographic
renormalization for 4-dimensional asymptotically z=2 locally Lifshitz
space-times by Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction of the corresponding
problem of holographic renormalization for 5-dimensional asymptotically locally
AdS space-times coupled to an axion-dilaton system. We can thus define and
characterize a 4-dimensional asymptotically locally z=2 Lifshitz space-time in
terms of 5-dimensional AdS boundary data. In this setup the 4-dimensional
structure of the Fefferman-Graham expansion and the structure of the
counterterm action, including the scale anomaly, will be discussed. We find
that for asymptotically locally z=2 Lifshitz space-times obtained in this way
there are two anomalies each with their own associated nonzero central charge.
Both anomalies follow from the Scherk--Schwarz dimensional reduction of the
5-dimensional conformal anomaly of AdS gravity coupled to an axion-dilaton
system. Together they make up an action that is of the Horava-Lifshitz type
with nonzero potential term for z=2 conformal gravity.

discoveries of massive galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect,
providing a new window for studying cluster astrophysics and cosmology. Many of
the newly discovered, SZ-selected clusters contain hot intracluster plasma (kTe
> 10 keV) and exhibit disturbed morphology, indicative of frequent mergers with
large peculiar velocity (v > 1000 km s^{-1}). It is well-known that for the
interpretation of the SZ signal from hot, moving galaxy clusters, relativistic
corrections must be taken into account, and in this work, we present a fast and
accurate method for computing these effects. Our approach is based on an
alternative derivation of the Boltzmann collision term which provides new
physical insight into the sources of different kinematic corrections in the
scattering problem. This allows us to obtain a clean separation of kinematic
and scattering terms which differs from previous works. We briefly mention
additional complications connected with kinematic effects that should be
considered when interpreting future SZ data for individual clusters. One of the
main outcomes of this work is SZpack, a numerical library which allows very
fast and precise (<~0.001% at frequencies h nu <~ 20kT_g) computation of the SZ
signals up to high electron temperature (kT_e ~ 25 keV) and large peculiar
velocity (v/c ~ 0.01). The accuracy is well beyond the current and future
precision of SZ observations and practically eliminates uncertainties related
to more expensive numerical evaluation of the Boltzmann collision term. Our new
approach should therefore be useful for analyzing future high-resolution,
multi-frequency SZ observations as well as computing the predicted SZ effect
signals from numerical simulations.

compatible if and only if every subset of $f(r)$ characters of $C$ is
compatible. We show that for every $r \ge 2$, there exists an incompatible set
$C$ of $\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor\cdot\lceil\frac{r}{2}\rceil + 1$ $r$-state

This improves the previous lower bound of $f(r) \ge r$ given by Meacham (1983),
and generalizes the construction showing that $f(4) \ge 5$ given by Habib and
To (2011). We prove our result via a result on quartet compatibility that may

incompatible set $Q$ of
$\lfloor\frac{n-2}{2}\rfloor\cdot\lceil\frac{n-2}{2}\rceil + 1$ quartets over

with a result on the compatibility of triplets: For every $n \ge 3$, if $R$ is
an incompatible set of more than $n-1$ triplets over $n$ labels, then some
proper subset of $R$ is incompatible. We show this upper bound is tight by
exhibiting, for every $n \ge 3$, a set of $n-1$ triplets over $n$ taxa such
that $R$ is incompatible, but every proper subset of $R$ is compatible.

effect can constrain both cosmological parameters and the astrophysics of the
intracluster medium (ICM). As the tSZ signal is strongly non-Gaussian, higher
moments of tSZ maps contain useful information. We first calculate the
dependence of the tSZ moments on cosmological parameters, finding that higher
moments scale more steeply with sigma_8 and are sourced by more massive galaxy
clusters. Taking advantage of the different dependence of the variance and
skewness on cosmological and astrophysical parameters, we construct a
statistic, |<T^3>|/<T^2>^1.4, which cancels much of the dependence on cosmology
(i.e., sigma_8) yet remains sensitive to the astrophysics of intracluster gas
(in particular, to the gas fraction in low-mass clusters). Constraining the ICM
astrophysics using this statistic could break the well-known degeneracy between
cosmology and gas physics in tSZ measurements, allowing for tight constraints

the quark sector. The minimal framework is however inadequate in the lepton
sector due to the strong constraint from \mu\ to e \gamma. This tension can be
efficiently alleviated by realizing Partial Compositeness within Supersymmetry.
The resulting models can saturate the CP asymmetry in D decays for superpartner
masses close to the TeV scale and somewhat large A-terms. The supersymmetric
realization of Partial Compositeness also offers a predictive and
phenomenologically viable organizing principle for R-Parity violation, and may
result in very distinctive signatures at hadron colliders. With or without

and difficult backgrounds. While light stops are motivated by naturalness
arguments, it has been suggested that such particles become nearly impossible
to detect near the limit where their mass is degenerate with the sum of the
masses of their decay products. We show that this is not the case, and that

stop masses above 175 GeV, even in the degenerate limit. We consider direct
pair production of stops, decaying to invisible LSPs and tops with either

magnified by boosted kinematics and by shape analyses of MET or suitably-chosen

simple analytic functions, in the kinematic regime where signal is enhanced.
Shape analyses of MET-related distributions will allow the LHC experiments to
place significantly improved bounds on stop squarks, even in scenarios where

the entire cosmic history from z~4 to the present. This multi-epoch abundance
matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite
galaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We
employ a redshift-dependent parameterization of the stellar-to-halo mass
relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with
galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several
redshifts be reproduced simultaneously. Using merger trees extracted from the
dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average
assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the
galaxies (in-situ) and accretion of stars (ex-situ). The peak star formation
efficiency decreases with redshift from 23% at z=0 to 9% at z=4 while the
corresponding halo mass increases from 10^11.8M\odot to 10^12.5M\odot. The star
formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo
mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass
galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the
Milky-Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z=0.7. In
low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly
of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the
central stellar mass is formed ex-situ with significant accretion of satellites
at z<2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an
evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those

polarized quark in order to explore the Collins effect within a multihadron
emission framework. This is accomplished by calculating the polarized quark
spin flip probabilities after a pseudoscalar hadron emission and the elementary
Collins functions. The model is used to calculate the number densities of the
hadrons produced in the polarized quark's decay chain. The full Collins
fragmentation function is extracted from the sine modulation of the polarized
number densities with respect to the polar angle between the initial quark's
spin and hadron's transverse momentum. Two cases are studied here. First, a toy
model for elementary Collins function is used to study the features of the
transversely polarized quark-jet model. Second, a full model calculation of
transverse momentum dependent pion and kaon Collins functions is presented. The
remarkable feature of our model is that the 1/2 moments of the favored Collins
fragmentation functions are positive and peak at large values of z but decrease
and oscillate at small values of z. The 1/2 moments of the unfavored Collins
functions have comparable magnitude and opposite sign to the favored functions,
vanish at large z and peak at small values of z. This feature is observed for
both the toy and full models and can be attributed to the quark-jet picture of
hadronization. Moreover, the transverse momentum dependencies of the model
Collins functions differ significantly from the Gaussian form widely used in
the empirical parametrizations. Finally, a naive interpretation of the
Schafer-Teryaev sum rule is proven not to hold in our model, where the
transverse momentum conservation is explicitly enforced. This is attributed to
the sizable average transverse momentum of the remnant quark that needs to be
accounted for to satisfy the transverse momentum sum-rule.

clouds cross our line of sight and produce variable x-ray absorption. Here we
investigate what optical/ultraviolet spectroscopic features would be produced
by such ""Intervening BLR Clouds"" (IBC) crossing our line of sight to the
accretion disk, the source of the optical/UV continuum. Although the emission
spectrum produced by intervening clouds is identical to the standard BLR model,
they may produce absorption features on the optical or UV continuum. Single
clouds will have little effect on the optical/UV spectrum because BLR clouds
are likely to be much smaller than the accretion disk. This is unlike the X-ray
case, where the radiation source is considerably smaller. However, an ensemble
of intervening clouds will produce spectroscopic features in the FUV including
a strong depression between the Lyman limit and Ly{\alpha}. The amount of the
depression will indicate the line-of-sight covering factor of clouds, an
unknown quantity that is important for the ionization of the intergalactic
medium and the energy budget of AGN. Comparison with observations suggests that
the SED of Mrk 766 may be affected by intervening BLR clouds and IBC may exist
in most of AGNs.

It was pioneered by Maurice Biot in the 1930s through 1960s, and has
applications in several fields, including geophysics and modeling of in vivo
bone. A wide variety of methods have been used to model poroelasticity,
including finite difference, finite element, pseudospectral, and discontinuous
Galerkin methods. In this work we use a Cartesian-grid high-resolution finite
volume method to numerically solve Biot's equations in the time domain for
orthotropic materials, with the stiff relaxation source term in the equations
incorporated using operator splitting. This class of finite volume method has
several useful properties, including the ability to use wave limiters to reduce
numerical artifacts in the solution, ease of incorporating material
inhomogeneities, low memory overhead, and an explicit time-stepping approach.
To the authors' knowledge, this is the first use of high-resolution finite
volume methods to model poroelasticity. The solution code uses the CLAWPACK
finite volume method software, which also includes block-structured adaptive
mesh refinement in its AMRCLAW variant. We present convergence results for
known analytic plane wave solutions, achieving second-order convergence rates
outside of the stiff regime of the system. Our convergence rates are degraded
in the stiff regime, but we still achieve similar levels of error on the finest
grids examined. We also demonstrate good agreement against other numerical
results from the literature. To aid in reproducibility, we provide all of the

investigate an implication of the CP-even Higgs boson with mass around 125 GeV
in the context of the minimal gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking (mGMSB). In
mGMSB, gravitino is the lightest sparticle (LSP) and hence the dark matter
candidate. We consider the so-called superWIMP scenario where the dark matter
gravitino is non-thermally produced by the decay of the next-to-LSP (NLSP)
bino-like neutralino after its freeze-out. For a given $\tan \beta$ and the
number of the messengers ($N_m$) fixed, we find that the rest of the mGMSB
parameters, the SUSY breaking parameter and the messenger scale, are completely
fixed by the conditions of simultaneously realizing the observed dark matter
abundance and the 125 GeV Higgs boson mass, leading to the NLSP neutralino mass
around 1.5-2 TeV and the gravitino mass around 3-7 GeV, depending on the values
of $\tan \beta$ and $N_m$. The lifetime of the NLSP is found to be shorter than
1 sec, so that the success of the big bang nucleosynthesis remains intact. The
non-thermally produced gravitino behaves as the warm dark matter with the
free-streaming scale found to be $\lambda_{\rm FS} \simeq 0.1$ Mpc, whose value
is reasonable for observations of the power spectrum on both large and

found that the long mean free path of the long-wavelength acoustic phonons in
graphene can lead to an unusual non-monotonic dependence of the thermal
conductivity on the length L of a ribbon. The effect is pronounced for the
ribbons with the smooth edges (specularity parameter p>0.5). Our results also
suggest that - contrary to what was previously thought - the bulk-like 3D
phonons in graphite can make a rather substantial contribution to its in-plane
thermal conductivity. The Umklapp-limited thermal conductivity of graphite
slabs scales, for L below ~ 10 micrometers, as log(L) while for larger L, the
thermal conductivity approaches a finite value following the dependence K_0 -
A\timesL^-1/2, where K_0 and A are parameters independent of the length. Our

perihelion, the comet underwent major changes (permanent loss of nuclear
condensation, formation of spine tail). The process of disintegration
culminated with an outburst on December 17.6 (T+1.6 d) and this delayed
response is inconsistent with the rubble pile model. Probable cause was thermal
stress from the heat pulse into the nucleus after perihelion, which could also
produce fragmentation of sungrazers far from the Sun. The spine tail was a
synchronic feature, made up of dust released at <30 m/s. Since the nucleus
would have been located on the synchrone, we computed the astrometric positions
of the missing nucleus as the coordinates of the points of intersection of the
spine tail's axis with lines of forced orbital-period variation, derived from
orbital solutions based on preperihelion astrometry from the ground. The
resulting osculating orbital period was 698+/-2 years, which proves that C/2011
W3 is the first major member of the predicted new, 21st-century cluster of
bright Kreutz-system sungrazers. The spine tail's tip contained dust 1-2 mm in
diameter. The bizarre appearance of the dust tail in images taken hours after
perihelion with coronagraphs on SOHO and STEREO is readily understood. The
disconnection of the comet's head from the preperihelion tail and the apparent
activity attenuation near perihelion are both caused by sublimation of all dust
at heliocentric distances smaller than ~1.8 solar radii. The tail's brightness
is strongly affected by forward scattering of sunlight by dust. The
longest-imaged grains had a radiation-pressure parameter beta ~ 0.6, probably
submicron-sized silicate grains. The place of C/2011 W3 within the hierarchy of
the Kreutz system and its genealogy via a 14th century parent suggest that it
is indirectly related to the celebrated sungrazer X/1106 C1.

1300 hours of observation time with the VLBA, between 90 cm and 3 mm wavelength

high radio frequencies (>1.4 GHz). V-FASTR has blindly detected bright
individual pulses from seven known pulsars but has not detected any
single-pulse events that would indicate high redshift impulsive bursts of radio

comparable with the PALFA survey at the Arecibo telescope, but generally at

multiuser multi-antenna downlink systems since it requires only partial channel
state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Under the conventional single-cell
setup, RBF is known to achieve the optimal sum-capacity scaling law as the
number of users goes to infinity, thanks to the multiuser diversity enabled
transmission scheduling that virtually eliminates the intra-cell interference.
In this paper, we extend the study of RBF to a more practical multi-cell
downlink system with single-antenna receivers subject to the additional
inter-cell interference (ICI). First, we consider the case of finite
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each receiver. We derive a closed-form
expression of the achievable sum-rate with the multi-cell RBF, based upon which
we show an asymptotic sum-rate scaling law as the number of users goes to
infinity. Next, we consider the high-SNR regime and for tractable analysis
assume that the number of users in each cell scales in a certain order with the
per-cell SNR. Under this setup, we characterize the achievable degrees of
freedom (DoF) for the single-cell case with RBF. Then we extend the analysis to
the multi-cell RBF case by characterizing the DoF region. It is shown that the
DoF region characterization provides useful guideline on how to design a
cooperative multi-cell RBF system to achieve optimal throughput tradeoffs among
different cells. Furthermore, our results reveal that the multi-cell RBF scheme
achieves the ""interference-free DoF"" region upper bound for the multi-cell
system, provided that the per-cell number of users has a sufficiently large
scaling order with the SNR. Our result thus confirms the optimality of
multi-cell RBF in this regime even without the complete CSI at the transmitter,
as compared to other full-CSI requiring transmission schemes such as
interference alignment.

phenomenon, in which the cargo (usually a vesicle) alternately moves in
retrograde and anterograde directions. In this case, teams of oppositely
pulling motors (eg., kinesin and dynein) bind to the cargo simultaneously, and
`coordinate' their activity such that the motion consists of spells of
positively and negatively directed segments, separated by pauses of varying
duration. A set of recent experiments have analyzed the bidirectional motion of
endosomes in the amoeba D. discoideum in detail. It was found that in between
directional switches, a team of 5-6 dyneins stall a cargo against a stronger
kinesin in tug of war, which lasts for almost a second. As the mean detachment
time of a kinesin under its stall load was also observed to be ~ 1s, we infer
that the collective detachment time of the dynein assembly must also be
similar. Here, we analyze this inference from a modeling perspective, using
experimentally measured single-molecule parameters as inputs. We find that the
commonly assumed exponential load-dependent detachment rate is inconsistent
with observations, as it predicts that a 5-dynein assembly will detach under
its combined stall load in less than a hundredth of a second. A modified model
where the load-dependent unbinding rate is assumed to saturate at stall-force

processes originate from the combined effects of the radiation field and the
graphene tunneling properties, and are shown to be substantially suppressed in
a graphene spin valve which results in a decrease of the differential
conductance for a high bias voltage. We also discussed the appearance of a
dynamical gap around zero bias due to the radiation field. The gap width can be
tuned by changing the radiation electric field strength and the frequency. This
leads to a shift of the resonant peaks in the differential conductance. We also
demonstrate numerically the dependencies of the radiation and spin valve

traditional estimation procedure in use is the following two-step approach: the
model is estimated by maximum likelihood method and then a rotation technique
is utilized to find sparse factor loadings. However, the maximum likelihood
estimates cannot be obtained when the number of variables is much larger than
the number of observations. Furthermore, even if the maximum likelihood
estimates are available, the rotation technique does not often produce a
sufficiently sparse solution. In order to handle these problems, this paper
introduces a penalized likelihood procedure that imposes a nonconvex penalty on
the factor loadings. We show that the penalized likelihood procedure can be
viewed as a generalization of the traditional two-step approach, and the
proposed methodology can produce sparser solutions than the rotation technique.
A new algorithm via the EM algorithm along with coordinate descent is
introduced to compute the entire solution path, which permits the application
to a wide variety of convex and nonconvex penalties. Monte Carlo simulations
are conducted to investigate the performance of our modeling strategy. A real

resonator (NAMR) capacitively coupled to a triple quantum dot (TQD). This TQD
is an electronic analog of a three-level atom in $\Lambda$ configuration which
allows an electron to enter it via lower-energy states and to exit only from a
higher-energy state. By tuning the degeneracy of the two lower-energy states in
the TQD, an electron can be trapped in a dark state caused by destructive
quantum interference between the two tunneling pathways to the higher-energy
state. Therefore, ground-state cooling of an NAMR can be achieved when
electrons absorb readily and repeatedly energy quanta from the NAMR for
excitations.

number of degrees of freedom for the fermion fields and the super-momentum
fulfil the mass shell condition, in sharp contrast with other cases in the
literature where the supermetric is degenerate. This fact leads a deviation of
the 4-impulse (e.g. mass constraint) that can be mechanically interpreted as a
modification of the Newton's law. Quantum aspects of the physical states and
the basic states and the projection relation between them, are completely
described due the introduction of a new Majorana-Weyl representation of the
generators of the underlying group manifold. A new oscillatory fermionic effect
in the $B_{0}$ part of the vaccum solution involving the chiral and antichiral
components of this Majorana bispinor is explicitly shown.

$r$-neighbor of a node $x$ is defined as a set of at most $N^r$ neighbors of
$x$, where $N$ is the total number of nodes. The parameter $r$ controls the
strength of a nonlocal effect. The system is found to undergo a percolation
transition belonging to the mean field universality class for $r< 1/2$. On the

a non-percolating phase to a quasi-critical phase where the largest cluster
size $G$ scales as $G \sim N^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha = 0.74 (1)$. In the
marginal case with $r=1/2$, the model displays a percolation transition that

estimated using large data sets. However, different events can exhibit
different features because of the quantum mechanical nature of the underlying
physics processes. While signal and background fractions in a given data set
can be evaluated using a maximum likelihood estimator, the shapes of the
corresponding distributions are traditionally obtained using high-statistics
control samples, which normally neglects the effect of fluctuations. On the
other hand, if it was possible to subtract background using templates that take
fluctuations into account, this would be expected to improve the resolution of
the observables of interest, and to reduce systematics depending on the
analysis. This study is an initial step in this direction. We propose a novel
algorithm inspired by the Gibbs sampler that makes it possible to estimate the
shapes of signal and background probability density functions from a given
collection of particles, using control sample templates as initial conditions
and refining them to take into account the effect of fluctuations. Results on
Monte Carlo data are presented, and the prospects for future development are
discussed.

as a result of a UV finite and non-local contribution which is entirely due to
the mixing between left-chiral and right-chiral neutrinos. The result shows how
anomaly-like couplings may arise in spite of the fact that the (B-L) current
remains exactly conserved to all orders in $\hbar$, lending additional support
to our previous proposal to identify the Majoron with the axion.

of precise stellar radial velocity measurements of Beta Gem were taken with an
iodine absorption cell and the echelle spectrograph mounted on the 2m Alfred
Jensch Telescope. Complementary photometric data for this star were also taken
with the MOST microsatellite spanning 3.6 d. A Fourier analysis of the radial
velocity data reveals the presence of up to 17 significant pulsation modes in
the frequency interval 10-250 micro-Hz. Most of these fall on a grid of
equally-spaced frequencies having a separation of 7.14 +/- 0.12 micro-Hz. An
analysis of 3.6 days of high precision photometry taken with the MOST space
telescope shows the presence of up to 16 modes, six of which are consistent
with modes found in the spectral (radial velocity) data. This frequency spacing
is consistent with high overtone radial pulsations; however, until the
pulsation modes are identified we cannot be sure if some of these are nonradial
modes or even mixed modes. The radial velocity frequency spacing along with
angular diameter measurements of Beta Gem via interferometry results in a
stellar mass of M = 1.91 +/- 0.09 solar masses. This value confirms the
intermediate mass of the star determined using stellar evolutionary tracks.
Beta Gem is confirmed to be an intermediate mass star. Stellar pulsations in
giant stars along with interferometric radius measurements can provide accurate
determinations of the stellar mass of planet hosting giant stars. These can
also be used to calibrate stellar evolutionary tracks.
