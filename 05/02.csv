an important role in its behavior, both scientifically and technologically. The
interactions are complicated due to the interplay between surface forces and
possibly nonlinear elastic behavior. Here we review recent experimental and
theoretical advances in the understanding of graphene adhesion. We organize our
discussion into experimental and theoretical efforts directed toward: graphene
conformation to a substrate, determination of adhesion energy, and applications
where graphene adhesion plays an important role. We conclude with a brief

  physics","21 pages, 2 figures, To appear in SPIE conference proceedings,
  Quantum information and computation X, April 26,27, 2012",,"10.1117/12.917731",,"quant-ph gr-qc math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Local availability of mathematics and number scaling provide an approach to a
coherent theory of physics and mathematics. Local availability of mathematics
assigns separate mathematical universes, U_{x}, to each space time point, x.
The mathematics available to an observer, O_{x}, at x is contained in U_{x}.
Number scaling is based on extending the choice freedom of vector space bases
in gauge theories to choice freedom of underlying number systems. Scaling
arises in the description, in U_{x}, of mathematical systems in U_{y}. If a_{y}
or \psi_{y} is a number or a quantum state in U_{y}, then the corresponding
number or state in U_{x} is r_{y,x}a_{x} or r_{y,x}\psi_{x}. Here a_{x} and
\psi_{x} are the same number and state in U_{x} as a_{y} and \psi_{y} are in
U_{y}. If y=x+\hat{\mu}dx is a neighbor point of x, then the scaling factor is
r_{y,x}=\exp(\vec{A}(x)\cdot\hat{\mu}dx) where \vec{A} is a vector field,
assumed here to be the gradient of a scalar field. The effects of scaling and
local availability of mathematics on quantum theory show that scaling has two
components, external and internal. External scaling is shown above for a_{y}
and \psi_{y}. Internal scaling occurs in expressions with integrals or
derivatives over space or space time. An example is the replacement of the
position expectation value, \int\psi^{*}(y)y\psi(y)dy, by
\int_{x}r_{y,x}\psi^{*}_{x}(y_{x})y_{x}\psi_{x}(y_{x})dy_{x}. This is an
integral in U_{x}. The good agreement between quantum theory and experiment
shows that scaling is negligible in a space region, L, in which experiments and
calculations can be done, and results compared. L includes the solar system,
but the speed of light limits the size of L to a few light years. Outside of
$L$, at cosmological distances, the limits on scaling are not present.

for comparison with high-redshift galaxies. We employed an automated Gaussian
line fitting program to decompose the emission line profiles of Halpha, [NII],
[SII], and [OI] into individual components, and chart the Halpha kinematics,
and the ionized gas excitations and densities. 11/18 of our galaxies show
evidence for outflowing warm ionized gas with speeds between 500 and a few 1000
km/s, with the fastest outflows associated with systems that contain an AGN.
Our spatially resolved spectroscopy has allowed us to map the outflows, and in
some cases determine for the first time to which nucleus the wind is
associated. In three of our targets we find line components with widths >2000
km/s over spatially extended regions in both the recombination and forbidden
lines; in two of these three, they are associated with a known Sy2 nucleus.
Eight galaxies have clear rotating gaseous disks, and for these we measure
rotation velocities, virial masses, and calculate Toomre Q parameters. We find
radial gradients in the emission line ratios in a significant number of systems
in our study. We attribute these gradients to changes in ionizing radiation
field strength, most likely due to an increasing contribution of shocks with
radius. We conclude with a detailed discussion of the results for each
individual system, with reference to the existing literature.
  Our observations demonstrate that the complexity of the kinematics and gas
properties in ULIRGs can only be disentangled with high sensitivity, spatially

year and time of day, which may be due in part to environmental influences.
However, time-series analysis reveals a number of periodicities, including two
at approximately 11.2 year$^{-1}$ and 12.5 year$^{-1}$. We have previously
found these oscillations in nuclear-decay data acquired at the Brookhaven

form of solar radiation that has its origin in the deep solar interior. A
curious property of the GSI data is that the annual oscillation is much
stronger in daytime data than in nighttime data, but the opposite is true for
all other oscillations. This may be a systematic effect but, if it is not, this
property should help narrow the theoretical options for the mechanism

fundamental ordering of the vertices on the underlying graph network, which
directly leads to a more intuitive scheduling algorithm that assures the same
convergence time and runs faster. More importantly, this structure enables a
distributed scheduling algorithm once individual paths are assigned to the
agents, which was not possible before. The vertex ordering also readily extends
to more general graphs - those with non-unit capacities and edge lengths - for
which we again guarantee the convergence time until the desired formation is
achieved.

The third zone is the zone of the main multipole moment, where higher order
terms make a contribution of less than 10%. This zone extends to distances
$r\gtrapprox 4a=2D$.
  The case of spherical particles with planar anchoring conditions and boojums
at the poles is considered as an example. It is found that boojums can be
described analitically via multipole expansion with accuracy up to $1/r^{7}$
and the whole spherical particle can be effectively considered as the multipole
of the order 6 with multipolarity equal $2^{6}=64$. The correspondent elastic
interaction with higher order elastic terms gives the angle
$\theta_{min}=34.5^{\circ}$ of minimum energy between two contact beads which
is close to the experimental value of $\theta_{min}=30^{\circ}$.

nuclear mid-IR characteristics, suggests that NGC 4178 may host a highly
absorbed AGN accreting at a high rate with a bolometric luminosity on order of
10^43 ergs/s. The black hole mass estimate, based on our Chandra data and
archival VLA data using the most recent fundamental plane relations is \sim
10^4 - 10^5 M\odot, possibly the lowest mass nuclear black hole currently
known. There are also three off-nuclear sources, two with a similar brightness
to the nuclear source at 36"" and 32"" from the center. As with the nuclear
source, hardness ratios are used to estimate spectra for these two sources, and
both are consistent with a simple power- law model with absorption. These two
sources have X-ray luminosities of the order of \sim 10^38 ergs/s, which place
them at the threshold between X-ray binaries and ultra-luminous X-ray sources
(ULXs). The third off-nuclear source, located 49"" from the center, is the
brightest source detected, with an X-ray luminosity of \sim 10^40 ergs/s. Its
spectrum is well-fit with an absorbed power law model, suggesting that it is a
ULX. We also fit its spectrum with the Bulk Motion Comptonization (BMC) model

psychology, cognitive science, medicine, social science, public health, and
many other disciplines. For instance, about 60% of recent papers published in
leading journals in social psychology contain at least one mediation test
(Rucker, Preacher, Tormala, & Petty, 2011). Standard parametric approaches to
mediation analysis employ regression models, and either the ""difference method""
(Judd & Kenny, 1981), more common in epidemiology, or the ""product method""
(Baron & Kenny, 1986), more common in the social sciences. In this paper we
first discuss a known, but perhaps often unappreciated fact: that these
parametric approaches are a special case of a general counterfactual framework
for reasoning about causality first described by Neyman (1923), and Rubin
(1974), and linked to causal graphical models by J. Robins (1986), and Pearl
(2000). We then show a number of advantages of this framework. First, it makes
the strong assumptions underlying mediation analysis explicit. Second, it
avoids a number of problems present in the product and difference methods, such
as biased estimates of effects in certain cases. Finally, we show the
generality of this framework by proving a novel result which allows mediation
analysis to be applied to longitudinal settings with unobserved confounders.

computing the mean azimuthal angle probability distribution function using 88
spectroscopically confirmed MgII absorption-selected galaxies [W_r(2796)>0.1A]

flat, indicating no azimuthal preference for gas characterized by
W_r(2796)<0.1A. We find that blue star-forming galaxies clearly drive the
bimodality while red passive galaxies may exhibit an excess along their major
axis. These results are consistent with galaxy evolution scenarios where
star-forming galaxies accrete new gas, forming new stars and producing winds,
while red galaxies exist passively due to reduced gas reservoirs. We further
compute an azimuthal angle dependent MgII absorption covering fraction, which
is enhanced by as much as 20-30% along the major and minor axes. The W_r(2796)
distribution for gas along the major axis is likely skewed toward weaker MgII
absorption than for gas along the projected minor axis. These combined results
are highly suggestive that the bimodality is driven by gas accreted along the
galaxy major axis and outflowing along the galaxy minor axis. Adopting these
assumptions, we find that the opening angle of outflows and inflows to be 100

stellar mass, and disk mass show better agreement, but can still deviate
significantly, and the agreement may in some cases be artificially good due to

increases. In order to understand its effect on spectroscopic observations of
asteroids, we have analyzed the visible and near-infrared spectra (0.45-2.5 \mu
m) of 12 near-Earth asteroids observed at different phase angles. All these
asteroids are classified as either S-complex or Q-type asteroids. In addition,
we have acquired laboratory spectra of three different types of ordinary
chondrites at phase angles ranging from 13\degree to 120\degree. We have found
that both asteroid and meteorite spectra show an increase in band depths with
increasing phase angle. The spectral slope of the ordinary chondrites spectra
shows a significant increase with increasing phase angle for g > 30\degree.
Variations in band centers and band area ratio (BAR) values were also found,
however they seems to have no significant impact on the mineralogical analysis.
Our study showed that the increase in spectral slope caused by phase reddening
is comparable to certain degree of space weathering. In particular, an increase
in phase angle in the range of 30\degree to 120\degree will produce a reddening
of the reflectance spectra equivalent to exposure times of ~ 0.1x10^6 to
1.3x10^6 years at about 1 AU from the Sun. Furthermore, we found that under
some circumstances phase reddening could lead to an ambiguous taxonomic
classification of asteroids.

attributed to free-free absorption by cool gas mixed into the nonthermal

shape of the rising light curves and the low gas column density inferred along
the line of sight to the emission region. The X-ray luminosity implies a

may be an asymmetry in the interaction. The X-ray spectrum shows Fe line

a hybrid remote state preparation. The latter, in its standard formulation, is
shown to have a performance limited by the initial mixedness of the oscillator,
echoing the behaviour of the geometric discord. If one includes a further

the performance is improved to match that of teleportation, which is directly

be used as a marker for supermassive black holes that otherwise lie dormant and
undetected in the centres of distant galaxies. Previous candidate flares have
had declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poor
constraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, because
the rising emission was not observed. Recently, two `relativistic' candidate
tidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme X-ray luminosity
and synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from a
relativistic jet. Here we report the discovery of a luminous
ultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at a
redshift of 0.1696. The observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simple
accreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decline of its light curve
follows the predicted mass accretion rate, and can be modelled to determine the
time of disruption to an accuracy of two days. The black hole has a mass of
about 2 million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radius
of the star disrupted. On the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionized
helium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was a

receive the same tidal torques, and therefore approximately the same initial
specific angular momentum. However, observations indicate that disc galaxies
typically have only about half as much specific angular momentum as their dark
matter haloes. We argue this does not necessarily imply that baryons lose this
much specific angular momentum as they form galaxies. It may instead indicate
that galaxies are most directly related to the inner regions of their host
haloes, as may be expected in a scenario where baryons in the inner parts of
haloes collapse first. A limiting case is examined under the idealised
assumption of perfect angular momentum conservation. Namely, we determine the
density contrast Delta, with respect to the critical density of the Universe,
by which dark matter haloes need to be defined in order to have the same
average specific angular momentum as the galaxies they host. Under the
assumption that galaxies are related to haloes via their characteristic
rotation velocities, the necessary Delta is ~600. This Delta corresponds to an
average halo radius and mass which are ~60% and ~75%, respectively, of the
virial values (i.e., for Delta = 200). We refer to this radius as the radius of
baryonic collapse R_BC, since if specific angular momentum is conserved
perfectly, baryons would come from within it. It is not likely a simple step
function due to the complex gastrophysics involved, therefore we regard it as
an effective radius. In summary, the difference between the predicted initial
and the observed final specific angular momentum of galaxies, which is
conventionally attributed solely to angular momentum loss, can more naturally
be explained by a preference for collapse of baryons within R_BC, with possibly
some later angular momentum transfer.

hole low-mass X-ray binaries are correlated with changes in the radio

can say that the jet is continuously present in the hard state and undetectable
(and therefore weaker) in the soft state. Since the different accretion states
are also generally assumed to be associated with different disc geometries --
the hard state with a hot, thick flow, and the soft state with a cold, thin
disc -- we investigate the possibility that these two phenomena are linked;
i.e., that the difference in disc geometry is the cause of the difference in
observed jet power. We do this by comparing various measures of jet power in
numerical simulations of accretion discs of differing temperatures and
thicknesses. We perform these simulations using the general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic code Cosmos++ and a newly added cooling function, which
allows us to regulate the disc scale height H/r at different radii. We find no
apparent correlation between the disc scale height and jet power whenever we
normalize the latter by the mass accretion history of each simulation. We
attribute this result to the role that the ""corona"" plays in confining and
accelerating the jet (our corona may also be considered a failed MHD ""wind"").
The properties of the corona do not vary significantly from one simulation to
another, even though the scale heights of the discs vary by up to a factor of
four. If this holds true in nature, then it suggests that the correlation
between spectral state and jet power must be attributable to some other
property, possibly the topology of the magnetic field. Alternatively, it could
be that the corona disappears altogether in the soft state, which would be
consistent with observations, but has so far not been seen in simulations.

direction of the acceleration g. We investigate the thermal fluctuations in the
Unruh bath by studying the Brownian motion of particles in the bath, especially
as regards to isotropy. We find that the thermal fluctuations are anisotropic
and induce different frictional drag forces on the Brownian particle depending
on whether it has a drift velocity along the direction of acceleration g or in
a direction transverse to it. Using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we
argue that this anisotropy arises due to quantum correlations in the
fluctuations at large correlation time scales.

t tbar production measured at the Tevatron significantly deviates from the
standard model predictions, and many models of new physics have been invented
to explain the puzzle. We consider the consistency of the simplified

flavor-changing neutral Z', or charged W' vector boson with existing t tbar

top-spin correlations. The LHC charge asymmetry measurements exclude the W' and
Z' explanations of the Tevatron FBA anomaly. On the other hand, all scalar
models predict notable deviations in several top spin observables, and the
recent top spin correlation measurement using the ""helicity"" spin quantization
axis by ATLAS already provides a significant constraint on possible
explanations of the Tevatron FBA anomaly. Future precise measurements of top
spin correlations and especially top polarization could differentiate between

spatial distribution of metal-enriched gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
of massive galaxies at redshift 3, using the ""Eris"" suite of cosmological
""zoom-in"" simulations. The reference run adopts a blastwave scheme for
supernova feedback that produces galactic outflows, a star formation recipe
based on a high gas density threshold, metal-dependent radiative cooling, and a
model for the diffusion of metals and thermal energy. Synthetic spectra through
the multiphase CGM produce interstellar absorption line strengths of Lya, CII,
CIV, SiII, and SiIV as a function of galactocentric impact parameter (scaled to
the virial radius) that are in broad agreement with those observed at
high-redshift by Steidel et al. (2010). Only about one third of all the gas
within R_vir is outflowing. The fraction of sightlines within one virial radius
that intercept optically thick material is 27%, in agreement with recent
observations by Rudie et al. (2012). Such optically thick absorption is shown
to trace inflowing ""cold"" streams that penetrate deep inside the virial radius.
The streams, enriched to metallicities above 0.01 solar, give origin to strong
(log N > 13) CII absorption with a covering factor of 22% within R_vir and 10%
within 2 R_vir. Galactic outflows do not cause any substantial suppression of
the cold accretion mode. The central galaxy is surrounded by a large OVI halo,
with a typical column density log N>14 and a near unity covering factor
maintained all the way out to 150 kpc. This matches the trends recently
observed in star-forming galaxies at low redshift by Tumlinson et al. (2011).
Our zoom-in simulations of this single system appear to reproduce
quantitatively the complex baryonic processes that determine the exchange of
matter, energy, and metals between galaxies and their surroundings. (Abridged)

presented self-consistent macroscopic theory of this process employs
thermodynamics (classical, statistical and linear non-equilibrium),
hydrodynamics and interfacial kinetics. As a result of thermodynamic study of
the problem, the work of formation of a bubble is obtained and parameters of
the critical bubble are determined. The variables V (the bubble volume), \rho
(the vapor density), and T (the vapor temperature) are shown to be natural for
the given task. An algorithm of writing the equations of motion of a bubble in
the space {V, \rho, T} - equations for V, \rho, and T - is offered. This
algorithm ensures symmetry of the matrix of kinetic coefficients. The equation
for written on the basis of this algorithm is shown to represent the first law
of thermodynamics for a bubble. The negative eigenvalue of the motion equations
which alongside with the work of the critical bubble formation determines the
stationary nucleation rate of bubbles is obtained. Various kinetic limits are
considered. One of the kinetic constraints leads to the fact that the
nucleation cannot occur in the whole metastable region; it occurs only in some
subregion of the latter. Zeldovich theory of cavitation is shown to be a
limiting case of the theory presented. The limiting effects of various kinetic
processes on the nucleation rate of bubbles are shown analytically. These are
the inertial motion of a liquid as well as the processes of particles exchange
and heat exchange between a bubble and surrounding liquid. The nucleation rate
is shown to be determined by the slowest kinetic process at positive and
moderately negative pressures in a liquid. The limiting effect vanishes at high
negative pressures.

scattering length a and L = 0.25a. For example, a state with a three-body
energy of -3/(ma^2) in the infinite volume has been shifted to -10/(ma^2) at L
= a. Special emphasis is put on the consequences of the breakdown of spherical
symmetry and several ways to perturbatively treat the ensuing partial wave
admixtures. We find their contributions to be on the sub-percent level compared
to the strong volume dependence of the S-wave component. For shallow bound
states, we find a transition to boson-diboson scattering behavior when
decreasing the size of the finite volume.

grid of 80,843 radiative transfer (RT) models of evolved stars and
circumstellar dust shells composed of either silicate or carbonaceous dust. We
fit GRAMS models to ~30,000 Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and Red Supergiant
(RSG) stars in the LMC, using 12 bands of photometry from the optical to the
mid-infrared. Our published dataset consists of thousands of evolved stars with
individually determined evolutionary parameters such as luminosity and
mass-loss rate. The GRAMS grid has a greater than 80% accuracy rate
discriminating between Oxygen- and Carbon-rich chemistry. The global dust
injection rate to the interstellar medium (ISM) of the LMC from RSGs and AGB
stars is on the order of 1.5x10^(-5) solar masses/yr, equivalent to a total
mass injection rate (including the gas) into the ISM of ~5x10^(-3) solar
masses/yr. Carbon stars inject two and a half times as much dust into the ISM
as do O-rich AGB stars, but the same amount of mass. We determine a bolometric
correction factor for C-rich AGB stars in the K band as a function of J - K
color, BC(K) = -0.40(J-K)^2 + 1.83(J-K) + 1.29. We determine several IR color
proxies for the dust mass-loss rate (MLR) from C-rich AGB stars, such as log

stars exhibiting the `long-secondary period' phenomenon are O-rich than stars
dominated by radial pulsations, and AGB stars without detectable mass-loss do
not appear on either the first-overtone or fundamental-mode pulsation

single-input-single-output (SISO) Gaussian interference channel, when the
improper Gaussian signaling is applied. Under the assumption that the
interference is treated as additive Gaussian noise, we show that the user's
achievable rate can be expressed as a summation of the rate achievable by the
conventional proper Gaussian signaling, which depends on the users' input
covariances only, and an additional term, which is a function of both the
users' covariances and pseudo-covariances. The additional degree of freedom
given by the pseudo-covariance, which is conventionally set to be zero for the
case of proper Gaussian signaling, provides an opportunity to improve the
achievable rate by employing the improper Gaussian signaling. Since finding the
optimal solution for the joint covariance and pseudo-covariance optimization is
difficult, we propose a sub-optimal but efficient algorithm by separately
optimizing these two sets of parameters. Numerical results show that the
proposed algorithm provides a close-to-optimal performance as compared to the
exhaustive search method, and significantly outperforms the optimal proper
Gaussian signaling and other existing improper Gaussian signaling schemes.

When the number of kernels $d$ to be combined is very large, multiple kernel
learning methods whose computational cost scales linearly in $d$ are
intractable. We propose a randomized version of the mirror descent algorithm to
overcome this issue, under the objective of minimizing the group $p$-norm
penalized empirical risk. The key to achieve the required exponential speed-up
is the computationally efficient construction of low-variance estimates of the
gradient. We propose importance sampling based estimates, and find that the
ideal distribution samples a coordinate with a probability proportional to the
magnitude of the corresponding gradient. We show the surprising result that in
the case of learning the coefficients of a polynomial kernel, the combinatorial
structure of the base kernels to be combined allows the implementation of
sampling from this distribution to run in $O(\log(d))$ time, making the total
computational cost of the method to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal solution to
be $O(\log(d)/\epsilon^2)$, thereby allowing our method to operate for very
large values of $d$. Experiments with simulated and real data confirm that the
new algorithm is computationally more efficient than its state-of-the-art
alternatives.

circle-compactified (non-thermal) supersymmetric gluodynamics in the limit
m->0. In the m-L plane, there is a line of center symmetry changing phase
transitions. In the limit m->infinity, this transition takes place at
L_c=1/T_c, where T_c is the critical temperature of the deconfinement

that the transition is of second order. This suggests that the deconfining

transition that can be studied at weak coupling. The center symmetry changing
phase transition arises from the competition of perturbative contributions and
monopole-instantons that destabilize the center, and topological molecules

computed using supersymmetry in the limit m=0, and via the

On one hand, there are the strictly Einstein-local interactions which generate
the time evolution. On the other hand, the quantum state space calls for a
non-local description of multi-particle states. This article uses a
behavioristic approach to argue, that an observer in a universe like this has
to rely on local interactions to learn about its properties and behavior. Such
an observer is fundamentally restricted in his ability to understand and
structurally reconstruct the individual local physical universe. We argue, that
this reconstruction based on dynamically available information is the defining
process of observation in quantum theory. The observer-centric view of the
global quantum dynamics is shown to be non-unitary and non-linear in general,
even if the universe itself evolves unitarily. Interactions with massless free
particles are found to have great influence on observation, because of their
special role in the light-cone structure of an Einstein-local universe. For a
specific scattering process with a photon of unknown state, the observed
outcome can be subjectively random and follow the Born statistic, while the
output state is really determined by the photon polarization. Based on this
result, a theory of quantum measurement is formulated, which describes a

of planetary systems requires studies of new formation scenarios. It is
important to study satellite formation in circumplanetary disks, which is often
viewed as analogous to formation of rocky planets in protoplanetary disks. We
investigated satellite formation from satellitesimals around giant planets
through N-body simulations that include gravitational interactions with a
circumplanetary gas disk. Our main aim is to reproduce the observable
properties of the Galilean satellites around Jupiter through numerical
simulations, as previous N-body simulations have not explained the origin of
the resonant configuration. We performed accretion simulations based on the
work of Sasaki et al. (2010), in which an inner cavity is added to the model of
Canup & Ward (2002, 2006). We found that several satellites are formed and
captured in mutual mean motion resonances outside the disk inner edge and are
stable after rapid disk gas dissipation, which explains the characteristics of
the Galilean satellites. In addition, owing to the existence of the disk edge,
a radial compositional gradient of the Galilean satellites can also be
reproduced. An additional objective of this study is to discuss orbital
properties of formed satellites for a wide range of conditions by considering
large uncertainties in model parameters. Through numerical experiments and
semianalytical arguments, we determined that if the inner edge of a disk is
introduced, a Galilean-like configuration in which several satellites are
captured into a 2:1 resonance outside the disk inner cavity is almost
universal. In fact, such a configuration is produced even for a massive disk
and rapid type I migration. This result implies the inevitability of a Galilean
satellite formation in addition to providing theoretical predictions for
extrasolar satellites.

The size of Ha absorption region in the eastern bubble is 5 kpc x 7.5 kpc and
the observed Ha equivalent widths are ~2 A +- 0.2 A. The sizes of the northern

the vertex set V of G is the Euler characteristic X(G). Poincare-Hopf tells
that for any injective function f on V the sum of i(f,x) is X(G). We also know
that averaging the indices E[i(f,x)] over all functions gives curvature K(x).
  We explore here the situation when G is geometric of dimension d: that is if
each unit sphere S(x) is geometric of dimension d-1 and that X(S(x))=0 for even
d and X(S(x))=2 for odd d. The dimension of G is inductively defined as the
average of 1+dim(S(x)) over all S(x) assuming the empty graph has dimension -1.
  We prove that any odd dimensional geometric graph G has zero curvature. This
is done with the help of an index formula j(f,x) = 1-X(S(x))/2-X(B(f,x))/2,
where j(x)=[i(f,x)+i(-f,x)]/2. The graph B(f,x) is the discrete level surface
{y | f(y) = f(x)} intersected with S(x). It is a subgraph of the line graph of
G and geometric if G is geometric.
  The index formula simplifies for geometric graphs: for even d it is j(f,x) =
1-X(B(f,x))/2, where B(f,x) is a (d-2)-dimensional graph. For odd d it becomes
j(f,x) =-X(B(f,x))/2, where B(f,x) is an odd dimensional graph. Because by
induction with respect to d, the X(B(f,x))=0 we know now that that j(f,x) is
zero for all x and so, by taking expectation over f that curvature K(x) is zero
for all x.
  We also point out that all these results hold almost verbatim for compact
Riemannian manifolds and actually are much simpler there. The same integral
geometric index formula is valid if f is a Morse function, i(f,x) is the index
of the gradient vector field and if S(x) is a sufficiently small geodesic
sphere around x and B(f,x) which is S(x) intersected with the level surface {y
| f(y)=f(x)}. Also in the continuum, the symmetric index j(f,x) is constant
zero everywhere if d is odd.

sufficient conditions for local linear convergence of the MAP algorithm. We use
the restricted normal cone together with the notion of superregularity, which

local linear convergence results with estimates for the radius of convergence
of the MAP algorithm applied to sparsity optimization with an affine

music and DNA. Determining the span of correlations in dolphin whistle
sequences is crucial for shedding light on their communicative complexity.
Dolphin whistles share various statistical properties with human words, i.e.
Zipf's law for word frequencies (namely that the probability of the $i$th most
frequent word of a text is about $i^{-\alpha}$) and a parallel of the tendency
of more frequent words to have more meanings. The finding of Zipf's law for
word frequencies in dolphin whistles has been the topic of an intense debate on
its implications. One of the major arguments against the relevance of Zipf's
law in dolphin whistles is that is not possible to distinguish the outcome of a
die rolling experiment from that of a linguistic or communicative source
producing Zipf's law for word frequencies. Here we show that statistically
significant whistle-whistle correlations extend back to the 2nd previous
whistle in the sequence using a global randomization test and to the 4th
previous whistle using a local randomization test. None of these correlations
are expected by a die rolling experiment and other simple explanation of Zipf's
law for word frequencies such as Simon's model that produce sequences of
unpredictable elements.

and energy-overheads is required. We formulate this problem as a discrete-time
Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which the SU aims at minimizing its average
cost (including both energy consumption and delay cost) to finish a target
traffic payload through an appropriate rate allocation. Based on Certainty
Equivalent Control, we propose a low-complexity rate-adaptation policy that
achieves comparable performance as the optimal policy. With the low-complexity
policy, we quantify the impact of energy-overheads (including the power
consumption for spectrum sensing and compulsory idling) on the SU transmission
strategy. Specifically, the SU rate increases with the increase of
energy-overheads, whose marginal impact, however, diminishes. Moreover, the
marginal impact of energy-overheads is more significant for delay-insensitive
traffic compared to that for delay-sensitive traffic. To mitigate the loss due
to imperfect spectrum sensing, we quantify that the SU decreases (increases)
its rate with a larger mis-detection probability (false alarm probability).

method performs identical to ML decoding for all these five codes. These STBCs

class of metric graphs that are isometrically embeddable into Hilbert spaces
must have the property SN. We also show, by a simple example, that this result
is not true replacing property SN with amenability. As a second result, we
prove that \emph{many} spaces with \emph{uniform bounded geometry} having a
bi-lipschitz embedding into Euclidean spaces must have the property SN.
Finally, we prove a Bourgain-like theorem for metric trees: a metric tree with
uniform bounded geometry and without property SN does not have bi-lipschitz
embeddings into finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

quantify the effects of the Thomson-scattering geometry, we study an
interplanetary shock using forward magnetohydrodynamic simulation and synthetic
white-light imaging. Identifiable as an inclined streak of enhanced brightness
in a time-elongation map, the travelling shock can be readily imaged by an
observer located within a wide range of longitudes in the ecliptic. Different
parts of the shock front contribute to the imaged brightness pattern viewed by
observers at different longitudes. Moreover, even for an observer located at a
fixed longitude, a different part of the shock front will contribute to the
imaged brightness at any given time. The observed brightness within each
imaging pixel results from a weighted integral along its corresponding
ray-path. It is possible to infer the longitudinal location of the shock from
the brightness pattern in an optical sky map, based on the east-west asymmetry
in its brightness and degree of polarization. Therefore, measurement of the
interplanetary polarized brightness could significantly reduce the ambiguity in
performing three-dimensional reconstruction of local electron density from
white-light imaging.

spectra are dominated by the narrow (full width at half-maximum ~1000 km s^-1)
Balmer lines distinctive of a Type IIn SN with P Cygni profiles. Contrarily,
the photometric evolution resembles more that of a Type IIP SN with a large
drop in luminosity at the end of the plateau phase. These characteristics are
similar to those of SN 1994W, whose nature has been explained with two
different models with different approaches. The well-sampled data set on SN
2009kn offers the possibility to test these models, in the case of both SN
2009kn and SN 1994W. We associate the narrow P Cygni lines with a swept-up
shell composed of circumstellar matter and SN ejecta. The broad emission line
wings, seen during the plateau phase, arise from internal electron scattering
in this shell. The slope of the light curve after the post-plateau drop is
fairly consistent with that expected from the radioactive decay of 56Co,
suggesting an SN origin for SN 2009kn. Assuming radioactivity to be the main
source powering the light curve of SN 2009kn in the tail phase, we infer an
upper limit for 56Ni mass of 0.023 M_sun. This is significantly higher than
that estimated for SN 1994W, which also showed a much steeper decline of the
light curve after the post-plateau drop. We also observe late-time
near-infrared emission which most likely arises from newly formed dust produced
by SN 2009kn. As with SN 1994W, no broad lines are observed in the spectra of
SN 2009kn, not even in the late-time tail phase.

restricted forms of infinitary term rewriting. The correspondence between
infinitary term rewriting and term graph rewriting has been studied to some
extent. However, this endeavour is impaired by the lack of an appropriate
counterpart of infinitary rewriting on the side of term graphs. We aim to fill
this gap by devising two modes of convergence based on a partial order
respectively a metric on term graphs. The thus obtained structures generalise
corresponding modes of convergence that are usually studied in infinitary term
rewriting. We argue that this yields a common framework in which both term
rewriting and term graph rewriting can be studied. In order to substantiate our
claim, we compare convergence on term graphs and on terms. In particular, we
show that the modes of convergence on term graphs are conservative extensions
of the corresponding modes of convergence on terms and are preserved under
unravelling term graphs to terms. Moreover, we show that many of the properties
known from infinitary term rewriting are preserved. This includes the intrinsic
completeness of both modes of convergence and the fact that convergence via the
partial order is a conservative extension of the metric convergence.

Subsequent astrochemical modeling that included reactions in the gas phase and
on the surface of dust grains was able to explain the observed abundance, and
highlighted the importance of grain chemistry in the formation of HOOH as an
intermediate product in water formation. This study also predicted that the
hydroperoxyl radical HO2, the precursor of HOOH, should be detectable. Aims: We
aim at detecting the hydroperoxyl radical HO2 in \rho Oph A. Methods: We used
the IRAM 30m and the APEX telescopes to target the brightest HO2 lines at about
130 and 260 GHz. Results: We detect five lines of HO2 (comprising seven
individual molecular transitions). The fractional abundance of HO2 is found to
be about 1e-10, a value similar to the abundance of HOOH. This observational
result is consistent with the prediction of the above mentioned astrochemical
model, and thereby validates our current understanding of the water formation
on dust grains. Conclusions: This detection, anticipated by a sophisticated
gas-grain chemical model, demonstrates that models of grain chemistry have
improved tremendously and that grain surface reactions now form a crucial part

hole: in a fraction of the Eddington time its mass can grow to an arbitrary
large value if the feedback effect is not taken into account. However, since
super-Eddington accretion has a very low radiation efficiency, people have
argued against it as a major process for the growth of the black holes in
quasars since observations have constrained the average accretion efficiency of
the black holes in quasars to be $\ga 0.1$. In this paper we show that the
observational constraint does not need to be violated if the black holes in
quasars have undergone a two-phase growing process: with a short
super-Eddington accretion process they get their masses inflated by a very
large factor until the feedback process becomes important, then with a
prolonged sub-Eddington accretion process they have their masses increased by a
factor $\ga 2$. The overall average efficiency of this two-phase process is
then $\ga 0.1$, and the existence of black holes of $10^9 M_\odot$ by redshift
6 is easily explained. Observational test of the existence of the
super-Eddington accretion phase is briefly discussed.

probes, such as the type Ia supernovae (SnIa), the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
(BAO) and the growth rate of matter perturbations. This is done by implementing
a model independent and bias-free reconstruction of the various scales and
distances that characterize the data, like the luminosity $d_L(z)$ and the
angular diameter distance $d_A(z)$ in the SnIa and BAO data, respectively, or
the dependence with redshift of the matter density $\om_m(a)$ in the growth
rate data, $f\sigma_8(z)$. These quantities can then be used to reconstruct the
expansion history of the Universe, and the resulting Dark Energy (DE) equation
of state $w(z)$ in the context of FRW models, or the mass radial function
$\om_M(r)$ in LTB models. In this way, the reconstruction is completely
independent of our prior bias. Furthermore, we use this method to test the
Etherington relation, ie the well-known relation between the luminosity and the
angular diameter distance, $\eta \equiv \frac{d_L(z)}{(1+z)^2 d_A(z)}$, which
is equal to 1 in metric theories of gravity. We find that the present data seem
to suggest a 3-$\sigma$ deviation from one at redshifts $z\sim 0.5$. Finally,
we present a novel way, within the Genetic Algorithm paradigm, to analytically
estimate the errors on the reconstructed quantities by calculating a Path
Integral over all possible functions that may contribute to the likelihood. We
show that this can be done regardless of the data being correlated or
uncorrelated with each other and we also explicitly demonstrate that our
approach is in good agreement with other error estimation techniques like the
Fisher Matrix approach and the Bootstrap Monte Carlo.

Let (M^n,g(t)) with t\in [-T,0] be a Ricci flow and H_{x} the conjugate heat
kernel centered at a point (x,0) in the final time slice. Substituting H_{x}
into Perelman's W-functional produces a monotone function W_{x}(s) of s \in
[-T,0], the pointed entropy, with W_{x}(s) <= 0, and W_{x}(s) = 0 iff (M,g(t))
is isometric to the trivial flow on R^n. Our main theorem asserts the
following: There exists an \epsilon>0, depending only on T and on lower scalar
curvature and \mu-entropy bounds for (M,g(-T)), such that W_{x_0}(s) >
-\epsilon implies |Rm|< r^{-2} on P_{\epsilon r}(x,0), where r^2 = |s| and
P_r(x,t) \equiv B_r(x,t)\times (t-r^2,t] is the parabolic ball.
  The main technical challenge of the theorem is to prove an effective
Lipschitz bound in x for the s-average of W_x(s). To accomplish this, we
require a new log-Sobolev inequality. It is well known by Perelman that the
metric measure spaces (M,g(t),dv_{g(t)}) satisfy a log-Sobolev; however we
prove that this is also true for the conjugate heat kernel weighted spaces
(M,g(t),H_{x}(-,t)\,dv_{g(t)}). Our log-Sobolev constants for these weighted
spaces are in fact universal and sharp.
  The weighted log-Sobolev has other consequences as well, including an average
Gaussian upper bound on the conjugate heat kernel that only depends on a
two-sided scalar curvature bound.

quite well. In this paper, we introduce some additional features into the model
and consider two specific cases. In the first case, a non-cooperative positive
feedback loop is included in the transcriptional regulation of the target gene
expression. In the second case, a stochastic version of the original model is
considered in which there are random transitions between the inactive and
active expression states of the gene. In the first case we show that
bistability is possible in a parameter regime, due to the presence of a
non-linear protein decay term in the gene expression dynamics. In the second
case, we derive the conditions for obtaining stochastic binary gene expression.
We find that this type of gene expression is more favourable in the case of
regulation by microRNAs as compared to the case of unregulated gene expression.
The theoretical predictions relating to binary gene expression are
experimentally testable.

Questions arising from diagrammatics, intermediate-states and order-by-order

curves outside the Local Group is rare. To date, the properties of the bump
have been examined in only two GRB afterglows (GRB 070802 and GRB 080607). In
this work we analyse in detail the detections of the 2175 extinction bump in
the optical spectra of the two further GRB afterglows: GRB 080605 and 080805.
We gather all available optical/NIR photometric, spectroscopic and X-ray data
to construct multi-epoch SEDs for both GRB afterglows. We fit the SEDs with the
Fitzpatrick & Massa (1990) model with a single or broken PL. We also fit a
sample of 38 GRB afterglows, known to prefer a SMC-type extinction curve, with
the same model. We find that the SEDs of GRB 080605 and GRB 080805 at two
epochs are fit well with a single PL with a derived extinction of A_V =
0.52(+0.13 -0.16) and 0.50 (+0.13 -0.10), and 2.1(+0.7-0.6) and 1.5+/-0.2
respectively. While the slope of the extinction curve of GRB 080805 is not
well-constrained, the extinction curve of GRB 080605 has an unusual very steep
far-UV rise together with the 2175 bump. Such an extinction curve has
previously been found in only a small handful of sightlines in the MW. One
possible explanation of such an extinction curve may be dust arising from two
different regions with two separate grain populations, however we cannot
distinguish the origin of the curve. We finally compare the four 2175 bump
sightlines to the larger GRB afterglow sample and to Local Group sightlines. We
find that while the width and central positions of the bumps are consistent
with what is observed in the Local Group, the relative strength of the detected
bump (A_bump) for GRB afterglows is weaker for a given A_V than for almost any
Local Group sightline. Such dilution of the bump strength may offer tentative
support to a dual dust-population scenario.

dominant effects from dispersion and periodic lattice potential are computed
together, while the non-periodic potential acts only as a perturbation. Because
the split-step communicator error between the periodic and non-periodic parts

the traditional splitting of the dispersion and potential operators. Indeed it
is shown by the given examples, that our method is unconditionally stable and
more efficient than the traditional split-step pseudo spectral schemes. To this

mass loss for massive star evolution. The reason is that stellar winds have
been found to be clumped, which results in the reduction of unclumped empirical
mass-loss rates. Most stellar evolution models employ theoretical mass-loss
rates which are already reduced by a moderate factor of ~2-3 compared to
non-corrected empirical rates. A key question is whether these reduced rates
are of the correct order of magnitude, or if they should be reduced even
further, which would mean that the alternative of eruptive mass loss becomes
necessary. Here we introduce the transition mass-loss rate (dM/dt)_trans
between O and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Its novelty is that it is model
independent. All that is required is postulating the spectroscopic transition
point in a given data-set, and determining the stellar luminosity, which is far
less model dependent than the mass-loss rate. The transition mass-loss rate is
subsequently used to calibrate stellar wind strength by its application to the
Of/WNh stars in the Arches cluster. Good agreement is found with two
alternative modelling/theoretical results, suggesting that the rates provided
by current theoretical models are of the right order of magnitude in the
~50Msun mass range. Our results do not confirm the specific need for eruptive
mass loss as Luminous Blue Variables, and current stellar evolution modelling
for Galactic massive stars seems sound. Mass loss through alternative
mechanisms might still become necessary at lower masses, and/or metallicities,
and the quantification of alternative mass loss is desirable.

while it is not necessarily correlated with the unit cell volume. The direction
of the major axis of the cross section of the Fermi surface lies in the
\Gamma-B direction, which differs from that obtained by the extended Huckel

they emerge as a consequence of remnant one-dimensional Umklapp scattering at
the momenta with vanishing interchain hopping matrix elements. In this
pseudogap phase, enhanced d-wave pairing correlations are driven by
antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Within the adopted cluster dynamical mean-field
theory on the $8\times 2$ cluster and down to our lowest temperatures the
transition from one to two dimensions is continuous.

is known for a problem. However, this assumption may not hold for many
real-world problems. For example, a classifier might need to be applied in
several circumstances, each of which associates with a different cost matrix.
Or, different human experts have different opinions about the costs for a given
problem. Motivated by these facts, this study aims to seek the minimax
classifier over multiple cost matrices. In summary, we theoretically proved
that, no matter how many cost matrices are involved, the minimax problem can be
tackled by solving a number of standard cost-sensitive problems and
sub-problems that involve only two cost matrices. As a result, a general
framework for achieving minimax classifier over multiple cost matrices is
suggested and justified by preliminary empirical studies.

scalar dressed black brane (BB) solutions of a recently proposed, exactly
integrable Einstein-scalar gravity model [1], which also arises as
compactification of (p-1)-branes with a smeared charge. The extremal, zero
temperature, solution is a scalar soliton interpolating between a conformal
invariant AdS vacuum in the near-horizon region and a scale covariant metric
(generating hyperscaling violation on the boundary field theory)
asymptotically. We show explicitly that for the boundary field theory this
implies the emergence of an UV length scale (related to the size of the brane),
which decouples in the IR, where conformal invariance is restored. We also show
that at high temperatures the system undergoes a phase transition. Whereas at
small temperature the Schwarzschild-AdS BB is stable, above a critical
temperature the scale covariant, scalar-dressed BB solution, becomes
energetically preferred. We calculate the critical exponent z and the
hyperscaling violation parameter of the scalar-dressed phase. In particular we
show that the hyperscaling violation parameter is always negative. We also show
that the above features are not a peculiarity of the exact integrable model of
Ref.[1], but are a quite generic feature of Einstein-scalar and
Einstein-Maxwell-scalar gravity models for which the squared-mass of the scalar
field is positive and the potential vanishes exponentially as the scalar field

expectation values of their respective fields are finite even without the
formal introduction of spurious Bose condensates for each of the bosonic
fields. The expectation values of the radial (real) fields are in fact to be
interpreted as the density of empty or singly occupied sites. Whereas the
radial representation of the Barnes slave bosons has been investigated before,
a setup for the functional integral of radial bosonic fields in the more
physical Kotliar-Ruckenstein representation has not been accomplished to date.
We implement a path integral procedure with suitable renormalization factors
for a strongly correlated two-site model which allows to control the formal
steps in the intricate evaluation, as the results for the partition function
and the expectation values are known from exact diagonalization for such a
minimal single impurity Anderson model. The partition function is shown to be a

The spectral resolution of the ACS prism spectra degrades from 300 at 1300 A to

other emission lines confirms the presence of an accretion disk, probably
diluted by the light of an early B star companion. The spectra differ strongly
from high mass X-ray binaries dominated by O star winds (e.g., Cyg X-1) and are
most similar to intermediate mass X-ray binary systems in the Milky Way and
LMC. This indicates that the mass transfer is due to Roche Lobe overflow. The

population, peculiar classes of isolated neutron stars (INSs) -- which include
magnetars, the ROSAT-discovered ""Magnificent Seven"" (M7), rotating radio
transients (RRATs), and central compact objects in supernova remnants (CCOs) --
represent a key element in understanding the neutron star phenomenology. We
report the results of an observational campaign to study the properties of the
source 2XMM J104608.7-594306. Its evolutionary state is investigated by means
of deep dedicated observations obtained with XMM-Newton, the ESO Very Large
Telescope, as well as publicly available gamma-ray data from the Fermi and
AGILE missions. The observations confirm previous expectations and reveal a
unique type of object. The source, which is likely within the Carina Nebula,
has a soft spectrum with absorption features and no magnetospheric emission.
The optical counterpart is fainter than V=27 and no gamma-ray emission is
significantly detected. Very interestingly, while these characteristics are
remarkably similar to those of the M7 or the only RRAT so far detected in
X-rays, which all have spin periods of a few seconds, we found intriguing
evidence of very rapid rotation, P=18.6 ms. We interpret these new results in
the light of the observed properties of the currently known neutron star
population, in particular those of standard rotation-powered pulsars, recycled
objects, and CCOs. We find that none of these scenarios can satisfactorily
explain the collective properties of 2XMM J104608.7-594306, although it may be
related to the still poorly known class of Galactic anti-magnetars. Future
XMM-Newton data, granted for the next cycle of observations (AO11), will help

out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer on 27.1 and 28.2 October 2007
UT, i.e., 4-5 days after the outburst. These observations probed the thermal
radiation of large dust particles, and therefore provide the best constraints
on the mass in the ejecta debris. The thermal emission of the debris was
modelled and coupled to a time-dependent description of their expansion after
the outburst. The analysis was performed in the Fourier plane. Visibilities
were computed for the two observing dates and compared to the data to measure
their velocity and mass. Optical data and 250-GHz continuum measurements
published in the literature were used to further constrain the dust kinematics
and size distribution. Two distinct dust components in terms of kinematic
properties are identified in the data. The large-velocity component, with
typical velocities V0 of 50-100 m/s for 1 mm particles, displays a steep size
distribution with a size index estimated to q = -3.7 (\pm0.1), assuming a
minimum grain size of 0.1 \mum. It corresponds to the fast expanding shell
observed in optical images. The slowly-moving ""core"" component (V0 = 7-9 m/s)
detected near the nucleus has a size index |q| < 3.4 and contains a higher
proportion of large particles than the shell. The dust mass in the core is in
the range 0.1-1 that of the shell. Using optical constants pertaining to porous
grains (50% porosity) made of astronomical silicates mixed with water ice (48%

efficiently coordinating physical activities with others. While specific forms
of social coordination can be seen in tools such as Evite, Meetup and Groupon,
we introduce a more general model using what we call enmeshed queries. An
enmeshed query allows users to declaratively specify an intent to coordinate by
specifying social attributes such as the desired group size and who/what/when,
and the database returns matching queries. Enmeshed queries are continuous, but
new queries (and not data) answer older queries; the variable group size also
makes enmeshed queries different from entangled queries, publish-subscribe
systems, and dating services.
  We show that even offline group coordination using enmeshed queries is
NP-hard. We then introduce efficient heuristics that use selective indices such
as location and time to reduce the space of possible matches; we also add
refinements such as delayed evaluation and using the relative matchability of
users to determine search order. We describe a centralized implementation and
evaluate its performance against an optimal algorithm. We show that the
combination of not stopping prematurely (after finding a match) and delayed
evaluation results in an algorithm that finds 86% of the matches found by an
optimal algorithm, and takes an average of 40 usec per query using 1 core of a
2.5 Ghz server machine. Further, the algorithm has good latency, is reasonably
fair to large group size requests, and can be scaled to global workloads using
multiple cores and multiple servers. We conclude by describing potential
generalizations that add prices, recommendations, and data mining to basic
enmeshed queries.

first realized in the 90s on the Morlet wavelet by M. Duval-Destin
\cite{Duval-Destin91a,Duval-Destin92}. This enabled to demonstrate the
capacities of the speed-tuned Morlet for psychovisual analysis. This
construction was also used very efficiently in a powerful aerial target
tracking algorithm by Mujica et al.\cite{Mujica99,Mujica2000}. In the last
decade, this tool was proposed as an elegant and efficient alternative
framework to the Optical Flow (OF), the Block Matching (BM) or the phase
difference, for the study of motion estimation in image sequences.
Nevertheless, the aperture selectivity of the 2D+T Morlet wavelet presents some
difficulties. Here we propose to replace the 2D Morlet wavelet by a
Gaussian-Conical (GC) wavelet for the spatial part of the spatio-temporal
wavelet, since the GC wavelet has a better aperture selectivity and allows a
very simple adjustment of the aperture. Therefore we build a new, highly
directional, speed-tuned wavelet called Gaussian-Conical-Morlet (GCM) wavelet.
Like the speed-tuned 2D+T Morlet, the new wavelet presents very good
characteristics in motion estimation and tracking, namely long temporal
dependence, robustness to noise and to occlusions, and supersedes the OF
(Optical Flow) and BM (Block Matching) techniques. However, for aperture
selectivity, directional speed-capture and spectral recognition and tracking,
GCM easily outperforms Morlet. This paper describes the GCM construction,
utilization and aperture performances.

electrical resistivity, Hall coefficient, and specific heat curves. Below T_N,
powder neutron diffraction measurements reveal an antiferromagnetic structure
of the Np sublattice, with an ordered magnetic moment of 1.70(0.07) \mu_B
aligned along the crystallographic c-axis. No magnetic order has been observed

measurements exclude the occurrence of lattice transformations down to 5 K, in
sharp contrast to the observation of a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic distortion in

norm through results due to Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o, Ni, and Hedden. For example,
given a closed 3-manifold Y, there is a bijection between vertices of the
HF^+(Y) polytope carrying the group Z and the faces of the Thurston norm unit
ball that correspond to fibrations of Y over the unit circle. Moreover, the
Thurston norm unit ball of Y is dual to the polytope of \underline{\hfhat}(Y).
  We prove a similar bijection and duality result for a class of 3-manifolds
with boundary called sutured manifolds. A sutured manifold is essentially a
cobordism between two surfaces R_+ and R_- that have nonempty boundary. We show
that there is a bijection between vertices of the sutured Floer polytope
carrying the group Z and equivalence classes of taut depth one foliations that
form the foliation cones of Cantwell and Conlon. Moreover, we show that a
function defined by Juh\'asz, which we call the geometric sutured function,is
analogous to the Thurston norm in this context. In some cases, this function is
an asymmetric norm and our duality result is that appropriate faces of this
norm's unit ball subtend the foliation cones.
  An important step in our work is the following fact: a sutured manifold
admits a fibration or a taut depth one foliation whose sole compact leaves are
exactly the connected components of R_+ and R_-, if and only if, there is a
surface decomposition of the sutured manifold resulting in a connected product
manifold.

semiconducting majority spin channel displays a very large in-plane component
of the Seebeck tensor at room temperature, $S$ = 1500 $\mu$V/K, and the
minority spin channel shows good in-plane conductivity $\sigma$ = 2.5

Dresselhaus model about enhanced global thermoelectric properties due to the
confinement of the metallic electrons, we find that the total power factor and
thermoelectric figure of merit for reduced doping is too small for practical
applications. The reason for this failure can be traced back on the electronic
structure of the interfacial gas, which departs from the free electron
behaviour on which the model was based. The evolution of the electronic
structure, electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and power factor as a
function of the chemical potential is explained by a simplified tight-binding
model. We find that the electron gas in our system is composed by a pair of one
dimensional electron gases orthogonal to each other. This reflects the fact the
physical dimensionality of the electronic system can be even smaller than that

population-level swimming-advection-diffusion model for suspensions of
micro-organisms in a vertical pipe flow. In particular, a combination of
gravitational and viscous torques acting on individual cells can affect their
swimming behaviour, which is termed gyrotaxis. This typically leads to local
cell drift and diffusion in a suspension of cells. In a flow in a pipe, small
amounts of radial drift across streamlines can have a major impact on the
effective axial drift and diffusion of the cells. We present a Galerkin method
to calculate the local mean swimming velocity and diffusion tensor based on
local shear for arbitrary flow rates. This method is validated with asymptotic
results obtained in the limits of weak and strong shear. We solve the resultant
swimming-advection-diffusion equation using numerical methods for the case of
imposed Poiseuille flow and investigate how the flow modifies the dispersion of
active swimmers from that of passive scalars. We establish that generalized
Taylor dispersion theory predicts an enhancement of gyrotactic focussing in
pipe flow with increasing shear strength, in contrast to earlier models. We
also show that biased swimming cells may behave very differently to passive
tracers, drifting axially at up to twice the rate and diffusing much less.

imprints on the CMB anisotropy likely represents a sufficiently accurate
modelling for the interpretation of current CMB data, a great attention has
been recently posed on the accurate computation of the reionization signatures
in the CMB for a large variety of astrophysical scenarios and physical
processes. This work is aimed at a careful characterization of the imprints
introduced in the polarization anisotropy, with particular attention to the
B-modes. We have implemented a modified version of CAMB, the Cosmological
Boltzmann code for computing the angular power spectrum (APS) of the
anisotropies of the CMB, to introduce the hydrogen and helium ionization
fractions predicted in astrophysical and phenomenological reionization
histories, beyond the simple {\tau}-parametrization. We compared the results
obtained for these models for all the non-vanishing (in the assumed scenarios)

particular, on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, and on the reionization history,
thus an accurate modeling of the reionization process will have implications
for the precise determination of r or to set more precise constraints on it

  As main application we prove that Euclidean \phi^4-quantum field theory on
four-dimensional Moyal space with harmonic propagation, taken at its
self-duality point and in the infinite volume limit, is exactly solvable and
non-trivial. This model is a quartic matrix model, where E has for N->\infty
the same spectrum as the Laplace operator in 4 dimensions. Using the theory of
singular integral equations of Carleman type we compute (for N->\infty and
after renormalisation of E,\lambda) the free energy density
(1/volume)\log(Z[E,J]/Z[E,0]) exactly in terms of the solution of a non-linear
integral equation. Existence of a solution is proved via the Schauder fixed

  The derivation of the non-linear integral equation relies on an assumption

inverse scattering which involves the S-matrix, which connects the interaction

determining the scattering S-matrix from the interaction potential between the
scattering particles, we do the inverse. That is to say, we calculate the
interaction potential from the S-matrix. This review explains how this can now
be done reliably, but the emphasis will be upon reasons why one should wish to

jets interacting with a two-phase fractal interstellar medium in the kpc-scale
core of galaxies using 29 3D grid-based hydrodynamical simulations. The
feedback efficiency, as measured by the amount of cloud-dispersal generated by
the jet-ISM interactions, is sensitive to the maximum size of clouds in the
fractal cloud distribution but not to their volume filling factor. Feedback
ceases to be efficient for Eddington ratios P_jet/L_edd<10^-4, although systems
with large cloud complexes ~50 pc require jets of Eddington ratio in excess of
10^-2 to disperse the clouds appreciably. Based on measurements of the bubble
expansion rates in our simulations we argue that sub-grid AGN prescriptions
resulting in negative feedback in cosmological simulations without a
multi-phase treatment of the ISM are good approximations if the volume filling
factor of warm phase material is less than 0.1 and the cloud complexes are
smaller than ~25 pc. We find that the acceleration of the dense embedded clouds
is provided by the ram pressure of the high velocity flow through the porous
channels of the warm phase, flow that has fully entrained the shocked hot-phase
gas it has swept up, and is additionally mass-loaded by ablated cloud material.
This mechanism transfers 10% to 40% of the jet energy to the cold and warm gas,
accelerating it within 10 to 100 Myr to velocities that match those observed in
a range of high and low redshift radio galaxies hosting powerful radio jets.

paper, we present the Gaussian beam method for the Dirac equation. With the
help of an eigenvalue decomposition, the Gaussian beams can be independently
evolved along each eigenspace and summed to construct an approximate solution
of the Dirac equation. Moreover, the proposed Eulerian Gaussian beam keeps the
advantages of constructing the Hessian matrices by simply using level set
