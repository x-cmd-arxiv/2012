density described by a holographic dual consisting of fermions in
Anti-de-Sitter space in the presence of a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. The
lattice effect is encoded by a periodic modulation of the chemical potential
with a wavelength of order of the intrinsic length scales of the system. This
corresponds with a highly complicated ""band structure"" problem in AdS, which we
only manage to solve in the weak potential limit. The ""domain wall"" fermions in
AdS encoding for the Fermi surfaces in the boundary field theory diffract as
usually against the periodic lattice, giving rise to band gaps. However, the
deep infrared of the field theory as encoded by the near horizon AdS2 geometry
in the bulk reacts in a surprising way to the weak potential. The hybridization
of the fermions bulk dualizes into a linear combination of CFT1 ""local quantum
critical"" propagators in the bulk, characterized by momentum dependent
exponents displaced by lattice Umklapp vectors. This has the consequence that
the metals showing quasi-Fermi surfaces cannot be localized in band insulators.
In the AdS2 metal regime, where the conformal dimension of the fermionic
operator is large and no Fermi surfaces are present at low T/\mu, the lattice
gives rise to a characteristic dependence of the energy scaling as a function
of momentum. We predict crossovers from a high energy standard momentum AdS2
scaling to a low energy regime where exponents found associated with momenta
""backscattered"" to a lower Brillioun zone in the extended zone scheme. We
comment on how these findings can be used as a unique fingerprint for the

high multiplicity remain heavily debated subjects in astrophysics. We have
performed a vast high-resolution radial velocity spectroscopic survey of about
250 O- and 540 B-type stars in the southern Milky Way which indicates that the
majority of stars (> 82%) with masses above 16 solar masses form close binary
systems while this fraction rapidly drops to 20% for stars of 3 solar masses.
The binary fractions of O- type stars among different environment classes are:
clusters (72 \pm 13%), associations (73 \pm 8%), field (43 \pm 13%), and
runaways (69 \pm 11%). The high frequency of close pairs with components of
similar mass argues in favour of a multiplicity originating from the formation
process rather than from a tidal capture in a dense cluster. The high binary
frequency of runaway O stars that we found in our survey (69% compared to
19-26% in previous surveys) points to the importance of ejection from young
star clusters and thus supports the competitive accretion scenario.

some of them grow by orders of magnitude in mass - lies in understanding the
dynamics of the stars in the galactic neighbourhood. Stars interact with the
central MBH primarily through their gradual inspiral due to the emission of
gravitational radiation. Also stars produce gases which will subsequently be
accreted by the MBH through collisions and disruptions brought about by the
strong central tidal field. Such processes can contribute significantly to the
mass of the MBH and progress in understanding them requires theoretical work in
preparation for future gravitational radiation millihertz missions and X-ray
observatories. In particular, a unique probe of these regions is the
gravitational radiation that is emitted by some compact stars very close to the

interferometer scrutinizing the range of masses fundamental to understanding
the origin and growth of supermassive black holes. By extracting the

that if there exists a toric degeneration of X satisfying some natural

completely integrable system on X in the sense of symplectic geometry. More
precisely, we construct a collection of real-valued functions H_1, ... H_n on X
which are continuous on all of X, smooth on an open dense subset U of X, and
pairwise Poisson-commute on U. Moreover, we show that in many cases, we can
construct the integrable system so that the functions H_1, ..., H_n generate a
Hamiltonian torus action on U. In the second part, we show that the toric
degenerations arising in the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies satisfy all the
hypotheses of the first part of the paper. In this case the image of the
""moment map"" \mu = (H_1, ..., H_n): X to R^n is precisely the Okounkov body
\Delta = \Delta(R, v) associated to the homogeneous coordinate ring R of X, and
an appropriate choice of a valuation v on R. Our main technical tools come from
algebraic geometry, differential (Kaehler) geometry, and analysis.
Specifically, we use the gradient-Hamiltonian vector field, and a subtle
generalization of the famous Lojasiewicz gradient inequality for real-valued
analytic functions. Since our construction is valid for a large class of
projective varieties X, this manuscript provides a rich source of new examples
of integrable systems. We discuss concrete examples, including elliptic curves,
flag varieties of arbitrary connected complex reductive groups, spherical
varieties, and weight varieties.

In addition, using orientation data, we find that sideways accelerations are
well explained by roll-based rotation of the lift vector. In contrast, the
insect's body pitch angle does not correlate with its forward acceleration.
This implies that controlling body roll is important to mosquito dynamics. The
dynamic importance of stabilizing body pitch and body yaw is less clear.

configurations of the disk and migrating SMBH system, self-consistently
accounting for tidal and viscous torques and heating, radiative diffusion
limited cooling, gas and radiation pressure, and the decay of the binary's
orbit. We obtain a ""phase diagram"" of the system as a function of binary
parameters, showing regimes in which both the disk structure and migration have
a different character. Although massive binaries can create a central gap in
the disk at large radii, the tidal barrier of the secondary causes a
significant pile-up of gas outside of its orbit, which can lead to the closing
of the gap. We find that this spillover occurs at an orbital separation as
large as ~200 M_7^{-1/2} gravitational radii, where M = 10^7 M_7 Msun is the
total binary mass. If the secondary is less massive than ~10^6 Msun, then the
gap is closed before gravitational waves (GWs) start dominating the orbital
decay. In this regime, the disk is still strongly perturbed, but the piled-up
gas continuously overflows as in a porous dam, and crosses inside the
secondary's orbit. The corresponding migration rate, which we label Type 1.5,
is slower than the usual limiting cases known as Type I and II migration.
Compared to an unperturbed disk, the steady-state disk in the overflowing
regime is up to several hundred times brighter in the optical bands. Surveys
such as PanSTARRS or LSST may discover the periodic variability of this
population of binaries. Our results imply that the circumbinary disks around
SMBHs can extend to small radii during the last stages of their merger, when
they are detectable by LISA, and may produce coincident electromagnetic (EM)
emission similar to active galactic nuclei (AGN).

stellar populations are dominated by carbon based absorption features offering
a wealth of information. Yet, spectral libraries that include the near-IR
wavelength range do not sample a sufficiently broad range of ages and
metallicities to allow for accurate calibration of stellar population models
and thus the interpretation of the observations. In this paper we investigate
the integrated J- and H-band spectra of six intermediate age (1-3 Gyr) and old
(>10 Gyr) globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using observations
obtained with the SINFONI IFU at the VLT. H-band C2 and K-band 12CO(2-0)
feature strengths are compared to the models of Maraston (2005). C2 is
reasonably well reproduced by the models at all ages, while 12CO(2-0) shows
good agreement for older (age>2 Gyr) populations, but the younger (1.3 Gyr)
globular clusters do not follow the models. We argue that this is due to the
fact that the empirical calibration of the models relies on only a few Milky
Way carbon star spectra, which show different 12CO(2-0) index strengths than
the LMC stars. The C2 absorption feature strength correlates strongly with age.
It is present essentially only in populations that have 1-2 Gyr old stars,
while its value is consistent with zero for older populations. The distinct
spectral energy distribution observed for the intermediate age globular
clusters in the J- and H-bands agrees well with the model predictions of
Maraston for the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant
branch phase (TP-AGB). We show that the H-band C2 absorption feature and the
J-, H-band spectral shape can be used as an age indicator for intermediate age
stellar populations in integrated spectra of star clusters and galaxies.

produce diffuse gamma ray emissions that are in tension with data measured by
Fermi-LAT. We point out that the tension could be alleviated if the dark matter
decays into three-body final states with a pair of leptons and a missing
particle. Using the goldstino decay in a certain class of supersymmetric
theories as a prime example, we demonstrate that simultaneous fits to the total
e+ + e- and the fractional e+/e- fluxes from Fermi-LAT and PAMELA could be
achieved for a 2 TeV parent particle and a 1 TeV missing particle, without
being constrained by gamma-ray measurements. By studying different effective
operators giving rise to the dark matter decay, we show that this feature is
generic for three-body decaying dark matter containing a missing particle.
Constraints on the hadronic decay widths from the cosmic anti-proton spectra

the ALFALFA blind HI survey. Our main result is that the bar fraction is
significantly lower among gas rich disc galaxies than gas poor ones. This is
not explained by known trends for more massive (stellar) and redder disc
galaxies to host more bars and have lower gas fractions: we still see at fixed
stellar mass a residual correlation between gas content and bar fraction. We
discuss three possible causal explanations: (1) bars in disc galaxies cause
atomic gas to be used up more quickly, (2) increasing the atomic gas content in
a disc galaxy inhibits bar formation, and (3) bar fraction and gas content are
both driven by correlation with environmental effects (e.g. tidal triggering of
bars, combined with strangulation removing gas). All three explanations are
consistent with the observed correlations. In addition our observations suggest
bars may reduce or halt star formation in the outer parts of discs by holding
back the infall of external gas beyond bar co-rotation, reddening the global
colours of barred disc galaxies. This suggests that secular evolution driven by
the exchange of angular momentum between stars in the bar, and gas in the disc,
acts as a feedback mechanism to regulate star formation in intermediate mass
disc galaxies.

stability of P4, the most recently discovered moon in the Pluto system. This
newfound companion orbits near the plane of the Pluto-Charon binary, roughly
halfway between the two minor moons Nix and Hydra. We use a suite of few body
integrations to constrain the masses of Nix and Hydra, and the orbital
parameters of P4. For the system to remain stable over the age of the Solar
System, the masses of Nix and Hydra likely do not exceed 5e16 kg and 9e16 kg,
respectively. These upper limits assume a fixed mass ratio between Nix and
Hydra at the value implied by their median optical brightness. Our study finds
that stability is more sensitive to their total mass and that a downward
revision of Charon's eccentricity (from our adopted value of 0.0035) is
unlikely to significantly affect our conclusions. Our upper limits are an order
of magnitude below existing astrometric limits on the masses of Nix and Hydra.
For a density at least that of ice, the albedos of Nix and Hydra would exceed
0.3. This constraint implies they are icy, as predicted by giant impact models.
Even with these low masses, P4 only remains stable if its eccentricity e <
0.02. The 5:1 commensurability with Charon is particularly unstable, Combining
stability constraints with the observed mean motion places the preferred orbit
for P4 just exterior to the 5:1 resonance. These predictions will be tested
when the New Horizons satellite visits Pluto. Based on the results for the
Pluto-Charon system, we expect that circumbinary, multi-planet systems will be
more widely spaced than their singleton counterparts. Further, circumbinary
exoplanets close to the three-body stability boundary, such as those found by

the first unambiguous numerical evidence showing that in ladder systems, a

quasiparticle. Specifically, the injected hole is found to be always localized
as long as the leg number is larger than one, with a vanishing quasiparticle
weight and a localization length monotonically decreasing with the leg number.
In addition, the single hole self-localization is insensitive to the parity
(even-odd) of the leg number. Our findings may advance conceptual developments
in different fields of condensed matter physics. First of all, the intriguing
self-localization phenomenon is of pure strong correlation origin free of
extrinsic disorders. Therefore, it is in sharp contrast to the well-known
Anderson localization and recently found many-body localization, where
extrinsic disordered potentials play crucial roles. Second, they confirm the

does not require the mechanical resonator to be prepared initially in its

interference-enhanced transfer schemes, and provide an enhanced discussion of
how the interference physics here is intimately related to the optomechanical

the same problem regarding ferromagnets in two spatial dimensions, to the best

present paper the low-temperature properties of two-dimensional ideal

discussed, including the effect of a weak external magnetic field. Our results

interaction only sets in at three-loop order. In particular, there is no
interaction term of order $T^3$ in the low-temperature series for the free
energy density. This is the analog of the statement that, in the case of
three-dimensional ferromagnets, there is no interaction term of order $T^4$ in

(20CR), which assimilates only surface pressure reports, sea-ice, and sea
surface temperature distributions, represents the longest global reanalysis
dataset available covering the period from 1871 to the present. Currently, the
20CR dataset is extensively used for the assessment of climate variability and
trends. Here, we compare the variability and long-term trends in Northeast
Atlantic storminess derived from 20CR and from observations. A well established
storm index derived from pressure observations over a relatively densely
monitored marine area is used. It is found that both, variability and long-term
trends derived from 20CR and from observations, are inconsistent. In
particular, both time series show opposing trends during the first half of the

similar behavior. While the variability and long-term trend derived from the
observations are supported by a number of independent data and analyses, the
behavior shown by 20CR is quite different, indicating substantial
inhomogeneities in the reanalysis most likely caused by the increasing number
of observations assimilated into 20CR over time. The latter makes 20CR likely
unsuitable for the identification of trends in storminess in the earlier part

reconfirm previous findings that care is needed in general, when global

Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature (CRSF) centroid energy on pulse-to-pulse

variability are observed. For sources in group 1, the CRSF energy is negatively
correlated with the variable source luminosity, and for sources in group 2, the
opposite behavior is observed. The physical basis for this bimodal behavior is
currently not understood. We explore the hypothesis that the accretion dynamics
in the group 1 sources is dominated by radiation pressure near the stellar
surface, and that Coulomb interactions decelerate the gas to rest in the group
2 sources. We derive a new expression for the critical luminosity such that
radiation pressure decelerates the matter to rest in the supercritical sources.
The formula for the critical luminosity is evaluated for 5 sources, using the
maximum value of the CRSF centroid energy to estimate the surface magnetic
field strength. The results confirm that the group 1 sources are supercritical
and the group 2 sources are subcritical, although the situation is less clear
for those highly variable sources that cross over the critical line. We also
explain the variation of the CRSF energy with luminosity as a consequence of
the variation of the characteristic emission height. The sign of the height
variation is opposite in the supercritical and subcritical cases, hence
creating the observed bimodal behavior.

determines precisely which index lists arise from pseudo-Anosov mapping
classes. Since the ideal Whitehead graph gives a finer invariant in the
analogous setting of a fully irreducible outer automorphism, we instead focus
on determining which of the 21 connected, loop-free, 5-vertex graphs are ideal
Whitehead graphs of ageometric, fully irreducible outer automorphisms of the
free group of rank 3. Our main theorem accomplishes this by showing that there
are precisely 18 graphs arising as such. We also give a method for identifying
certain complications called periodic Nielsen paths, prove the existence of
conveniently decomposed representatives of ageometric, fully irreducible outer
automorphisms having connected, loop-free, (2r-1)-vertex ideal Whitehead

fully irreducible outer automorphisms. The methods we use for constructing
fully irreducible outer automorphisms of free groups, as well as our

broadcasting a set of data packets to a number of users. The links from the
source to the users are modeled as independent erasure channels. Users are
allowed to inform the source node whether a packet is received correctly via
feedback channels. In order to minimize the number of packet transmissions
until all users have received all packets successfully, it is necessary that a
data packet, if successfully received by a user, can increase the dimension of
the vector space spanned by the encoding vectors he or she has received by one.
Such an encoding vector is called innovative. We prove that innovative linear
network code is uniformly optimal in minimizing user download delay. When the
finite field size is strictly smaller than the number of users, the problem of
determining the existence of innovative vectors is proven to be NP-complete.
When the field size is larger than or equal to the number of users, innovative
vectors always exist and random linear network code (RLNC) is able to find an
innovative vector with high probability. While RLNC is optimal in terms of
completion time, it has high decoding complexity due to the need of solving a
system of linear equations. To reduce decoding time, we propose the use of
sparse linear network code, since the sparsity property of encoding vectors can
be exploited when solving systems of linear equations. Generating a sparsest
encoding vector with large finite field size, however, is shown to be NP-hard.
An approximation algorithm that guarantee the Hamming weight of a generated
encoding vector to be smaller than a certain factor of the optimal value is
constructed. Our simulation results show that our proposed methods have
excellent performance in completion time and outperforms RLNC in terms of
decoding time.

examine its nature. It is, by far, the only data with the highest signal
statistic in 0.4 -- 10 keV range. Despite being able to reproduce the X-ray
spectrum, Comptonization of the disk photons failed to give a physically
meaningful solution. A modified version of the multi-color disk model, in which
the dependence of the disk temperature on the radius is described as r^(-p)
with p being a free parameter, can also approximate the spectrum. From this
model, the innermost disk temperature and bolometric luminosity were obtained
as T_in = 2.00-0.05+0.06 keV and L_disk = 1.36 x 10^39 (cos i)^(-1) ergs/s,
respectively, where i is the disk inclination. A small temperature gradient of
p = 0.535-0.005+0.004, together with the high disk temperature, is regarded as
the signatures of the slim accretion disk model, suggesting that M33 X-8 was
accreting at high mass accretion rate. With a correction factor for the slim
disk taken into account, the innermost disk radius, R_in =81.9-6.5+5.9 (cos
i)^(-0.5) km, corresponds to the black hole mass of M \sim 10 M_sun (cos
i)^(-0.5). Accordingly, the bolometric disk luminosity is estimated to be about
80 (cos i)^(-0.5)% of the Eddington limit. A numerically calculated slim disk
spectrum was found to reach a similar result. Thus, the extremely
super-Eddington luminosity is not required to explain the nature of M33 X-8.
This conclusion is utilized to argue for the existence of intermediate mass
black holes with M > 100 M_sun radiating at the sub/trans-Eddington luminosity,
among ultraluminous X-ray sources with L_disk > 10^(40) ergs/s.

  System under Unknown Channel Orders and Doppler Frequencies",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, channel estimation and data detection for multihop relaying
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is investigated under
time-varying channel. Different from previous works, which highly depend on the
statistical information of the doubly-selective channel (DSC) and noise to
deliver accurate channel estimation and data detection results, we focus on
more practical scenarios with unknown channel orders and Doppler frequencies.
Firstly, we integrate the multilink, multihop channel matrices into one
composite channel matrix. Then, we formulate the unknown channel using
generalized complex exponential basis expansion model (GCE-BEM) with a large
oversampling factor to introduce channel sparsity on delay-Doppler domain. To
enable the identification of nonzero entries, sparsity enhancing Gaussian
distributions with Gamma hyperpriors are adopted. An iterative algorithm is
developed under variational inference (VI) framework. The proposed algorithm
iteratively estimate the channel, recover the unknown data using Viterbi
algorithm and learn the channel and noise statistical information, using only
limited number of pilot subcarrier in one OFDM symbol. Simulation results show
that, without any statistical information, the performance of the proposed
algorithm is very close to that of the optimal channel estimation and data
detection algorithm, which requires specific information on system structure,
channel tap positions, channel lengths, Doppler shifts as well as noise powers.

1.2B ejecta which we artificially mix to alter the chemical stratification.
While the total 56Ni mass influences the LC peak, the spatial distribution of
56Ni, controlled by mixing processes, impacts both the multi-band LCs and
spectra. With enhanced mixing, our synthetic LCs start their post-breakout
re-brightening phase earlier, follow a more gradual rise to peak, appear
redder, and fade faster after peak due to enhanced gamma-ray escape.
Non-thermal electrons, crucial for the production of HeI lines, deposit a
dominant fraction of their energy as heat. Because energy deposition is
generally local well after the LC peak, the broad HeI lines characteristic of
maximum-light SN IIb/Ib spectra require mixing that places 56Ni and helium
nuclei to within a gamma-ray mean-free-path. This requirement indicates that
SNe IIb and Ib most likely arise from the explosion of stripped-envelope
massive stars (main-sequence masses \leq25Msun) that have evolved through
mass-transfer in a binary system, rather than from more massive single WR
stars. In contrast, the lack of HeI lines in SNe Ic may result from a variety
of causes: A genuine helium deficiency; strongly-asymmetric mixing; weak
mixing; or a more massive, perhaps single, progenitor characterized by a larger
oxygen-rich core. Our models, subject to different mixing magnitudes, can
produce a variety of SN types, including IIb, IIc, Ib, and Ic. As it is poorly
constrained by explosion models, mixing challenges our ability to infer the
progenitor and explosion properties of SNe IIb/Ib/Ic.

second order type, as expected on general grounds. The corresponding critical
exponents are, however, of the mean-field type. Using a ""RG-improved"" version

the exponents are modified. In particular, the exponent delta, which relates

respect to the potential. Moreover we not only prove the continuity of the
equilibrium states and their metric entropy as well as the differentiability of
the maximal entropy measure and extremal Lyapunov exponents with respect to the
dynamics. We also prove a local large deviations principle and central limit
theorem and show that the rate function, mean and variance vary continuously
with respect to observables, potentials and dynamics. Finally, we show that the

is of great importance for understanding the dynamics of charmonium decays. The
information of the phase can be obtained model-independently by fitting the
scan data of some special decay channels, one of which is $\psi^{\prime} \to
K^{+}K^{-}$. To find out the optimal data taking strategy for a scan experiment
in the measurement of the phase in $\psi^{\prime} \to K^{+} K^{-}$, the
minimization process is analyzed from a theoretical point of view. The result
indicates that for one parameter fit, only one data taking point in the
vicinity of a resonance peak is sufficient to acquire the optimal precision.
Numerical results are obtained by fitting simulated scan data. Besides the
results related to the relative phase between strong and electromagnetic
amplitudes, the method is extended to analyze the fits of other resonant
parameters, such as the mass and the total decay width of $\psi^{\prime}$.

and anomalous negative transmission in a self-sustained rectangular dielectric
grating slab in P polarization and for incidence angle not very far from the
Brewster's angle of the equivalent slab, are investigated. Notice, that the
self sustained dielectric grating slab is the simplest system that, due to the
Bragg diffraction, can show both the former optical effects. A systematic study
of its optical response is performed by an analytical exact solution of the
Maxwell equations for a general incidence geometry. At variance of the well
known broad reflection bands in high contrast dielectric grating slab in the
sub-wavelength regime, obtained by the destructive interference between the
travelling fundamental wave and the first diffracted wave (a generalization of
the so called second kind Wood's anomalies), the giant reflection band is a
subtle effect due to the interplay, as well as among the travelling fundamental
wave and the first quasi-guided diffracted one, also among the higher in-plane
wave- vector components of the evanescent/divergent waves. To better describe
this effect we will compare the optical response of the self-sustained high
contrast dielectric grating slab with a system composed by an equivalent
homogeneous slab with a thin rectangular high contrast dielectric grating
engraved in one of the two surfaces, usually taken as a prototype for the
second kind Wood's anomalies generation. Finally, the electromagnetic field
confinement in a patterned planar cavity, where the mirrors are two
self-sustained rectangular dielectric grating slabs, is briefly discussed.

The aim of this study is to determine the conditions under which the gaseous

picture requested to trigger the underlying turbulent behavior. We focus our
attention to the generalized Ohm equation in order to understand if the plasma
backreaction is able to provide the proper toroidal current, allowing a
non-zero infalling velocity. In the limit of linear plasma backreaction, this
analysis shows how the Shakura profile of accretion turns out to be
inconsistent. In particular, comparing the azimuthal and the generalized Ohm
equilibrium equations, we argue that it is not possible to maintain a constant
rate of accretion. A non-stationary scenario for the disk configuration is then
outlined and it results into a transient process which is however associated to
a vanishing accretion rate.

shapes. In addition, their widths are much wider than can be accounted for
purely by stellar rotation. This excess broadening is often referred to as
macroturbulence. Both effects have been linked to stellar oscillations, but B
supergiants have not been systematically searched yet for the presence of
especially short-term variability caused by stellar pulsations. We have started
an observational campaign to investigate the line profile variability of
photospheric lines in a sample of Galactic B supergiants. These observations
aim to improve our understanding of the physical effects acting in the
atmospheres of evolved massive stars. We obtained four time-series of
high-quality optical spectra for the Galactic B supergiant HD 202850. The
spectral coverage of about 500 A around Halpha encompasses the Si II (6347 A,
6371 A), and the He I (6678 A) photospheric lines. The line profiles were
analysed by means of the moment method. The time-series of the photospheric Si
II and He I lines display a simultaneous, periodic variability in their profile
shapes. Proper analysis revealed a period of 1.59 h in all three lines. This
period is found to be stable with time over the observed span of 19 months.
This period is much shorter than the rotation period of the star and might be
ascribed to stellar oscillations. Since the star seems to fall outside the
currently known pulsational instability domains, the nature of the discovered
oscillation remains unclear.

constant-space are Turing-equivalent. More specifically, we show that for any
Turing-recognizable language, there exists a constant-space weak-qAM system,
(the nonmembers do not need to be rejected with high probability), and we show
that any Turing-recognizable language can be recognized by a constant-space
qATM even with one-way input head.
  For strong proof systems, where the nonmembers must be rejected with high

can also be simulated by our public qAM system with the same space bound.
Besides, we introduce a strong version of qATM: The qATM that must halt in

ATMs) can simulate deterministic space with exponentially less space. This
leads to shifting the deterministic space hierarchy exactly by one-level. The

observations, we find that a large proportion of the aperture magnitudes suffer
a ~0.2-2% systematic trend as a function of PSF full-width half-maximum (FWHM),
the amplitude of which increases for fainter objects. Analysis of the PSF
magnitudes reveals more complicated systematic trends of similar amplitude as a
function of PSF FWHM and object brightness. We suspect that sky
over-subtraction is the cause of the largest amplitude trends as a function of
PSF FWHM. We also detect systematic trends as a function of subpixel
coordinates for the PSF magnitudes with peak-to-peak amplitudes of ~1.6 mmag
and ~4-7 mmag for the over- and under-sampled images, respectively. We note
that the systematic trends are similar in amplitude to the reported ~1% and ~2%
precision of the SDSS photometry in the griz and u wavebands, respectively, and
therefore their correction has the potential to substantially improve the SDSS
photometric precision. We provide an {\tt IDL} program specifically for this
purpose. Finally, we note that the SDSS aperture and PSF magnitude scales are
related by a non-linear transformation that departs from linearity by ~1-4%,
which, without correction, invalidates the application of a photometric
calibration model derived from the aperture magnitudes to the PSF magnitudes,

with two torsion functions are presented. These solutions give a essentially
different explanation from the one in most of previous works to the cause of
the accelerating cosmological expansion and the origin of the torsion of the
spacetime. These solutions can be divided into two classes. The solutions in
the first class define the critical points of a dynamical system representing
an asymptotically stable de Sitter spacetime. The solutions in the second class
have exact analytic expressions which have never been found in the literature.
The acceleration equation of the universe in general relativity is only a
special case of them. These solutions indicate that even in vacuum the
spacetime can be endowed with torsion, which means that the torsion of the
spacetime has an intrinsic nature and a geometric origin. In these solutions
the acceleration of the cosmological expansion is due to either the scalar
torsion or the pseudoscalar torsion function. Neither a cosmological constant
nor dark energy is needed. It is the torsion of the spacetime that causes the
accelerating expansion of the universe in vacuum. All the effects of the
inflation, the acceleration and the phase transformation from deceleration to
acceleration can be explained by these solutions. Furthermore, the energy and
pressure of the matter without spin can produce the torsion of the spacetime
and make the expansion of the universe decelerate as well as accelerate.

  This paper has three main contributions: Firstly, we rephrase a large set of
popular similarity measures into a common framework, which we refer to as
Locally Orderless Registration, and which makes full use of the features of
local histograms. Secondly, we extend the theoretical understanding of the
local histograms. Thirdly, we use our framework to compare two state-of-the-art
intensity density estimators for image registration: The Parzen Window (PW) and
the Generalized Partial Volume (GPV), and we demonstrate their differences on a
popular similarity measure, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).
  We conclude, that complicated similarity measures such as NMI may be
evaluated almost as fast as simple measures such as Sum of Squared Distances
(SSD) regardless of the choice of PW and GPV. Also, GPV is an asymmetric
measure, and PW is our preferred choice.

combines two techniques, namely, the reconstruction of a highly non-generic
braid monodromy with a systematic method to go from a non-generic to a generic
braid monodromy. This ""generification"" method is independent from Kummer covers
and can be applied in more general circumstances since non generic braid
monodromies appear more naturally and are oftentimes much easier to compute.
Explicit examples are computed using these techniques.

numerically in the terahertz range where the transverse-optical (TO) phonons
play the role of a mediator which strongly couples the ultrasound and light
fields. A propagating acoustic wave interacts with the TO phonons via
anharmonic channels and opens band gaps in the TO-phonon polariton energy
dispersion that results in pronounced Bragg scattering and reflection of the
incoming light. The separation in frequency of different Bragg replicas, which
is at the heart of acousto-optics, allows us to study the resonant
acousto-optic effect in the most simple and efficient geometry of collinear
propagation of electromagnetic and ultrasonic waves. The acoustically induced
energy gaps, Bragg reflection spectra, and the spatial distribution of the
electric field and polarization are calculated for CuCl parameters, in a wide
range of frequencies and intensities of the pumping acoustic wave. Our results
show drastic changes in terahertz spectra of semiconductor crystals that opens
the way for efficient and accessible manipulation of their infrared properties,

two-dimensional subdivisions via randomized incremental construction,
implemented in CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library. We can now
guarantee that the constructed directed acyclic graph G is of linear size and
provides logarithmic query time. Via the construction of the Voronoi diagram
for a given point set S of size n, this also enables nearest-neighbor queries
in guaranteed O(log n) time. Another major innovation is the support of general
unbounded subdivisions as well as subdivisions of two-dimensional parametric
surfaces such as spheres, tori, cylinders. The implementation is exact,
complete, and general, i.e., it can also handle non-linear subdivisions. Like
the previous version, the data structure supports modifications of the
subdivision, such as insertions and deletions of edges, after the initial
preprocessing. A major challenge is to retain the expected O(n log n)
preprocessing time while providing the above (deterministic) space and
query-time guarantees. We describe an efficient preprocessing algorithm, which
explicitly verifies the length L of the longest query path in O(n log n) time.
However, instead of using L, our implementation is based on the depth D of G.
Although we prove that the worst case ratio of D and L is Theta(n/log n), we
conjecture, based on our experimental results, that this solution achieves
expected O(n log n) preprocessing time.

frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission systems is considered to
improve the system performance over simple amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying.
Unlike conventional OFDM relays performing OFDM demodulation and remodulation,
to reduce processing complexity, the proposed FF relay directly filters the
incoming signal in time domain with a finite impulse response (FIR) and
forwards the filtered signal to the destination. Three design criteria are
considered to optimize the relay filter. The first criterion is the
minimization of the relay transmit power subject to per-subcarrier
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints, the second is the maximization of the
worst subcarrier channel SNR subject to source and relay transmit power
constraints, and the third is the maximization of data rate subject to source
and relay transmit power constraints. It is shown that the first problem
reduces to a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem by semi-definite
relaxation and the solution to the relaxed SDP problem has rank one under a
mild condition. For the latter two problems, the problem of joint source power
allocation and relay filter design is considered and an efficient algorithm is
proposed for each problem based on alternating optimization and the projected
gradient method (PGM). Numerical results show that the proposed FF relay
significantly outperforms simple AF relays with insignificant increase in
complexity. Thus, the proposed FF relay provides a practical alternative to the
AF relaying scheme for OFDM transmission.

more interesting interaction that can be tested through this channel is the
(ttbar hh) coupling. This interaction vanishes in the Standard Model and is a
genuine signature of theories in which the Higgs boson emerges from a
strongly-interacting sector. In this paper we perform a model-independent

rest-frame wavelengths of strong optical emission lines in nine sub-mm-luminous
galaxies (SMGs) at 2.0<z<2.7. The GEMINI-NIFS and VLT-SINFONI imaging
spectroscopy allows the mapping of the gas morphologies and dynamics within the
sources, and we measure an average Halpha velocity dispersion of
sigma=220+-80km/s and an average half light radius of r=3.7+-0.8kpc. The
average dynamical measure, V_obs/2sigma=0.9+-0.1 for the SMGs, is higher than
in more quiescent star-forming galaxies at the same redshift, highlighting a
difference in the dynamics of the two populations. The SMGs' far-infrared SFRs,
measured using Herschel-SPIRE far-infrared photometry, are on average
370+-90Mo/yr which is ~2 times higher than the extinction corrected SFRs of the
more quiescent star-forming galaxies. Six of the SMGs in our sample show strong
evidence for kinematically distinct multiple components with average velocity
offsets of 200+-100km/s and average projected spatial offsets of 8+-2kpc, which
we attribute to systems in the early stages of major mergers. Indeed all SMGs
are classified as mergers from a kinemetry analysis of the velocity and
dispersion field asymmetry. We bring together our sample with seven other SMGs
with IFU observations to describe the ionized gas morphologies and kinematics
in a sample of 16 SMGs. By comparing the velocity and spatial offsets of the
SMG Halpha components with sub-halo offsets in the Millennium simulation
database we infer an average halo mass for SMGs of 13<log(M[h^-1Mo])<14.
Finally we explore the relationship between the velocity dispersion and star
formation intensity within the SMGs, finding the gas motions are consistent
with the Kennicutt-Schmidt law and a range of extinction corrections, although
might also be driven by the tidal torques from merging or even the star
formation itself.

elements of ~800AU. Results: NGC7538IRS1 remains a single compact and massive
gas core with extraordinarily high column densities, corresponding to visual
extinctions on the order of 10^5mag, and average densities within the central
2000AU of ~2.1x10^9cm^-3 that have not been measured before. We identify a
velocity gradient across in northeast-southwest direction that is consistent

reveal strong blue- and red-shifted absorption toward the mm continuum peak

the order of 10^-2 Msun/yr. Although we cannot prove that the gas will be
accreted in the end, the data are consistent with ongoing star formation
activity in a scaled-up low-mass star formation scenario. Compared to that,
NGC7538S fragments in a hierarchical fashion into several sub-sources. While
the kinematics of the main mm peak are dominated by the accompanying jet, we
find rotational signatures from a secondary peak. Furthermore, strong spectral
line differences exist between the sub-sources which is indicative of different

differential emission measure distributions, we build synthetic spectra to
establish the main emission-line contributors in the AIA bands. We find that
the Fe IX line always dominates the 171 band, even in the absence of plasma at
> 10^6 K temperatures, while the 131 band is dominated by Fe VIII. We conclude
that the PCTR has sufficient plasma emitting at > 4 10^5 K to be detected by

basis of the perturbation theory. The binding energies, wave functions and

numerically. It is shown that with an increase of the anisotropy degree the
oscillator strengths are markedly redistributed between optically active and

empirical ""laws"", discovered in the beginning of the 20th century. MLR is still
used to estimate stellar masses for nearby stars, particularly for those that
are not binary systems, hence the mass cannot be derived directly from the
observations. It's well known that the MLR has a statistical dispersion which
cannot be explained exclusively due to the observational errors in luminosity
(or mass). It is an intrinsic dispersion caused by the differences in age and
chemical composition from star to star. In this work we discuss the impact of
age and metallicity on the MLR. Using the recent data on mass, luminosity,
metallicity, and age for 26 FGK stars (all members of binary systems, with
observational mass-errors <= 3%), including the Sun, we derive the MLR taking
into account, separately, mass-luminosity, mass-luminosity-metallicity, and
mass-luminosity-metallicity-age. Our results show that the inclusion of age and
metallicity in the MLR, for FGK stars, improves the individual mass estimation
by 5% to 15%.

investigate the non-thermal processes in the starburst galaxy NGC 253. The VHE

normalisation at 1 TeV of F_0 = (9.6 \pm 1.5_stat (+5.7,-2.9)_sys) x 10^{-14}

20% of the energy of the cosmic rays capable of producing hadronic interactions
is channeled into pion production. The smooth alignment between the spectra in
the HE and VHE \gamma-ray domain suggests that the same transport processes
dominate in the entire energy range. Advection is most likely responsible for
charged particle removal from the starburst nucleus from GeV to multiple TeV
energies. In a hadronic scenario for the \gamma-ray production, the single
overall power-law spectrum observed would therefore correspond to the mean
energy spectrum produced by the ensemble of cosmic-ray sources in the starburst

plasma observed in the solar corona are based on short bursts of energy. The
intensities and velocities measured in the cores of quiescent active regions,
however, can be steady over many hours of observation. One heating scenario
that has been proposed to reconcile such observations with impulsive heating
models is the ""long nanoflare storm,"" where short duration heating events occur
infrequently on many sub-resolutions strands; the emission of the strands is
then averaged together to explain the observed steady structures. In this
Letter, we examine the emission measure distribution predicted for such a long
nanoflare storm by modeling an arcade of strands in an active region core.
Comparisons of the computed emission measure distributions with recent
observations indicate that that the long nanoflare storm scenario implies
greater than 5 times more 1 MK emission than is actually observed for all
plausible combinations of loop lengths, heating rates, and abundances. We
conjecture that if the plasma had ""super coronal"" abundances, the model may be
able to match the observations at low temperatures.

dynamics. Based on a detailed analysis of the structure of the light-front
Poincar\'e algebra, the formalism is then generalized to all orders in the
interaction. The interacting theory, being a deformation of the free theory,
takes the form of a strongly homotopy Lie algebra. It is conjectured that the
ensuing recursive equations, if they can be explicitly solved, will encode all
interaction data into a denumerable set of functions of p+, the overall
transverse momentum structure being fixed already at the kinematical level.
