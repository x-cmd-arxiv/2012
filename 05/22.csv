The vector $\beta$ is unknown but is sparse in the sense that most of its
coordinates are $0$. The main interest is to separate its nonzero coordinates
from the zero ones (i.e., variable selection). Motivated by examples in
long-memory time series (Fan and Yao [Nonlinear Time Series: Nonparametric and
Parametric Methods (2003) Springer]) and the change-point problem (Bhattacharya
[In Change-Point Problems (South Hadley, MA, 1992) (1994) 28-56 IMS]), we are
primarily interested in the case where the Gram matrix $G=X'X$ is nonsparse but
sparsifiable by a finite order linear filter. We focus on the regime where
signals are both rare and weak so that successful variable selection is very
challenging but is still possible. We approach this problem by a new procedure
called the covariate assisted screening and estimation (CASE). CASE first uses
a linear filtering to reduce the original setting to a new regression model
where the corresponding Gram (covariance) matrix is sparse. The new covariance
matrix induces a sparse graph, which guides us to conduct multivariate
screening without visiting all the submodels. By interacting with the signal
sparsity, the graph enables us to decompose the original problem into many
separated small-size subproblems (if only we know where they are!). Linear
filtering also induces a so-called problem of information leakage, which can be
overcome by the newly introduced patching technique. Together, these give rise
to CASE, which is a two-stage screen and clean [Fan and Song Ann. Statist. 38
(2010) 3567-3604; Wasserman and Roeder Ann. Statist. 37 (2009) 2178-2201]

and screening, and then re-examine each candidate to remove false positives.

number of terms in the series K plays the lead role in the computational cost

BATHFIT 1, whose input is any spectral distribution functions J(w) or bath

{p_k,w_k}_k=1^K such that for a given value of K, the series {\Sigma}_k^k p_k

represent a(t) as accurately as possible with as few parameters as possible.
The program executes non-linear least squares fitting, and for a very wide
variety of spectral distribution functions, competent starting parameters are
used for these fits. For most forms of J(w), these starting parameters, and the
exact a(t) corresponding to the given J(w), are calculated using the recent
Pade decomposition technique - therefore this program can also be used to
merely implement the Pade decomposition for these spectral distribution
functions; and it can also be used just to efficiently and accurately calculate
a(t) for any given J(w) . The program also gives the J(w) corresponding to a
given a(t), which may allow one to assess the quality (in the w-domain) of a
representation of a(t) being used. Finally, the program can calculate the
discretized influence functional coefficients for any J(w), and this is
computed very efficiently for most forms of J(w) by implementing the recent

complex-valued coefficients on the plane leads to bicomplex Vekua equations. To
the difference of complex pseudoanalytic (generalized analytic) functions the
theory of bicomplex functions has not been developed. Such basic facts as the
similarity principle or the Liouville theorem in general are no longer
available due to the presence of zero divisors in the algebra of bicomplex
numbers. We develop a theory of bicomplex pseudoanalytic formal powers
analogous to the developed by Bers and obtain Cauchy's integral formula in the
bicomplex setting. In the classical complex situation this formula was obtained
under the assumption that the involved Cauchy kernel is global, a restrictive
condition taking into account possible applications, especially when the
equation itself is not defined on the whole plane. We show that the Cauchy
integral formula remains valid with a Cauchy kernel from a wider class called
here the reproducing Cauchy kernels. We give a complete characterization of
this class. To our best knowledge these results are new even for complex Vekua
equations. We establish that reproducing Cauchy kernels can be used to obtain a
full set of negative formal powers for the corresponding bicomplex Vekua
equation and present an algorithm for their construction. Bicomplex Vekua
equations of a special form called main Vekua equations are closely related to
Schr\""odinger equations with complex-valued potentials. We use this relation to
establish connections between the reproducing Cauchy kernels and the
fundamental solutions for the Schr\""odinger operators which allow one to
construct the Cauchy kernel when the fundamental solution is known and vice
versa as well as to construct the fundamental solutions for the Darboux
transformed Schr\""odinger operators.

convergence results for vector-valued regression to the embedding problem we
derive minimax convergence rates which are O(\log(n)/n) -- compared to current
state of the art rates of O(n^{-1/4}) -- and are valid under milder and more
intuitive assumptions. These minimax upper rates coincide with lower rates up
to a logarithmic factor, showing that the embedding method achieves nearly
optimal rates. We study our sparse embedding algorithm in a reinforcement
learning task where the algorithm shows significant improvement in sparsity

jamming transition. Previous work has indicated that such packs are isostatic,
and thus obey a null stress law which, independent of the packing history,
causes rays of stress to propagate away from a point force at oblique angles.
Prior verifications of the null stress law have used a sequential packing
method which yields packs with anisotropic packing histories. We create packs
without this anisotropy, and then later break the symmetry by adding a
boundary. Our isotropic packs are very sensitive, and their responses to point
forces diverge wildly, indicating that they cannot be described by any
continuum stress model. We stabilize the packs by supplying an additional
boundary, which makes the response much more regular. The response of the
stabilized packs resembles what one would expect in a hyperstatic pack, despite
the isostatic bulk. The expected stress rays characteristic of null stress
behavior are not present. This suggests that isostatic packs do not need to
obey a null stress condition. We argue that the rays may arise instead from
more simple geometric considerations, such as preferred contact angles between
beads.

transport perpendicular to the Cu-O planes becomes highly coherent. This effect
is achieved by excitation with mid-infrared optical pulses, tuned to the
resonant frequency of apical oxygen vibrations, which modulate both lattice and
electronic properties. Below the superconducting transition temperature Tc, the
equilibrium signatures of superconducting interlayer coupling are enhanced.
Most strikingly, the optical excitation induces a new reflectivity edge at
higher frequency than the equilibrium Josephson plasma resonance, with a
concomitant enhancement of the low frequency imaginary conductivity. Above Tc,
the incoherent equilibrium conductivity becomes highly coherent, with the
appearance of a reflectivity edge and a positive imaginary conductivity that
increases with decreasing frequency. These features are observed up to room
temperature in YBa2Cu2O6.45 and YBa2Cu2O6.5. The data above Tc can be fitted by
hypothesizing that the light re-establishes a transient superconducting state
over only a fraction of the solid, with a lifetime of a few picoseconds.
Non-superconducting transport could also explain these observations, although
one would have to assume transient carrier mobilities near 10^4 cm^2/(V.sec) at
100 K, with a density of charge carriers similar to the below Tc superfluid

inter-experimental study group on HEP data preservation and long-term analysis
was convened as a panel of the International Committee for Future Accelerators
(ICFA). The group was formed by large collider-based experiments and
investigated the technical and organisational aspects of HEP data preservation.
An intermediate report was released in November 2009 addressing the general
issues of data preservation in HEP. This paper includes and extends the
intermediate report. It provides an analysis of the research case for data
preservation and a detailed description of the various projects at experiment,
laboratory and international levels. In addition, the paper provides a concrete
proposal for an international organisation in charge of the data management and
policies in high-energy physics.

However, there have not yet been any algorithms that self-heal in the case
where an adversary takes over nodes in the network. In this paper, we address
this gap. In particular, we describe a communication network over n nodes that
ensures the following properties, even when an adversary controls up to t <=
(1/8 - \epsilon)n nodes, for any non-negative \epsilon. First, the network
provides a point-to-point communication with bandwidth and latency costs that
are asymptotically optimal. Second, the expected total number of message
corruptions is O(t(log* n)^2) before the adversarially controlled nodes are
effectively quarantined so that they cause no more corruptions. Empirical
results show that our algorithm can reduce the bandwidth cost by up to a factor

buoyancy) instability in a uniformly rotating plasma screw pinch confined in a
cylinder. Uniform plasma rotation is imposed to create a centrifugal
acceleration, which mimics the gravity required for the classical Parker
instability. The goal of this study is to determine how the Parker instability
could be unambiguously identified in a weakly magnetized, rapidly rotating
screw pinch, in which the rotation provides an effective gravity and a radially
varying azimuthal field is controlled to give conditions for which the plasma
is magnetically buoyant to inward motion. We show that an axial magnetic field
is also required to circumvent conventional current driven magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) instabilities such as the sausage and kink modes that would obscure the
Parker instability. These conditions can be realized in the Madison Plasma
Couette Experiment (MPCX). Simulations are performed using the extended MHD
code NIMROD for an isothermal compressible plasma model. Both linear and
nonlinear regimes of the instability are studied, and the results obtained for
the linear regime are compared with analytical results from a slab geometry.
Based on this comparison, it is found that in a cylindrical pinch the magnetic
buoyancy mechanism dominates at relatively large Mach numbers (M>5), while at
low Mach numbers (M<1) the instability is due to the curvature of magnetic
field lines. At intermediate values of Mach number (1<M<5) the Coriolis force
has a strong stabilizing effect on the plasma. A possible scenario for
experimental demonstration of the Parker instability in MPCX is discussed.

investigate the evolution of the distribution of baryons (gas and stars) in a
local group-type universe. First, with standard star formation and supernova
feedback prescriptions, we find that the mean baryonic fraction value estimated
at the virial radius of the two main central objects (i.e. the Milky Way and
Andromeda) is decreasing over time, and is 10-15% lower than the universal
value, 0.166, at z=0. This decrease is mainly due to the fact that the amount
of accretion of dissipative gas onto the halo, especially at low redshift, is
in general much lower than that of the dissipationless dark matter. Indeed, a
significant part of the baryons does not collapse onto the haloes and remains
in their outskirts, mainly in the form of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM).
Moreover, during the formation of each object, some dark matter and baryons are
also expelled through merger events via tidal disruption. In contrast to
baryons, expelled dark matter can be more efficiently re-accreted onto the
halo, enhancing both the reduction of fb inside Rv, and the increase of the
mass of WHIM outside Rv. Varying the efficiency of supernovae feedback at low
redshift does not seem to significantly affect these trends. Alternatively,
when a significant fraction of the initial gas in the main objects is released
at high redshifts by more powerful sources of feedback, such as AGN from
intermediate mass black holes in lower mass galaxies, the baryonic fraction at
the virial radius can have a lower value (fb~0.12) at low redshift. Hence
physical mechanisms able to drive the gas out of the virial radius at high
redshifts will have a stronger impact on the deficit of baryons in the mass
budget of Milky Way type-galaxies at present times than those that expel the
gas in the longer, late phases of galaxy formation.

galaxies using Schwarzschild's orbit superposition method. This type of
modelling yields constraints both on the total mass distribution (e.g. enclosed
mass and scale radius) as well as on the orbital structure of the system (e.g.
velocity anisotropy). This method is thus less prone to biases introduced by
assumptions in comparison to the more commonly used Jeans modelling, and it
allows us to derive the dark matter content in a robust way. Here we present
our results for the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, after testing our methods
on mock data sets. We fit both the second and fourth velocity moment profile to
break the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. For an NFW dark matter halo profile, we
find that the mass of Sculptor within 1 kpc is M_1kpc = 1.03 \pm 0.07 x 10^8
Msol, and that its velocity anisotropy profile is tangentially biased and
nearly constant with radius. The preferred concentration (c ~ 15) is low for
its dark matter mass but consistent within the scatter found in N-body
cosmological simulations. When we let the value of the central logarithmic
slope \alpha{} vary, we find that the best-fit model has \alpha{} = 0, although
an NFW cusp or shallower is consistent at 1 \sigma{} confidence level. On the

\alpha{} < -1.5 are strongly disfavoured for Sculptor.

that a compact object merges with the MBH after only one intense burst of GWs
is much more likely than a slow adiabatic inspiral, an EMRI. The later is
referred to as a ""plunge"" because the compact object dives into the MBH. The
event rates for plunges are orders of magnitude larger than slow inspirals. On
the other hand, nature MBH's are most likely Kerr and the magnitude of the spin
has been sized up to be high. We calculate the number of periapsis passages
that a compact object set on to an extremely radial orbit goes through before
being actually swallowed by the Kerr MBH and we then translate it into an event
rate for a LISA-like observatory, such as the proposed ESA mission eLISA/NGO.
We prove that a ""plunging"" compact object is conceptually indistinguishable
from an adiabatic, slow inspiral; plunges spend on average up to hundred of
thousands of cycles in the bandwidth of the detector for a two years mission.
This has an important impact on the event rate, enhancing in some cases
significantly, depending on the spin of the MBH and the inclination. Moreover,
it has been recently proved that the production of low-eccentricity EMRIs is
severely blocked by the presence of a blockade in the rate at which orbital
angular momenta change takes place. This is the result of relativistic
precession on to the stellar potential torques and hence affects EMRIs
originating via resonant relaxation at distances of about $\sim 10^{-2}$ pc
from the MBH. Since high-eccentricity EMRIs are a result of two-body
relaxation, they are not affected by this phenomenon. Therefore we predict that
eLISA EMRI event rates will be dominated by high-eccentricity binaries, as we
present here.

applicable for large masses and binary separations, and near-equal mass ratios.
However, we identify a distinct new regime, applicable at smaller separations

piles up outside the binary's orbit, but rather than creating a cavity, it
continuously overflows as in a porous dam. The disk profile is intermediate
between a weakly perturbed disk (producing Type-I migration) and a disk with a

typically slower than both Type-I and Type-II rates. We term this new regime

a sample of 35 microlensed bulge dwarf and subgiant stars, characterizing their
distribution in the 12-dimensional space defined by their measured elemental
abundances. The first principal component PC1, which suffices to describe the
abundance patterns of most stars in the sample, shows a strong contribution
from alpha-elements, reflecting the relative contributions of Type II and Type
Ia supernovae. The second principal component PC2 is characterized by a Na--Ni
correlation, the likely product of metallicity-dependent Type II supernova
yields. The distribution in PC1 is bimodal, showing that the bimodality
previously found in the [Fe/H] values of these stars is robustly and
independently recovered by looking at only their relative abundance patterns.
The two metal-rich stars that are alpha-enhanced have outlier values of PC2 and
PC3, respectively, further evidence that they have distinctive enrichment
histories. Applying PCAA to a sample of local thin and thick disk dwarfs yields
a nearly identical PC1; in PC1, the metal-rich and metal-poor bulge dwarfs
track kinematically selected thin and thick disk dwarfs, respectively,
suggesting broadly similar alpha-enrichment histories. However, the disk PC2 is
dominated by a Y--Ba correlation, likely indicating a greater contribution of
s-process enrichment from long-lived asymptotic giant branch stars that is
absent from the bulge PC2 because of its rapid formation.

post-starburst (PSB) galaxies aimed at constraining the debated influence of

for high-redshift studies. PSB galaxies have negligible on-going star formation
and a SED dominated by the stars formed in a recent (<2 Gyr) burst. By
spectroscopically selecting PSB galaxies with mean luminosity-weighted ages
between 0.5 and 1.5 Gyr and a broad range of metallicities, we explore the
parameter space around the peak of the relative energy output of TP-AGB stars.
Crucially, we target galaxies at z~0.2, so that two main spectral features of
TP-AGB stars (C-molecule band-head drops at 1.41 and 1.77mum), which are
heavily absorbed by our atmosphere for targets at z~0, move inside the H and K
atmospheric windows and can be constrained for the first time to high accuracy.
Our findings provide key constraints to stellar population synthesis models: i)
The NIR regions around 1.41 and 1.77mum (rest-frame) are featureless for all
galaxies in our sample over the whole range of relevant ages and metallicities
at variance with the Maraston (2005) TP-AGB heavy models, which exhibit marked
drops there; ii) No flux boosting is observed in the NIR. The optical-NIR SEDs
of most of our PSB galaxies can be consistently reproduced with Bruzual &
Charlot (2003) models, using either simple stellar populations of corresponding
light-weighted ages and metallicities, or a more realistic burst plus an old
population containing <~60% of the total stellar mass. In contrast, all
combinations of this kind based on the Maraston (2005) models are unable to
simultaneously reproduce the smoothness of the NIR spectra and the relatively
blue optical-NIR colours in the observations. The data collected in this study
appear to disfavour TP-AGB heavy models with respect to TP-AGB light ones.

which 182 new and 37 previously known companions were detected in 205 systems.
Most of the targets have been observed during two or more epochs, and could be
confirmed as physical companions through common proper motion, often with
orbital motion being confirmed in addition. After accounting for various bias
effects, we find a total M-dwarf multiplicity fraction of 27+/-3% within the
AstraLux detection range of 0.08-6"" (semi-major axes of ~3-227 AU at a median
distance of 30 pc). We examine various statistical multiplicity properties
within the sample, such as the trend of multiplicity fraction with stellar mass
and the semi-major axis distribution. The results indicate that M-dwarfs are
largely consistent with constituting an intermediate step in a continuous
distribution from higher-mass stars down to brown dwarfs. Along with other
observational results in the literature, this provides further indications that
stars and brown dwarfs may share a common formation mechanism, rather than
being distinct populations.

of tidally stripped stars from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) located ~4-10
kpc behind a lensing population of LMC disk stars can naturally explain the
observed event durations (17-71 days), event frequencies and spatial
distribution of the reported events. Differences in the event frequencies
reported by the OGLE (~0.33 /yr) and MACHO (~1.75 /yr) surveys appear to be
naturally accounted for by their different detection efficiencies and
sensitivity to faint sources. The presented models of the Magellanic System
were constructed without prior consideration of the microlensing implications.
These results favor a scenario for the interaction history of the Magellanic
Clouds, wherein the Clouds are on their first infall towards the Milky Way and
the SMC has recently collided with the LMC 100-300 Myr ago, leading to a large
number of faint sources distributed non-uniformly behind the LMC disk. In
contrast to self-lensing models, microlensing events are also expected to occur
in fields off the LMC's stellar bar since the stellar debris is not expected to
be concentrated in the bar region. This scenario leads to a number of
observational tests: the sources are low-metallicity SMC stars, they exhibit
high velocities relative to LMC disk stars that may be detectable via proper
motion studies, and, most notably, there should exist a stellar counterpart to
the gaseous Magellanic Stream and Bridge with a V-band surface brightness of >

feedback. We present new deep ATCA, Chandra and optical observations, and test
the feedback model. We report the first high-resolution observations of the
radio jet. The inner jet extends ~8.5 kpc towards an optical emission-line High
Ionization Cloud (HIC) before taking a zig-zag path to an offset position. Jet
X-ray synchrotron radiation is seen. The HIC is associated with 0.3 keV X-ray
gas of anomalously low metallicity. On larger scales the radio galaxy displays
all three X-ray features that together confirm supersonic expansion of the
lobes into the external medium: gas cavities, inverse-Compton emission showing
excess internal lobe pressure, and high-contrast arms of temperature above the
~1 keV ambient medium. The well-formed S lobe on the counterjet side is
expanding with a Mach number 2.2-3. We estimate a cavity power ~3x10^43 ergs/s,
which falls well below previously reported correlations with radio power. The
total inferred time-averaged jet power, ~4x10^44 ergs/s, is dominated by the
kinetic and thermal energy of shocked gas, and if used instead would bring the
source into better agreement with the correlations. The S hotspot is the more
complex, with a spiral polarization structure. Its bright peak emits
synchrotron X-rays. The fainter N hotspot is particularly interesting, with
X-rays offset in the direction of the incoming jet by ~1 arcsec relative to the
radio peak. Here modest (delta ~ 6) relativistic beaming and a steep radio
spectrum cause the jet to be X-ray bright through inverse-Compton scattering
before it decelerates. With such beaming, a modest proton content or small
departure from minimum energy in the jet will align estimates of the
instantaneous and time-averaged jet power. The hotspots suggest acceleration of
electrons to a maximum energy ~10^13 eV in the jet termination shocks.

large-scale diffuse radio emission that is unrelated to individual galaxies. It
contains both a giant radio halo and a relic, as well as a number of head-tail
sources and smaller diffuse steep-spectrum radio sources. The origin of radio
halos and relics is still being debated, but over the last years it has become
clear that the presence of these radio sources is closely related to galaxy
cluster merger events. Here we present the results from the first LOFAR Low
band antenna (LBA) observations of Abell 2256 between 18 and 67 MHz. To our
knowledge, the image presented in this paper at 63 MHz is the deepest ever
obtained at frequencies below 100 MHz in general. Both the radio halo and the
giant relic are detected in the image at 63 MHz, and the diffuse radio emission
remains visible at frequencies as low as 20 MHz. The observations confirm the
presence of a previously claimed ultra-steep spectrum source to the west of the
cluster center with a spectral index of -2.3 \pm 0.4 between 63 and 153 MHz.
The steep spectrum suggests that this source is an old part of a head-tail
radio source in the cluster. For the radio relic we find an integrated spectral
index of -0.81 \pm 0.03, after removing the flux contribution from the other
sources. This is relatively flat which could indicate that the efficiency of
particle acceleration at the shock substantially changed in the last \sim 0.1
Gyr due to an increase of the shock Mach number. In an alternative scenario,
particles are re-accelerated by some mechanism in the downstream region of the
shock, resulting in the relatively flat integrated radio spectrum. In the radio
halo region we find indications of low-frequency spectral steepening which may
suggest that relativistic particles are accelerated in a rather inhomogeneous
turbulent region.

the electron charge bound to a single vortex core is effectively fractionalized

ages (t), spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and disk masses (Mdisk) for a
sample of 38 HAeBe stars, comparing them to analogous correlations found for
classical T Tauri stars. Our goal is to shed light on the timescale and
physical processes that drive evolution of intermediate-mass pre-main sequence
objects.
  Macc shows a dissipation timescale \tau = 1.3^{+1.0}_{-0.5} Myr from an
exponential law fit, while a power law yields Macc(t) \propto t^{-\eta}, with
\eta = 1.8^{+1.4}_{-0.7}. This result is based on our whole HAeBe sample (1-6
Msun), but the accretion rate decline most probably depends on smaller stellar
mass bins. The near-IR excess is higher and starts at shorter wavelengths (J
and H bands) for the strongest accretors. Active and passive disks are roughly
divided by 2 x 10^{-7} Msun/yr. The mid-IR excess and the SED shape from the
Meeus et al. classification are not correlated with Macc. We find Macc \propto
Mdisk^{1.1 +- 0.3}. Most stars in our sample with signs of inner dust
dissipation typically show accretion rates ten times lower and disk masses
three times smaller than the remaining objects.
  The trends relating Macc with the near-IR excess and Mdisk extend those for T
Tauri stars, and are consistent with viscous disk models. The differences in
the inner gas dissipation timescale, and the relative position of the stars
with signs of inner dust clearing in the Macc-Mdisk plane, could be suggesting
a slightly faster evolution, and that a different process - such as
photoevaporation - plays a more relevant role in dissipating disks in the HAeBe
regime compared to T Tauri stars. Our conclusions must consider the mismatch
between the disk mass estimates from mm fluxes and the disk mass estimates from
accretion, which we also find in HAeBe stars.

elements in the Solar System was believed to be unique. Many recent studies
have shown that this does not include the formation of lighter elements (in
particular 38 < Z < 48). Among those, palladium (Pd) and especially silver (Ag)
are expected to be key indicators of a possible second r-process, but until
recently they have been studied only in a few stars. Therefore we target Pd and
Ag in a large sample of stars and compare these abundances to those of Sr, Y,
Zr, Ba and Eu produced by the slow (s-) and rapid (r-) neutron-capture
processes. Hereby we investigate the nature of the formation process of Ag and
Pd. Through a homogeneous 1D LTE analysis of 71 stars we derive stellar
abundances using the spectrum synthesis code MOOG, and MARCS model atmospheres.
We calculate abundance ratio trends and compare the derived abundances to
site-dependent yield predictions (low mass O-Ne-Mg cc SN, and parametrised high
entropy winds), to extract characteristics of the second r-process. The
abundance ratios of the heavy elements yield correlations and
anti-correlations. These trends lead to clear indications of the existence of a
second/weak r-process, responsible for the formation of Pd and Ag. By comparing
to the model predictions, we find that the conditions under which this process
takes place differ from the main r-process in needing lower neutron number
densities, neutron-to-seed ratios, entropies and/or favour higher electron
abundances. Our analysis confirms that Pd and Ag form via a r-process that
differs from the main r-process, the main and weak s-processes, and charged
particle freeze-outs. This process is efficiently working down to [Fe/H] = -3.3
(where our sample ends). Our results may indicate that a combination of these
explosive sites is needed to explain the observationally-derived abundance
patterns.

to the classical studies about the aggregation of solid spheres. Yet, it is
commonly believed that most findings on solid dispersions are directly
applicable to liquid mixtures. Here, the state of the art in the evaluation of
the flocculation rate of these two systems is reviewed. Special emphasis is
made on the differences between suspensions and emulsions. In the case of
suspensions, the stability ratio is commonly evaluated from the initial slope
of the absorbance as a function of time under diffusive and reactive
conditions. Puertas and de las Nieves (1997) developed a theoretical approach
that allows the determination of the flocculation rate from the variation of
the turbidity of a sample as a function of time. Here, suitable modifications
of the experimental procedure and the referred theoretical approach are
implemented in order to calculate the values of the stability ratio and the
flocculation rate corresponding to a dodecane-in-water nanoemulsion stabilized
with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Four analytical expressions of the turbidity are
tested, basically differing in the optical cross section of the aggregates
formed. The first two models consider the processes of: a) aggregation (as
described by Smoluchowski) and b) the instantaneous coalescence upon
flocculation. The other two models account for the simultaneous occurrence of
flocculation and coalescence. The latter reproduce the temporal variation of
the turbidity in all cases studied (380 \leq [NaCl] \leq 600 mM), providing a
method of appraisal of the flocculation rate in nanoemulsions.

time-inconsistent optimal control problem in the sense that it does not satisfy
Bellman's optimality principle and therefore the usual dynamic programming
approach fails. We develop a time- consistent formulation of this problem,
which is based on a local notion of optimality called local mean-variance
efficiency, in a general semimartingale setting. We start in discrete time,
where the formulation is straightforward, and then find the natural extension
to continuous time. This complements and generalises the formulation by Basak

optimal strategy in terms of the structure condition and the
F\""ollmer-Schweizer decomposition of the mean-variance tradeoff. As a

acceleration of gas in the disk, and sensitive VLBI imaging to measure the

potentially life threatening; this makes them a major factor contributing to
the cost and uncertainty of drug development. Clinical data suggest that many
such reactions involve immune mechanisms, and genetic association studies have
identified strong linkage between drug hypersensitivity reactions to several
drugs and specific HLA alleles. One of the strongest such genetic associations
found has been for the antiviral drug abacavir, which causes severe adverse
reactions exclusively in patients expressing the HLA molecular variant B*57:01.
Abacavir adverse reactions were recently shown to be driven by drug-specific
activation of cytokine-producing, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that required
HLA-B*57:01 molecules for their function. However, the mechanism by which
abacavir induces this pathologic T cell response remains unclear. Here we show
that abacavir can bind within the F-pocket of the peptide-binding groove of
HLA-B*57:01 thereby altering its specificity. This supports a novel explanation
for HLA-linked idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions; namely that drugs can
alter the repertoire of self-peptides presented to T cells thus causing the
equivalent of an alloreactive T cell response. Indeed, we identified specific
self-peptides that are presented only in the presence of abacavir, and that
were recognized by T cells of hypersensitive patients. The assays we have
established can be applied to test additional compounds with suspected HLA
linked hypersensitivities in vitro. Where successful, these assays could speed
up the discovery and mechanistic understanding of HLA linked hypersensitivities

of this work is to obtain X-ray images in the iron-line complex at 6.7 keV
observed during solar flares with an angular resolution as fine as 0.1 arcsec -
over an order of magnitude finer than is now possible. This line emission is
from highly ionized iron atoms, primarily Fe xxv, in the hottest flare plasma
at temperatures in excess of \approx10 MK. It provides information on the flare
morphology, the iron abundance, and the distribution of the hot plasma.
Studying how this plasma is heated to such high temperatures in such short
times during solar flares is of critical importance in understanding these
powerful transient events, one of the major objectives of solar physics. We
describe the design, fabrication, and testing of phase zone plate X-ray lenses
with focal lengths of \approx100 m at these energies that would be capable of
achieving these objectives. We show how such lenses could be included on a
two-spacecraft formation-flying mission with the lenses on the spacecraft
closest to the Sun and an X-ray imaging array on the second spacecraft in the
focal plane \approx100 m away. High resolution X-ray images could be obtained
when the two spacecraft are aligned with the region of interest on the Sun.
Requirements and constraints for the control of the two spacecraft are
discussed together with the overall feasibility of such a formation-flying
mission.

wavelengths enable the selection of galaxies with nuclear activity, which may
not be revealed even in the deepest X-ray surveys. In this work new near- and
mid-IR color diagnostics are explored, aiming for improved efficiency - better
completeness and less contamination - in selecting AGN out to very high
redshifts. We restrict our study to the James Webb Space Telescope wavelength
range (0.6-27um). The criteria are created based on the predictions by
state-of-the-art galaxy and AGN templates covering a wide variety of galaxy
properties, and tested against control samples with deep multi-wavelength
coverage (ranging from the X-rays to radio frequencies). We show that the
colors Ks-[4.5], [4.5]-[8.0], and [8.0]-[24] are ideal as AGN/non-AGN
diagnostics at, respectively, z<~1, 1<~z<~2.5, and z>~2.5-3. However, when the
source redshift is unknown, these colors should be combined. We thus develop an
improved IR criterion (using Ks and IRAC bands, KI) as a new alternative at
z<~2.5. KI does not show improved completeness (50-60% overall) in comparison
to commonly used IRAC-based AGN criteria, but is less affected by non-AGN
contamination (revealing a >50-90% level of successful AGN selection). We also
propose KIM (using Ks, IRAC, and MIPS-24um bands, KIM), which aims to select
AGN hosts from local distances to as far back as the end of reionization
(0<z<~7) with reduced non-AGN contamination. However, the necessary
testing-constraints and the small control-sample sizes prevent the confirmation
of its improved efficiency at z<~2.5. Overall, KIM shows a ~30-40% completeness
and a >70-90% level of successful AGN selection. KI and KIM are built to be
reliable against a ~10-20% error in flux, are based on existing filters, and
are suitable for immediate use.

the system might evade the critical state altogether by undergoing a

Telatar-Tse noisy two-pair interference channel generalizes the El Gamal-Costa
injective channel. Specifically, arbitrary noise is introduced that acts on the
combined interference signal before it affects the desired signal. This class
of channels includes the Gaussian case.
  The rate region includes the best-known inner bound on the 3-DIC capacity
region, dominates treating interference as noise, and subsumes the
Han-Kobayashi region for the two-pair case.

is substantial and should be conserved, yet there is a growing need to support
many real-time applications that require timely data delivery. To model such a
scenario, in this paper we consider the problem of minimizing the expected sum
energy of delivering a message of a given size from a source to a destination
subject to a deadline constraint. A relay is present and can assist after it
has decoded the message. Causal channel state information (CSI), in the form of
present and past SNRs of all links, is available for determining the optimal
power allocation for the source and relay. We obtain the optimal power
allocation policy by dynamic programming and explore its structure. We also
obtain conditions for which the minimum expected sum energy is bounded given a
general channel distribution. In particular, we show that for Rayleigh and
Rician fading channels, relaying is necessary for the minimum expected sum
energy to be bounded. This illustrates the fundamental advantage of relaying
from the perspective of energy efficient communications when only causal CSI is
available. Numerical results are obtained which show the reduction in the
expected sum energy under different communication scenarios.

complex domain, we characterize the C^3 lifespan of the HCMA in terms of
analytic continuation of Hamiltonian mechanics and intersection of complex time
characteristics. We use a conservation law type argument to prove uniqueness of

problem is ill-posed in C^3, in the sense that there exists a dense set of C^3
Cauchy data for which there exists no C^3 solution even for a short time. In
the real domain we show that the HRMA is equivalent to a Hamilton--Jacobi
equation, and use the equivalence to prove that any differentiable weak
solution is smooth, so that the differentiable lifespan equals the convex
lifespan determined in our previous articles. We further show that the only
obstruction to C^1 solvability is the invertibility of the associated Moser
maps. Thus, a smooth solution of the Cauchy problem for HRMA exists for a
positive but generally finite time and cannot be continued even as a weak C^1
solution afterwards. Finally, we introduce the notion of a ""leafwise
subsolution"" for the HCMA that generalizes that of a solution, and many of our

scattering off nuclear targets in the few-GeV energy region is a prerequisite
for correct interpretation of results of ongoing and planned oscillation
experiments.
  Purpose: Clarify possible source of disagreement between recent measurements
of the cross sections on carbon.
  Method: Nuclear effects in (anti)neutrino scattering off carbon nucleus are
described using the spectral function approach. The effect of two- and
multi-nucleon final states is accounted for by applying an effective value of
the axial mass, fixed to 1.23 GeV. Neutral-current elastic (NCE) and
charged-current quasielastic (CCQE) processes are treated on equal footing.
  Results: The differential and total cross sections for the energy ranging
from a few hundreds of MeV to 100 GeV are obtained and compared to the
available data from the BNL E734, MiniBooNE, and NOMAD experiments.
  Conclusions: Nuclear effects in NCE and CCQE scattering seem to be very
similar. Within the spectral function approach, the axial mass from the shape
analysis of the MiniBooNE data is in good agreement with the results reported
by the BNL E734 and NOMAD Collaborations. However, the combined analysis of NCE
and CCQE data does not seem to support the contribution of multi-nucleon final
states being large enough to explain the normalization of the
MiniBooNE-reported cross sections.

chemically peculiar star HD207561. During a survey programme to search for new
roAp stars in the Northern hemisphere, Joshi et al. (2006) observed significant
photometric variability on two consecutive nights in the year 2000. The
amplitude spectra of the light curves obtained on these two nights showed
oscillations with a frequency of 2.79 mHz [P~6-min]. However, subsequent
follow-up observations could not confirm any rapid variability. In order to
determine the spectroscopic nature of HD207561, high-resolution spectroscopic
and spectro-polarimetric observations were carried out. A reasonable fit of the
calculated Hbeta line profile to the observed one yields the effective
temperature (Teff) and surface gravity (log g) as 7300 K and 3.7 dex,
respectively. The derived projected rotational velocity (vsin i) for HD207561
is 74 km/sec indicative of a relatively fast rotator. The position of HD207561
in the H-R diagram implies that this is slightly evolved from the main-sequence
and located well within the delta-Scuti instability strip. The abundance
analysis indicates the star has slight under-abundances of Ca and Sc and mild
over-abundances of iron-peak elements. The spectro-polarimetric study of
HD207561 shows that the effective magnetic field is within the observational
error of 100 gauss (G). The spectroscopic analysis revealed that the star has
most of the characteristics similar to an Am star, rather than an Ap star, and
that it lies in the delta-Scuti instability strip; hence roAp pulsations are
not expected in HD207561, but low-overtone modes might be excited.

properly quantifies the importance of events in connecting nodes along
time-ordered paths. Because of strong heterogeneity in the importance of events
present in real data, a small fraction of highly important events is necessary
and sufficient to sustain the connectivity of temporal networks. Nevertheless,
in contrast to the behavior of scale-free networks against link removal, this
property mainly results from bursty activity patterns and not heterogeneous
degree distributions.

to perform well. Existing reinforcement learning algorithms provide strong
exploration guarantees, but they tend to rely on an ergodicity assumption. The
essence of ergodicity is that any state is eventually reachable from any other
state by following a suitable policy. This assumption allows for exploration
algorithms that operate by simply favoring states that have rarely been visited
before. For most physical systems this assumption is impractical as the systems
would break before any reasonable exploration has taken place, i.e., most
physical systems don't satisfy the ergodicity assumption. In this paper we
address the need for safe exploration methods in Markov decision processes. We
first propose a general formulation of safety through ergodicity. We show that
imposing safety by restricting attention to the resulting set of guaranteed
safe policies is NP-hard. We then present an efficient algorithm for guaranteed
safe, but potentially suboptimal, exploration. At the core is an optimization
formulation in which the constraints restrict attention to a subset of the
guaranteed safe policies and the objective favors exploration policies. Our
framework is compatible with the majority of previously proposed exploration
methods, which rely on an exploration bonus. Our experiments, which include a
Martian terrain exploration problem, show that our method is able to explore
better than classical exploration methods.

promising real-time super-resolution lens that can effectively transform
evanescent waves into propagating waves and thus break the diffraction limit.
However, previous hyperlens implementations usually adopted metal which would
absorb most energy during light transmission and thus deteriorate imaging
efficiency. Here we propose a novel hyperlens design based on dielectric
layered graphene and h-boron nitride (h-BN) whose performance can surpass the
counterpart design with metal. Our first-principle and Kramers-Kronig relation
calculation shows that both layered graphene and layered h-BN exhibit strong
anisotropic properties in ultraviolet spectrum regions, where their
permittivity components perpendicular to the optic axis can be negative while
the components parallel to the optic axis can be positive. Based on the
anisotropic properties, flat and cylindrical hyperlenses are designed and
numerically verified with layered graphene at 1200 THz and layered h-BN at 1400
THz, respectively. Our work provides a dielectric hyperlens approach to
overcome the diffraction limit at ultraviolet frequencies, which may find
applications where dynamic imaging of subwavelength features at the molecular
and cellular scales is desired.

the primary focus will be on storing messages in encrypted format with a
password and send it to the required destination hiding in a QR Code, without
being tracked or decrypted properly by any hacker or spyware. Since QR Codes
have fast response time and have large storage capacity, QR Codes can be used
perfectly to send encrypted data (messages) to the receiver. This method will
be suitable in any business house, government sectors, communication network to
send their encrypted messages faster to the destination. Or a person can even
use this method to keep his important documents, like passport number, pan-card

the information getting leaked to outside world. The new method is achieved by
entering the message along with a password. This password will generate a
secret code, which will be added to each digit or alphabet in the numbers or
text entered in the message (which is needed to be encrypted) and generate the
first phase of encryption. That newly generated encrypted message will again be
encrypted using various other methods to generate the final encrypted message.

function of a gauge field is modulated by the inflaton, we can obtain a new
inflationary attractor solution, in which the roll-over of the inflaton suffers
additional impedance due to the vector field backreaction. As a result,
directions of the scalar potential which, due to strong Kaehler corrections,
become too steep and curved to normally support slow-roll inflation can now
naturally do so. This solves the infamous eta-problem of inflation in
supergravity and also keeps the spectral index of the curvature perturbation
mildly red despite eta of order unity. This mechanism is applied to a model of
hybrid inflation in supergravity with a generic Kaehler potential. The spectral
index of the curvature perturbation is found to be 0.97 - 0.98, in excellent
agreement with data. The gauge field can act as vector curvaton generating
statistical anisotropy in the curvature perturbation. However, this anisotropy
could be possibly observable only if the gauge coupling constant is unnaturally
small.

the [NII]205um emission in a strongly [CII]-emitting SMG, LESS J033229.4-275619

results from the interaction of helical convective motions and differential
rotation in the solar convection zone. The principal direction of the drift
corresponds to the direction of the large-scale vorticity vector. Thus, the
effect produces a latitudinal transport of the large-scale magnetic field in
the convective zone wherever the angular velocity has a strong radial gradient.
The direction of the drift depends on the sign of helicity and it is defined by
the Parker-Yoshimura rule. The analytic calculations are done within the
framework of mean-field magnetohydrodynamics using the minimal
\tau-approximation. We estimate the magnitude of the drift velocity and find
that it can be several m/s near the base of the solar convection zone. The
implications of this effect for the solar dynamo are illustrated on the basis
of an axisymmetric mean-field dynamo model with a subsurface shear layer. We
find that the helicity--vorticity pumping effect can have an influence on the
features of the sunspot time--latitude diagram, producing a fast drift of the
sunspot activity maximum at the rise phase of the cycle and a slow drift at the

Previous work on actor-critic algorithms is limited to the on-policy setting
and does not take advantage of the recent advances in off-policy gradient
temporal-difference learning. Off-policy techniques, such as Greedy-GQ, enable
a target policy to be learned while following and obtaining data from another
(behavior) policy. For many problems, however, actor-critic methods are more
practical than action value methods (like Greedy-GQ) because they explicitly
represent the policy; consequently, the policy can be stochastic and utilize a
large action space. In this paper, we illustrate how to practically combine the
generality and learning potential of off-policy learning with the flexibility
in action selection given by actor-critic methods. We derive an incremental,
linear time and space complexity algorithm that includes eligibility traces,
prove convergence under assumptions similar to previous off-policy algorithms,
and empirically show better or comparable performance to existing algorithms on
standard reinforcement-learning benchmark problems.

two identical linearly coupled Duffing oscillators is equivalent to the
symmetric (non-biased) case of `macroscopic' quantum dynamics of two weakly
coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. The analogy develops through the boson
Josephson junction equations, however, reduced to a single conservative energy
partition (EP) oscillator. The derived oscillator is solvable in quadratures,
furthermore it admits asymptotic solution in terms of elementary functions
after transition to the action-angle variables. Energy partition and coherency
indexes are introduced to provide a complete characterization of the system
dynamic states through the state variables of the EP oscillator. In particular,
nonlinear normal and local mode dynamics of the original system associate with
equilibrium points of such oscillator. Additional equilibrium points - the
local modes - may occur on high energy level as a result of the symmetry
breaking bifurcation, which is equivalent to the macroscopic quantum
self-trapping effect in boson Josephson junction. Finally, since the
Hamiltonian of EP oscillator is always quadratic with respect its linear
momentum, the idea of second quantization can be explored without usual
transition to the rigid pendulum approximation.

variations, consist in discretizing the objective functional using appropriate
approximations for derivatives that appear in the problem. This article
generalizes the same idea for fractional variational problems. We consider a
minimization problem with a Lagrangian that depends on the left
Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative. Using the Grunwald-Letnikov
definition, we approximate the objective functional in an equispaced grid as a
multi-variable function of the values of the unknown function on mesh points.
The problem is then transformed to an ordinary static optimization problem. The
solution to the latter problem gives an approximation to the original
fractional problem on mesh points.

distributions only in terms of bivariate building blocks (pair copulas),
constitute a flexible class of dependence models. To keep them tractable for
inference and model selection, the simplifying assumption that copulas of
conditional distributions do not depend on the values of the variables which
they are conditioned on is popular. In this paper, we show for which classes of
distributions such a simplification is applicable, significantly extending the
discussion of Hob{\ae}k Haff et al. (2010). In particular, we show that the
only Archimedean copula in dimension d \geq 4 which is of the simplified type
is that based on the gamma Laplace transform or its extension, while the
Student-t copula is the only one arising from a scale mixture of Normals.
Further, we illustrate how PCCs can be adapted for situations where conditional
copulas depend on values which are conditioned on.

require a number of tolerance specifications that allow the developers to build

assumptions underlying the particular measurement technique. Here we discuss
general properties of every magnetograph, as the detectability thresholds for
the vector magnetic field and the line-of-sight velocity, as well as specific
properties of a given type of instrument, namely that based on a pair of
nematic liquid crystal variable retarders and a Fabry-P\'erot etalon (or
several) for carrying out the light polarization modulation and spectral
analysis, respectively. We derive formulae that give the detection thresholds
in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio of the observations and the polarimetric
efficiencies of the instrument. Relationships are also established between
inaccuracies in the solar physical quantities and instabilities in the
instrument parameters. Such relationships allow, for example, to translate
scientific requirements for the velocity or the magnetic field into
requirements for temperature or voltage stability. We also demonstrate that
this type of magnetograph can theoretically reach the optimum polarimetric
efficiencies of an ideal polarimeter, regardless of the optics in between the
modulator and the analyzer. Such optics induces changes in the instrument
parameters that are calculated too.

stars thanks to CoRoT and Kepler space-crafts. The seismic data gathered by
CoRoT on red giant stars allow us to test mode driving theory in physical
conditions different from main-sequence stars. Using a set of 3D hydrodynamical
models representative of the upper layers of sub- and red giant stars, we
computed the acoustic mode energy supply rate (Pmax). Assuming adiabatic
pulsations and using global stellar models that assume that the surface
stratification comes from the 3D hydrodynamical models, we computed the mode
amplitude in terms of surface velocity. This was converted into intensity
fluctuations using either a simplified adiabatic scaling relation or a
non-adiabatic one. From L and M (the luminosity and mass), the energy supply
rate Pmax is found to scale as (L/M)^2.6 for both main-sequence and red giant
stars, extending previous results. The theoretical amplitudes in velocity
under-estimate the Doppler velocity measurements obtained so far from the
ground for red giant stars by about 30%. In terms of intensity, the theoretical
scaling law based on the adiabatic intensity-velocity scaling relation results
in an under-estimation by a factor of about 2.5 with respect to the CoRoT
seismic measurements. On the other hand, using the non-adiabatic
intensity-velocity relation significantly reduces the discrepancy with the
CoRoT data. The theoretical amplitudes remain 40% below, however, the CoRoT
measurements. Our results show that scaling relations of mode amplitudes cannot
be simply extended from main-sequence to red giant stars in terms of intensity
on the basis of adiabatic relations because non-adiabatic effects for red giant
stars are important and cannot be neglected. We discuss possible reasons for
the remaining differences.

unprecedented depths. One key observable for constraining cosmological models
is the correlation function of these objects, measured through their
spectroscopic redshift. We study the redshift-space correlation functions of
clusters of galaxies, averaged over finite redshift intervals, and their
covariance matrices. Expanding as usual the angular anisotropy of the
redshift-space correlation on Legendre polynomials, we consider the
redshift-space distortions of the monopole as well as the next two multipoles,
$2\ell=2$ and 4. Taking into account the Kaiser effect, we developed an
analytical formalism to obtain explicit expressions of all contributions to
these mean correlations and covariance matrices. We include shot-noise and
sample-variance effects as well as Gaussian and non-Gaussian contributions. We
obtain a reasonable agreement with numerical simulations for the mean
correlations and covariance matrices on large scales ($r> 10 h^{-1}$Mpc).
Redshift-space distortions amplify the monopole correlation by about $10-20%$,
depending on the halo mass, but the signal-to-noise ratio remains of the same
order as for the real-space correlation. This distortion will be significant
for surveys such as DES, Erosita, and Euclid, which should also measure the
quadrupole $2\ell=2$. The third multipole, $2\ell=4$, may only be marginally
detected by Euclid.

pulsar have been recently discovered by the MAGIC and VERITAS Collaborations.
They were not clearly predicted by any pulsar model. It is at present argued
that this emission is produced by electrons in the Inverse Compton process
occurring either in the outer gap of the pulsar magnetosphere or in the pulsar
wind region at some distance from the light cylinder. We analyse another
scenario which is consistent with the basic features of this enigmatic
emission. It is proposed that this emission is caused by electrons accelerated
very close to the light cylinder where the $e^\pm$ plasma can not saturate
induced huge electric fields. Electrons reach energies sufficient for
production of hard $\gamma$-ray spectra in the curvature radiation process. Due
to different curvature radii of the leading and trailing magnetic field lines,
the $\gamma$-ray spectra from separate pulses should extend to different
maximum energies. The scenario can also explain the lower level $\gamma$-ray
emission from the interpulse region (between P1 and P2) observed in the Crab
pulsar light curve. Moreover, we argue that pulsars with parameters close to
the Vela pulsar should also show pulsed emission with the cut-off at clearly
lower energies ($\sim$50 GeV) than that observed in the case of the Crab
pulsar. On the other hand, such tail emission is not expected in pulsars with
parameters close to the Geminga pulsar. The model also predicts the tail
$\gamma$-ray emission extending up to $\sim$50 GeV from some millisecond
pulsars with extreme parameters such as PSR J0218+4243 and PSR J1823-3021A.

localized (find its location on 2-D plane), when initially only a subset of
nodes have their location information. The iterated localization process
proceeds as follows. Starting with a subset of nodes that have their location
information, possibly using global positioning system (GPS) devices, any other
node gets localized if it has three or more localized nodes in its radio range.
The newly localized nodes are included in the subset of nodes that have their
location information for the next iteration. This process is allowed to
continue, until no new node can be localized. The problem is to find the
minimum size of the initially localized subset to start with so that the whole
network is localized with high probability. There are intimate connections
between iterated localization and bootstrap percolation, that is well studied
in statistical physics. Using results known in bootstrap percolation, we find a
sufficient condition on the size of the initially localized subset that
guarantees the localization of all nodes in the network with high probability.

power sector (FTT:Power), a representation of global power systems based on
market competition, induced technological change (ITC) and natural resource use
and depletion. It is the first component of a family of sectoral bottom-up
models of technology, designed for integration into the global macroeconometric
model E3MG. ITC occurs as a result of technological learning produced by
cumulative investment and leads to highly nonlinear, irreversible and path
dependent technological transitions. The model uses a dynamic coupled set of
logistic differential equations. As opposed to traditional bottom-up energy
models based on systems optimisation, such differential equations offer an
appropriate treatment of the times and structure of change involved in sectoral
technology transformations, as well as a much reduced computational load.
Resource use and depletion are represented by local cost-supply curves, which
give rise to different regional energy landscapes. The model is explored for a
single global region using two simple scenarios, a baseline and a mitigation
case where the price of carbon is gradually increased. While a constant price
of carbon leads to a stagnant system, mitigation produces successive technology
transitions leading towards the gradual decarbonisation of the global power
sector.

establish that the abundances of every element in the analysis are homogeneus

For a total of 61 stars from the Hyades Supercluster, stellar atmospheric

StePar, which is based on the sensitivity to the stellar atmospheric parameters
of the iron EWs measured in the spectra. We derive the chemical abundances of

abundance trends reported in previous studies. The chemical tagging method is
applied with a carefully developed differential abundance analysis of each

Hyades cluster as a reference (vB 153). We find that only 28 stars (26 dwarfs

component in the form of dark matter is needed in order to match the
observations. In this work those analyses are extended by comparing lensing to
stellar masses for a sample of nine strong gravitational lenses that probe
galactic scales. The sample is extracted from a recent work that presents the
mass profile out to a few effective radii, therefore reaching into regions that
are dominated by dark matter in the standard (general relativity) scenario. A
range of interpolating functions are explored to test the validity of
MOND/TeVeS in these systems. Out of the nine systems, there are five robust
candidates with a significant excess (higher that 50%) of lensing mass with
respect to stellar mass, irrespective of the stellar initial mass function. One
of these lenses (Q0957) is located at the centre of a galactic cluster. This
system might be accommodated in MOND/TeVeS via the addition of a hot component,
like a 2 eV neutrino, that contribute over cluster scales. However, the other

of the subject is given, and several of the most obvious particle candidates
for dark matter are identified. Particular focus is given to weakly
interacting, massive particles (WIMPs) of which the lightest supersymmetric
particle is an interesting special case and a usful template. The three
detection methods: in particle accelerators, by direct detection of scattering
in terrestrial detectors, and indirect detection of products from dark matter
particle annihilation in the galactic halo, are discussed and their
complementarity is explained. Direct detection experiments have revealed some
possible indications of a dark matter signal, but the situation is quite
confusing at the moment. Very recently, also indirect detection has entered a
sensitivity region where some particle candidates could be detectable. Indeed,
also here there are some (presently non-conclusive) indications of possible
dark matter signals, like an interesting structure at 130 GeV gamma-ray energy
found in publicly available data from the Fermi-LAT space detector. The future
of the field will depend on whether WIMPs are indeed the dark matter, something
that may realistically be probed in the next few years. If this exciting
scenario turns out to be true, we can expect a host of other, complementary

more relevant and interesting question is how difficult it is to cluster data
sets {\em that can be clustered well}. More generally, despite the ubiquity and
the great importance of clustering, we still do not have a satisfactory
mathematical theory of clustering. In order to properly understand clustering,
it is clearly necessary to develop a solid theoretical basis for the area. For
example, from the perspective of computational complexity theory the clustering
problem seems very hard. Numerous papers introduce various criteria and
numerical measures to quantify the quality of a given clustering. The resulting
conclusions are pessimistic, since it is computationally difficult to find an
optimal clustering of a given data set, if we go by any of these popular
criteria. In contrast, the practitioners' perspective is much more optimistic.
Our explanation for this disparity of opinions is that complexity theory
concentrates on the worst case, whereas in reality we only care for data sets
that can be clustered well.
  We introduce a theoretical framework of clustering in metric spaces that
revolves around a notion of ""good clustering"". We show that if a good
clustering exists, then in many cases it can be efficiently found. Our
conclusion is that contrary to popular belief, clustering should not be
considered a hard task.

on the hardness of its worst case. This approach has many advantages and has
led to a deep and beautiful theory. However, from the practical perspective,
this leaves much to be desired. In application areas, practically interesting
instances very often occupy just a tiny part of an algorithm's space of
instances, and the vast majority of instances are simply irrelevant. Addressing
these issues is a major challenge for theoretical computer science which may
make theory more relevant to the practice of computer science.
  Following Bilu and Linial, we apply this perspective to MAXCUT, viewed as a
clustering problem. Using a variety of techniques, we investigate practically
interesting instances of this problem. Specifically, we show how to solve in
polynomial time distinguished, metric, expanding and dense instances of MAXCUT
under mild stability assumptions. In particular, $(1+\epsilon)$-stability
(which is optimal) suffices for metric and dense MAXCUT. We also show how to
solve in polynomial time $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-stable instances of MAXCUT,
substantially improving the best previously known result.

Finding this matrix in its entirety involves solving a matrix inversion

hence impractical whenever the graph is relatively large. Our approximations
use only few eigenpairs of the Laplacian matrix and are parametric with respect
to this number, so that the user can compromise between effectiveness and
efficiency of the approximated solution. We apply the devised approximations to
the problem of computing current-flow betweenness centrality on a graph.
However, given the generality of the Laplacian matrix, many other applications
can be sought. We experimentally demonstrate that the approximations are
effective already with a constant number of eigenpairs. These few eigenpairs
can be stored with a linear amount of memory in the number of nodes of the
graph and, in the realistic case of sparse networks, they can be efficiently
computed using one of the many methods for retrieving few eigenpairs of sparse

Indicators of disk evolution, such as holes and gaps, can be traced in the
spectral energy distribution (SED) and spatially resolved images.
  We aim to construct a self-consistent model of HH 30 by fitting all available
continuum observations simultaneously. New data sets not available in previous
studies, such as high-resolution interferometric imaging with the Plateau de
Bure Interferometer (PdBI) at lambda = 1.3 mm and SED measured with IRS on the
Spitzer Space Telescope in the mid-infrared, put strong constraints on
predictions and are likely to provide new insights into the evolutionary state
of this object.
  A parameter study based on simulated annealing was performed to find unbiased
best-fit models for independent observations made in the wavelength domain
lambda ~ 1 micron ... 4 mm. The method essentially creates a Markov chain
through parameter space by comparing predictions generated by our
self-consistent continuum radiation transfer code MC3D with observations.
  We present models of the edge-on circumstellar disk of HH 30 based on
observations from the near-infrared to mm-wavelengths that suggest the presence
of an inner depletion zone with about 45 AU radius and a steep decline of mm
opacity beyond 140 AU. Our modeling indicates that several modes of dust
evolution such as growth, settling, and radial migration are taking place in

expansion (OPE) in the context of perturbative, Euclidean $\varphi^{4}$-quantum
field theory. First, we demonstrate, generalizing earlier results and
techniques of arXiv:1105.3375, that the 3-point OPE, $< O_{A_1} O_{A_2} O_{A_3}
> = \sum_{C} \cal{C}_{A_1 A_2 A_3}^{C} <O_{C}>$, usually interpreted only as an
asymptotic short distance expansion, actually converges at finite, and even
large, distances. We further show that the factorization identity $\cal{C}_{A_1
A_2 A_3}^{B}=\sum_{C}\cal{C}_{A_1 A_2}^{C} \cal{C}_{C A_3}^{B}$ is satisfied
for suitable configurations of the spacetime arguments. Again, the infinite sum
is shown to be convergent. Our proofs rely on explicit bounds on the remainders
of these expansions, obtained using refined versions, mostly due to Kopper et
al., of the renormalization group flow equation method. These bounds also
establish that each OPE coefficient is a real analytic function in the
spacetime arguments for non-coinciding points. Our results hold for arbitrary
but finite loop orders. They lend support to proposals for a general axiomatic
framework of quantum field theory, based on such `consistency conditions' and
akin to vertex operator algebras, wherein the OPE is promoted to the defining
structure of the theory.

on Physics, was given by Ehrenfest, in 1917, who showed that the stability
requirement for $n$-dimensional two-body planetary system very strongly
constrains space dimensionality, favoring 3-d. This kind of approach will be
generically called ""stability postulate"" throughout this paper and was shown by
Tangherlini, in 1963, to be still valid in the framework of general relativity
as well as for quantum mechanical hydrogen atom, giving the same constraint for
space-dimensionality. In the present work, before criticizing this methodology,
a brief discussion has been introduced, aimed at stressing and clarifying some
general physical aspects of the problem of how to determine the number of space
dimensions. Then, the epistemological consequences of Ehrenfest's methodology
are critically reviewed. An alternative procedure to get at the proper number
of dimensions, in which the stability postulate (and the implicit singularities
in three-dimensional physics) are not an essential part of the argument, is
proposed. In this way, the main epistemological problems contained in
Ehrenfest's original idea are avoided. The alternative methodology proposed in
this paper is realized by obtaining and discussing the $n$-dimensional quantum
theory as expressed in Planck's law, de Broglie relation and the Heisenberg
uncertainty relation. As a consequence, it is possible to propose an
experiment, based on thermal neutron diffraction by crystals, to directly
measure space dimensionality. Finally the distinguished role of Maxwell's
electromagnetic theory in the determination of space dimensionality is
stressed.

representation of the Green's function. The perturbed modes are found by
solving a linear eigenvalue problem in matrix form. The method is illustrated
on exactly solvable one- and three-dimensional examples being, respectively, a
dielectric slab and a microsphere.

perihelion distances, q, outside Neptune's orbit, a_N, is quite different from
the dynamics of TNOs with q < a_N, already studied in previous works. While for
the last case there are stable equilibrium points at {\omega} = 0\circ,
90\circ, 180\circ and 270\circ in a wide range of orbital inclinations, for the
former case it appears a family of stable equilibrium points only at a specific
value of the orbital inclination, i \sim 62\circ, that we call critical
inclination. We show this family of equilibrium points is generated by a
mechanism analogue to which drives the dynamics of an artificial satellite
perturbed by an oblate planet. The planetary system also generates an
oscillation in the longitude of the perihelion of the TNOs with i \sim 46\circ,
being Eris a paradigmatic case. We discuss how the resonant condition with
Neptune modify the energy level curves and the location of equilibrium points.
The asymmetric librations of resonances of the type 1:N generate a distortion
in the energy level curves and in the resulting location of the equilibrium
points in the phase space ({\omega},q). We study the effect on the Kozai
dynamics due to the diffusion process in ""a"" that occurs in the Scattered Disk.

interacting with a multi-mode field of a ring cavity is discussed. The
retardation is associated with a finite time required for light to travel
between the atoms located at a finite distance and between the atoms and the
cavity boundaries. We explore features in the concurrence indicative of
retardation and show how these features evolve depending on the initial state
of the system, distance between the atoms and the number of modes to which the
atoms are coupled. In particular, we consider the short-time and the long time
dynamics for both the multi- and sub-wavelength distances between the atoms. It
is found that the retardation effects can qualitatively modify the entanglement
dynamics of the atoms not only at multi- but also at sub-wavelength distances.
We follow the temporal evolution of the concurrence and find that at short
times of the evolution the retardation induces periodic sudden changes of
entanglement. To analyze where the entanglement lies in the space spanned by
the state vectors of the system, we introduce the collective Dicke states of
the atomic system that explicitly account for the sudden changes as a periodic
excitation of the atomic system to the maximally entangled symmetric state. At
long times, the retardation gives rise to periodic beats in the concurrence
that resemble the phenomenon of collapses and revivals in the Jaynes-Cummings
model. In addition, we identify parameter values and initial conditions at
which the atoms remain separable or are entangled without retardation during
the entire evolution time, but exhibit the phenomena of sudden birth and sudden
death of entanglement when the retardation is included.

Heavy quarks, in particular, interact with the rest of the medium via binary
scatterings with a running coupling and a Debye screening which is matched by
comparing to hard thermal loop calculations. The lack of radiative processes in
the heavy flavor sector is accounted for by scaling the binary cross section
with a phenomenological factor K=3.5, which describes well the elliptic flow

J/psi from B mesons. We compare to experimental data, where it is already

observations in the CO J=1--0 and 3--2 lines have been carried out in an
interacting region of a molecular cloud with an HII region. As a result,
several 1,000 to 10,000 AU scale cloudlets with small velocity dispersion are
detected, whose systemic velocities have a relatively large scatter of a few
km/s. It is suggested that the cloud is composed of small-scale dense and cold
structures and their overlapping effect makes it appear to be a turbulent
entity as a whole. This picture strongly supports the two-phase model of
turbulent medium driven by thermal instability proposed previously. On the
surface of the present cloud, the turbulence is likely to be driven by thermal
instability following ionization shock compression and UV irradiation. Those
small scale structures with line width of ~ 0.6 km/s have a relatively high CO
line ratio of J=3--2 to 1--0, 1 < R(3-2/1-0) < 2. The large velocity gradient
analysis implies that the 0.6 km/s width component cloudlets have an average
density of 10^{3-4} cm^{-3}, which is relatively high at cloud edges, but their
masses are only < 0.05 M_{sun}.

small group of 24 asteroids dynamically linked to main-belt comet P/2006 VW139,
recently discovered by the Pan-STARRS1 survey telescope, shares a common
physical origin. By applying the Hierarchical Clustering and Backward
Integration methods, we find strong evidence that 11 of these asteroids form a
sub-group which likely originated in a recent collision event, and that this
group includes P/2006 VW139. The objects not found to be part of the 11-member
sub-group, which we designate as the P/2006 VW139 family, were either found to
be dynamically unstable, or these are likely interlopers which should be
expected due to the close proximity of the Themis family. As we demonstrated,
statistical significance of P/2006 VW139 family is >99 per cent. We determine
the age of the family to be 7.5 +/- 0.3 Myr, and estimate the diameter of the
parent body to be about 11 km. Results show that the family is produced by an
impact which can be best characterized as a transition from catastrophic to
cratering regime. The dynamical environment of this family is studied as well,
including the identification of the most influential mean motion and secular
resonances in the region. Our findings make P/2006 VW139 now the second
main-belt comet to be dynamically associated with a young asteroid family, a
fact with important implications for the origin and activation mechanism of
such objects.

speed up symbolic execution by reducing the invocation times of constraint

speculatively explore the branch without regard to the feasibility. Constraint
solver is invoked only when the speculated branches are accumulated to a
specified number. In addition, we present a key optimization technique that
enhances SSE greatly. We have implemented SSE and the optimization technique on
Symbolic Pathfinder (SPF). Experimental results on six programs show that, our
method can reduce the invocation times of constraint solver by 21% to 49% (with
an average of 30%), and save the search time from 23.6% to 43.6% (with an

identify the origin of the deviations, and explain it as arising from the
finite size of the system. Furthermore, finite-size effects in the pair

find that the theoretical predictions and the numerical results agree, provided

in the low storage limit, namely the correlated attractor case and the
multitasking case recently introduced by the authors. The former case is based
on a modification of the Hebbian prescription, which induces a coupling between
consecutive patterns and this effect is tuned by a parameter $a$. In the latter
case, dilution is introduced in pattern entries, in such a way that a fraction
$d$ of them is blank. Then, we merge these two extensions to obtain a system
able to retrieve several patterns in parallel and the quality of retrieval,
encoded by the set of Mattis magnetizations ${m^{\mu}}$, is reminiscent of the
correlation among patterns. By tuning the parameters $d$ and $a$, qualitatively
different outputs emerge, ranging from highly hierarchical, to symmetric. The
investigations are accomplished by means of both numerical simulations and
statistical mechanics analysis, properly adapting a novel technique originally
developed for spin glasses, i.e. the Hamilton-Jacobi interpolation, with
excellent agreement. Finally, we show the thermodynamical equivalence of this
associative network with a (restricted) Boltzmann machine and study its
stochastic dynamics to obtain even a dynamical picture, perfectly consistent
with the static scenario earlier discussed.
