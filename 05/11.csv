self-flux technique. The crystal structure with the space group P4/nbm was
established from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data and presents a
derivative of the LaGa6Ni0.6 prototype. Magnetic susceptibility measurements
show Curie-Weiss behaviour due to local Ce^3+ moments. At high temperatures,
the magnetic anisotropy is dominated by the crystal-electric-field (CEF) effect
with the easy axis along the crystallographic c direction. Ce2Ga12Pt undergoes
two antiferromagnetic phase transitions at T_N,1 = 7.3K and T_N,2 = 5.5K and
presents several metamagnetic transitions for the magnetic field along c.
Specific-heat measurements prove the bulk nature of these magnetic transitions
and reveal a doublet CEF ground state. The 4f contribution to the resistivity
shows a broad maximum at T_max ~ 85K due to Kondo scattering off the CEF ground
state and excited levels.

universal two-zero texture in the general case and propose two ansatze to
reduce the number of free parameters. Taking account of the new result of
\theta_{13} from the Daya Bay experiment, we constrain the parameter space of

effect. Our study has found strong evidence for pulsar spin-velocity alignment,
excluding that those two vectors are completely uncorrelated, with >99%
confidence. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of orthogonal
spin-velocity configurations, comparison of the data with simulations shows
that the scenario of aligned vectors is more likely than that of the orthogonal
case. Moreover, we have determined the spread of velocities that a spin-aligned
and spin-orthogonal distribution of kicks must have to produce the observed
distribution of spin-velocity angle offsets. If the observed distribution of
spin-velocity offset angles is the result of spin-aligned kicks, then we find
that the distribution of kick-velocity directions must be broad with
{\sigma}_v~30\degree if the orthogonal-kick scenario is assumed, then the
velocity distribution is much narrower with {\sigma}_v<10\degree. Finally, in
contrast to previous studies, we have performed robustness tests on our data,
in order to determine whether our conclusions are the result of a statistical
and/or systematic bias. The conclusion of a correlation between the spin and
velocity vectors is independent of a bias introduced by subsets in the total

10% systematic uncertainties on the determination of the spin-axis direction

chromospheric jets situated at the edge of a sunspot. Analysis reveals a near
continuous series of jets, that raise chromospheric material into the low
corona above a sunspot. The jets have average rise speeds of 30 km\,s^{-1} and
a range of 10-100km\,s^{-1}. Enhanced emission observed at the jets leading
edge suggests the formation of a shock front. Increased emission in TRACE
bandpasses above the sunspot and the disappearance of the jets from the Ca II
filter suggests that some of the chromospheric jet material is at least heated
to \sim0.1MK. The evidence suggests that the jets could be a mechanism which
provides a steady, low-level heating for active region features.

simulate about 90 multi-mass star clusters with the Nbody6 code. These clusters
have different initial total mass, half-mass radius and galactocentric

show that the slopes of the mass functions decrease with time. In addition we

order of magnitude smaller than the existing measurements. While strong
arguments have been made that the measured fluctuations do not have an origin

i) (cm-2) = 22.0+/-0.10, at zabs = 3.287 towards the QSO SDSS J 081634+144612.
We measure column densities of H2, C i, C i^*, Zn ii, Fe ii, Cr ii, Ni ii and
Si ii from a high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution VLT-UVES
spectrum. The overall metallicity of the system is [Zn/H] = -1.10 +/- 0.10
relative to solar. Two molecular hydrogen absorption components are seen at z =
3.28667 and 3.28742 (a velocity separation of \approx 52 km s-1) in rotational
levels up to J = 3. We derive a total H2 column density of log N(H2) (cm-2) =
18.66 and a mean molecular fraction of f = 2N(H2)/[2N(H2) + N(H i)] =
10-3.04+/-0.37, typical of known H2-bearing DLA systems. From the observed
abundance ratios we conclude that dust is present in the Interstellar Medium
(ISM) of this galaxy, with a enhanced abundance in the H2-bearing clouds.
However, the total amount of dust along the line of sight is not large and does
not produce any significant reddening of the background QSO. The physical
conditions in the H2-bearing clouds are constrained directly from the column
densities of H2 in different rotational levels, C i and C i^* . The kinetic
temperature is found to be T = 75 K and the particle density lies in the range
nH = 50-80 cm-3 . The neutral hydrogen column density of this DLA is similar to
the mean H i column density of DLAs observed at the redshift of {\gamma}-ray
bursts (GRBs). We explore the relationship between GRB-DLAs and high column
density end of QSO-DLAs finding that the properties (metallicity and depletion)
of DLAs with log N(H i) > 21.5 in the two populations do not appear to be
significantly different.

blazars. The amount of variability in different classes of Active Galactic
Nuclei has been studied extensively but many questions remain unanswered. We
present the results of a long-term programme to investigate the intra-night
optical variability (INOV) of powerful flat spectrum radio core-dominated
quasars (CDQs), with a focus on probing the relationship of INOV to the degree
of optical polarization. We observed a sample of 16 bright CDQs showing strong
broad optical emission lines and consisting of both high and low optical
polarization quasars (HPCDQs and LPCDQs). We employed ARIES, IIA, IGO
telescopes, to carry out {\it R}-band monitoring on a total of 47 nights.
Combining these INOV data with those taken from the literature, we were able to
increase the sample size to 21 CDQs(12 LPCDQs and 9 HPCDQs) monitored on a
total of 73 nights. As the existence of a prominent flat-spectrum radio core
signifies that strong relativistic beaming is present in all these CDQs, the
definitions of the two sets differ primarily in fractional optical
polarization, the LPCDQs showing a very low median$ P_{op} \simeq$ 0.4 per
cent.
  Our study yields an INOV duty cycle (DC) of $\sim$28 per cent for the LPCDQs
and $\sim 68$ percent for HPCDQs.
  If only strong INOV with fractional amplitude above 3 per cent is considered,
the corresponding DCs are $\sim$ 7 per cent and $\sim$ 40 per cent,
respectively.From this strong contrast between the two classes of luminous,
relativistically beamed quasars, it is apparent that relativistic beaming is
normally not a sufficient condition for strong INOV and a high optical
polarization is the other necessary condition.

calculated with state-of-the-art self-consistent random-phase approximation

\DeltaR_(pn) value for 124Sn was deduced to be 0.175 \pm 0.048 fm, which agrees
well with the previous results. The energy of the AGDR measured previously for

the pattern of nuclear recoil directions in a way that depends on the orbital

Knowing the former, WIMP aberration can give information on the latter, besides

lags O enrichment, we find a general conversion from O abundance to Fe
abundance. The distributions we present here are the best yet standard of
comparison for evaluating how rare classes of SNe depend on progenitor
metallicity. We measure the gas-phase O abundance of a representative subsample
of the hosts of SNe II from the first-year PTF SN search, using a combination
of SDSS spectra near the SN location (9) and new long slit spectroscopy (25).
The median metallicity of these 34 hosts is 12+log(O/H) = 8.65, with a median
error of 0.09. The median host galaxy stellar mass from fits to SDSS photometry
is 10^9.9 solar masses. They do not show a systematic offset in metallicity or
mass from a redshift-matched sample of the MPA/JHU value-added catalog. In
contrast to previous SN host metallicity studies, this sample is drawn from a
single, areal survey. SNe in the lowest-mass galaxies are not systematically
excluded. The metallicity distribution we find is statistically
indistinguishable from the metallicity distribution of SN II hosts found by
targeted surveys and by samples from multiple surveys with different selection
functions. Using the relationship between Fe and O abundances found for Milky
Way disk, bulge, and halo stars, we translate our O abundance distribution of
SN II environments into Fe abundance estimates. We find that though this sample
spans only 0.65 dex in O abundance, the gap between the Fe and O abundance is
50% wider at the low-metallicity end of our sample than at the high-metallicity

Monte Carlo/Fokker-Planck code (Chen et al. 2001). As primary source of seed
photons for inverse Compton scattering, we consider radiation from the broad
line region (BLR), from the molecular torus, and the local synchrotron
radiation (SSC). Different scenarios are assessed by comparing simulated light
curves and SEDs with one of the best flares by PKS1510-089, in March 2009. The
time-dependence of our code and its correct handling of light travel time
effects allow us to fully take into account the effect of the finite size of
the active region, and in turn to fully exploit the information carried by time
resolved observed SEDs, increasingly available since the launch of Fermi. We
confirm that the spectrum adopted for the external radiation has an important
impact on the modeling of the SED, in particular for the lower energy end of
the Compton component, observed in the X-ray band, which in turn is one of the
most critical bands to assess the differences between EC and SSC emission. In
the context of the scenario presented here, where the flaring is caused by the
increase of the number of relativistic electrons ascribed to the effect of the
interaction of a portion of the jet (blob) with a shock, we can not firmly
discriminate the three main scenarios for gamma-ray emission. However, results
show clearly the differences produced by a more realistic treatment of the
emitting source in the shape of SEDs and their time variability over relevant,
observable time-scales, and demonstrate the crucial importance of
time-dependent multi-zone models to advance our understanding of the physics of
these sources, by taking full advantage of the wealth of information offered by
the high quality data of current multiwavelength campaigns.

geographical coordinates for optimal greedy data packet forwarding. Simulation
results have demonstrated that ORION outperforms other existing DTN routing

Central questions are how these conformational changes are coupled to the
binding or catalytic processes during which they occur, and how they affect the
catalytic rates of enzymes. An important model system is the enzyme
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from E. coli, which exhibits characteristic
conformational changes of the active-site loop during the catalytic step and
during unbinding of the product. In this article, we present a general kinetic
framework that can be used (1) to identify the ordering of events in the
coupling of conformational changes, binding and catalysis and (2) to determine
the rates of the substeps of coupled processes from a combined analysis of NMR
R2 relaxation dispersion experiments and traditional enzyme kinetics
measurements. We apply this framework to E. coli DHFR and find that the
conformational change during product unbinding follows a
conformational-selection mechanism, i.e. the conformational change occurs
predominantly prior to unbinding. The conformational change during the
catalytic step, in contrast, is an induced change, i.e. the change occurs after
the chemical reaction. We propose that the reason for these conformational
changes, which are absent in human and other vertebrate DHFRs, is robustness of
the catalytic rate against large pH variations and changes to substrate/product
concentrations in E. coli.

many one-dimensional (1D) nonlinear wave phenomena, from water waves in narrow
canals to light pulses in optical fibers. In ultra-cold gases, they have long
been sought, and were first observed to be generated by phase-imprinting. More
recently, their spontaneous formation in 1D gases was predicted as a result of
the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, rapid evaporative cooling, and dynamical processes
after a quantum quench. Here we show that they actually occur generically in
the thermal equilibrium state of a weakly-interacting elongated Bose gas,
without the need for external forcing or perturbations. This reveals a major
new quality to the experimentally widespread quasicondensate state. It can be
understood via thermal occupation of the famous and somewhat elusive Type II
excitations in the Lieb-Liniger model of a uniform 1D gas.

X-ray-selected MCXC clusters that fall within the ACT Equatorial region and an

measured SZ flux from the X-ray-selected clusters is consistent with
expectations. However, we find that the measured SZ flux from the
optically-selected clusters is both significantly lower than expectations and
lower than the recovered SZ flux measured by the Planck satellite. Since we
find a lower recovered SZ signal than Planck, we investigate the possibility
that there is a significant offset between the optically-selected brightest
cluster galaxies (BCGs) and the SZ centers, to which ACT is more sensitive due
to its finer resolution. Such offsets can arise due to either an intrinsic
physical separation between the BCG and the center of the gas concentration or
from misidentification of the cluster BCG. We find that the entire discrepancy
for both ACT and Planck can be explained by assuming that the BCGs are offset
from the SZ maxima with a uniform random distribution between 0 and 1.5 Mpc.
Such large offsets between gas peaks and BCGs for optically-selected cluster
samples seem unlikely given that we find the physical separation between BCGs
and X-ray peaks for an X-ray-selected subsample of MaxBCG clusters to have a
much narrower distribution that peaks within 0.2 Mpc. It is possible that other
effects are lowering the ACT and Planck signals by the same amount, with
offsets between BCGs and SZ peaks explaining the remaining difference between
measurements. (Abridged)

have used the deep optical-to-radio multi-wavelength data in the SHADES Lockman
Hole East and SXDF/UDS fields to obtain galaxy identifications for ~64% (~80%
with tentative identifications) of the 148 AzTEC-SHADES 1.1 mm sources,
exploiting deep radio and 24 um data complemented by methods based on 8 um
flux-density and red optical-infrared (i-K) colour. This unusually high
identification rate can be attributed to the relatively bright
millimetre-wavelength flux-density threshold, combined with the relatively deep
supporting multi-frequency data. We have further exploited the
optical-mid-infrared-radio data to derive a ~60% (~75% with tentative
identifications) complete redshift distribution for the AzTEC-SHADES sources,
yielding a median redshift of z~2.2, with a high-redshift tail extending to at
least z~4. Despite the larger area probed by the AzTEC survey relative to the
original SCUBA SHADES imaging, the redshift distribution of the AzTEC sources
is consistent with that displayed by the SCUBA sources, and reinforces
tentative evidence that the redshift distribution of mm/sub-mm sources in the
Lockman Hole field is significantly different from that found in the SXDF/UDS
field. Comparison with simulated surveys of similar scale extracted from
semi-analytic models based on the Millennium simulation indicates that this is
as expected if the mm/sub-mm sources are massive (M>10^11 Mo) star-forming
galaxies tracing large-scale structures over scales of 10-20 Mpc. This confirms
the importance of surveys covering several square degrees (as now underway with
SCUBA2) to obtain representative samples of bright (sub)mm-selected galaxies.

survey in Kapteyn's Selected Areas (SAs), based on the PMs, SDSS photometry,
and follow-up spectroscopy of 215 stars. The signature of the Virgo
substructure is clear in the SDSS color-magnitude diagram (CMD) centered on SA
103, and 16 stars are identified that have high Galactocentric-frame radial
velocities (V_GSR > 50 km/s) and lie near the CMD locus of Virgo. The implied
distance to the Virgo substructure from the candidates is 14+/-3 kpc. We derive
mean kinematics from these 16 stars, finding a radial velocity V_GSR = 153+/-22
km/s and proper motions (mu_alpha*cos(delta), mu_delta) = (-5.24,
-0.91)+/-(0.43, 0.46) mas/yr. From the mean kinematics of these members, we
determine that the Virgo progenitor was on an eccentric (e ~ 0.8) orbit that
recently passed near the Galactic center (pericentric distance R_p ~ 6 kpc).
This destructive orbit is consistent with the idea that the substructure(s) in
Virgo originated in the tidal disruption of a Milky Way satellite. N-body
simulations suggest that the entire cloud-like Virgo substructure (encompassing
the ""Virgo Overdensity"" and the ""Virgo Stellar Stream"") is likely the tidal
debris remnant from a recently-disrupted massive (~10^9 M_sun) dwarf galaxy.
The model also suggests that some other known stellar overdensities in the
Milky Way halo (e.g., the Pisces Overdensity and debris near NGC 2419 and SEGUE
1) are explained by the disruption of the Virgo progenitor.

simultaneously attainable in the MSSM, with no additional fields and
supersymmetry breaking generated at the GUT scale. The Higgs mass is raised by
large radiative contributions from top squarks with significant left-right
mixing, and naturalness is preserved by the focus point mechanism with large
$A$-terms, which suppresses large log-enhanced sensitivities to variations in
the fundamental parameters. The focus point mechanism is independent of almost
all supersymmetry-breaking parameters, but is predictive in the top sector,
requiring the GUT-scale relation $m_{H_u}^2 : m_{\bar{U}_3}^2 : m_{Q_3}^2 :
A_t^2 = 1 : 1+x - 3y : 1-x : 9y$, where $x$ and $y$ are constants. We derive
this condition analytically and then investigate three representative models

superpartners, but dark matter searches in the case of non-unified gaugino
masses are promising, as are searches for top squarks and gluinos with top and
bottom-rich cascade decays at the LHC. This framework may be viewed as a simple
update to mSUGRA/CMSSM to accommodate both naturalness and current Higgs boson
constraints, and provides an ideal framework for presenting new results from

extensive than previously thought, and associated with enough enthalpy to
theoretically inhibit the inferred classical cooling flow. Nevertheless, we
present new evidence, consistent with previous results, that a moderately
strong residual cooling flow is persisting at 4%-8% of the classically
predicted rates in a spatially structured manner amid the feedback-driven
excavation of the X-ray cavity network. New Herschel observations are used to
estimate warm and cold dust masses, a lower-limit gas-to-dust ratio, and a star
formation rate consistent with previous measurements. The cooling time profile
of the ambient X-ray atmosphere is used to map the locations of the
observational star formation entropy threshold as well as the theoretical
thermal instability threshold. Both lie just outside the < 30 kpc central
region permeated by X-ray cavities, and star formation as well as ionized and
molecular gas lie interior to both. The young stars are distributed in an
elongated region that is aligned with the radio lobes, and their estimated ages
are both younger and older than the X-ray cavity network, suggesting both
jet-triggered as well as persistent star formation over the current AGN
feedback episode. Bright X-ray knots that are coincident with extended Ly-alpha
and FUV continuum filaments motivate a discussion of structured cooling from
the ambient hot atmosphere along a projected axis that is perpendicular to

arc of hot gas which in projection borders the inner edge of a large X-ray

(a) due to a compressed rim of cold gas pushed outward by the radio bubble or
(b) morphologically and energetically consistent with cavity-driven active

the enthalpy of a buoyant X-ray cavity is locally thermalized as ambient gas

of 46^+9_-8 Msun (for an adopted distance modulus of 18.7 mag to the young

hotter temperature (~47.5 kK) for the primary component. In either scenario, Sk

surface densities, Sigma, up to ~0.5g/cm^2 with 2"" resolution. We then
characterize the structure of 42 massive starless and early-stage IRDC cores
and their surrounding clumps, measuring Sigma_cl(r) from the core/clump
centers. We first assess the properties of the core/clump at a scale where the
total enclosed mass as projected on the sky is M_cl=60Msun. We find these
objects have a mean radius of R_cl~0.1pc, mean Sigma_cl=0.3g/cm^2 and, if fit
by a power law density profile rho_cl ~ r^{-k_{rho,cl}}, a mean value of
k_{rho,cl}=1.1. If we assume a core is embedded in each clump and subtract the
surrounding clump envelope to derive the core properties, we find a mean core
density power law index of k_{rho,c} = 1.6. We repeat this analysis as a
function of radius and derive the best-fitting power law plus uniform clump
envelope model for each of the 42 core/clumps. The cores have typical masses of
M_c~100Msun and mean Sigma_c~0.1g/cm^2, and are embedded in clumps with
comparable mass surface densities. We conclude massive starless cores exist and
are well-described by singular polytropic spheres. Their relatively low values
of Sigma and the fact that they are IR dark may imply that their fragmentation
is inhibited by magnetic fields rather than radiative heating. Comparing to
massive star-forming cores, there is tentative evidence for an evolution
towards higher densities and steeper density profiles as star formation
proceeds.

frequencies below the ionospheric plasma cutoff and must therefore be measured
in space, with deployable antenna systems. The problem of measuring both the
general direction and polarization of an electromagnetic source is commonly
solved by iterative fitting methods such as linear regression that deal
simultaneously with both directional and polarization parameters. We have
developed a scheme that separates the problem of deriving the source direction
from that of determining the polarization, avoiding iteration in a
multi-dimensional manifold. The crux of the method is to first determine the
source direction independently of concerns as to its polarization. Once the
source direction is known, its direct characterization in terms of Stokes
vectors in a single iteration if desired, is relatively simple. This study
applies the source-direction determination to radio signatures of flares
received by STEREO. We studied two previously analyzed radio type III bursts
and found that the results of the eigenvalue decomposition technique are
consistent with those obtained previously by Reiner et al. (Solar Phys. 259,
255, 2009). For the type III burst observed on 7 December 2007, the difference
in travel times from the derived source location to STEREO A and B is the same
as the difference in the onset times of the burst profiles measured by the two
spacecraft. This is consistent with emission originating from a single,
relatively compact source. For the second event of 29 January 2008, the
relative timing does not agree, suggesting emission from two sources separated
by 0.1 AU, or perhaps from an elongated region encompassing the apparent source
locations.

each of the five blazars 1ES 1101-232, Markarian 180, 1ES 1218+304, PG
1553+113, and H 2356-309, at frequencies from 5 to 22 GHz. Fundamental jet
properties, including the apparent jet speeds, that can be measured from these
multi-epoch series of VLBA images are presented and compared with other
gamma-ray blazars. Confirming prior work, we find that the TeV HBLs have
significantly slower apparent jet speeds than radio-selected blazars. Together
with other radio properties of the HBL class, this suggests modest Lorentz
factors in their parsec-scale radio jets. This in turn suggests some form of
Lorentz factor gradient in these jets, since they are likely to have high
Lorentz factors in their TeV-emitting regions. The study presented here
approximately doubles the number of TeV HBLs with multi-epoch parsec-scale
kinematic measurements.

resolution of phase shifts beyond the usual Heisenberg scaling of 1/n, where n
is a measure of resources such as the number of subsystems of the probe state
or the mean photon number of the probe state. These suggestions are based on
calculations of `local precision' for particular nonlinear schemes. However, we
show that there is no simple connection between the local precision and the
average estimation error for these schemes, leading to a scaling puzzle. This
puzzle is partially resolved by a careful analysis of iterative implementations
of the suggested nonlinear schemes. However, it is shown that the suggested
nonlinear schemes are still limited to an exponential scaling in \sqrt{n}.
(This scaling may be compared to the exponential scaling in n which is
achievable if multiple passes are allowed, even for linear schemes.) The
question of whether nonlinear schemes may have a scaling advantage in the
presence of loss is left open.
  Our results are based on a new bound for average estimation error that
depends on (i) an entropic measure of the degree to which the probe state can
encode a reference phase value, called the G-asymmetry, and (ii) any prior
information about the phase shift. This bound is asymptotically stronger than
bounds based on the variance of the phase shift generator. The G-asymmetry is
also shown to directly bound the average information gained per estimate. Our
results hold for any prior distribution of the shift parameter, and generalise
to estimates of any shift generated by an operator with discrete eigenvalues.

In this work we demonstrate that significant changes in nuclear spin
polarization can be created by applying an electric current in a 2-dimensional
electron system at Landau level filling factor nu=1/2. Electron spin
transitions at nu= 2/3 and 1/2 are utilized for the measurement of the nuclear
spin polarization. Consistent results are obtained from these two different
methods of nuclear magnetometry. The finite thickness of the electron
wavefunction is found to be important even for a narrow quantum well. The
current induced effect on nuclear spins can be attributed to electron heating
and the efficient coupling between the nuclear and electron spin systems at
nu=1/2. The electron temperature, elevated by the current, can be measured with
a thermometer based on the measurement of the nuclear spin relaxation rate. The
nuclear spin polarization follows a Curie law dependence on the electron
temperature. This work also allows us to evaluate the electron g-factor in high

populations, such as groups of healthy and diseased individuals. The interest
is in detecting a group effect. When the observations are vectorial,
real-valued and follow a multivariate Normal distribution, multivariate
analysis of variance (MANOVA) tests are routinely applied. However, such
traditional procedures are not suitable when dealing with more complex data
structures such as functional (e.g. curves) or graph-structured (e.g. trees and
networks) objects, where the required distributional assumptions may be
violated. In this paper we discuss a distance-based MANOVA-like approach, the
DBF test, for detecting differences between groups for a wider range of data
types. The test statistic, analogously to other distance-based statistics, only
relies on a suitably chosen distance measure that captures the pairwise
dissimilarity among all available samples. An approximate null probability
distribution of the DBF statistic is proposed thus allowing inferences to be
drawn without the need for costly permutation procedures. Through extensive
simulations we provide evidence that the proposed methodology works well for a
range of data types and distances, and generalizes the traditional MANOVA
tests. We also report on an application of the proposed methodology for the

cosmological parameters such as the dark energy equation of state parameters.
Here we study the effect of curvature on constraints on parameters used to test
general relativity (GR) at cosmological scales, commonly known as modified
growth (MG) parameters, as while current data taken in the context of the
$\Lambda$CDM model points to a universe that is flat or very close to it, this
constraint may not hold in modified theories of gravity. Using the latest
cosmological data sets we find that MG parameters are correlated with the
curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ and the constraints on the MG parameters are
weakened compared to when $\Omega_k$ is not included in the parameter analysis.
We next use various future simulated data sets, including cosmic microwave
background, weak lensing, and Integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations,
where the fiducial model is spatially curved but we assume a flat model when
fitting the MG parameters. We find the assumption of a spatially flat model on
a spatially curved universe does indeed cause an artificial shift in the
constraints on the MG parameters, in some cases even producing an apparent
deviation from GR in the MG parameter space. For our simulated data, tension
with GR begins to manifest itself for fiducial models with $\abs{\Omega_k} \geq
0.02$ and apparent deviations appear for $\abs{\Omega_k} \geq 0.05$. We find
that for negatively curved models the apparent deviation is more significant.
The manifestation of this apparent deviation from GR due to the assumption of
spatial flatness above leads one to conclude that, when using future
high-precision data to perform these tests, spatial curvature must be included
in the parameter analysis along with the other core cosmological parameters and
the MG parameters.

exchange messages between processing nodes. Decoding algorithms that exchange
binary messages are interesting for fully-parallel implementations because they
can reduce the number and the length of the wires, and increase logic density.
This paper introduces the Relaxed Half-Stochastic (RHS) decoding algorithm, a
binary message belief propagation (BP) algorithm that achieves a coding gain
comparable to the best known BP algorithms that use real-valued messages. We
derive the RHS algorithm by starting from the well-known Sum-Product algorithm,
and then derive a low-complexity version suitable for circuit implementation.
We present extensive simulation results on two standardized codes having

decreases to one tenth of the linear analysis results, favors forming the
configuration of KOI-152. Under such formation scenario, the planets in the

the planetary masses are estimated to be about $15,~19$, and $24 M_\oplus$,

management systems that generate and distribute keys between communicating

due to lack of central server and infrastructure in Mobile Ad hoc Networks
(MANETs), this is major problem to manage the keys in the network. Dynamically
changes in network's topology causes weak trust relationship among the nodes in
the network. In MANETs a mobile node operates as not only end terminal but also
as an intermediate router. Therefore, a multi-hop scenario occurs for
communication in MANETs; where there may be one or more malicious nodes in
between source and destination. A routing protocol is said to be secure that
detects the detrimental effects of malicious node(s in the path from source to
destination). In this paper, we proposed a key management scheme and a secure
routing protocol that secures on demand routing protocol such as DSR and AODV.
We assume that MANETs is divided into groups having a group leader in each
group. Group leader has responsibility of key management in its group. Proposed
key management scheme is a decentralized scheme that does not require any
Trusted Third Party (TTP) for key management. In proposed key management

two-cluster direct potential of the Coulomb force becomes in general a local
screened Coulomb potential. The asymptotic Hamiltonian yields two types of
asymptotic waves; one is an approximate Coulomb wave with $\rho$ in the
middle-range region, and the other a free (no-Coulomb) wave in the
longest-range region. The constant Wronskians of this Hamiltonian can be
calculated in either region. We can evaluate the Coulomb-modified nuclear phase
shifts for the screened Coulomb problem, using the matching condition proposed
by Vincent and Phatak for the sharply cut-off Coulomb problem. We apply this
method first to an exactly solvable model of the $\alpha \alpha$ scattering
with the Ali-Bodmer potential and confirm that a complete solution is obtained
with a finite $\rho$. The stability of nuclear phase shifts with respect to the

of avoiding any explicit modeling of the interface structure. In the present

proof of its convergence toward the unique entropy solution (for a broad class
of nonlinear hyperbolic equations). Due to the presence of a possibly resonant
interface, the standard technique based on a total variation estimate does not
apply, and DiPerna's uniqueness theorem must be used. Following a method

Following the intravenous administration of the 90^Y-HSAMMS in rats, 88.81% of

summation approach. Both scalar fields and electromagnetic fields are

T-matrices representing the Lippmann-Schwinger T-operators, one for each of the
objects. The two G's in the TGTG formula are the translation matrices, relating
the wave basis of an object to the wave basis of the other object. After
discussing the general theory, we apply the prescription to derive the explicit

cylinder-cylinder and cylinder-plane interactions. First the T-matrices for a
plane, a sphere and a cylinder are derived for the following cases: the object
is imposed with general Robin boundary conditions; the object is
semitransparent; and the object is magnetodielectric. Then the operator
approach is used to derive the translation matrices. From these, the explicit
TGTG formula for each of the scenarios can be written down. Besides summarizing

utilized to obtain multi-antenna gains, the system generally requires channel
state information (CSI) at the transmitters. We consider a linear precoding
scheme in a MIMO relaying broadcast channel with quantized CSI feedback from
both two-hop links. With this scheme, each remote user feeds back its quantized
CSI to the relay, and the relay sends back the quantized precoding information
to the base station (BS). An upper bound on the rate loss due to quantized
channel knowledge is first characterized. Then, in order to maintain the rate
loss within a predetermined gap for growing SNRs, a strategy of scaling
quantization quality of both two-hop links is proposed. It is revealed that the
numbers of feedback bits of both links should scale linearly with the transmit
power at the relay, while only the bit number of feedback from the relay to the
BS needs to grow with the increasing transmit power at the BS. Numerical
results are provided to verify the proposed strategy for feedback quality
control.

spatially averaged material parameters. To determine the mechanical state and
parameters in the Drosophila pupa dorsal thorax epithelium, we sever in vivo
the adherens junctions around a disk-shaped domain comprising typically hundred

orientations at once. The amplitude and anisotropy of the strain increase
during development. We also measure the stress to viscosity ratio and similarly
find an increase in amplitude and anisotropy. The relaxation time is of order
of ten seconds. We propose a space-time, continuous model of the relaxation.
Good agreement with experimental data validates the description of the
epithelial domain as a continuous, linear, visco-elastic material. We discuss
the relevant time and length scales. Another material parameter, the ratio of

days (3.779939 hours), that consists of a low-mass subdwarf B (sdB) star and a
white dwarf. As seen in many other similar systems, the gravitational field of
the white dwarf produces an ellipsoidal deformation of the sdB which appears in
the light curve as a modulation at two times the orbital frequency. The
ellipsoidal deformation of the sdB implies that the system has a maximum
inclination of ~40 degrees, with i \approx 20 degrees being the most likely.
The orbital radial velocity of the sdB star is high enough to produce a Doppler
beaming effect with an amplitude of 432 \pm 5 ppm, clearly visible in the
folded light curve. The photometric amplitude that we obtain, K1 = 85.8 km/s,
is ~12 per cent less than the spectroscopic RV amplitude of 97.2 \pm 2.0 km/s.
The discrepancy is due to the photometric contamination from a close object at
about 5 arcsec North West of KIC 6614501, which is difficult to remove. The
atmospheric parameters of the sdB star, Teff = 23 700 \pm 500 K and log g =

low to sustain core helium burning. If the mass was close to 0.18-0.19 Msun,
the star could be already on the final He-core WD cooling track. A higher mass,
up to ~0.25 Msun, would be compatible with a He-core WD progenitor undergoing a

defocusing and analytic. The main novelty compared to previous results, is the
proof of a unique continuation result in large time for some undamped equation.
The idea is to use an asymptotic smoothing effect proved by Hale and Raugel in
the context of dynamical systems. Then, once the analyticity in time is proved,
we apply a unique continuation result with partial analyticity due to Robbiano,
Zuily, Tataru and H\""ormander. Some other consequences are also given for the
controllability and the existence of a compact attractor.

extending the iterative summation of real-time path integrals (ISPI) to this

show that the exact relaxation rate deviates from the corresponding

increasing coupling to the impurity. Moreover, our approach allows us to

generalization of Dubrovin's duality in the framework of $F$-manifolds due to
Manin [22], we consider a special class of $F$-manifolds, called bi-flat
$F$-manifolds. A bi-flat $F$-manifold is given by the following data $(M,
\nabla_1,\nabla_2,\circ,*,e,E)$, where $(M, \circ)$ is an $F$-manifold, $e$ is
the identity of the product $\circ$, $\nabla_1$ is a flat connection compatible
with $\circ$ and satisfying $\nabla_1 e=0$, while $E$ is an eventual identity
giving rise to the dual product *, and $\nabla_2$ is a flat connection
compatible with * and satisfying $\nabla_2 E=0$. Moreover, the two connections
$\nabla_1$ and $\nabla_2$ are required to be hydrodynamically almost equivalent
in the sense specified in [2].
  First we show that, similarly to the way in which Frobenius manifolds are
constructed starting from Darboux-Egorov systems, also bi-flat $F$-manifolds
can be built from solutions of suitably augmented Darboux-Egorov systems,
essentially dropping the requirement that the rotation coefficients are
symmetric.
  Although any Frobenius manifold possesses automatically the structure of a
bi-flat $F$-manifold, we show that the latter is a strictly larger class. In
particular we study in some detail bi-flat $F$-manifolds in dimensions n=2, 3.
For instance, we show that in dimension 3 bi-flat $F$-manifolds are
parametrized by solutions of a two parameters Painlev\'e VI equation, admitting
among its solutions hypergeometric functions. Finally we comment on some open
problems of wide scope related to bi-flat $F$-manifolds.

vegetation to spread and colonize other parts of the landscape. A suitable
cooperation between these three terms is able to give rise to ordered
structures which show spatial and temporal coherence, and are statistically
steady in time.

of a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson within the Peccei-Quinn invariant
extension of the NMSSM (PQ-NMSSM). The SM singlet added to the Higgs sector
connects the PQ and visible sectors through a PQ-invariant non-renormalizable
K\""ahler potential term, making the model free from the tadpole and domain-wall
problems. For the case that the lightest Higgs boson is dominated by the
singlet scalar, the Higgs mixing increases the mass of a SM-like Higgs boson
while reducing its signal rate at collider experiments compared to the SM case.
The Higgs mixing is important also in the region of parameter space where the
NMSSM contribution to the Higgs mass is small, but its size is limited by the
experimental constraints on the singlet-like Higgs boson and on the lightest
neutralino constituted mainly by the singlino whose Majorana mass term is
forbidden by the PQ symmetry. Nonetheless the Higgs mixing can increase the
SM-like Higgs boson mass by a few GeV or more even when the Higgs signal rate
is close to the SM prediction, and thus may be crucial for achieving a 125 GeV
Higgs mass, as hinted by the recent ATLAS and CMS data. Such an effect can
reduce the role of stop mixing.

The transverse energy density per unit pseudorapidity d(ET)/d(eta) increases
faster with collision energy than the charged particle multiplicity. This
implies that the mean energy per particle is increasing with collision energy.
At all pseudorapidities the transverse energy per participating nucleon
increases with the centrality of the collision. The ratio of transverse energy
per unit pseudorapidity in peripheral to central collisions varies
significantly as the pseudorapidity increases from eta = 0 to abs(eta) = 5.0.
For the 5% most central collisions the energy density per unit volume is

  This 5th force predicts quark mixing and the related CP violation, which in
fact was a phenomena observed in labs about fifty years ago. Thus, there are
two conflicting theories as of now, the one based on the 5th force which {\em
predicts} this phenomena and the established Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)

test of these two theories against the recent experimental data is presented.
It is found in this test that the CKM theory fares poorly, whereas the one
based on the 5th force withstands the test well, in both accuracy and
precision. For example, for the CKM matrix entry $V_{cd}$, we have

brighter PNe, S and Ar; central star luminosities and temperatures are also
derived. For 40 PNe with Cloudy models, from the upper 2 mag. of the luminosity
function, the most reliably estimated element, oxygen, has a mean 12+log(O/H)
of 8.52. No obvious radial gradient is apparent in O/H over a range 2-20 kpc.
Comparison of the PN abundances with the stellar population, from the spectra
of the integrated starlight on the multi-slits and photometric studies,
suggests [Fe/H]=-0.4 and [O/Fe]=0.25. The masses of the PN central stars in NGC

efficient way of extension of wavelength ranges of existing and planned X-ray
FEL facilities. Contrary to nonlinear harmonic generation, harmonic lasing can
provide much more intense, stable, and narrow-band FEL beam which is easier to
handle due to the suppressed fundamental frequency. In this paper we perform a
parametrization of the solution of the eigenvalue equation for lasing at odd
harmonics, and present an explicit expression for FEL gain length, taking into
account all essential effects. We propose and discuss methods for suppression
of the fundamental harmonic. We also suggest a combined use of harmonic lasing
and lasing at the retuned fundamental wavelength in order to reduce bandwidth
and to increase brilliance of X-ray beam at saturation. Considering 3rd
harmonic lasing as a practical example, we come to the conclusion that it is
much more robust than usually thought, and can be widely used in the existing
or planned X-ray FEL facilities. In particular, LCLS after a minor modification
can lase to saturation at the 3rd harmonic up to the photon energy of 25-30 keV
providing multi-gigawatt power level and narrow bandwidth. As for the European
XFEL, harmonic lasing would allow to extend operating range (ultimately up to
100 keV), to reduce FEL bandwidth and to increase brilliance, to enable
two-color operation for pump-probe experiments, and to provide more flexible
operation at different electron energies. Finally, in this paper we discover
that in a part of the parameter space, corresponding to the operating range of
soft X-ray beamlines of X-ray FEL facilities (like SASE3 beamline of the

the novel concept of entanglement susceptibility by expanding the 2-Renyi

quantitatively which violations one should expect when the system becomes

updated during the simulations. Thus, this simulation can be referred to as
""Simulated Tempering and Magnetizing (STM)."" We also performed the ""Simulated
Magnetizing"" (SM) simulations, in which the external field was considered as a

studies, the ST method is not always compatible with first-order phase
transitions. This is also true in the magnetizing process. Flipping of the
entire magnetization did not occur in the SM simulations under $T_\mathrm{c}$

temperature region in the STM simulations. Thus, the dimensional extension let
us eliminate the difficulty of the first-order phase transitions and study wide

techniques to determine from remote-sensing observations the CME direction of
propagation, arrival time and final speed which are compared to in situ
measurements. We find evidence that for large viewing angles, the HM fitting
method predicts the CME direction better. However, this may be due to the fact
that only wide CMEs can be successfully observed when the CME propagates more
than 100 deg from the observing spacecraft. Overall eight CMEs, originating
from behind the limb as seen by one of the STEREO spacecraft can be tracked and
their arrival time at the other STEREO spacecraft can be successfully
predicted. This includes CMEs, such as the events on 4 December 2009 and 9
April 2010, which were viewed 130 deg away from their direction of propagation.
Therefore, we predict that some Earth-directed CMEs will be observed by the HIs
until early 2013, when the separation between Earth and one of the STEREO
spacecraft will be similar to the separation of the two STEREO spacecraft in
2009--2010.

definition is that a set of galaxies is homologous if they are the same in all
respects up to a set of three dimensional scaling constants which may differ
from one galaxy to the next. Noting that we are free to choose the dimensional
constants, we find that a set of hydrodynamic simulated galaxy merger remnants

taken to be the radius containing equal amounts of dark and baryonic matter

half-mass radius. Once the correct dimensional scaling constants are used, the

Currently, two theories for their formation have been presented. These are the
Final Flash scenario, in which a dying asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star
throws off its atmosphere to reveal the hydrogen poor, heavily processed
material underneath, and the double degenerate scenario, in which two white
dwarfs merge to produce a new star with renewed vigour. Some theories predict
that the temperatures reached during the latter scenario would destroy any
lithium originally present in the white dwarfs. The observed lithium content of
some R Coronae Borealis stars, therefore, is often interpreted as an indication
that the Final Flash scenario best describes their formation. In this paper, it
is shown that lithium production can, indeed, occur in the merging of a helium
white dwarf with a carbon-oxygen white dwarf if their chemical composition,
particularly that of 3He, is fully considered. The production mechanism is
described in detail, and the sensitivity of lithium production to the merger
environment is investigated. Nucleosynthesis post-processing calculations of
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) tracer particles are performed to show
that any lithium produced in these environments will be concentrated towards
the cloud of material surrounding the R CrB star. Measurements of the lithium
content of these clouds would, therefore, provide a valuable insight into the
formation mechanism of R CrB stars.

coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the particle acceleration in the associated
flares as evidenced in RHESSI non-thermal X-rays for a set of 37 impulsive
flare-CME events. CME peak velocity and peak acceleration yield distinct
correlations with various parameters characterizing the flare-accelerated
electron spectra. The highest correlation coefficient is obtained for the
relation of the CME peak velocity and the total energy in accelerated electrons
(c = 0.85), supporting the idea that the acceleration of the CME and the
particle acceleration in the associated flare draw their energy from a common
source, probably magnetic reconnection in the current sheet behind the erupting
structure. In general, the CME peak velocity shows somewhat higher correlations
with the non-thermal flare parameters than the CME peak acceleration, except
for the spectral index of the accelerated electron spectrum which yields a
higher correlation with the CME peak acceleration (c = -0.6), indicating that
the hardness of the flare-accelerated electron spectrum is tightly coupled to
the impulsive acceleration process of the rising CME structure. We also
obtained high correlations between the CME initiation height $h_0$ and the
non-thermal flare parameters, with the highest correlation of $h_0$ to the
spectral index of flare-accelerated electrons (c = 0.8). This means that CMEs
erupting at low coronal heights, i.e.\ in regions of stronger magnetic fields,
are accompanied with flares which are more efficient to accelerate electrons to
high energies. In the majority of events (80%), the non-thermal flare emission
starts after the CME acceleration (6 min), giving a current sheet length at the
onset of magnetic reconnection of 21 \pm 7 Mm. The flare HXR peaks are well
synchronized with the peak of the CME acceleration profile.

to the energy costs of deployments without additional hardware. Accurate power
usage data leads to the possibility of Cloud providers creating a separate
tariff for power and therefore incentivizing software developers to create

fall into groups and clusters (also referred to as `strangulation' or
`starvation') is generally thought to shut down star formation on a time scale
of a few Gyr. However, it has recently been suggested, on the basis of
X-ray-optical scaling relations of galaxies in the field and the group/cluster
environment, that confinement pressure by the intra-cluster medium can actually
lead to an increase in the mass of hot gas surrounding these galaxies. We
investigate the competition between pressure confinement and ram pressure
stripping for satellite galaxies in orbit about galaxy groups and clusters
using simple analytic models and detailed cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations. It is found that, independent of host mass, ram pressure is
generally dominant over confinement pressure --- only ~16 % of galaxies find
themselves in the reverse situation. Furthermore, these galaxies have, on
average, less hot gas than ram-pressure dominated ones, contrary to simple
expectations. This is explained by the fact that the small number of galaxies
which are confinement dominated are typically at first or second apocentre and
have therefore already been maximally affected by ram pressure stripping around
first pericentre. Our results are shown to be insensitive to host halo mass; we
argue that the same is true for uncertain sub-grid processes, such as feedback.

uncertainty in models for these outflows is the distance ($R$) to the gas from
the central black hole. In this paper we use the HST/COS data from a massive
multi-wavelength monitoring campaign on the bright Seyfert I galaxy Mrk 509, in
combination with archival HST/STIS data, to constrain the location of the
various kinematic components of the outflow. We compare the expected response
of the photoionized gas to changes in ionizing flux with the changes measured
in the data using the following steps: 1) We compare the column densities of
each kinematic component measured in the 2001 STIS data with those measured in
the 2009 COS data; 2) We use time-dependent photionization calculations with a
set of simulated lightcurves to put statistical upper limits on the hydrogen
number density that are consistent with the observed small changes in the ionic
column densities; 3) From the upper limit on the number density, we calculate a
lower limit on the distance to the absorber from the central source via the
prior determination of the ionization parameter. Our method offers two
improvements on traditional timescale analysis. First, we account for the
physical behavior of AGN lightcurves. Second, our analysis accounts for the
quality of measurement in cases where no changes are observed in the absorption
troughs. The very small variations in trough ionic column densities (mostly
consistent with no change) between the 2001 and 2009 epochs allow us to put
statistical lower limits on the distance between 100--200 pc for all the major
UV absorption components at a confidence level of 99%. These results are mainly
consistent with the independent distance estimates derived for the warm
absorbers from the simultaneous X-ray spectra.
