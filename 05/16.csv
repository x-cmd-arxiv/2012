loose groups and in the field to deepen our understanding of the physical
mechanisms acting upon galaxy evolution in different environments. We select
samples of galaxies in compact groups identified by McConnachie et al., loose
groups identified by Zandivarez and Martinez, and field galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. We compare properties of the galaxy populations in these
different environments: absolute magnitude, colour, size, surface brightness,
stellar mass and concentration. We also study the fraction of red and early
type galaxies, the luminosity function, the colour-luminosity and
luminosity-size relations. The population of galaxies in compact groups differ
from that of loose groups and the field. The fraction of read and early type
galaxies is higher in compact groups. On average, galaxies in compact groups
are systematically smaller, more concentrated and have higher surface
brightness than galaxies in the field and in loose groups. For fixed absolute
magnitude, or fixed surface brightness, galaxies in compact groups are smaller.
The physical mechanisms that transform galaxies into earlier types could be
more effective within compact groups given the high densities and low velocity
dispersion that characterise that particular environment, this could explain
the large fraction of red and early type galaxies we found in compact groups.
Galaxies inhabiting compact groups have undergone a major transformation
compared to galaxies that inhabit loose groups.

theory in special kinematics where all external four-dimensional momenta are
restricted to a (1+1)-dimensional subspace. The amplitudes are known to satisfy
non-trivial factorisation properties arising from multi-collinear limits, which
we further study here. We are able to find a general solution to these
multi-collinear limits. This results in a simple formula which represents an
n-point superamplitude in terms of a linear combination of functions S_m which
are constrained to vanish in all appropriate multi-collinear limits. These
collinear-vanishing building blocks, S_m, are dual-conformally-invariant
functions which depend on the reduced m-point kinematics with 8 \leq m \leq 4l.
For MHV amplitudes they can be constructed directly using, for example, the
approach in Ref. [1]. This procedure provides a universal uplift of lower-point
collinearly vanishing building blocks S_m to all higher-point amplitudes. It
works at any loop-level l \geq 1 and for any MHV or N^kMHV amplitude. We
compare this with explicit examples involving n-point MHV amplitudes at 2-loops

different properties and are treated separately from loop-level amplitudes in

with arrays like LOFAR, MWA and GMRT, will have a very low signal-to-noise
ratio per resolution element (\sim 0.2). In addition, whereas the variance of
the cosmological signal decreases on scales larger than the typical size of
ionization bubbles, the variance of the formidable galactic foregrounds
increases, making it hard to disentangle the two on such large scales. The poor
sensitivity on small scales on the one hand, and the foregrounds effect on
large scales on the other hand, make direct imaging of the Epoch of
Reionization of the Universe very difficult, and detection of the signal
therefore is expected to be statistical.Despite these hurdles, in this paper we
argue that for many reionization scenarios low resolution images could be
obtained from the expected data. This is because at the later stages of the
process one still finds very large pockets of neutral regions in the IGM,
reflecting the clustering of the large-scale structure, which stays strong up
to scales of \sim 120 comoving Mpc/h (\sim 1 degree). The coherence of the
emission on those scales allows us to reach sufficient S/N (\sim 3) so as to
obtain reionization 21 cm images. Such images will be extremely valuable for
answering many cosmological questions but above all they will be a very
powerful tool to test our control of the systematics in the data. The existence
of this typical scale (\sim 120 comoving Mpc/h) also argues for designing
future EoR experiments, e.g., with SKA, with a field of view of at least 4

energy distribution, acceleration rate, and maximum energies achievable in
these flows. We also discuss a scenario, based on jets dominated by magnetic
fields of changing polarity, in which this mechanism may operate. Results. The
proposed acceleration mechanism operates if the reconnection layer is much
thinner than its transversal characteristic size, and the magnetic field has a
disordered component. Synchrotron losses may prevent electrons from entering in
this acceleration regime. The acceleration rate should be faster, and the
energy distribution of particles harder than in standard diffusive shock
acceleration. The interaction of obstacles with the innermost region of jets in
active galactic nuclei and microquasars may be suitable sites for particle
acceleration in converging flows.

class of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), in which the peak luminosity exceeds
10^{44} erg/s. Here we focus on a subclass of these events, where the light
curve is also tens of days wide, so the total radiated energy is order 10^{51}
erg. If the origin of these SLSNe is a core-collapse-driven explosion of a
massive star, then the mechanism which converts the explosion energy into
radiation must be very efficient (much more than in typical core collapse SNe,
where this efficiency is of order one percent). We examine the scenario where
the radiated luminosity is due to efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the
ejected stellar envelope into radiation by interaction with an optically thick,
pre-existing circumstellar material (CSM), presumably the product of a steady
wind from the progenitor. We base the analysis on a simple, numerically solved,
hydrodynamic diffusion model, which allows us to identify the qualitative
behavior of the observable light curves, and to relate them to the parameters
of the wind. We specifically show that a wide and superluminous supernova
requires the mass of the relevant wind material to be comparable to that of
ejected material from the exploding progenitor. We find the wind parameters
which explain the peak luminosity and width of the bolometric light curves of
three particular SLSNe, namely, SN 2005ap, SN 2006gy, and SN 2010gx, and show
that they are best fitted with a wind that extends to a radius of order 10^{15}
cm. These results serve as an additional indication that at least some SLSNe
are powered by interaction of the ejected material with a steady wind of
similar mass.

Non-Hamiltonian Chaotic Flows in $ R^{3} $, are dissipation induced
deformations, of integrable volume preserving flows, specified by pairs of
Intersecting Surfaces in $R^{3}$. In the present work we focus our attention to
the Lorenz system with a linear dissipative sector in its phase space dynamics.
In this case the Intersecting Surfaces are Quadratic. We parametrize its
dissipation strength through a continuous control parameter $\epsilon$, acting
homogeneously over the whole 3-dim. phase space. In the extended
$\epsilon$-Lorenz system we find a scaling relation between the dissipation
strength $ \epsilon $ and Reynolds number parameter r . It results from the
scale covariance, we impose on the Lorenz equations under arbitrary rescalings
of all its dynamical coordinates. Its integrable limit, ($ \epsilon = 0 $, \
fixed r), which is described in terms of intersecting Quadratic Nambu
""Hamiltonians"" Surfaces, gets mapped on the infinite value limit of the
Reynolds number parameter (r $\rightarrow \infty,\ \epsilon= 1$). In effect
weak dissipation, through small $\epsilon$ values, generates and controls the
well explored Route to Chaos in the large r-value regime. The non-dissipative
$\epsilon=0 $ integrable limit is therefore the gateway to Chaos for the Lorenz
system.

magnetic transport channel where a half integer resonance is induced such that
the normal elliptical motion of particles in x-x' phase space becomes
hyperbolic, with particles moving to smaller x and larger x' at the channel
focal points. Thin absorbers placed at the focal points of the channel then
cool the angular divergence of the beam by the usual ionization cooling
mechanism where each absorber is followed by RF cavities. We present a theory
of Parametric-resonance Ionization Cooling (PIC), starting with the basic
principles in the context of a simple quadrupole-focused beam line. Then we
discuss detuning caused by chromatic, spherical, and non-linear field
aberrations and the techniques needed to reduce the detuning. We discuss the
requirement that PIC be accompanied by emittance exchange in order to keep the
momentum spread sufficiently small. Examples of PIC channel are presented,

Brownian motion or fractal process) and define a new risk measure, the
p-variation, which reduces to the variance if the process is a brownian motion.
We deduce the explicit formula for the TC and IS algorithms under a
self-similar process. We show that there is an equivalence between selfsimilar
models and a family of risk measures called p-variations: assuming a
self-similar process and calibrating empirically the parameter p for the
p-variation yields the same result as assuming a Brownian motion and using the
p-variation as risk measure instead of the variance. We also show that p can be
seen as a measure of the aggressiveness: p increases if and only if the TC
algorithm starts later and executes faster. Finally, we show how the parameter
p of the p-variation can be implied from the optimal starting time of TC, and
that under this framework p can be viewed as a measure of the joint impact of
market impact (i.e. liquidity) and volatility.

proposed as a key physical process to regulate the co-evolution of nuclear
black holes and their host galaxies. The recent detection of a massive gas
outflow in one of the most distant quasar, SDSS J1148+5251 at z = 6.4,
presented by Maiolino et al. (2012) strongly supports this idea and suggests
that strong quasar feedback is already at work at very early times. In a
previous work, Valiante et al. (2011), we have presented a hierarchical
semi-analytical model, GAMETE/ QSOdust, for the formation and evolution of
high-redshift quasars, and we have applied it to the quasar SDSS J1148+5251,
with the aim of investigating the star formation history, the nature of the
dominant stellar populations and the origin and properties of the large dust
mass observed in the host galaxy. A robust prediction of the model is that the
evolution of the nuclear black hole and of the host galaxy are tightly coupled
by quasar feedback in the form of strong galaxy-scale winds. In the present
letter, we show that the gas outflow rate predicted by GAMETE/QSOdust is in
good agreement with the lower limit of 3500 Msun/yr inferred by the
observations. According to the model, the observed outflow at z = 6.4 is
dominated by quasar feedback, as the outflow rate has already considerably
depleted the gas content of the host galaxy, leading to a down-turn in the star
formation rate at z < 7 - 8. Hence, supernova explosions give a negligible
contribution to the observed winds at z = 6.4.

the survey the most comprehensive in terms of redshift completeness of any
sample to the full Swift depth, analyzed to date. We present the cumulative
redshift distribution and derive a conservative, yet small, associated
uncertainty. We constrain the fraction of Swift GRBs at high redshift to a
maximum of 14% (5%) for z > 6 (z > 7). The mean redshift of the host sample is
assessed to be <z> > 2.2, with the 10 new redshifts reducing it significantly.
Using this more complete sample, we confirm previous findings that the GRB rate
at high redshift (z > 3) appears to be in excess of predictions based on
assumptions that it should follow conventional determinations of the star
formation history of the universe, combined with an estimate of its likely
metallicity dependence. This suggests that either star formation at high
redshifts has been significantly underestimated, for example due to a dominant
contribution from faint, undetected galaxies, or that GRB production is
enhanced in the conditions of early star formation, beyond that usually
ascribed to lower metallicity.

turbulence in our simulations. In support of this inference, we present four
major results. First, the convective fluxes and kinetic energies in the
neutrino-heated region are consistent with expectations of buoyancy-driven
convection. Second, the convective flux is positive where buoyancy actively
drives convection, and the radial and tangential components of the kinetic
energy are in rough equipartition (i.e. K_r ~ K_{\theta} + K_{\phi}). Both
results are natural consequences of buoyancy-driven convection, and are
commonly observed in simulations of convection. Third, buoyant driving is
balanced by turbulent dissipation. Fourth, the convective luminosity and
turbulent dissipation scale with the driving neutrino power. In all, these four
results suggest that in neutrino-driven explosions, the multi-dimensional
motions are consistent with neutrino-driven convection.

with the BEAMS formalism, allowing for fully photometric supernova cosmology
studies. Here we extend BEAMS to deal with the case in which the supernovae are
correlated by systematic uncertainties. The analytical form of the full BEAMS
posterior requires evaluating 2^N terms, where N is the number of supernova
candidates. This `exponential catastrophe' is computationally unfeasible even
for N of order 100. We circumvent the exponential catastrophe by marginalising
numerically instead of analytically over the possible supernova types: we
augment the cosmological parameters with nuisance parameters describing the
covariance matrix and the types of all the supernovae, \tau_i, that we include
in our MCMC analysis. We show that this method deals well even with large,
unknown systematic uncertainties without a major increase in computational
time, whereas ignoring the correlations can lead to significant biases and
incorrect credible contours. We then compare the numerical marginalisation
technique with a perturbative expansion of the posterior based on the insight
that future surveys will have exquisite light curves and hence the probability
that a given candidate is a Type Ia will be close to unity or zero, for most
objects. Although this perturbative approach changes computation of the
posterior from a 2^N problem into an N^2 or N^3 one, we show that it leads to
biases in general through a small number of misclassifications, implying that

velocities exceeding 30 km/s. Their high speeds allow them to travel ~0.1-1 kpc
away from their birth place before they explode at the end of their several Myr
lifetimes. At high redshift, when galaxies were much smaller than in the local
universe, runaways could venture far from the dense inner regions of their host
galaxies. From these large radii, and therefore low column densities, much of
their ionizing radiation is able to escape into the intergalactic medium.
Runaways may therefore significantly enhance the overall escape fraction of
ionizing radiation, fesc, from small galaxies at high redshift. We present
simple models of the high-redshift runaway population and its impact on fesc as
a function of halo mass, size, and redshift. We find that the inclusion of
runaways enhances fesc by factors of ~1.1-8, depending on halo mass, galaxy
geometry, and the mechanism of runaway production, implying that runaways may
contribute 50-90% of the total ionizing radiation escaping from high-redshift

suppressed at large magnetic Reynolds numbers owing to the conservation of

Advection of magnetic fields by stellar and galactic winds toward the outer

Here we explore the relative roles played by advective and turbulent--diffusive

of advection, the dynamo, otherwise stationary, becomes oscillatory. We confirm
an earlier result for turbulent--diffusive magnetic helicity fluxes that for
small magnetic Reynolds numbers ($\Rm\lesssim 100...200$, based on the
wavenumber of the energy-carrying eddies) the magnetic helicity flux scales
less strongly with magnetic Reynolds number ($\Rm^{-1/2}$) than the term
describing magnetic helicity destruction by resistivity ($\Rm^{-1}$). Our new
results now suggest that for larger $\Rm$ the former becomes approximately
independent of $\Rm$, while the latter falls off more slowly. We show for the
first time that both for weak and stronger winds, the magnetic helicity flux
term becomes comparable to the resistive term for $\Rm\gtrsim 1000$, which is
necessary for alleviating catastrophic quenching.

actively accreting metals from a circumstellar disk of gas caused by the
destruction of asteroids perturbed by planetary systems. We report, for the
first time, the detection of circumstellar Ca~II gas in absorption around the
DAZ WD~1124-293, which lacks an infrared excess. We constrain the gas to $>$7
$R_{\rm WD}$ and $<$32000~AU, and estimate it to be at $\sim$54~R$_{\rm WD}$,
well within WD~1124-293's tidal disruption radius. This detection is based on
several epochs of spectroscopy around the Ca~II H and K lines
($\lambda$=3968\AA, 3933\AA) with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan/Clay
Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We confirm the circumstellar nature of
the gas by observing nearby sightlines and finding no evidence for gas from the
local interstellar medium. Through archival data we have measured the
equivalent width of the two photospheric Ca lines over a period of 11 years. We
see $<$ 5-7\% epoch-to-epoch variation in equivalent widths over this time
period, and no evidence for long term trends. The presence of a circumstellar
gas implies a near edge-on inclination to the system, thus we place limits to
short period transiting planetary companions with R $>$ R$_{\rm \oplus}$ using
the WASP survey. The presence of gas in orbit around WD~1124-293 implies that
most DAZs could harbor planetary systems. Since 25-30\% of white dwarfs show
metal line absorption, the dynamical process for perturbing small bodies must
be robust.

blood sample, proteins on cell surfaces, biological populations in their
habitat, galaxies in the universe, the sequence of human genes, and the fitness
in evolutionary computing, have been found to follow power law. Taylor's power
law (Taylor 1961: Nature, 189:732-) is well recognized as one of the
fundamental models in population ecology. A fundamental property of biological
populations, which Taylor's power law reveals, is the near universal
heterogeneity of population abundance distribution in habitat. Obviously, the
heterogeneity also exists at the community level, where not only the
distributions of population abundances but also the proportions of the species
composition in the community are often heterogeneous. Nevertheless, existing
community diversity indexes such as Shannon index and Simpson index can only
measure ""local"" or ""static"" diversity in the sense that they are computed for
each habitat at a specific time point, and the indexes alone do not reflect the
diversity changes. In this note, I propose to extend the application scope of
Taylor's power law to the studies of human microbial communities, specifically,
the community heterogeneity at both population and community levels. I further
suggested that population dispersion models such as Taylor (1980: Nature, 286,
53-), which is known to generate population distribution patterns consistent
with the power law, should also be very useful for analyzing the distribution
patterns of human microbes within the human body. Overall, I hope that the
approach to human microbial community with the power law offers an example that
ecological theories can play an important role in the emerging medical ecology,
which aims at studying the ecology of human microbiome and its implications to
human diseases and health, as well as in personalized medicine.

Holstein-Primakoff transformations. This resonant energy exchange mode is not
predicted by linear Bogoliubov theory, and its frequency is sensitive to
interactions among Bogoliubov quasi-particles; it may be referred to as a
second Josephson oscillation, in analogy to the second sound mode of liquid
Helium II. In this paper we will explore this system beyond the
Gross-Pitaevskii mean field regime. We directly compare the classical mean
field dynamics to the exact full quantum many-particle dynamics and show good
agreement over a large range of the system parameters. The second Josephson
frequency becomes imaginary for stronger interactions, however, indicating
dynamical instability of the symmetric state. By means of a generalized quantum
phase model for the full four-mode system, we then show that, in this regime,
high-energy Bogoliubov quasiparticles tend to accumulate in one pair of sites,

cardinal $\kappa$ is characterized by a Scott sentence $\phi_M$, if $\phi_M$
has a model of size $\kappa$, but no model of $\kappa^+$.
  The main question in this paper is the following: Are the characterizable
cardinals closed under the powerset operation? We prove that if
$\aleph_{\beta}$ is characterized by a Scott sentence, then
$2^{\aleph_{\beta+\beta_1}}$ is (homogeneously) characterized by a Scott
sentence, for all $0<\beta_1<\omega_1$. So, the answer to the above question is
positive, except the case $\beta_1=0$ which remains open.
  As a consequence we derive that if $\alpha\le\beta$ and $\aleph_{\beta}$ is
characterized by a Scott sentence, then
$\aleph_{\alpha+\alpha_1}^{\aleph_{\beta+\beta_1}}$ is also characterized by a
Scott sentence, for all $\alpha_1<\omega_1$ and $0<\beta_1<\omega_1$. Whence,
depending on the model of ZFC, we see that the class of characterizable and

spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source across the electromagnetic
spectrum yielding a bolometric luminosity of 1.7*10^43 erg s^-1.
Phenomenologically, the SED of NGC 7213 is similar to that of low-ionization

outbursts. The current size of the shell, its known distance, and the largest
observed nova ejection velocity set a lower limit to the time since Z Cam's
last outburst of 220 years. The brightest part of the Z Cam shell's radius is
currently p ~ 1690 pixels. No expansion of the radius of the brightest part of
the ejecta was detected, with an upper limit of pdot < 1 pixel/3 years. This
suggests that the last Z Cam eruption occurred p/pdot > 5,000 years ago.
However, including the important effect of deceleration as the ejecta sweeps up
interstellar matter in its snowplow phase reduces the lower limit to 1300
years. This is the first strong test of the prediction of nova thermonuclear
runaway theory that the inter-outburst times of classical novae are longer than
1000 yr. The intriguing suggestion that Z Cam was a bright nova, recorded by
Chinese imperial astrologers in October - November 77 BCE, is consistent with
our measurements. If Z Cam was indeed the nova of 77 BCE we predict that its

cause tidal dissipation, and these are still not well understood. We refine the
theory of the equilibrium tide in fluid bodies that are partly or entirely
convective, to predict the dynamical evolution of the systems. In particular,
we examine the validity of modeling the tidal dissipation by the quality factor
Q, as is commonly done. We consider here the simplest case where the considered
star or planet rotates uniformly, all spins are aligned, and the companion is
reduced to a point-mass. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the
shape of the star or planet adiabatically along the line of centers. This
generates the divergence-free velocity field of the adiabatic equilibrium tide
which is decoupled from the dynamical tide. The tidal kinetic energy is
dissipated into heat through turbulent friction, which is modeled here as an
eddy-viscosity acting on the adiabatic tidal flow. This dissipation induces a
second velocity field, the dissipative equilibrium tide, which is in quadrature
with the exciting potential; it is responsible for the imaginary part of the
disturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations,
from which one derives characteristic evolution times. The rate at which the
system evolves depends on the physical properties of tidal dissipation, and
specifically on how the eddy viscosity varies with tidal frequency and on the
thickness of the convective envelope for the fluid equilibrium tide. At low
frequency, this tide retards by a constant time delay, whereas it lags by a
constant angle when the tidal frequency exceeds the convective turnover rate.

the Coriolis force. At present r-modes are thought to be unstable in many
observed rapidly rotating stars. If WIMPs stabilize the r-modes, this would
allow neutron stars to spin rapidly. This likely requires WIMP-nucleon cross
sections near present experimental limits and an appropriate density of WIMPs

social dilemma situations when individuals do not repeatedly meet. The
conditions under which cooperation based on indirect reciprocity occurs have
been examined in great details. Most previous theoretical analysis assumed for
mathematical tractability that an individual possesses a binary reputation
value, i.e., good or bad, which depends on their past actions and other
factors. However, in real situations, reputations of individuals may be
multiple valued. Another puzzling discrepancy between the theory and
experiments is the status of the so-called image scoring, in which cooperation
and defection are judged to be good and bad, respectively, independent of other
factors. Such an assessment rule is found in behavioral experiments, whereas it
is known to be unstable in theory. In the present study, we fill both gaps by
analyzing a trinary reputation model. By an exhaustive search, we identify all
the cooperative and stable equilibria composed of a homogeneous population or a
heterogeneous population containing two types of players. Some results derived
for the trinary reputation model are direct extensions of those for the binary
model. However, we find that the trinary model allows cooperation under image
scoring under some mild conditions.

black-box separation between one-way functions and protocols for certain Secure

Surprisingly, however, {\em since then there has been no further progress in

picture for deterministic 2-party SFE functionalities. We show that one-way

rely on any computational hardness), when secure computation against

adversaries, a black-box one-way function is indeed useful for SFE, but we show

is useful.

electronic voting machines and voting centers classified by types of
transmissions according to the volume of traffic in incoming and outgoing data
of machines from and toward the National Electoral Council (CNE) totalizing
servers. One unexpectedly finds two types of behavior in wire telephony data
transmissions and only one type where cellular telephony is employed,
contravening any reasonable electoral normative. Differentiation in data
transmissions arise when comparing number of incoming and outgoing data bytes
per machine against total number of votes per machine reported officially by
the CNE. The respective distributions of electoral variables for each type of
transmission show that the groups classified by it do not correspond to random
sets of the electoral universe. In particular, the distributions for the NO
percentage of votes per machine differ statistically across groups. The
presidential elections of 1998, 2000 and the 2004 Presidential Recall
Referendum (2004 PRR) are compared according to the type of transmissions in
2004 PRR. Statistically, the difference between the empirical distributions of
the 2004 PRR NO results and the 2000 Chavez votes results by voting centers is
not significant.

hydrodynamic code we show that mixing of high entropy shocked jet's material
with the intra-cluster medium (ICM) is the major heating process perpendicular
to the jets' axis. Heating by the forward shock is not significant. The mixing
is very efficient in heating the ICM in all directions, to distances of ~10kpc
and more. Although the jets are active for a time period of only 20 Myr, the
mixing and heating near the equatorial plane, as well as along the symmetry
axis, continues to counter radiative cooling for times of >10^8 yr after the
jets have ceased to exist. We discuss some possible implications of the
results. (i) The vigorous mixing is expected to entangle magnetic field lines,
hence to suppress any global heat conduction in the ICM near the center. (ii)
The vigorous mixing forms multi-phase ICM in the inner cluster regions, where
the coolest parcels of gas will eventually cool first, flow inward, and feed
the active galactic nucleus to set the next jet-activity episode. This further
supports the cold feedback mechanism. (iii) In cases where the medium outside
the region of r~10kpc is not as dense as in groups and clusters of galaxies,
like during the process of galaxy formation, the forward shock and the high
pressure of the shocked jets' material might expel gas from the system.

of GeV photons relative to the onset of MeV photons in some GRBs. In order to
avoid a large optical depth, the minimal value of the Lorentz factor has been
estimated to be higher than 1000 in some brightest bursts. In this paper, we
present a detailed calculation of the time delay between the MeV and GeV
photons in the framework of the magnetic-dominated jet model. We find that the
time delay strongly depends on the saturated bulk Lorentz factor of the jet.
Inspired by this fact, we use this model to calculate the Lorentz factors of
the four brightest Fermi bursts. The results indicate that the Lorentz factors
are much smaller than that obtained from the ""single-zone"" scenario. The short
GRB 090510 has a minimal Lorentz factor 385, while the three long bursts GRB
080916c, GRB090902b and GRB 090926 have almost the same Lorentz factors, with
an average value near 260. Another interesting result is that, for long bursts,
GeV photons are emitted after the bulk Lorentz factor saturates. For the short
GRB, however, MeV and GeV photons are emitted at the same phase, i.e., either
at the expansion phase or at the coast phase.

notion of stability characterizing non-Markovianity. For stable non-Markovian
systems, the non-adiabatic entropy production satisfies an integral fluctuation
theorem, leading to the second law of thermodynamics for transitions between
non-equilibrium steady-states. This quantity can also be written as a sum of
products of generalized fluxes and forces, thus being suitable for
thermodynamics. On the other hand, the generalized fluctuation-dissipation
relation also holds, clarifying that the conditions for it to be satisfied are
ergodicity and stability instead of Markovianity. We show that in spite of
being counter-intuitive, the stability criterion introduced in this work may be
violated in non-Markovian systems even if they are ergodic, leading to a
violation of the fluctuation theorem and the generalized
fluctuation-dissipation relation. Stability represents then a necessary
condition for the above properties to hold and explains why the generalized
fluctuation-dissipation relation has remained elusive in the study of
non-Markov systems exhibiting non-equilibrium steady-states.

evolution equations in the unknowns \theta (absolute temperature), u

coupled. Moreover, the momentum equation for u contains \chi-dependent elliptic
operators, which degenerate at the pure phases (corresponding to the values
\chi=0 and \chi=1), making the whole system degenerate. That is why, we have to
resort to a suitable weak solvability notion for the analysis of the problem:
it consists of the weak formulations of the heat and momentum equation, and,
for the phase/damage parameter \chi, of a generalization of the principle of
virtual powers, partially mutuated from the theory of rate-independent damage
processes. To prove an existence result for this weak formulation, an
approximating problem is introduced, where the elliptic degeneracy of the
displacement equation is ruled out: in the framework of damage models, this
corresponds to allowing for partial damage only. For such an approximate
system, global-in-time existence and well-posedness results are established in
various cases. Then, the passage to the limit to the degenerate system is
performed via suitable variational techniques.

theory of self-adjoint extensions of the covariant Laplace-Beltrami and Dirac
operators on compact Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundary emphasizing the
relation with the theory of global boundary conditions.
  Self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators, specially of the
Laplace-Beltrami and Dirac operators, are fundamental in Quantum Physics as
they determine either the energy of quantum systems and/or their unitary
evolution. The well-known von Neumann's theory of self-adjoint extensions of
symmetric operators is not always easily applicable to differential operators,
while the description of extensions in terms of boundary conditions constitutes
a more natural approach. Thus an effort is done in offering a description of
self-adjoint extensions in terms of global boundary conditions showing how an
important family of self-adjoint extensions for the Laplace-Beltrami and Dirac
operators are easily describable in this way.
  Moreover boundary conditions play in most cases an significant physical role
and give rise to important physical phenomena like the Casimir effect. The
geometrical and topological structure of the space of global boundary
conditions determining regular self-adjoint extensions for these fundamental
differential operators is described. It is shown that there is a natural
homology class dual of the Maslov class of the space.
  A new feature of the theory that is succinctly presented here is the relation
between topology change on the system and the topology of the space of
self-adjoint extensions of its Hamiltonian. Some examples will be commented and
the one-dimensional case will be thoroughly discussed.

Gravity (QEG) by means of the effective average action and its associated

for non-trivial boundaries, restricting ourselves to action functionals which
are at most of second order in the derivatives acting on the metric. We analyze
two examples of truncated actions with running boundary terms: full fledged QEG
within the single-metric Einstein-Hilbert (EH) truncation, augmented by a scale
dependent Gibbons-Hawking (GH) surface term, and a bi-metric truncation for
gravity coupled to scalar matter fields. The latter contains 17 running
couplings, related to both bulk and boundary terms, whose beta-functions are
computed in the induced gravity approximation. We find that the bulk and the
boundary Newton constant, pertaining to the EH and GH term, respectively, show
opposite RG running; proposing a scale dependent variant of the ADM mass we
argue that the running of both couplings is consistent with gravitational
anti-screening. We describe a simple device for counting the number of field
modes integrated out between the infrared cutoff scale and the ultraviolet.
This method makes it manifest that, in an asymptotically safe theory, there are
effectively no field modes integrated out while the RG trajectory stays in the
scaling regime of the underlying fixed point. As an application, we investigate
how the semiclassical theory of Black Hole Thermodynamics gets modified by
quantum gravity effects and compare the new picture to older work on
`RG-improved black holes' which incorporated the running of the bulk Newton
constant only. We find, for instance, that the black hole's entropy vanishes

most general perturbative changes of field variables. The usual functional
Gamma does not behave as a scalar under the transformation law inherited from
its very definition as the Legendre transform of W = ln Z, although it does
behave as a scalar under an unusual transformation law. The master functional,
on the other hand, is the Legendre transform of an improved functional W with
respect to the sources coupled to both elementary and composite fields. The
inclusion of certain improvement terms in W and Z is necessary to make the new
Legendre transform well defined. The master functional behaves as a scalar
under the transformation law inherited from its very definition. Moreover, it
admits a proper formulation, obtained extending the set of integrated fields to
so-called proper fields, which allows us to work without passing through Z, W
or Gamma. In the proper formulation the classical action coincides with the
classical limit of the master functional, and correlation functions and
renormalization are calculated applying the usual diagrammatic rules to the
proper fields. Finally, the most general change of field variables, including
the map relating bare and renormalized fields, is a linear redefinition of the
proper fields.

library for high performance simulation of high intensity ion beam transport
with space charge. Such particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations require a method to
generate multivariate particle distributions as starting conditions.
  In a preceeding publications it has been shown that the generators of
symplectic transformations in two dimensions are a subset of the real Dirac
matrices (RDMs) and that few symplectic transformations are required to
transform a quadratic Hamiltonian into diagonal form.
  Here we argue that the use of RDMs is well suited for the generation of
multivariate normal distributions with arbitrary covariances. A direct and
simple argument supporting this claim is that this is the ""natural"" way how
such distributions are formed. The transport of charged particle beams may
serve as an example: An uncorrelated gaussian distribution of particles
starting at some initial position of the accelerator is subject to linear
deformations when passing through various beamline elements. These deformations
can be described by symplectic transformations.
  Hence, if it is possible to derive the symplectic transformations that bring
up these covariances, it is also possible to produce arbitrary multivariate
normal distributions without Cholesky decomposition. The method allows the use
of arbitrary uncoupled distributions. The functional form of the coupled
multivariate distributions however depends in the general case on the type of
the used random number generator. Only gaussian generators always yield
gaussian multivariate distributions.

edge-weighted undirected graph and a set of terminal nodes. The goal is to
compute a min-cost tree S which spans all terminals. In this paper we consider
the min-power version of the problem, which is better suited for wireless
applications. Here, the goal is to minimize the total power consumption of
nodes, where the power of a node v is the maximum cost of any edge of S
incident to v. Intuitively, nodes are antennas (part of which are terminals
that we need to connect) and edge costs define the power to connect their
endpoints via bidirectional links (so as to support protocols with ack
messages). Differently from its min-cost counterpart, min-power Steiner tree is
NP-hard even in the spanning tree case, i.e. when all nodes are terminals.
Since the power of any tree is within once and twice its cost, computing a rho
\leq ln(4)+eps [Byrka et al.'10] approximate min-cost Steiner tree provides a
2rho<2.78 approximation for the problem. For min-power spanning tree the same
approach provides a 2 approximation, which was improved to 5/3+eps with a
non-trivial approach in [Althaus et al.'06]. Here we present an improved
approximation algorithm for min-power Steiner tree. Our result is based on two
main ingredients. We prove the first decomposition theorem for min-power
Steiner tree, in the spirit of analogous structural results for min-cost
Steiner tree and min-power spanning tree. Based on this theorem, we define a
proper LP relaxation, that we exploit within the iterative randomized rounding
framework in [Byrka et al.'10]. A careful analysis provides a 3ln
4-9/4+eps<1.91 approximation factor. The same approach gives an improved
1.5+eps approximation for min-power spanning tree as well, matching the
approximation factor in [Nutov and Yaroshevitch'09] for the special case of
min-power spanning tree with edge weights in {0,1}.

pump-only configuration scattering against a point-like defect and evaluate
analytically the drag force exerted by the fluid on the defect. When the system
is excited near the bottom of the lower polariton dispersion, the sign of the
interaction-renormalised pump detuning classifies the collective excitation
spectra in three different categories [C. Ciuti and I. Carusotto, physica
status solidi (b) 242, 2224 (2005)]: linear for zero, diffusive-like for
positive, and gapped for negative detuning. We show that both cases of zero and
positive detuning share a qualitatively similar crossover of the drag force
from the subsonic to the supersonic regime as a function of the fluid velocity,
with a critical velocity given by the speed of sound found for the linear
regime. In contrast, for gapped spectra, we find that the critical velocity
exceeds the speed of sound. In all cases, the residual drag force in the
subcritical regime depends on the polariton lifetime only. Also, well below the
critical velocity, the drag force varies linearly with the polariton lifetime,
in agreement with previous work [E. Cancellieri et al., Phys. Rev. B 82, 224512

population of satellites around massive galaxies in cosmological simulations
versus the observations. We use state-of-the-art, publically available,
Millennium I and II simulations and the associated semi-analytical galaxy
catalogues to explore the time evolution of the fraction of massive galaxies
that have satellites, the number of satellites per galaxy, the projected
distance at which the satellite locate from the host galaxy, and the mass ratio
between the host galaxies and their satellites. The three virtual galaxy
catalogues considered here, overproduce the fraction of galaxies with
satellites by a factor ranging between 1.5 and 6 depending on the epoch,
whereas the mean projected distance and ratio of the satellite mass over host
mass are in closer agreement with data. The larger pull of satellites in the
semi-analytical samples could suggest that the size evolution found in previous
hydrodynamical simulations is an artifact due to the larger number of infalling
satellites compared to the real Universe. These results advise to revise the
physical ingredients implemented in the semi-analytical models in order to
reconcile the observed and computed fraction of galaxies with satellites, and
eventually, it would leave some room to other mechanisms explaining the galaxy
size growth not related to the minor merging.

strongly interacting in the crossover region. By these, the pressure of the

is insensitive to the different choice of the hadronic equation of state with

compounds, where A is an alkali ion, has been rapidly ascribed to a BCS
mechanism, in which the pairing is mediated by on ball optical phonon modes.
While this has lead to consider that electronic correlations were not important
in these compounds, further studies of various AnC60 with n=1, 2, 4 allowed to
evidence that their electronic properties cannot be explained by a simple
progressive band filling of the C60 six-fold degenerate t1u molecular level.
This could only be ascribed to the simultaneous influence of electron
correlations and Jahn-Teller Distortions (JTD) of the C60 ball, which
energetically favour evenly charged C60 molecules. This is underlined by the
recent discovery of two expanded fulleride Cs3C60 isomeric phases which are
Mott insulators at ambient pressure. Both phases undergo a pressure induced
first order Mott transition to SC with a (p, T) phase diagram displaying a dome
shaped SC, a common situation encountered nowadays in correlated electron
systems. NMR experiments allowed us to study the magnetic properties of the
Mott phases and to evidence clear deviations from BCS expectations near the
Mott transition. So, although SC involves an electron-phonon mechanism, the
incidence of electron correlations has an importance on the electronic
properties, as had been anticipated from DMFT calculations.

Studies of cycloidal lineaments and strike-slip fault patterns on Europa
suggest that Europa's obliquity is about 1 deg, although theoretical models of
the obliquity predict the obliquity to be one order of magnitude smaller for an
entirely solid Europa. Here, we investigate the influence of a global liquid
layer on the obliquity of the Galilean satellites. Io most likely has a fully
liquid core, while Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are thought to have an
internal global liquid water ocean beneath an external ice shell. We use a
model for the obliquity based on a Cassini state model extended to the presence
of an internal liquid layer and the internal gravitational and pressure torques
induced by the presence of this layer. We find that the obliquity of Io only
weakly depends on the different internal structure models considered, because
of the weak influence of the liquid core which is therefore almost impossible
to detect through observations of the obliquity. The obliquity of Europa is
almost constant in time and its mean value is smaller (0.033-0.044 deg) with an
ocean than without (0.055 deg). An accuracy of 0.004 deg (about 100 m on the
spin pole location at the surface) would allow detecting the internal ocean.
The obliquity of Ganymede and Callisto depends more on their interior structure
because of the possibility of resonant amplifications for some periodic terms
of the solution. Their ocean may be easily detected if, at the measuring time,
the actual internal structure model lead to a very different value of the
obliquity than in the solid case. A long-term monitoring of their shell

correlation in areal unit data, and are typically specified as a prior
distribution for a set of random effects, as part of a hierarchical Bayesian
model. The spatial correlation structure induced by these models is determined
by geographical adjacency, so that two areas have correlated random effects if
they share a common border. However, this correlation structure is too
simplistic for real data, which are instead likely to include sub-regions of
strong correlation as well as locations at which the response exhibits a
step-change. Therefore this paper proposes an extension to CAR priors, which
can capture such localised spatial correlation. The proposed approach takes the
form of an iterative algorithm, which sequentially updates the spatial
correlation structure in the data as well as estimating the remaining model
parameters. The efficacy of the approach is assessed by simulation, and its
utility is illustrated in a disease mapping context, using data on respiratory

can match the requirements of a collaborative task. Example of such

various participatory sensing tasks in knowledge creation. Due to the nature of
the task, team members are often required to work on a co-operative basis.
Previous studies have indicated that co-operation becomes effective in presence
of social connections. Therefore, effective team selection requires the team
members to be socially close as well as a division of the task among team
members so that no user is overloaded by the assignment. In this work, we
investigate how such teams can be formed on a social network.
  Since our team formation problems are proven to be NP-hard, we design
efficient approximate algorithms for finding near optimum teams with provable
guarantees. As traditional data-sets from on-line social networks (e.g.

collaboration, we have crawled millions of software repositories spanning a
period of four years and hundreds of thousands of developers from GitHub, a
popular open-source social coding network. We perform large scale experiments
on this data-set to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of our algorithms.
Experimental results suggest that our algorithms achieve significant
improvement in finding effective teams, as compared to naive strategies and
scale well with the size of the data. Finally, we provide a validation of our

matter where an insulating bulk hosts a linearly-dispersing surface state,
which can be viewed as a sea of massless Dirac fermions protected by the
time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Breaking the TRS by a magnetic order leads to the
opening of a gap in the surface state and consequently the Dirac fermions
become massive. It has been proposed theoretically that such a mass acquisition
is necessary for realizing novel topological phenomena, but achieving a
sufficiently large mass is an experimental challenge. Here we report an
unexpected discovery that the surface Dirac fermions in a solid-solution system
TlBi(S1-xSex)2 acquires a mass without explicitly breaking the TRS. We found
that this system goes through a quantum phase transition from the topological
to the non-topological phase, and by tracing the evolution of the electronic
states using the angle-resolved photoemission, we observed that the massless
Dirac state in TlBiSe2 switches to a massive state before it disappears in the
non-topological phase. This result suggests the existence of a condensed-matter
version of the ""Higgs mechanism"" where particles acquire a mass through
spontaneous symmetry breaking.

temperature in cold and heavily shielded starless cores by combining chemical
and radiative transfer models. Methods: A determination of the dust temperature
in a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere is used to calculate initial radial molecular
abundance profiles. The abundances of selected cooling molecules corresponding
to two different core ages are then extracted to determine the gas temperature
at two time steps. The calculation is repeated in an iterative process yielding
molecular abundances consistent with the gas temperature. Line emission
profiles for selected substances are calculated using simulated abundance
profiles. Results: The gas temperature is a function of time; the gas heats up
as the core gets older because the cooling molecules are depleted onto grain
surfaces. The contributions of the various cooling molecules to the total
cooling power change with time. Radial chemical abundance profiles are
non-trivial: different species present varying degrees of depletion and in some
cases inward-increasing abundances profiles, even at t > 10^5 years. Line
emission simulations indicate that cores of different ages can present
significantly different line emission profiles, depending on the tracer species
considered. Conclusions: Chemical abundances and the associated line cooling
power change as a function of time. Most chemical species are depleted onto
grain surfaces at densities exceeding ~10^5 cm^-3. Notable exceptions are NH_3
and N2H^+; the latter is largely undepleted even at n_H~10^6 cm-3. On the other
hand, chemical abundances are not significantly developed in regions of low gas
density even at t~10^5 years, revealed by inward-increasing abundance
gradients. The gas temperature can be significantly different from the dust
temperature; this may have implications on core stability.

the sparsification of realistic mfe-structures leads to a constant time and

financial analysts and regulators. Second, the U.S. administration - both

model avoids numerous common approximations (two-mode treatment, time-space
factorization, fixed values of the chemical potential and barrier
penetrability, etc) and thus provides a realistic description of BEC dynamics,
including both weak-coupling (sub-barrier) and strong-coupling (above-barrier)
regimes and their crossover. The strong coupling regime is achieved by
increasing the number $N$ of BEC atoms and thus the chemical potential. The
evolution with $N$ of Josephson oscillations (JO) and Macroscopic Quantum
Self-Trapping (MQST) is examined and the crucial impact of the BEC interaction
is demonstrated. At weak coupling, the calculations well reproduce the JO/MQST
experimental data. At strong coupling, with a significant overlap of the left
and right BECs, we observe a remarkable persistence of the Josephson-like
dynamics: the JO and MQST converge to a high-frequency JO-like mode where both
population imbalance and phase difference oscillate around the zero averages.
The results open new avenues for BEC interferometry.

uses a 3000 square centimeter effective area mirror (at 6 keV) to achieve
unprecedented sensitivities for hard X-ray imaging spectrometry (5-70 keV) and
for broadband X-ray polarimetry (2-70 keV). BEST can make substantial
contributions to our understanding of the inner workings of accreting black
holes, our knowledge about the fabric of extremely curved spacetime, and the
evolution of supermassive black holes. BEST will allow for time resolved
studies of accretion disks. With a more than seven times larger mirror area and
a seven times wider bandpass than GEMS, BEST will take X-ray polarimetry to a
new level: it will probe the time variability of the X-ray polarization from
stellar mass and supermassive black holes, and it will measure the polarization
properties in 30 independent energy bins. These capabilities will allow BEST to
conduct tests of accretion disk models and the underlying spacetimes. With
three times larger mirror area and ten times better angular resolution than
NuSTAR, BEST will be able to make deep field observations with a more than 15
times better sensitivity than NuSTAR. The mission will be able to trace the
evolution of obscured and unobscured black holes in the redshift range from
zero to six, covering the most important epoch of supermassive black hole
growth. The hard X-ray sensitivity of BEST will enable a deep census of
non-thermal particle populations. BEST will give us insights into AGN feedback
by measuring the particle luminosity injected by AGNs into the interstellar
medium (ISM) of their hosts, and will map the emission from particles
accelerated at large scale structure shocks. Finally, BEST has the potential to
constrain the equation of state of neutron stars (NS).

CERN-CERES/NA45 experiment in mid-central Pb+Au collisions (10% of
\sigma(geo)). The pT range extends from about 0.1 GeV/c (0.55 GeV/c for
\Lambda) to more than 2 GeV/c. Protons below 0.4 GeV/c are directly identified
by dE/dx. At higher pT, proton elliptic flow v2(pT) is derived as a
constituent, besides \pi+ and K+, of the elliptic flow of positive pion
candidates. The retrieval requires additional inputs: (i) of the particle
composition, and (ii) of v2(pT) of positive pions. For (i), particle ratios
obtained by NA49 were adapted to CERES conditions; for (ii), the measured
v2(pT) of negative pions is substituted, assuming \pi+ and \pi- elliptic flow
magnitudes to be sufficiently close. The v2(pT) spectra are compared to
ideal-hydrodynamics calculations. In synopsis of the series \pi- - K0short - p
- \Lambda, flow magnitudes are seen to fall with decreasing pT progressively
even below hydro calculations with early kinetic freeze-out (Tf= 160 MeV)
leaving not much time for hadronic evolution. The proton v2(pT) data show a
downward swing towards low pT with excursions into negative v2 values. The
pion-flow isospin asymmetry observed recently by STAR at RHIC, invalidating in
principle our working assumption, is found in its impact on proton flow
bracketed from above by the direct proton flow data, and not to alter any of
our conclusions. Results are discussed in perspective of recent viscous

Since the finite volume in lattice QCD makes it difficult to compute the vacuum
polarization at a large number of low momenta with high statistics (combined
with the fact that one cannot compute it at zero momentum), a parametrization
of the vacuum polarization is required to extrapolate the data. A much used
functional form is based on vector meson dominance, which introduces model
dependence into the lattice computation of the magnetic moment. Here we
introduce a model-independent extrapolation method, and present a few first
tests of this new method.

two-mode cat states. The entanglement is then distributed using homodyne
detection. To improve the protocol, we replace the time-consuming non-local

the need for classical communication during growth. Entanglement is generated
in subsequent connection processes. Furthermore the growth procedure is

to belong to an increasingly important class of pulsars that are ablating their

Using the radio ephemeris we detect pulsations in the unclassified gamma-ray

pulsar's spin-down luminosity into gamma-rays and adding PSR J1816+4510 to the
large number of millisecond pulsars detected by Fermi. The likely optical/UV

colors. Assuming that it is the companion, with R=18.27+/-0.03 mag and
effective temperature >15,000 K it would be among the brightest and hottest of
low-mass pulsar companions, and appears qualitatively different from other
eclipsing pulsar systems. In particular, current data suggest that it is a
factor of two larger than most white dwarfs of its mass, but a factor of four
smaller than its Roche lobe. We discuss possible reasons for its high
temperature and odd size, and suggest that it recently underwent a violent

precedence, freedom and novelty play central roles. This is based on a
modification of the postulates for quantum theory given by Masanes and Muller.
We argue that quantum mechanics is uniquely characterized as the probabilistic
theory in which individual systems have maximal freedom in their responses to
experiment, given reasonable axioms for the behavior of probabilities in a
physical theory. Thus, to the extent that quantum systems are free, in the
sense of Conway and Kochen, there is a sense in which they are maximally free.
  We also propose that laws of quantum evolution arise from a principle of
precedence, according to which the outcome of a measurement on a quantum system
is selected randomly from the ensemble of outcomes of previous instances of the
same measurement on the same quantum system. This implies that dynamical laws
for quantum systems can evolve as the universe evolves, because new precedents
are generated by the formation of new entangled states.

Solar Dynamics Observatory, we statistically investigate the ephemeral regions
(ERs) in the quiet Sun. We find that there are two types of ERs: normal ERs
(NERs) and self-cancelled ERs (SERs). Each NER emerges and grows with
separation of its opposite polarity patches which will cancel or coalesce with
other surrounding magnetic flux. Each SER also emerges and grows and its
dipolar patches separate at first, but a part of magnetic flux of the SER will
move together and cancel gradually, which is described with the term
""self-cancellation"" by us. We identify 2988 ERs among which there are 190 SERs,
about 6.4% of the ERs. The mean value of self-cancellation fraction of SERs is
62.5%, and the total self-cancelled flux of SERs is 9.8% of the total ER flux.
Our results also reveal that the higher the ER magnetic flux is, (i) the easier
the performance of ER self-cancellation is, (ii) the smaller the
self-cancellation fraction is, and (iii) the more the self-cancelled flux is.
We think that the self-cancellation of SERs is caused by the submergence of
magnetic loops connecting the dipolar patches, without magnetic energy release.

is proposed on the base of the new (PRL, 2004; JETP, 2004) quantum theory of
Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation (VCR), where Abraham's form for the true photon
momentum in the medium is used (only which allows the introduction in the
energy-momentum balance equations of the effective real photon mass in the
medium). This gives the possibility to consider the ejection of VCR quantum
directly by medium, as complies with known assumptions of the microscopic
mechanism of VCR (I.E. Tamm, 1939 and etc.). On the base of the Abraham theory,
it is stated the new value of threshold velocity Vth=c/n*(n) of the charged
particle, when only for V>Vth the emission by medium of the VCR or its
analogues is take place for n>1 and also for n<1 (c is light velocity in
vacuum, n is the refraction index of isotropic medium in equilibrium state). It
allows explaining of the observed ""subthreshold"" VCR effects and its analogues.
It is show that for n<1, value n*>1 in the expression for Vth, that allows VCR
mechanism realization when emitting transversal electromagnetic waves in plasma
and also while emitting by a nuclear medium interacting with sufficiently fast
K+ and K0 mesons. Propose the possibility for using of the new VCR theory in
relation with super radiation in Bose-Einstein condensates and with the Compton
effect in medium for n<1 and n>1. Near the same consideration on the base of
the new VCR quantum theory is proposed for the modification of the Landau
superfluid threshold velocity theory.

generally the possible descriptions have been given in the frequency domain.
The aim of this paper, limited to materials with rigid skeleton considered as
equivalent fluids, is to compare the descriptions by Johnson-Allard ($JA$%) as
well as by Pride-Lafarge ($PL$) with i) some analytical, approximate formulas,
based upon asymptotic high frequency expansion ; ii) the exact formula by
Zwikker and Kosten for the case of cylindrical pores. The paper starts with a
short summary of the statement of the different general full frequency models
($JA$ and $PL).$ The Green function in the time domain is shown to exhibit
interesting properties of materials. In particular the maximum response depends
on one dimensionless parameter only, which is denoted $\xi $ and is the ratio
of the travelled distance to the product of the \textquotedblleft
frozen\textquotedblright\ sound speed and a characteristic viscous relaxation
time. The distance $\xi $ is related to a time domain Stokes number. The
numerical computation of the Green function is done by FFT, with some
precautions, because of the importance of the higher frequencies on the
response shape. The $PL$ description is shown to be the best full frequency
general model, but some discrepancies with the exact model appear at short
times or short distances. When the distance $\xi $ increases from zero, the
asymptotic expansion shows that the maximum of the Green function decreases
first as $1/\xi ^{2}$, then exponentially.

composite top quark, cancelation of the scalar leading quadratic divergences,
and a particular ground state such that top anti-top channel is neither
attractive or repulsive at tree level at the Z pole mass. The radiatively
generated scalar mass in 2D is m_H=\sqrt((6m_t^2 -M_Z^2-2M_w^2)/3(1+{\pi}/k))=
113 GeV/c^2,143 GeV/c^2,...,230 GeV/c^2 for k = 1,2,...\infty. As first
proposed by Nambu in the simplest models with dynamical mass generation and
fermion condensate in 4D, one expects the Higgs mass on the order of twice the
heaviest fermion mass. Hence, if this is applied to the CPM one could expect
scalar mass dynamically generated by top constituent quarks and composite top
quarks to be equal to 2 m_t/3 and 2m_t respectively. When Bose-Einstein
statistics for kT \cong M_W c^2 is applied to the two lowest energy states in
2D (113 GeV and 143 GeV) and 4D (115 GeV and 346 GeV), the CPM suggests
physical Higgs mass equal to m_H \cong 125 GeV/c^2 in both 2D and 4D.
