asymmetries. The model is an extension of the popular Stahl Model, which is
widely used in the literature. The extension introduces sellers with
heterogeneous stores number, reflecting the typical market structure. The
market consists of several sellers heterogeneous in size consumers, some of
which face a cost when sequentially searching. The paper shows that no
symmetric model exist in the extension and asymmetric NE of the Stahl model are
found for comparison. Additional results suggest that smallest sellers will be
the ones offering lowest prices, in line with several real world examples
provided in the paper. However, profits remain in most cases fixed per store,
making a larger firm more profitable, yet with lower sold quantity. The
findings suggest that on some level price dispersion will still exist, together
with some level of price stickiness, both observed in reality.

thresholds of 10 EeV, 40 EeV, and 57 EeV. We find that the distributions of the
events in right ascension and declination are compatible with an isotropic
distribution in all three sets. We then compare with previously reported
clustering of the UHECR events at small angular scales. No significant
clustering is found in the TA data. We then check the events with E>57 EeV for
correlations with nearby active galactic nuclei. No significant correlation is
found. Finally, we examine all three sets for correlations with the large-scale

compatible with both an isotropic distribution and the hypothesis that UHECR
sources follow the matter distribution of the Universe (the LSS hypothesis),
while the event set with E>10 EeV is compatible with isotropy and is not
compatible with the LSS hypothesis at 95% CL unless large deflection angles are
also assumed. We show that accounting for UHECR deflections in a realistic
model of the Galactic magnetic field can make this set compatible with the LSS
hypothesis.

power of the universal processor to perform effective procedures. The notion of
computation finds it meaning, for the computist, through his
\underline{interaction} with the universal processor.
  We are interested in those computation environments which can be considered
as alternative for the real computation environment that the human being is its
computist. These computation environments must have two properties: 1- being
physically plausible, and 2- being enough powerful.
  Based on Copeland' criteria for effective procedures, we define what a
\emph{physically plausible} computation environment is.
  We construct two \emph{physically plausible} and \emph{enough powerful}
computation environments: 1- the Turing computation environment, denoted by
$E_T$, and 2- a persistently evolutionary computation environment, denoted by
$E_e$, which persistently evolve in the course of executing the computations.
  We prove that the equality of complexity classes $\mathrm{P}$ and
$\mathrm{NP}$ in the computation environment $E_e$ conflicts with the
\underline{free will} of the computist.
  We provide an axiomatic system $\mathcal{T}$ for Turing computability and
prove that ignoring just one of the axiom of $\mathcal{T}$, it would not be
possible to derive $\mathrm{P=NP}$ from the rest of axioms.
  We prove that the computist who lives inside the environment $E_T$, can never
be confident that whether he lives in a static environment or a persistently
evolutionary one.

ergodicity by a simple but useful criterion in [16]. To establish the strong
Feller property, we need to truncate the nonlinearity and apply a gradient
estimate established in [26] (or see [24]} for a general version for the finite
dimension systems). Because the solution has discontinuous trajectories and the
nonlinearity is not Lipschitz, we can not solve a control problem to get
irreducibility. Alternatively, we use a replacement, i.e., the fact that the

centered on a secular period change with a periodic variation superposed,
presumed to be due to light time effects in a binary system. According to this
paradigm, one would expect what seems like a period increase of about 0.5 s
during or soon after the year 2001. I have continued photometric monitoring
through the year 2012, adding 35 new timings of maximum and minimum light. This
expected change in period did not occur, which rules out that interpretation of
the period variation. As of 2012, the observed timings are about two hours
early compared to those predicted by the quadratic ephemeris, but are very
close to those predicted by the linear ephemeris. In fact, the period has
remained constant for the last 32 years, indicating that the previous epochs of
constant period are almost certainly the correct interpretation, though the
cause of the period changes is still not clear. Continued photometric
monitoring of BW Vul leads to the conclusion that the period changes are
abrupt, followed by epochs of constant period lasting between 12 and at least
32 years.

general non-radial trapping potential, under the unit mass constraint, in the
Thomas-Fermi limit where a small parameter tends to 0. This ground state plays
an important role in the mathematical treatment of recent experiments on the
phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation, and in the study of various types of
solutions of nonhomogeneous defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Many of
these applications require delicate estimates for the behavior of the ground
state near the boundary of the condensate, as the singular parameter tends to
zero, in the vicinity of which the ground state has irregular behavior in the
form of a steep corner layer. In particular, the role of this layer is
important in order to detect the presence of vortices in the small density
region of the condensate, understand the superfluid flow around an obstacle,
and also has a leading order contribution in the energy. In contrast to
previous approaches, we utilize a perturbation argument to go beyond the
classical Thomas-Fermi approximation and accurately approximate the layer by
the Hastings-McLeod solution of the Painleve-II equation. This settles an open
problem, answered very recently only for the special case of the model harmonic
potential. In fact, we even improve upon previous results that relied heavily
on the radial symmetry of the potential trap. Moreover, we show that the ground
state has the maximal regularity available, namely it remains uniformly bounded
in the 1/2-Holder norm, which is the exact Holder regularity of the singular
limit profile, as the singular parameter tends to zero. Our study is highly
motivated by an interesting open problem posed recently by Aftalion, Jerrard,
and Royo-Letelier, and an open question of Gallo and Pelinovsky, concerning the
removal of the radial symmetry assumption from the potential trap.

may have predictions for a minimal measurable length, and a maximal observable

The generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is based on a momentum-dependent
modification in the standard dispersion relation which is conjectured to
violate the principle of Lorentz invariance. From the resulting Hamiltonian,
the velocity and time of flight of relativistic distant particles at Planck
energy can be derived. A first comparison is made with recent observations for
Hubble parameter in redshift-dependence in early-type galaxies. We find that
LIV has two types of contributions to the time of flight delay $\Delta t$
comparable with that observations. Although the wrong OPERA measurement on
faster-than-light muon neutrino anomaly, $\Delta t$, and the relative change in
the speed of muon neutrino $\Delta v$ in dependence on redshift $z$ turn to be
wrong, we utilize its main features to estimate $\Delta v$. Accordingly, the
results could not be interpreted as LIV. A third comparison is made with the
ultra high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR). It is found that an essential ingredient
of the approach combining string theory, loop quantum gravity, black hole
physics and doubly spacial relativity and the one assuming a perturbative
departure from exact Lorentz invariance. Fixing the sensitivity factor and its
energy dependence are essential inputs for a reliable confronting of our
calculations to UHECR. The sensitivity factor is related to the special time of
flight delay and the time structure of the signal. Furthermore, the upper and
lower bounds to the parameter, $\alpha$ that characterizes the generalized
uncertainly principle, have to be fixed in related physical systems such as the
gamma rays bursts.

different types of dwarf novae. Their light-curves combine the characteristic
features of SU UMa, ER UMa, Z Cam, and WZ Sge-type systems but also show a
variety of properties never observed in dwarf novae. The compactness of AM CVn
orbits and their unusual chemical composition make these systems valuable
testbeds for outburst models. We aim for a better understanding of the role of
helium in the accretion disc instability mechanism, testing the model for dwarf
novae outbursts in the case of AM CVn stars, and aim to explain the outburst
light-curves of these ultra-compact binaries. We calculated the properties of
the hydrogen-free AM CVn stars using our previously developed numerical code
adapted to the different chemical composition of these systems and supplemented
with formulae accounting for mass transfer rate variations, additional sources
of the disc heating, and the primary's magnetic field. We discovered how
helium-dominated discs react to the thermal-viscous instability and were able
to reproduce various features of the outburst cycles in the light-curves of AM
CVn stars. The AM CVn outbursts can be explained by the suitably adapted
dwarf-nova disc instability model but, as in the case of its application to
hydrogen-dominated cataclysmic variables, one has to resort to additional
mechanisms to account for the observed superoutbursts, dips, cycling states,
and standstills. We show that the enhanced mass-transfer rate, due presumably
to variable irradiation of the secondary, must not only be taken into account
but is a determining factor that shapes AM CVn star outbursts. The cause of the
variable secondary's irradiation has yet to be understood; the best candidate
is the precession of a tilted/warped disc.

isostatic, jamming transition is not affected by random pinning: the jamming
density is only slightly reduced, a generalized isostaticity condition holds,
the system is marginally rigid over the entire glass phase, and the typical
structural signatures of jamming are unchanged. Besides, random pinning does
not have effect on the vibrational modes of the amorphous system, at least on
the time and length scale that we are able to probe. For packings that are
hyperstatic at jamming, the microscopic properties of the system are strongly
affected by the random pinning: the frozen degrees of freedom introduce an
excess of constraints that drives the system far from the mechanical
marginality conditions and stabilize the low frequency modes of the system,
shifting them to higher frequencies. The distance from the isostatic point

represent the space of waveforms for non-precessing binary black hole

two spin magnitudes). Compared to the non-spinning case, we find that only a
{\it marginal} increase in the (already relatively small) number of reduced
basis elements is required to represent any non-precessing waveform to nearly
numerical round-off precision. Most parameters selected by the algorithm are
near the boundary of the parameter space, leaving the bulk of its volume
sparse. Our results suggest that the full eight dimensional space (two masses,
two spin magnitudes, four spin orientation angles on the unit sphere) may be
highly compressible and represented with very high accuracy by a remarkably
small number of waveforms, thus providing some hope that the number of
numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole coalescences needed to
represent the entire space of configurations is not intractable. Finally, we
find that the {\it distribution} of selected parameters is robust to different
choices of seed values starting the algorithm, a property which should be
useful for indicating parameters for numerical relativity simulations of binary
black holes. In particular, we find that the mass ratios $m_1/m_2$ of
non-spinning binaries selected by the algorithm are mostly in the interval

function. Although progress has been recently made in the identification of
various concurring factors influencing nucleosome positioning, it is still
unclear whether nucleosome positions are sequence dictated or determined by a
random process. It has been postulated for a long time that,in the proximity of
TSS, a barrier determines the position of the +1 nucleosome and then geometric
constraints alter the random positioning process determining nucleosomal
phasing. Such a pattern fades out as one moves away from the barrier to become
again a random positioning process. Although this statistical model is widely
accepted,the molecular nature of the barrier is still unknown. Moreover,we are
far from the identification of a set of sequence rules able:to account for the
genome-wide nucleosome organization;to explain the nature of the barriers on
which the statistical mechanism hinges;to allow for a smooth transition from
sequence-dictated to statistical positioning and back. We show that sequence
complexity,quantified via various methods, can be the rule able to at least
partially account for all the above.In particular, we have conducted our
analyses on 4 high resolution nucleosomal maps of the model eukaryotes and
found that nucleosome depleted regions can be well distinguished from
nucleosome enriched regions by sequence complexity measures.In particular, (a)
the depleted regions are less complex than the enriched ones, (b) around TSS
complexity measures alone are in striking agreement with in vivo nucleosome
occupancy,in particular precisely indicating the positions of the +1 and -1
nucleosomes. Those findings indicate that the intrinsic richness of
subsequences within sequences plays a role in nucleosomal formation in genomes,
and that sequence complexity constitutes the molecular nature of nucleosome
barrier.

exact asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric black holes when a self
interacting, minimally coupled scalar field is the source of the energy
momentum of the Einstein equations in four dimensions. The scalar field
potential is the recently found to be compatible with the hairy generalization
of the Plebanski-Demianski solution of general relativity. This paper describes
the spherically symmetric solutions that smoothly connect the Schwarzschild
black hole with its hairy counterpart. The geometry and scalar field are
everywhere regular except at the usual Schwarzschild like singularity inside
the black hole. The scalar field energy momentum tensor satisfies the null
energy condition in the static region of the spacetime. The first law holds
when the parameters of the scalar field potential are fixed under
thermodynamical variation. Secondly, it is shown that an extra, dimensionless
parameter, present in the hairy solution, allows to modify the gravitational
field of a spherically symmetric black hole in a remarkable way. When the
dimensionless parameter is increased, the scalar field generates a flat
gravitational potential, that however asymptotically matches the Schwarzschild
gravitational field. Finally, it is shown that a positive cosmological constant
can render the scalar field potential convex if the parameters are within a
specific rank.

accretion disc, using global two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The
temperature of an optically thick accretion disc is determined by the energy
balance between the viscous heating and the radiative cooling. The radiative
cooling rate depends on the opacity of the disc. The opacity is expressed as a
function of the temperature. We find the disc is divided into three regions
that have different temperature distributions. The slope of the entropy
distribution becomes steep in the inner region of the disc with the high
temperature and the outer region of the disc with the low temperature, while it
becomes shallow in the middle region with the intermediate temperature. Planets
in the inner and outer regions move outward owing to the large positive
corotation torque exerted on the planet by an adiabatic disc, on the other
hand, a planet in the middle region moves inward toward the central star.
Planets are expected to accumulate at the boundary between the inner and middle
regions of the adiabatic disc. The positive corotation torque decreases with an
increase in the viscosity of the disc. We find that the positive corotation
torque acting on the planet in the inner region becomes too small to cancel the
negative Lindblad torque when we include the large viscosity, which destroys
the enhancement of the density in the horseshoe orbit of the planet. This leads
to the inward migration of the planet in the inner region of the disc. A planet
with 5 Earth masses in the inner region can move outward in a disc with the
surface density of 100 g/cm^2 at 1 AU when the accretion rate of a disc is
smaller than 2x10^{-8} solar mass/yr.

  Energy Harvesting Sensor","32 pages",,,,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a remote estimation problem with an energy harvesting sensor and
a remote estimator. The sensor observes the state of a discrete-time source
which may be a finite state Markov chain or a multi-dimensional linear Gaussian
system. It harvests energy from its environment (say, for example, through a
solar cell) and uses this energy for the purpose of communicating with the
estimator. Due to the randomness of energy available for communication, the
sensor may not be able to communicate all the time. The sensor may also want to
save its energy for future communications. The estimator relies on messages
communicated by the sensor to produce real-time estimates of the source state.
We consider the problem of finding a communication scheduling strategy for the
sensor and an estimation strategy for the estimator that jointly minimize an
expected sum of communication and distortion costs over a finite time horizon.
Our goal of joint optimization leads to a decentralized decision-making
problem. By viewing the problem from the estimator's perspective, we obtain a
dynamic programming characterization for the decentralized decision-making
problem that involves optimization over functions. Under some symmetry
assumptions on the source statistics and the distortion metric, we show that an
optimal communication strategy is described by easily computable thresholds and
that the optimal estimate is a simple function of the most recently received
sensor observation.

between the system and the reservoir, and by expanding the time-convolutionless
(TCL) generator to the forth order with respect to the coupling strength, the
time-local non-Markovian master equation for the reduced state of the system is
derived. Under the secular approximation, the exact analytic solution is

the backflow of information for the system dynamics are presented. In the more
general case, we investigate numerically the properties of the two measures for
the case of Lorentzian reservoir. Our results show the importance of the

their rationality as non-Markovian measures. Finally, the complete positivity

captured by XMM-Newton in the field of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The flare
event was recorded continuously in X-ray for its first 10 hours from the
precursor to the late decay phases. The observed fluxes increased by more than
two orders of magnitude at its peak in X-ray and at least one in the UV as
compared to quiescence. The peak 0.1-7.0 keV X-ray flux is derived from the
two-temperature APEC model to be ~(8.4 +/- 0.6) x 10^-12 erg cm-2 s-1.
Combining astrometric information from multiple X-ray observations in the
quiescent and flare states, we identify the NIR counterpart of LMC 335 as the
2MASS source J05414534-6921512. The NIR color relations and spectroscopic
parallax characterize the source as a Galactic K7-M4 dwarf at a foreground
distance of (100 - 264) pc, implying a total energy output of the entire event
of ~(0.4 - 2.9) x 10^35 erg. This report comprises detailed analyses of this
late-K / early-M dwarf flare event that has the longest time coverage yet
reported in the literature. The flare decay can be modeled with two exponential
components with timescales of ~28 min and ~4 hours, with a single component
decay firmly ruled out. The X-ray spectra during flare can be described by two
components, a dominant high temperature component of ~40-60MK and a low
temperature component of ~10MK, with a flare loop length of about 1.1-1.3
stellar radius.

main observable signature of planetary formation. However, since dust dynamics
is size-dependent (because of gas-drag or radiation pressure) any attempt to
understand the full dynamical evolution of circumstellar dusty-disks that
neglect the coupling of collisional evolution with dynamical evolution is
thwarted because of the feedback between these two processes. Here, a new
hybrid lagrangian/eulerian code is presented that overcomes some of these
difficulties. The particles representing ""dust-clouds"" are tracked individually
in a lagrangian way. This system is then mapped on an eulerian spatial grid,
inside the cells of which the local collisional evolutions are computed.
Finally, the system is remapped back in a collection of discrete lagrangian
particles keeping constant their number. An application example on dust growth
in a turbulent protoplanetary disk at 1 AU is presented. First the growth of
dust is considered in the absence of a dead-zone and the vertical distribution
of dust is self-consistently computed. It is found that the mass is rapidly
dominated by particles about a fraction of millimeter in size. Then the same
case with an embedded dead-zone is investigated and It is found that
coagulation is much more efficient and produces, in a short time scale,
1cm-10cm dust pebbles that dominate the mass. These pebbles may then be
accumulated into embryos sized objects inside large-scale turbulent structures
as shown recently (see e.g. Johansen et al., 2007).

the mutators but an arbitrarily small conversion rate results in the fixation
of mutators in a finite population. We calculate analytical expressions for the
mutator fraction at mutation-selection balance and fixation time for mutators
in a finite population when mutational effects are weaker (regime I) and
stronger (regime II) than the selective effects. Our main result is that in
regime I, the mutator fraction and the fixation time are independent of
epistasis but in regime II, mutators are rarer and take longer to fix when the
decrease in fitness with the number of deleterious mutations occurs at an
accelerating rate (synergistic epistasis) than at a diminishing rate

deterministic dynamics developed by D'Alembert, Langrange, Hamilton, Jacobi,
and many other luminaries of applied mathematics. Diffusion as a stochastic
process of an overdamped individual particle immersed in a fluid, initiated by
Einstein, Smoluchowski, Langevin and Wiener, has no momentum since its path is
nowhere differentiable. In this exposition, we illustrate how analytical
mechanics arises in stochastic dynamics from a randomly perturbed ordinary
differential equation $dX_t=b(X_t)dt+\epsilon dW_t$ where $W_t$ is a Brownian
motion. In the limit of vanishingly small $\epsilon$, the solution to the
stochastic differential equation other than $\dot{x}=b(x)$ are all rare events.
However, conditioned on an occurence of such an event, the most probable
trajectory of the stochastic motion is the solution to Lagrangian mechanics
with $\mathcal{L}=\|\dot{q}-b(q)\|^2/4$ and Hamiltonian equations with
$H(p,q)=\|p\|^2+b(q)\cdot p$. Hamiltonian conservation law implies that the
most probable trajectory for a ""rare"" event has a uniform ""excess kinetic
energy"" along its path. Rare events can also be characterized by the principle
of large deviations which expresses the probability density function for $X_t$
as $f(x,t)=e^{-u(x,t)/\epsilon}$, where $u(x,t)$ is called a large-deviation
rate function which satisfies the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. An
irreversible diffusion process with $\nabla\times b\neq 0$ corresponds to a
Newtonian system with a Lorentz force $\ddot{q}=(\nabla\times b)\times
\dot{q}+1/2\nabla\|b\|^2$. The connection between stochastic motion and
analytical mechanics can be explored in terms of various techniques of applied
mathematics, for example, singular perturbations, viscosity solutions, and
integrable systems.

substitution are taken account as the changes of the $dp$ hybridizations
between the Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals. Using the numerical minimization of the
energy obtained in the GA, we obtain the renormalization factor (RF) of the
kinetic energy and total RF, which estimates the inverse of the mass
enhancement, for three cases with the effective models of x=2 and 0.5 and a
special model. We find that the inverse of the total RF becomes the largest for
the case of x=0.5, and that the van Hove singularity, which is located on
(below) the Fermi level for the special model (the effective model of x=0.5),
plays a secondary role in enhancing the effective mass. Our calculation
suggests that the heavy fermion behavior around x=0.5 comes from the
cooperative effects between moderately strong Coulomb interaction compared to
the total bandwidth and the modification of the electronic structures due to
the rotation of RuO_{6} octahedra (i.e., the variation of the $dp\pi$
hybridizations and the downward shift for the $d_{xy}$ orbital). We propose
that moderately strong electron correlation and the orbital-dependent
modifications of the electronic structures due to the lattice distortions play
important roles in the electronic states for Ca_{2-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{4}.

nonstandard cube-root asymptotics prevail when $\gamma>1/3$ and $\gamma=1/3$

the boundary is different from either of the previous cases and converges
weakly to those obtained with $\gamma\in(0,1/3)$ and $\gamma\in(1/3,\infty)$ as

coupling can be excluded with more than 2-\sigma significance; the limits on
the coupling are \beta>3 for the growing neutrino mass and \beta<-1.5 for the
decreasing mass case. This is a clear sign for a preference of higher

on the coupling becomes |\beta|<3 at 2-$\sigma$ level for the exponential

lensing from an Euclid-like experiment and we also consider the combination

saddle point configuration around each vertex insertion point and can be
applied to cases where the precise forms of the vertex operators are not known.
As an important application, we compute the contributions of the vertex
operators to the three-point functions of the large spin limit of the
Gubser-Klebanov-Polyakov (GKP) strings in $AdS_3$ spacetime, left unevaluated
in our previous work [arXiv:1110.3949] which initiated such a study. Combining
with the finite part of the action already computed previously and with the
newly evaluated divergent part of the action, we obtain finite three-point
functions with the expected dependence of the target space boundary coordinates
on the dilatation charge and the spin.

simulations, we study possible signatures of gravitational waves (GWs) in the
context of the collapsar model for long-duration gamma-ray bursts. In our SR
simulations, the central black hole is treated as an absorbing boundary. By
doing so, we focus on the GWs generated by asphericities in neutrino emission
and matter motions in the vicinity of the hyperaccreting disks. We compute nine
models by adding initial angular momenta and magnetic fields parametrically to
a precollapse core of a $35 M_{\odot}$ progenitor star. As for the
microphysics, a realistic equation of state is employed and the neutrino
cooling is taken into account via a multiflavor neutrino leakage scheme. To
accurately estimate GWs produced by anisotropic neutrino emission, we perform a
ray-tracing analysis in general relativity by a post-processing procedure. By
employing a stress formula that includes contributions both from magnetic
fields and special relativistic corrections, we study also the effects of
magnetic fields on the gravitational waveforms. We find that the GW amplitudes
from anisotropic neutrino emission show a monotonic increase with time, whose
amplitudes are much larger than those from matter motions of the accreting
material. We show that the increasing trend of the neutrino GWs stems from the
excess of neutrino emission in the direction near parallel to the spin axis
illuminated from the hyperaccreting disks. We point out that a recently
proposed future space-based interferometer like Fabry-Perot type DECIGO would
permit the detection of these GW signals within $\approx$ 100 Mpc.

symmetries that exist in these webs. Certain eigenvectors of the Jacobian
describing dynamical modes of the system, such as specific instabilities or
responses to perturbations, localize on these symmetric motifs. On the one hand
this means that by removing a symmetry from the network one obtains a system
which has identical dynamics except for the removal of the localized mode. This
explains the previously observed equivalence. On the other hand it means that
we can identify dynamical modes that only depend on the symmetric motif.
Symmetric structures thus provide an example for mesoscale network motifs

studied. In the dressed-state picture, wave packets of ballistic two-level
atoms propagate simultaneously in two optical potentials. The probability to
make a transition from one potential to another one is maximal when centroids
of wave packets cross the field nodes and is given by a simple formula with the
single exponent, the Landau--Zener parameter $\kappa$. If $\kappa \gg 1$, the
motion is essentially adiabatic. If $\kappa \ll 1$, it is (almost) resonant and
periodic. If $\kappa \simeq 1$, atom makes nonadiabatic transitions with a
splitting of its wave packet at each node and strong complexification of the
wave function as compared to the two other cases. This effect is referred as
nonadiabatic quantum chaos. Proliferation of wave packets at $\kappa \simeq 1$
is shown to be connected closely with chaotic center-of-mass motion in the
semiclassical theory of point-like atoms with positive values of the maximal
Lyapunov exponent. The quantum-classical correspondence established is
justified by the fact that the Landau--Zener parameter $\kappa$ specifies the
regime of the semiclassical dynamical chaos in the map simulating chaotic
center-of-mass motion. Manifestations of nonadiabatic quantum chaos are found
in the behavior of the momentum and position probabilities.

a population network with $N$-armed spiral patterns, having a roughly constant

assumed, could its parameters be determined uniquely, or do different parameter
choices give indistinguishable experimental signatures? This inverse problem
was studied before for a supersymmetric Standard Model with 15 free parameters.
This earlier study found 283 indistinguishable pairs of parameter choices,
called degenerate pairs, even if backgrounds are ignored. We can resolve all
but 23 of those pairs by constructing a true \chi^2 distribution using mostly
counting observables. The elimination of systematic errors would even allow
separating the residual degeneracies. Taking the Standard Model background into
account we still can resolve 237 of the 283 ""degenerate"" pairs. This indicates
that (some of) our observables should also be useful for the purpose of
determining the values of SUSY parameters.

Motivated by an analogy with convex sets, intersection patterns of good covers
were studied intensively. Our main result is that intersection patterns of good
covers are algorithmically unrecognizable.
  More precisely, the intersection pattern of a good cover can be stored in a
simplicial complex called nerve which records which subfamilies of the good

these basic solutions behave like free particles, obeying $p=\hbar k$, $E=\hbar

change under the effect of uniform acceleration, thus providing the first steps
towards the application of the aforementioned nonlinear equation to the study
of physical scenarios beyond free particle dynamics. We investigate first the
behaviour of the power-law solutions under Galilean transformation and discuss
the ensuing Doppler-like effects. We consider then constant acceleration,
obtaining new solutions that can be equivalently regarded as describing a free
particle viewed from an uniformly accelerated reference frame (with
acceleration $a$) or a particle moving under a constant force $-ma$. The latter

two-level atom and a standing-wave single-mode laser field. Classical treatment
of the translational atomic motion provides the semiclassical
Hamilton-Schrodinger equations which are a 5D nonlinear dynamical system with
two integrals of motion. The atomic dynamics can be regular or chaotic in
dependence on values of the control parameters, the atom-field detuning and
recoil frequency. We develop a semiclassical theory of the chaotic atomic
transport in terms of a random walk of the atomic electric dipole moment $u$.
Based on a jump-like behavior of this variable for atoms crossing nodes of the
standing wave, we construct a stochastic map that specifies the center-of-mass
motion. We find the relations between the detuning, recoil frequency and the
atomic energy, under which atoms may move in a optical lattice in a chaotic
way. We obtain the analytical conditions under which deterministic atomic
transport has fractal properties and explain a hierarchical structure of the
dynamical fractals. Quantum treatment of the atomic motion in a standing wave
is studied in the dressed state picture where the atom moves in two optical
potentials simultaneously. If the values of the detuning and a characteristic
atomic frequency are of the same order, than there is a probability of
nonadiabatic transitions of the atom upon crossing nodes of the standing wave.
At the same condition exactly, we observe sudden jumps in the atomic dipole
moment $u$ when the atom crosses the nodes. Those jumps are accompanied by
splitting of atomic wave packets at the nodes. Such a proliferation of wave
packets at the nodes of a standing wave is a manifestation of classical atomic
chaotic transport. At large values of the detuning, the quantum evolution is
shown to be adiabatic in accordance with a regular character of the classical
atomic motion.

when the system is placed in an environment out of thermal equilibrium. To this
aim we provide a detailed investigation of the dynamics of an atomic system
placed close to a body of arbitrary geometry and dielectric permittivity, whose
temperature $T_M$ is different from that of the surrounding walls $T_W$. A
suitable master equation for the general case of an $N$-level atom is first
derived and then specialized to the cases of a two- and three-level atom.
Transition rates and steady states are explicitly expressed as a function of
the scattering matrices of the body and become both qualitatively and
quantitatively different from the case of radiation at thermal equilibrium. Out
of equilibrium, the system steady state depends on the system-body distance, on
the geometry of the body and on the interplay of all such parameters with the
body optical resonances. While a two-level atom tends toward a thermal state,
this is not the case already in the presence of three atomic levels. This
peculiar behavior can be exploited, for example, to invert the populations
ordering and to provide an efficient cooling mechanism for the internal state
of the quantum system. We finally provide numerical studies and asymptotic
expressions when the body is a slab of finite thickness. Our predictions can be
relevant for a wide class of experimental configurations out of thermal
equilibrium involving different physical realizations of two or three-level
systems.

the central region of the proto-planetary nebula CRL 2688. This object is
thought to have recently moved off the AGB, and display abundance patterns of
CNO and heavy elements that can provide us with important clues to understand
the nucleosynthesis, dredge-up and mixing experienced by the envelope of the
central star during its AGB stage of evolution. The analysis of the molecular
features, presumably originated from the circumstellar matter provides further
constraints on the chemistry and velocity of the expanding shell, expelled as a
consequence of the strong mass loss experienced by the central star. We confirm
that the central star shows a spectrum typical of an F-type supergiant with
Teff=7250 K, log g=0.5 and [Fe/H]=-0.3 dex. We find that the abundance pattern
of this object is characterized by enhancements of Carbon ([C/Fe]=0.6),
Nitrogen ([N/Fe]=1.0) and Na ([Na/Fe]=0.7), similar to other previously known
carbon-rich post-AGB stars. Yttrium is also enhanced while the [Ba/Y] ratio is
very low (-1.0), indicating that only the light s-process elements are
enhanced. The Zinc abundance is found to be normal, [Zn/Fe]=0.0, suggesting
that there is no depletion of refractory elements. The Halpha, Na I and K I
resonance lines show prominent emission components, whose helio-centric radial
velocities are offsetted by -41 km/s relative to the photospheric
metal-absorption lines. The molecular features of C_2 and CN also show emission
components, whose velocities are consistent with the emission components of the
Halpha, Na I, and K I lines. On the other hand, their absorption components are
more highly blue shifted than the corresponding emission components, which
suggests that the regions where the emission and absorption components arise
are expanding at different velocities.

have considered the third order Lovelock-Born-Infeld black holes in AdS
space-time. We have analytically derived the thermodynamic quantities of the
system. Our analysis revealed the onset of a higher order phase transition in
the black hole leading to an infinite discontinuity in the specific heat at
constant charge at the critical points. Our entire analysis is based on the
canonical framework where we have fixed the charge of the black hole. In an
attempt to study the behavior of the thermodynamic quantities near the critical
points we have derived the critical exponents of the system explicitly.
Although the values of the critical points have been determined numerically,
the critical exponents are calculated analytically. Our results fit well with
the thermodynamic scaling laws. The scaling hypothesis is also seen to be
consistent with these scaling laws. We find that all types of AdS black holes,
studied so far, indeed belong to the same universality class. Moreover these
results are consistent with the mean field theory approximation. We have
derived the suggestive values of the other two critical exponents associated

heavy elements is the dominant dust source. We adopt a chemical evolution model
applicable to nearby galaxies but utilize parameters adequate to high-$z$
quasars. It is assumed that metals and dust are predominantly ejected by Type
II supernovae (SNe). We have found that grain growth strongly depends on the
grain size distribution. If we simply use the size distribution of grains
ejected from SNe, grain growth is inefficient because of the lack of small
grains (i.e.\ small surface-to-volume ratio of the dust grains). However, if we
take small grain production by interstellar shattering into consideration,
grain growth is efficient enough to account for the rich dust abundance in
high-$z$ quasars. Our results not only confirm that grain growth is necessary
to explain the large amount of dust in high-$z$ quasars, but also demonstrate
that grain size distributions have a critical impact on grain growth.

shape and in-plane membrane arrangement of the phases are coupled through
phase-specific bending energies and line tensions. We use simulated annealing
Monte Carlo simulations to find low-energy structures, allowing both phase
arrangement and membrane shape to relax. The three-phase system is the simplest
one in which there are multiple interface pairs, allowing us to analyze
interfacial preferences and pairwise distinct line tensions. We observe the
system's preference for interface pairs that maximize differences in
spontaneous curvature. From a pattern selection perspective, this acts as an
effective attraction between phases of most disparate spontaneous curvature. We
show that this effective attraction is robust enough to persist even when the
interface between these phases is the most penalized by line tension. This
effect is driven by geometry and not by any explicit component-component
interaction.

on a variety X a DG category C such that the bounded derived category of
coherent sheaves on X is equivalent to the bounded derived category of C. In
this paper we show that the category C has finite dimensional spaces of
morphisms. We describe how it behaves under mutations and present an algorithm
allowing to calculate it for full exceptional collections with vanishing Ext^k
groups for k > 1. Finally, we use it to describe an example of a
non-commutative deformation of certain rational surfaces.

community or cells in tissue) with fixed positions, in which damage or disease
is transmitted by diffusing agents (""signals"") emitted by infected individuals.
The signals decay as well as diffuse; since they are assumed to be produced in
large numbers, the signal concentration is treated deterministically. The
model, which includes four cellular states (susceptible, transformed, depleted,
and removed), admits various interpretations: spread of an infection or
infectious disease, or of damage in a tissue in which injured cells may
themselves provoke further damage, and as a description of the so-called
radiation-induced bystander effect, in which the signals are molecules capable
of inducing cell damage and/or death in unirradiated cells. The model exhibits
a continuous phase transition between spreading and nonspreading phases. We
formulate two mean-field theory (MFT) descriptions of the model, one of which
ignores correlations between the cellular state and the signal concentration,
and another that treats such correlations in an approximate manner. Monte Carlo
simulations of the spread of infection on the square lattice yield values for
the critical exponents and the fractal dimension consistent with the dynamic
percolation universality class.

the game TomeNET. The results show that adaptive coding is especially useful
for compressing large amounts of very small packets.
