spectra in K$_{2}$Fe$_{4+x}$Se$_{5}$, and find it to be in excellent agreement
with a recent experiment. The spectrum can be alternatively described rather
well by localized spin Hamiltonian restricted to first and second nearest
neighbor couplings. We confirm that exchange coupling between nearest neighbor
Fe magnetic moments is strongly anisotropic, and show directly that in the
ideal system this anisotropy has itinerant nature which can be imitated by
introducing higher order terms in effective localized spin Hamiltonian
(biquadratic coupling). In the real system, structural relaxation provides an
additional source of the exchange anisotropy of approximately the same
magnitude. The dependence of spin wave spectra on filling of Fe vacancy sites
is also discussed.

that the interaction graph structure alone is not enough to predict the outcome

is to put some records in the development of von Neumann modules straight.
  The von Neumann or $W^*$-objects among the Hilbert ($C^*$-)modules are around
since the first papers by Paschke (1973) and Rieffel (1974) that lift
Kaplansky's setting (1953) to modules over noncommutative $C^*$-algebras. While
the formal definition of $W^*$-modules} is due to Baillet, Denizeau, and Havet
(1988), the one of von Neumann modules as strongly closed operator spaces
started with Skeide (2000). It has been paired with the definition of concrete
von Neumann modules in Skeide (2006). It is well-known that (pre-)Hilbert
modules can be viewed as ternary rings of operators and in their definition of
Hilbert-von Neumann modules, Bikram, Mukherjee, Srinivasan, and Sunder (2012)
take that point of view.
  We illustrate that a (suitably nondegenerate) Hilbert-von Neumann module is
the same thing as a strongly full concrete von Neumann module. We also use this
occasion to put some things in earlier papers right. We show that the tensor
product of (concrete, or not) von Neumann correspondences is, indeed, (a
generalization of) the tensor product of Connes correspondences (claimed in
Skeide (2008)), viewed in a way quite different from Bikram et al.. We also
present some new arguments that are useful even for (pre-)Hilbert modules.

in promoters sequences that enhance or repress gene expression. With respect to
an initial distribution of letters on the DNA alphabet, Behrens and Vingron
consider a random sequence of length $n$ that does not contain a given $k$-mer
or word of size $k$. Under an evolution model of the DNA, they compute the
probability $\mathfrak{p}_n$ that this $k$-mer appears after a unit time of 20
years. They prove that the waiting time for the first apparition of the $k$-mer
is well approximated by $T_n=1/\mathfrak{p}_n$. Their work relies on the
simplifying assumption that the $k$-mer is not self-overlapping. They observe
in particular that the waiting time is mostly driven by the initial
distribution of letters.
  Behrens et al. use an approach by automata that relaxes the assumption
related to words overlaps. Their numerical evaluations confirms the validity of
Behrens and Vingron approach for non self-overlapping words, but provides up to
44% corrections for highly self-overlapping words such as $\mathtt{AAAAA}$. We
devised an approach of the problem by clump analysis and generating functions;
this approach leads to prove a quasi-linear behaviour of $\mathfrak{p}_n$ for a
large range of values of $n$, an important result for DNA evolution. We present
here this clump analysis, first by language decomposition, and next by an
automaton construction; finally, we describe an equivalent approach by
construction of Markov automata.

external magnetic field are expected to occur in some extensions of the
standard model. It is usually assumed that those axionlike particles (ALPs)
could produce a drop in the energy spectra of gamma ray sources and possibly
decrease the opacity of the Universe for TeV gamma rays. We show here that
these assumptions are in fact based on an average behavior that cannot happen
in real observations of single sources. We propose a new method to search for
photon-ALP oscillations, taking advantage of the fact that a single observation
would deviate from the average expectation. Our method is based on the search
for irregularities in the energy spectra of gamma ray sources. We predict
features that are unlikely to be produced by known astrophysical processes and
a new signature of ALPs that is easily falsifiable.

fashion, by joint activity patterns of spiking and silence. A full account of
this mapping from stimulus to neural activity is given by the conditional
probability distribution over neural codewords given the sensory input. To be
able to infer a model for this distribution from large-scale neural recordings,
we introduce a stimulus-dependent maximum entropy (SDME) model---a minimal
extension of the canonical linear-nonlinear model of a single neuron, to a
pairwise-coupled neural population. The model is able to capture the
single-cell response properties as well as the correlations in neural spiking
due to shared stimulus and due to effective neuron-to-neuron connections. Here
we show that in a population of 100 retinal ganglion cells in the salamander
retina responding to temporal white-noise stimuli, dependencies between cells
play an important encoding role. As a result, the SDME model gives a more
accurate account of single cell responses and in particular outperforms
uncoupled models in reproducing the distributions of codewords emitted in
response to a stimulus. We show how the SDME model, in conjunction with static
maximum entropy models of population vocabulary, can be used to estimate
information-theoretic quantities like surprise and information transmission in
a neural population.

(~10^4-5 Msun) formed via the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in massive
haloes (>10^7 Msun) at z>6. Our model is based on the evolution of dark matter
haloes within a cosmological N-body simulation, combined with prescriptions for
the formation of BH along with both Pop III and Pop II stars. We calculate the
spatially-varying intensity of Lyman Werner (LW) radiation from stars and
identify the massive pristine haloes in which it is high enough to shut down
molecular hydrogen cooling. In contrast to previous BH seeding models with a
spatially constant LW background, we find that the intensity of LW radiation
due to local sources, J_local, can be up to 10^6 times the spatially averaged
background in the simulated volume and exceeds the critical value, J_crit, for
the complete suppression of molecular cooling, in some cases by 4 orders of
magnitude. Even after accounting for possible metal pollution in a halo from
previous episodes of star formation, we find a steady rise in the formation
rate of direct collapse (DC) BHs with decreasing redshift from 10^{-3}/Mpc^3/z
at z=12 to 10^{-2}/Mpc^3/z at z=6. The onset of Pop II star formation at z~16
simultaneously marks the onset of the epoch of DCBH formation, as the increased
level of LW radiation from Pop II stars is able to elevate the local levels of
the LW intensity to J_local > J_crit while Pop III stars fail to do so at any
time. The number density of DCBHs is sensitive to the number of LW photons and
can vary by an order of magnitude at z=6 after accounting for reionisation
feedback. Haloes hosting DCBHs are more clustered than similar massive
counterparts that do not host DCBHs, especially at redshifts z>10. We also show
that planned surveys with JWST should be able to detect the supermassive
stellar precursors of DCBHs.

global security of distributed systems, which are designed consisting of set of
localised security policies that enforce specific issues about the security
expected.
  The systems are formally specified following a syntax, defined in detail in
this report, and their behaviour is clearly established by the Semantics, also
defined in detail in this report. The systems include the formal attachment of
security policies into their locations, whose intended interactions are trapped
by the policies, aiming at taking access control decisions of the system, and
the Semantics also takes care of this.
  Using the Semantics, a Labelled Transition System (LTS) can be induced for
every particular system, and over this LTS some model checking tasks could be
done. We identify how this LTS is indeed obtained, and propose an alternative
way of model checking the not-yet-induced LTS, by using the system design
directly. This may lead to over-approximation thereby producing imprecise,
though safe, results. We restrict ourselves to finite systems, in the sake of
being certain about the decidability of the proposed method.
  To illustrate the usefulness and validity of our proposal, we present 2 small
case-study-like examples, where we show how the system can be specified, which
policies could be added to it, and how to decide if the desired global security
property is met.
  Finally, an Appendix is given for digging deeply into how a tool for
automatically performing this task is being built, including some
implementation issues. The tool takes advantage of the proposed method, and
given some system and some desired global security property, it safely (i.e.
without false positives) ensures satisfaction of it.

ideal for targeted SETI, including follow-up observations. The techniques

holes (SMBHs) with masses over a billion solar masses were in place less than 1
Gyr after the Big Bang. If these SMBHs assembled from ""seed"" BHs left behind by
the first stars, then they must have accreted gas at close to the Eddington
limit during a large fraction (>50%) of the time. A generic problem with this
scenario, however, is that the mass density in million-solar-mass SMBHs at z=6
already exceeds the locally observed SMBH mass density by several orders of
magnitude; in order to avoid this overproduction, BH seed formation and growth
must become significantly less efficient in less massive protogalaxies, while
proceeding uninterrupted in the most massive galaxies that formed first. Using
Monte-Carlo realizations of the merger and growth history of BHs, we show that
X-rays from the earliest accreting BHs can provide such a feedback mechanism.

change, in which the first miniquasars---among them the ancestors of the z>6

subsequent generations of BHs. We present two specific models with global

an important problem because of its role in the launching of jets and winds and
in determining the intensity of turbulence. In this paper, we develop a
formalism to calculate the transport magnetic flux in a thin accretion disc,
thus determining its evolution on a viscous/resistive timescale. The governing
equations are derived by performing an asymptotic expansion in the limit of a
thin disc, in the regime where the magnetic field is dominated by its vertical
component. Turbulent viscosity and resistivity are included, with an arbitrary
vertical profile that can be adjusted to mimic the vertical structure of the
turbulence. At a given radius and time, the rates of transport of mass and
magnetic flux are determined by a one-dimensional problem in the vertical
direction, in which the radial gradients of various quantities appear as source
terms. We solve this problem to obtain the transport rates and the vertical
structure of the disc. The present paper is then restricted to the idealised
case of uniform diffusion coefficients, while a companion paper will study more
realistic vertical profiles of these coefficients. We show the advection of
weak magnetic fields to be significantly faster than the advection of mass,
contrary to what a crude vertical averaging might suggest. This results from
the larger radial velocities away from the mid-plane, which barely affect the
mass accretion owing to the low density in these regions but do affect the
advection of magnetic flux. Possible consequences of this larger accretion
velocity include a potentially interesting time-dependence with the magnetic
flux distribution evolving faster than the mass distribution. If the disc is
not too thin, this fast advection may also partially solve the long-standing
problem of too efficient diffusion of an inclined magnetic field.

single-dish detected SMGs consist of multiple sources, 2) statistical
identifications of multi-wavelength counterparts to the single-dish SMGs yield
that only ~50% of these single-dish SMGs have real radio or IR counterparts, 3)

to an rms of 7-12uJy at 1.4GHz. Using the exact interferometric positions to
identify proper multi-wavelength counterparts allows us to determine accurate
photometric redshifts for these sources. The redshift distributions of the
combined and the individual 1.1mm and 870um selected samples have a higher mean
and broader width than the redshift distributions derived in previous studies.
Our sample supports the previous tentative trend that on average brighter
and/or mm-selected SMGs are located at higher redshifts. There is a tentative
offset between the mean redshift for the 1.1mm (<z>=3.1+/-0.4) and 870um
(<z>=2.6+/-0.4) selected samples, with the 1.1mm sources lying on average at
higher redshifts. Based on our nearly complete sample of AzTEC 1.1mm SMGs

old stellar populations is one of the few direct probes of the stellar initial
mass function (IMF) outside of the Milky Way. Owing to the advent of fully
depleted CCDs with little or no fringing it has recently become possible to
obtain accurate measurements of these features. Here we present spectra
covering the wavelength ranges 0.35 - 0.55 micron and 0.72 - 1.03 micron for
the bulge of M31 and 34 early-type galaxies from the SAURON sample, obtained
with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on Keck. The signal-to-noise ratio
is >200 per Angstrom out to 1 micron, which is sufficient to measure
gravity-sensitive features for individual galaxies and to determine how they
depend on other properties of the galaxies. Combining the new data with
previously obtained spectra for globular clusters in M31 and the most massive
elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster we find that the dwarf-sensitive Na I
doublet and the FeH Wing-Ford band increase systematically with velocity
dispersion, while the giant-sensitive Ca II triplet decreases with dispersion.
These trends are consistent with a varying IMF, such that galaxies with deeper
potential wells have more dwarf-enriched mass functions. In a companion paper
(Conroy & van Dokkum 2012) we use a comprehensive stellar population synthesis
model to demonstrate that IMF effects can be separated from age and abundance
variations and quantify the IMF variation among early-type galaxies.

their dark matter halos, using LCDM haloes similar in mass to that of the Milky
Way taken from the Aquarius Project. We introduce the stellar disks by first
allowing the haloes to respond to the influence of a growing rigid disk
potential from z = 1.3 to z = 1.0. The rigid potential is then replaced with
star particles which evolve self-consistently with the dark matter particles
until z = 0.0. Regardless of the initial orientation of the disk, the inner
parts of the haloes contract and change from prolate to oblate as the disk
grows to its full size. When the disk normal is initially aligned with the
major axis of the halo at z=1.3, the length of the major axis contracts and
becomes the minor axis by z=1.0. Six out of the eight disks in our main set of
simulations form bars, and five of the six bars experience a buckling
instability that results in a sudden jump in the vertical stellar velocity
dispersion and an accompanying drop in the m=2 Fourier amplitude of the disk
surface density. The bars are not destroyed by the buckling but continue to
grow until the present day. Bars are largely absent when the disk mass is
reduced by a factor of two or more; the relative disk-to-halo mass is therefore
a primary factor in bar formation and evolution. A subset of the disks is
warped at the outskirts and contains prominent non-coplanar material with a
ring-like structure. Many disks reorient by large angles between z=1 and z=0,
following a coherent reorientation of their inner haloes. Larger reorientations
produce more strongly warped disks, suggesting a tight link between the two
phenomena. The origins of bars and warps appear independent: some disks with
strong bars show no disturbances at the outskirts, while the disks with the
weakest bars show severe warps.

information regarding the detailed abundance pattern, star formation history,
and stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the underlying stellar population.
Using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect of
variable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high quality
absorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of M31.
These data extend to 1um and they therefore include the IMF-sensitive spectral
features NaI, CaII, and FeH at 0.82um, 0.86um and 0.99um, respectively. The
models fit the data well, with typical rms residuals ~1%. Strong constraints on
the IMF and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (M/L)_stars, are derived
for individual galaxies. We find that the IMF becomes increasingly bottom-heavy
with increasing velocity dispersion and [Mg/Fe]. At the lowest dispersions and
[Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF is consistent with the Milky Way IMF, while at
the highest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF contains more
low-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a Salpeter IMF. Our best-fit
(M/L)_stars values do not exceed dynamically-based M/L values. We also apply
our models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and
find an (M/L)_stars that implies fewer low-mass stars than a Milky Way IMF,
again agreeing with dynamical constraints. We discuss other possible
explanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the IMF is
the simplest and most plausible.

role in shaping galactic discs. An important aspect of the disc secular
evolution driven by these perturbers is the radial migration of stars. It has
been suggested recently that migration can populate a thick-disc component from
inner-disc stars with high vertical energies. Since this has never been
demonstrated in simulations, we study in detail the effect of radial migration
on the disc velocity dispersion and disc thickness, by separating simulated
stars into migrators and non-migrators. We apply this method to three isolated
barred Tree-SPH N-body galaxies with strong radial migration. Contrary to
expectations, we find that as stellar samples migrate, on the average, their
velocity dispersion change (by as much as 50%) in such a way as to
approximately match the non-migrating population at the radius at which they
arrive. We show that, in fact, migrators suppress heating in parts of the disc.
To confirm the validity of our findings, we also apply our technique to three
cosmological re-simulations, which use a completely different simulation scheme
and, remarkably, find very similar results. We believe the inability of
migration to thicken discs is a fundamental property of internal disc
evolution, irrespective of the migration mechanism at work. We explain this
with the approximate conservation of the (average) vertical and radial actions
rather than the energy. This ""action mixing"" can be used to constrain the
migration rate in the Milky Way: estimates of the average vertical action in
observations for different populations of stars should reveal flattening with
radius for older groups of stars.

suggested that magnetohydrodynamic transport of angular momentum and chemical
composition can dominate over the otherwise purely hydrodynamic processes. A
proper consideration of the interaction between rotation and magnetic fields is
therefore essential. Previous studies have focused on a magnetic model where
the magnetic field strength is derived as a function of the stellar structure
and angular momentum distribution. We have adapted our one-dimensional stellar
rotation code, RoSE, to model the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field
strengths with a pair of time-dependent advection-diffusion equations coupled
to the equations for the evolution of the angular momentum distribution and
stellar structure. This produces a much more complete, though still reasonably
simple, model for the magnetic field evolution. Our model reproduces well
observed surface nitrogen enrichment of massive stars in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. In particular it reproduces a population of slowly-rotating
nitrogen-enriched stars that cannot be explained by rotational mixing alone
alongside the traditional rotationlly-enriched stars. The model further
predicts a strong mass-dependency for the dynamo-driven field. Above a
threshold mass, the strength of the magnetic dynamo decreases abruptly and so
we predict that more massive stars are much less likely to support a
dynamo-driven field than less massive stars.

solved by Goldilocks cosmology, in which TeV neutralinos decay to GeV

across the non-magnetic NS as it moves through the magnetosphere sets up a
circuit connecting the two stars. The exact features of this circuit depend on
the uncertain resistance in the space between the stars R_space. Nevertheless,
I show that there are interesting observational and/or dynamical effects
irrespective of its exact value. When R_space is large, electric dissipation as
great as ~10^{46} erg/s (for magnetar-strength fields) occurs in the
magnetosphere, which would exhibit itself as a hard X-ray precursor in the
seconds leading up to merger. With less certainty, there may also be an
associated radio transient, but this would be observed well past merger (~hrs)
because of interstellar dispersion. When R_space is small, electric dissipation
largely occurs in the surface layers of the magnetic NS. This can reach
~10^{49} erg/s during the final ~1 sec before merger, similar to the energetics
and timescales of short gamma-ray bursts. In addition, for dipole fields
greater than ~10^{12} G and a small R_space, magnetic torques spin up the
magnetized NS. This drains angular momentum from the binary and accelerates the
inspiral. A faster coalescence results in less orbits occurring before merger,
which would impact matched-filtering gravitational-wave searches by
ground-based laser interferometers and could create difficulties for studying

analysis of the condensate fraction and/or the superfluid stiffness. We then
discuss how these phase diagrams can be measured in experiments with trapped

method based on the measurement of the zero-momentum occupation, which is
adequate for experiments dealing with both homogeneous and trapped systems, and

constrained models, the formation of glass becomes a true (singular) phase

8799 are much redder than most field brown dwarfs of the same effective
temperature. Previous theoretical studies of these objects have concluded that
the atmospheres of planets b, c, and d are unusually cloudy or have unusual
cloud properties. Some studies have also found that the inferred radii of some
or all of the planets disagree with expectations of standard giant planet
evolution models. Here we compare the available data to the predictions of our
own set of atmospheric and evolution models that have been extensively tested
against observations of field L and T dwarfs, including the reddest L dwarfs.
Unlike some previous studies we require mutually consistent choices for
effective temperature, gravity, cloud properties, and planetary radius. This
procedure thus yields plausible values for the masses, effective temperatures,
and cloud properties of all three planets. We find that the cloud properties of
the HR 8799 planets are not unusual but rather follow previously recognized
trends, including a gravity dependence on the temperature of the L to T
spectral transition--some reasons for which we discuss. We find the inferred
mass of planet b is highly sensitive to whether or not we include the H and K
band spectrum in our analysis. Solutions for planets c and d are consistent
with the generally accepted constraints on the age of the primary star and
orbital dynamics. We also confirm that, like in L and T dwarfs and solar system
giant planets, non-equilibrium chemistry driven by atmospheric mixing is also
important for these objects. Given the preponderance of data suggesting that
the L to T spectral type transition is gravity dependent, we present an
exploratory evolution calculation that accounts for this effect. Finally we
recompute the the bolometric luminosity of all three planets.

Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on HST. We find a systematic trend of increasing
redshift with more rapid rotation (decreasing rotation period) that is similar
to the increase in line red shift between quiet and plage regions on the Sun.
The fastest-rotating solar-mass star in our study, HII314, shows significantly
enhanced redshifts at all temperatures above log T = 4.6, including the corona,
which is very different from the redshift pattern observed in the more
slowly-rotating stars. This difference in the redshift pattern suggests that a
qualitative change in the magnetic-heating process occurs near Prot = 2 days.
We propose that HII314 is an example of a solar-mass star with a magnetic
heating rate too large for the physical processes responsible for the redshift
pattern to operate in the same way as for the more slowly rotating stars.
HII314 may therefore lie above the high activity end of the set of solar-like

of air holes running down the length of a silica fiber surrounding a central
core of solid silica or, in some cases air. MOFs can exhibit a number of unique
properties, including zero dispersion at visible wavelengths and low or high
effective nonlinearity [3]-[17], By varying the size of the holes and their
number and position, one can also design MOFs with carefully controlled
dispersive and modal properties. In this paper, we analyze and modeling the
behavior of the photonic crystal fiber (PCF) by using in the first step a
propagator method based on the BPM method. With our BPM software, the electric
field contour of the fundamental mode of PCF was demonstrated. We also used it
to see the variation of the effective index; an effective index model confirms
that such a fiber can be single mode for any wavelength. It would make a study
of photonic crystal fibers, and a study of the numerical simulation methods
allow the simulation of optical properties and has modeled the propagation of
light in this fiber type. After that we use the V-parameter because it offers a
simple way to design a photonic crystal fiber (PCF), by basing in a recent
formulation of this parameter of a PCF, we provide numerically based empirical
expression for this quantity only dependent on the two structural parameters,
the air hole diameter and the hole-to-hole center spacing.

enough (5x10^5 g/cc) that the convectively burning region runs away on a
timescale comparable to the sound travel time across the shell; raising the
possibility for an explosive outcome. The nature of the explosion (i.e.
deflagration or detonation) remains ambiguous. In the case of detonation, this
causes a laterally propagating front whose properties in these geometrically
thin and low density shells we begin to study here. Our calculations show that
the radial expansion time of <0.1 s leads to incomplete helium burning, in
agreement with recent work by Sim and collaborators, but that the nuclear
energy released is still adequate to realize a self-sustaining detonation
propagating laterally at slower than the Chapman-Jouguet speed. Our simulations
resolve the subsonic region behind the front and are consistent with a direct
computation of the reaction structure from the shock strength. The ashes are
typically He rich, and consist of predominantly Ti-44, Cr-48, along with a

excellent agreement with the observed ARPES measurement. The Fermi surface (FS)
nesting, which is predicted in the conventional density functional theory
method, is suppressed due to the orbital-dependent correlation effect with the
DMFT method. We have shown that such marginal breakdown of the FS nesting is an
essential condition to the spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity, while
the good FS nesting in NaFeAs induces a spin density wave ground state. Our
results indicate that fully charge self-consistent description of the

parameters: 1) the magnetic flux imbalance between opposite polarities, 2) the
total photospheric free magnetic energy, 3) the length of the magnetic neutral

magnetic shear. Furthermore, we selected another eight large and inactive
active regions (ARs), which are called fallow ARs (FARs), to compare them with
the SARs. We found that most of the SARs have a net magnetic flux higher than
7.0\times10^21 Mx, a total photospheric free magnetic energy higher than
1.0\times10^24 erg/cm, a magnetic neutral line with a steep horizontal magnetic
gradient (\geq 300 G/Mm) longer than 30 Mm, and an area with strong magnetic
shear (shear angle \geq 80\degree) greater than 100 Mm^2. In contrast, the
values of these parameters for the FARs are mostly very low. The Pearson
\c{hi}2 test was used to examine the significance of the difference between the
SARs and FARs, and the results indicate that these two types of ARs can be
fairly distinguished by each of these parameters. The significance levels are
99.55%, 99.98%, 99.98%, and 99.96%, respectively. However, no single parameter
can distinguish them perfectly. Therefore we propose a composite index based on

high-energy astrophysics: (1) the vertical thermal structure of an optically
thick accretion disk heated by the dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), and (2)
determining the fraction of the accretion power released in the corona above
the disk. For simplicity, we consider a gas-pressure-dominated disk and assume
a constant opacity. We argue that the local turbulent dissipation rate due to
the disruption of MRI channel flows by secondary parasitic instabilities should
be uniform across most of the disk, almost up to the disk photosphere. We then
obtain a self-consistent analytical solution for the vertical thermal structure
of the disk, governed by the balance between the heating by MRI turbulence and
the cooling by radiative diffusion. Next, we argue that the coronal power
fraction is determined by the competition between the Parker instability,
viewed as a parasitic instability feeding off of MRI channel flows, and other
parasitic instabilities. We show that the Parker instability inevitably becomes
important near the disk surface, leading to a certain lower limit on the
coronal power. While most of the analysis in this paper focuses on the case of
a disk threaded by an externally imposed vertical magnetic field, we also
discuss the zero-net-flux case, in which the magnetic field is produced by the
MRI dynamo itself, and show that most of our arguments and conclusions should
be valid in this case as well.

Coupled with improved geometrical characterization, this presents an
opportunity to measure solid diffusion more accurately than the traditional

the particle geometry and size distribution. We revisit bounded diffusion
impedance models and incorporate them into an overall impedance model for

experimental data of a silicon nanowire electrode to show the effects of
including the actual nanowire geometry and radius distribution in interpreting
the impedance data. From these results, we show that it is essential to account

terms. By listing some representative methods, we can roughly divide them into
two categories, i.e. (1) directly making the dictionary discriminative and (2)
forcing the sparse coefficients discriminative to push the discrimination power

Adjusting measures of the transformations are mainly studied to keep the

about the algorithm based on random search theory. In the meanwhile, to
strengthen the search ability in high dimensional space, communication strategy
is introduced into the basic algorithm and intermittent exchange is presented

discrete-state Markov process, $\mathcal{Q}$, can be decomposed into a
symmetric and a skew-symmetric parts. As recently shown for the case of
diffusion processes, while the symmetric part corresponding to a gradient
system stands for a reversible Markov process, the skew-symmetric part,
$\frac{d}{dt}u(t)=\mcA u$, is mathematically equivalent to a linear Hamiltonian
dynamics with Hamiltonian $H=1/2u^T\big(\mcA^T\mcA)^{1/2}u$. It can also be
transformed into a Schr\""{o}dinger-like equation $\frac{d}{dt}u=i\mathcal{H}u$
where the ""Hamiltonian"" operator $\mathcal{H}=-i\mcA$ is Hermitian. In fact,
these two representations of a skew-symmetric dynamics emerge natually through
singular-value and eigen-value decompositions, respectively. The stationary
probability of the Markov process can be expressed as $\|u^s_i\|^2$. The motion
can be viewed as ""harmonic"" since $\frac{d}{dt}\|u(t)-\vec{c}\|^2=0$ where
$\vec{c}=(c,c,...,c)$ with $c$ being a constant. More interestingly, we
discover that $\textrm{Tr}(\mcA^T\mcA)=\sum_{j,\ell=1}^n
\frac{(q_{j\ell}\pi_\ell-q_{\ell j}\pi_j)^2}{\pi_j\pi_{\ell}}$, whose
right-hand-side is intimately related to the entropy production rate of the
Markov process in a nonequilibrium steady state with stationary distribution
$\{\pi_j\}$. The physical implication of this intriguing connection between
conservative Hamiltonian dynamics and dissipative entropy production remains to
be further explored.

observational equivalence. Moreover, our setting has the advantage of being the
first construction dealing with additives where proofs of MALL are interpreted
by finite objects. The fact that we obtain a denotational model of MALL relies
on a single geometric property, which we call the trefoil property, from which
we obtain, for each value of the parameter, adjunctions. We then proceed to
show how this setting is related to Girard's various constructions: particular
choices of the parameter respectively give a combinatorial version of his
latest GoI, a refined version of older Geometries of Interaction based on
nilpotency. This shows the importance of the trefoil property underlying our

circumstellar disk were detected in all the lines. The disk parameters were
estimated from model calculation in which the radial distribution of
temperature or surface density inside the disk has a power-law form. The
surface density should be sufficiently high so that the disk is optically thick
for all the CO lines, as discussed in previous studies based on interferometric
observations. The temperature and outer radius of the disk were also confirmed
to be consistent with the previous results. Taking advantage of difference in
position of the photosphere among the CO lines, we revealed temperature
distribution in vertical direction. The temperature of 12CO (J=3-2) emitting
region is about twice higher than that of any other CO emitting region; the
former is about 59 K while the latter is about 31 K at 100 AU from the central
star, suggesting that there are at least two distinct temperature regions. The
best fit temperature for 13CO (J=1-0) that should trace the deepest region of
the disk is even lower, implying that there is also a different temperature
region in deep inside of the disk. Such vertical temperature distribution in a
disk was identified both in T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars (e.g., DM Tau, AB Aur,

10.3+-0.7 keV (rest frame) in the 2000 Chandra observation, while two similar
features, at 8.9+-0.4 and at 12.5+-0.7 keV, are visible when the 8 contiguous
Chandra observations of 2007 are stacked together. In the XMM observation of
2002, strongly affected by background flares, there is a hint for a similar
feature at 8.0+-0.3 keV. We interpreted these features as absorption lines from
a high velocity, highly ionized (i.e. Fe XXV, FeXXVI) outflowing gas. In this
scenario, the outflow velocities inferred are in the range v=0.12-0.59c. To
reproduce the observed features, the gas must have high column density
(Nh>3x10^23 cm^-2), high ionization parameter (log(xi)>3.3 erg cm s^-1) and a
large range of velocities (Delta V~10^4 km s^-1). This Absorption Line QSO is
the fourth high-z quasar displaying X-ray signatures of variable, high velocity
outflows, and among these, is the only one non-lensed. A rough estimate of the
minimum kinetic energy carried by the wind of up to 18% L(bol), based on a
biconical geometry of the wind, implies that the amount of energy injected in
the outflow environment is large enough to produce effective mechanical
feedback.

may explain the observed cosmological baryon asymmetry as well as signal
physics beyond the Standard Model. In the decay of polarized neutrons, the
triple correlation D<J_{n}>\cdot(p_{e}\timesp_{\nu}) is a parity-even,
time-reversal- odd observable that is uniquely sensitive to the relative phase
of the axial-vector amplitude with respect to the vector amplitude. The triple
correlation is also sensitive to possible contributions from scalar and tensor
amplitudes. Final-state effects also contribute to D at the level of 1e-5 and
can be calculated with a precision of 1% or better. Purpose: We have improved
the sensitivity to T-odd, P-even interactions in nuclear beta decay. Methods:
We measured proton-electron coincidences from decays of longitudinally
polarized neutrons with a highly symmetric detector array designed to cancel
the time-reversal-even, parity-odd Standard-Model contributions to polarized
neutron decay. Over 300 million proton-electron coincidence events were used to
extract D and study systematic effects in a blind analysis. Results: We find D
= [-0.94\pm1.89(stat)\pm0.97(sys)]e-4. Conclusions: This is the most sensitive
measurement of D in nuclear beta decay. Our result can be interpreted as a
measurement of the phase of the ratio of the axial-vector and vector coupling
constants (CA/CV= |{\lambda}|exp(i{\phi}_AV)) with {\phi}_AV = 180.012{\deg}
\pm0.028{\deg} (68% confidence level) or to constrain time-reversal violating
scalar and tensor interactions that arise in certain extensions to the Standard
Model such as leptoquarks. This paper presents details of the experiment,
analysis, and systematic- error corrections.

Real-Time X-layer Protocol (RTXP), a real-time communication protocol. To the
best of our knowledge, RTXP is the first MAC and routing real-time
communication protocol that is not centralized, but instead relies only on
local information. The solution is cross-layer (X-layer) because it allows to
control the delays due to MAC and Routing layers interactions. RTXP uses a
suited hop-count-based Virtual Coordinate System which allows deterministic
medium access and forwarder selection. In this paper we describe the protocol
mechanisms. We give theoretical bound on the end-to-end delay and the capacity
of the protocol. Intensive simulation results confirm the theoretical
predictions and allow to compare with a real-time centralized solution. RTXP is
also simulated under harsh radio channel, in this case the radio link
introduces probabilistic behavior. Nevertheless, we show that RTXP it performs
better than a non-deterministic solution. It thus advocates for the usefulness
of designing real-time (deterministic) protocols even for highly unreliable

induce the opposite effect of positively-correlated particle motion, which
close to zero temperature generates entanglement. The non-classical

up a graph and performs a graph cut to separate an object from the background.
Typically graph-based schemes distribute the nodes of the graph uniformly and

particular shape. The strategy of uniform and equidistant nodes does not allow
the cut to prefer more complex structures, especially when areas of the object
are indistinguishable from the background. We propose a solution by introducing
the concept of a ""template shape"" of the target object in which the nodes are
sampled non-uniformly and non-equidistantly on the image. We evaluate it on

evaluating its quadratic scalar radius, \la r^2\ra_s^\sigma. This allows one to
have a quantitative estimate for the size of this resonance. We obtain that the
\sigma resonance is a compact object with $\la
r^2\ra_s^\sigma=(0.19\pm0.02)-i(0.06\pm0.02)$ fm^2. Within our approach,
employing unitary chiral perturbation theory, the \sigma is a dynamically
generated resonance that stems from the pion-pion interactions. Given its small
size we conclude that the two pions inside the resonance are merged. A
four-quark picture is then more appropriate. However, when the pion mass
increases, for pion masses somewhat above 400 MeV, the picture of a two-pion
molecule is the appropriate one. The \sigma is then a spread \pi\pi bound
state. These results are connected with other recent works that support a non
standard nature of the \sigma as well, while fulfilling strong QCD constraints,
as well as with lattice QCD. We offer a detailed study of the low-energy S-wave
\pi\pi scattering data from where we extract our values for the threshold
parameters of S-wave \pi\pi phase shifts, the {\cal O}(p^4) chiral perturbation
theory low energy constants as well as the \sigma pole position. From the
comparison with other accurate determinations in the literature we obtain the
average values for the isospin 0 S-wave \pi\pi threshold parameters,
$a_0^0=0.220\pm0.003$, $b_0^0=0.279\pm 0.003 M_\pi^{-2}$, and for the real and
imaginary parts of the \sigma pole position in \sqrt{s}, $458\pm14-i(261\pm17)$
MeV. The quark mass dependence of the size of the \sigma, its mass and width
are considered too. The latter agree accurately with a previous lattice QCD
calculation. The fact that the mass of this resonance tends to follow the
threshold of two pions is a clear indication that the \sigma is a dynamically
generated meson-meson resonance.

on the attosecond timescale. Our aim is to detail the theoretical description
of ultra-short time-delays, and to relate these to the phase of extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) light pulses and to the asymptotic phase-shifts of
photoelectron wave packets. Special emphasis is laid on time-delay experiments,
where attosecond XUV pulses are used to photoionize target atoms at
well-defined times, followed by a probing process in real time by a
phase-locked, infrared laser field. In this way, the laser field serves as a
""clock"" to monitor the ionization event, but the observable delays do not
correspond directly to the delay associated with single-photon ionization.
Instead, a significant part of the observed delay originates from a measurement
induced process, which obscures the single-photon ionization dynamics. This
artifact is traced back to a phase-shift of the above-threshold ionization
transition matrix element, which we call the continuum-continuum phase. It
arises due to the laser-stimulated transitions between Coulomb continuum
states. As we shall show here, these measurement-induced effects can be
separated from the single-photon ionization process, using analytical
expressions of universal character, so that eventually the attosecond
time-delays in photoionization can be accessed.

particular, a point-like defect in graphene may have effects in the long range.
This peculiarity questions the validity of using a supercell geometry in an
attempt to explore the properties of an isolated defect. Still, this approach
is often used in ab-initio electronic structure calculations, for instance. How
does this approach converge with the size of the supercell is generally not
tackled for the obvious reason of keeping the computational load to an
affordable level. The present paper addresses the problem of substitutional
nitrogen doping of graphene. DFT calculations have been performed for 9x9 and
10x10 supercells. Although these calculations correspond to N concentrations
that differ by about 10%, the local densities of states on and around the
defects are found to depend significantly on the supercell size. Fitting the
DFT results by a tight-binding Hamiltonian makes it possible to explore the
effects of a random distribution of the substitutional N atoms, in the case of
finite concentrations, and to approach the case of an isolated impurity when
the concentration vanishes. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is used to calculate
the STM image of graphene around an isolated N atom. STM images are also
calculated for graphene doped with 0.5 % concentration of nitrogen. The results
are discussed in the light of recent experimental data and the conclusions of
the calculations are extended to other point defects in graphene.

biomolecules subject to mechanical force ($f$), are often quantitatively fit
using worm-like chain (WLC) or freely-jointed chain (FJC) models. These models
predict that the chain extension, $x$, normalized by the contour length
increases linearly at small $f$ and at high forces scale as $x \sim (1 -
f^{-\alpha})$ where $\alpha$= 0.5 for WLC and unity for FJC. In contrast,
experiments on ssDNA show that over a range of $f$ and ionic concentration, $x$
scales as $x\sim\ln f$, which cannot be explained using WLC or FJC models.
Using theory and simulations we show that this unusual behavior in FEC in ssDNA
is due to sequence-independent polyelectrolyte effects. We show that the $x\sim
\ln f$ arises because in the absence of force the tangent correlation function,
quantifying chain persistence, decays algebraically on length scales on the
order of the Debye length. Our theory, which is most appropriate for monovalent

we here interpret GRB 970828 in terms of a double episode emission: the first
episode, observed in the first 40 s of the emission, is interpreted as the
proto-black-hole emission; the second episode, observed after t$_0$+50 s, as a
canonical gamma ray burst. The transition between the two episodes marks the
black hole formation. The characteristics of the real GRB, in the second
episode, are an energy of $E_{tot}^{e^+e^-} = 1.60 \times 10^{53}$ erg, a
baryon load of $B = 7 \times 10^{-3}$ and a bulk Lorentz factor at transparency
of $\Gamma = 142.5$. The clear analogy with GRB 090618 would require also in
GRB 970828 the presence of a possible supernova. We also infer that the GRB
exploded in an environment with a large average particle density $<n> \,
\approx 10^3$ part/cm$^3$ and dense clouds characterized by typical dimensions
of $(4 - 8) \times 10^{14}$ cm and $\delta n/n \propto 10$. Such an environment
is in line with the observed large column density absorption, which might have
darkened both the supernova emission and the GRB optical afterglow.

selection is indispensable. This article explores how an assessment of the
individual importance of variables (effect size estimation) can be used to
perform variable selection. I review recent effect size estimation approaches
in the context of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and propose a new
conceptually simple effect size estimation method which is at the same time
computationally efficient. I then show how to use effect sizes to perform
variable selection based on the misclassification rate which is the data
independent expectation of the prediction error. Simulation studies and real
data analyses illustrate that the proposed effect size estimation and variable
selection methods are competitive. Particularly, they lead to both compact and
interpretable feature sets.

It is
therefore essential to remove these ambiguities before the solutions could be

not yield a unitary ambiguity, especially under ionospheric distortions. We
also present exact ambiguities we get in our solutions, in closed form. Casting
this as an optimization problem, we also present conditions for this approach
to work. The proposed method enables us to use the solutions obtained via
calibration for further modeling of instrumental and propagation effects. We
provide extensive simulation results on the performance of our method.
Moreover, we also give cases where due to degeneracy, this method fails to
perform as expected and in such cases, we suggest exploiting diversity in time,

Hinode to follow the evolution of a sunspot for eight days starting on June 28,
2007. The imaging data were corrected for intensity gradients, projection
effects, and instrumental stray light prior to the analysis. The observations
show the formation of a light bridge at one corner of the sunspot by a slow
intrusion of neighbouring penumbral filaments. This divided the umbra into two
individual umbral cores. During the light bridge formation, there was a steep
increase in its intensity from 0.28 to 0.7 I_QS in nearly 4 hr, followed by a
gradual increase to quiet Sun (QS) values in 13 hr. This increase in intensity
was accompanied by a large reduction in the field strength from 1800 G to 300
G. The smaller umbral core gradually broke away from the parent sunspot nearly
2 days after the formation of the light bridge rendering the parent spot
without a penumbra at the location of fragmentation. The penumbra in the
fragment disappeared first within 34 hr, followed by the fragment whose area
decayed exponentially with a time constant of 22 hr. The depleted penumbra in
the parent sunspot regenerated when the inclination of the magnetic field at
the penumbra-QS boundary became within 40 deg. from being completely horizontal
and this occurred near the end of the fragment's lifetime. After the
disappearance of the fragment, another light bridge formed in the parent which
had similar properties as the fragmenting one, but did not divide the sunspot.
The significant weakening in field strength in the light bridge along with the
presence of granulation is suggestive of strong convection in the sunspot which
might have triggered the expulsion and fragmentation of the smaller spot.
Although the presence of QS photospheric conditions in sunspot umbrae could be
a necessary condition for fragmentation, it is not a sufficient one.

low-mass planet hosts are systematically higher than those of comparison stars
at low metallicities ([Fe/H] < from -0.2 to 0.1 dex depending on the element).
The most evident discrepancy between planet-hosting and stars without planets
is observed for Mg. Our data suggest that the planet incidence is greater among
the thick disk population than among the thin disk for mettallicities bellow
-0.3 dex. After examining the [alpha/Fe] trends of the planet host and non-host
samples we conclude that a certain chemical composition, and not the Galactic
birth place of the stars, is the determinating factor for that. The inspection
of the Galactic orbital parameters and kinematics of the planet-hosting stars
shows that Neptunian hosts tend to belong to the ""thicker"" disk compared to
their high-mass planet-hosting counterparts.We also found that Neptunian hosts
follow the distribution of high-alpha stars in the UW vs V velocities space,
but they are more enhanced in Mg than high-alpha stars without planetary
companions. Our results indicate that some metals other than iron may also have
an important contribution to planet formation if the amount of iron is low.
These results may provide strong constraints for the models of planet
formation, especially for planets with low mass.

populations in the nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies. As each population must
reside in the same gravitational potential, this provides strong constraints on
the nature of the dark matter halo. We derive necessary conditions for two
populations with Plummer or exponential surface brightnesses to reside in a
cusped Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo. We apply our methods to the Sculptor
dwarf spheroidal, and show that there is no NFW halo compatible with the

~ 120 pc for the virial solutions for the two populations to be consistent.
This conclusion remains true, even if the effects of flattening or self-gravity
of the stellar populations are included.

characterize properties of web graphs which are Nash equilibria. In this paper
we consider three different models for PageRank games on undirected graphs such
as certain social networks. In undirected graphs players may delete links at
will, but typically cannot add links without the other player's permission. In
the deletion-model players are free to delete any of their bidirectional links
but may not add links. We study the problem of determining whether the given
graph represents a Nash equilibrium or not in this model. We give an $O(n^{2})$
time algorithm for a tree, and a parametric $O(2^{k}n^{4})$ time algorithm for
general graphs, where $k$ is the maximum vertex degree in any biconnected
component of the graph. In the request- delete-model players are free to delete
any bidirectional links and add any directed links, since these additions can
be done unilaterally and can be viewed as requests for bidirected links. For
this model we give an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm for verifying Nash equilibria in

deletions and the addition of a single bidirectional link if it would increase
the page rank of the other player also. In this model we give a parametric

systems. Nevertheless, simulations can sometimes be time-consuming. In this
case, an approximation of the code input/output relation is made using a
metamodel. Actually, a computer code can often be run at different levels of
complexity and a hierarchy of levels of code can hence be obtained. For
example, it can be a finite element model with a more or less fine mesh. The
aim of our research is to study the use of several levels of a code to predict
the output of a costly computer code. The presented multi-stage metamodel is a
particular case of co-kriging which is a well-known geostatistical method. We
first describe the construction of the co-kriging model and we focus then on a
sequential experimental design strategy. Indeed, one of the strengths of
co-kriging is that it provides through the predictive co-kriging variance an
estimation of the model error at each point of the input space parameter.
Therefore, to improve the surrogate model we can sequentially add points in the
training set at locations where the predictive variances are the largest ones.
Nonetheless, in a multi-fidelity framework, we also have to choose which level
of code we have to run. We present here different strategies to choose this
level. They are based on an original result which gives the contribution of
each code on the co-kriging variance.

Existing methods focus on finding relevant points-of-interest (POIs) based on

a new kind of spatio-textual data, regions-of-interest (ROIs), containing
region-based spatial information and textual description, e.g., mobile user
profiles with active regions and interest tags. To satisfy search requirements
on ROIs, we study a new research problem, called spatio-textual similarity
search: Given a set of ROIs and a query ROI, we find the similar ROIs by
considering spatial overlap and textual similarity. Spatio-textual similarity
search has many important applications, e.g., social marketing in
location-aware social networks. It calls for an efficient search method to

introduce a filter-and-verification framework to compute the answers. In the
filter step, we generate signatures for the ROIs and the query, and utilize the
signatures to generate candidates whose signatures are similar to that of the

final answers. To achieve high performance, we generate effective high-quality
signatures, and devise efficient filtering algorithms as well as pruning

location-based services, it is now feasible to accurately study the propagation
of items such as infectious viruses, sensitive information pieces, and malwares
through a population of moving objects, e.g., individuals, mobile devices, and
vehicles. In such application scenarios, an item passes between two objects
when the objects are sufficiently close (i.e., when they are, so-called, in
contact), and hence once an item is initiated, it can penetrate the object
population through the evolving network of contacts among objects, termed
contact network. In this paper, for the first time we define and study
reachability queries in large (i.e., disk-resident) contact datasets which
record the movement of a (potentially large) set of objects moving in a spatial
environment over an extended time period. A reachability query verifies whether
two objects are ""reachable"" through the evolving contact network represented by
such contact datasets. We propose two contact-dataset indexes that enable
efficient evaluation of such queries despite the potentially humongous size of
the contact datasets. With the first index, termed ReachGrid, at the query time
only a small necessary portion of the contact network which is required for
reachability evaluation is constructed and traversed. With the second approach,
termed ReachGraph, we precompute reachability at different scales and leverage
these precalculations at the query time for efficient query processing. We
optimize the placement of both indexes on disk to enable efficient index
traversal during query processing. We study the pros and cons of our proposed
approaches by performing extensive experiments with both real and synthetic
data. Based on our experimental results, our proposed approaches outperform
existing reachability query processing techniques in contact n...[truncated].

  860-871 (2012)",,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There have been intense research interests in moving object indexing in the
past decade. However, existing work did not exploit the important property of
skewed velocity distributions. In many real world scenarios, objects travel
predominantly along only a few directions. Examples include vehicles on road
networks, flights, people walking on the streets, etc. The search space for a
query is heavily dependent on the velocity distribution of the objects grouped
in the nodes of an index tree. Motivated by this observation, we propose the
velocity partitioning (VP) technique, which exploits the skew in velocity
distribution to speed up query processing using moving object indexes. The VP
technique first identifies the ""dominant velocity axes (DVAs)"" using a
combination of principal components analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering.
Then, a moving object index (e.g., a TPR-tree) is created based on each DVA,
using the DVA as an axis of the underlying coordinate system. An object is
maintained in the index whose DVA is closest to the object's current moving
direction. Thus, all the objects in an index are moving in a near 1-dimensional
space instead of a 2-dimensional space. As a result, the expansion of the
search space with time is greatly reduced, from a quadratic function of the
maximum speed (of the objects in the search range) to a near linear function of
the maximum speed. The VP technique can be applied to a wide range of moving
object index structures. We have implemented the VP technique on two
representative ones, the TPR*-tree and the Bx-tree. Extensive experiments
validate that the VP technique consistently improves the performance of those
index structures.

offering consumers the convenience of ""one-stop shopping"" for both their
mainstream and niche tastes. However, most of existing recommender systems,
especially collaborative filter based methods, can not recommend tail products
due to the data sparsity issue. It has been widely acknowledged that to
recommend popular products is easier yet more trivial while to recommend long
tail products adds more novelty yet it is also a more challenging task. In this
paper, we propose a novel suite of graph-based algorithms for the long tail
recommendation. We first represent user-item information with undirected
edge-weighted graph and investigate the theoretical foundation of applying
Hitting Time algorithm for long tail item recommendation. To improve
recommendation diversity and accuracy, we extend Hitting Time and propose
efficient Absorbing Time algorithm to help users find their favorite long tail

different user-item rating pairs, which further enhances the effectiveness of
long tail recommendation. Empirical experiments on two real life datasets show
that our proposed algorithms are effective to recommend long tail items and
outperform state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.

(background-subtracted) soft X-ray peak fluxes that is invariant through three
solar cycles and agrees with the theoretical prediction $\alpha_F=2.0$ of the

$\alpha_T=2.0$ of the FD-SOC model. During solar cycle maxima years, the
powerlaw slope is steeper in the range of $\alpha_T \approx 2.0-5.0$, which can
be modeled by a solar cycle-dependent flare pile-up bias effect. These results
corroborate the FD-SOC model, which predicts a powerlaw slope of $\alpha_E=1.5$
for flare energies and thus rules out significant nanoflare heating. While the
FD-SOC model predicts the probability distribution functions of spatio-temporal
scaling laws of nonlinear energy dissipation processes, additional physical

for large scale quantum computations without a detrimental loss of quantum
information. A very natural class of gates for fault-tolerant quantum
computation is the Clifford gate set and as such their usefulness for universal
quantum computation is of great interest. Clifford group gates augmented by
magic state preparation give the possibility of simulating universal quantum
computation. However, experimentally one cannot expect to perfectly prepare
magic states. Nonetheless, it has been shown that by repeatedly applying
operations from the Clifford group and measurements in the Pauli basis, the
fidelity of noisy prepared magic states can be increased arbitrarily close to a
pure magic state [1]. We investigate the robustness of magic state distillation
to perturbations of the initial states to arbitrary locations in the Bloch
sphere due to noise. Additionally, we consider a depolarizing noise model on
the quantum gates in the decoding section of the distillation protocol and
demonstrate its effect on the convergence rate and threshold value. Finally, we
establish that faulty magic state distillation is more efficient than
fault-tolerance-assisted magic state distillation at low error rates due to the
large overhead in the number of quantum gates and qubits required in a
fault-tolerance architecture. The ability to perform magic state distillation
with noisy gates leads us to conclude that this could be a realistic scheme for
future small-scale quantum computing devices as fault-tolerance need only be

around these points. Absolute bounds are placed on the phase space of the
libration-orbit coupling through the use of zero-velocity curves that exist in

condition for when the satellite's libration is bound to less than 90 degrees.
When this condition is not satisfied so that circulation of the satellite is

lead to circulation of the satellite. Exact analytical conditions for

vector of the exponentials of the dual variables of an optimal flow problem
(the ""temperature"" of each page). The flow represents an optimal distribution
of web surfers on the web graph in the sense of entropy maximization.
  In this paper, we prove the convergence of Tomlin's HOTS algorithm. We first
study a simplified version of the algorithm, which is a fixed point scaling
algorithm designed to solve the matrix balancing problem for nonnegative
irreducible matrices. The proof of convergence is general (nonlinear
Perron-Frobenius theory) and applies to a family of deformations of HOTS. Then,
we address the effective HOTS algorithm, designed by Tomlin for the ranking of
web pages. The model is a network entropy maximization problem generalizing
matrix balancing. We show that, under mild assumptions, the HOTS algorithm
converges with a linear convergence rate. The proof relies on a uniqueness
property of the fixed point and on the existence of a Lyapunov function.
  We also show that the coordinate descent algorithm can be used to find the
ideal and effective HOTS vectors and we compare HOTS and coordinate descent on
fragments of the web graph. Our numerical experiments suggest that the
convergence rate of the HOTS algorithm may deteriorate when the size of the
input increases. We thus give a normalized version of HOTS with an
experimentally better convergence rate.

a real, and statistically significant, increase in the fraction of
stripped-envelope supernovae in the central regions. A discussion into what may
cause this increased fraction, compared to the more common type IIP supernovae,
and type II supernovae without sub-classifications, is presented. Selection
effects are shown not to drive this result, and so we propose that this study
provides direct evidence for a high-mass weighted initial mass function within
the central regions of disturbed galaxies. ii) Within 'undisturbed' spiral
galaxies the radial distribution of type Ib and type Ic supernovae is
statistically very different, with the latter showing a more centrally
concentrated distribution. This could be driven by metallicity gradients in
these undisturbed galaxies, or radial variations in other properties (binarity

order to get this new equation is to construct a tensor depending on the noise
path but also on the semigroup. We then prove the existence of a unique
H\""older continuous solution of the system of equations, consisting of the path
and the area components, if the nonlinear term and the initial condition are
sufficiently smooth. Once the abstract theory is developed, we can present a
pathwise nonlinear SPDE driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst
parameter in $(1/3,1/2]$.

(SRF) cavities at medium accelerating gradients (20-25 MV/m) is important in
order to reduce the cryogenic losses in continuous wave (CW) accelerators used
for a variety of applications. In recent years, SRF cavities fabricated from
ingot niobium have become a viable alternative to standard high-purity
fine-grain Nb for the fabrication of high-performing SRF cavities with the
possibility of significant cost reduction. Recent studies demonstrated the
improvement of Q0 at medium field in cavities heat treated at 800-1200 {\deg}C
without subsequent chemical etching [ ]. To further explore this treatment
procedure, a new induction furnace with an all-niobium hot-zone was
commissioned [ ]. A single-cell 1.5 GHz cavity fabricated from ingot material
from CBMM, Brazil, with RRR 200, was heat treated in the new furnace in the
temperature range 800-1400 {\deg}C for several hours. Residual resistance value
of 1 - 5 n\Omega have been consistently achieved on this cavity Q0-values as
high as 4.6\times1010 at 90 mT peak surface magnetic field at 2 K. Q0 values of
about ~2\times1011 have been measured at 1.5 K.

resonator in the deep quantum regime, where only few quanta are excited. This
regime is dominated by the appearance of coherent multiphoton resonances in the
nonlinear response of the resonator to the modulation. We determine simple
expressions for the photon noise spectrum and find that the multiphoton
resonances also induces a multiple peak structure in that noise. When the
corresponding multiphoton Rabi oscillations are underdamped, zero temperature
quantum fluctuations determine comparable populations of all quasienergy states
which belong to a resonant multiphoton doublet. Most interestingly, the quantum
fluctuations probe the multiphoton transitions by inducing several peaks in the
noise spectrum of the resonator observables. In particular, the noise of the
photon number contains complete information about the multiphoton states and
their stationary populations via pairs of nearly symmetric peaks at opposite
frequencies. Their widths are determined by the damping of the Rabi
oscillations and their heights are proportional to the stationary nonequilbrium
populations. A finite detuning from a multiphoton resonance generates a
quasielastic noise peak at zero frequency. In addition, we relate the
stationary populations of the quasienergy states with an effective quantum
temperature and discuss the role of a finite temperature.

challenges in biomedical research. In simple cases, single polymorphic loci
explain a significant fraction of the phenotype variability. However, many
traits of interest appear to be subject to multifactorial control by groups of
genetic loci instead. Accurate detection of such multivariate associations is
nontrivial and often hindered by limited power. At the same time, confounding
influences such as population structure cause spurious association signals that
result in false positive findings if they are not accounted for in the model.
Here, we propose LMM-Lasso, a mixed model that allows for both, multi-locus
mapping and correction for confounding effects. Our approach is simple and free
of tuning parameters, effectively controls for population structure and scales
to genome-wide datasets. We show practical use in genome-wide association
studies and linkage mapping through retrospective analyses. In data from
Arabidopsis thaliana and mouse, our method is able to find a genetic cause for
significantly greater fractions of phenotype variation in 91% of the phenotypes
considered. At the same time, our model dissects this variability into
components that result from individual SNP effects and population structure. In
addition to this increase of genetic heritability, enrichment of known
candidate genes suggests that the associations retrieved by LMM-Lasso are more
likely to be genuine.
