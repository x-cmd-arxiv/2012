accretion onto a moving Kerr black hole is presented. The equations of general
relativistic hydrodynamics are solved using high resolution shock capturing
methods. In this treatment we consider the ultrarelativistic limit wherein one
may neglect the baryon rest mass density. This approximation is valid in the
regime where the internal energy of the system dominates over the rest mass
energy contribution from the baryons. The parameters of interest in this study
are the adiabatic constant $\Gamma$, and the asymptotic speed of the fluid,
$v_\infty$. We perform our simulations in three different regimes, subsonic,
marginally supersonic, and supersonic, but the primary focus of this study is
the parameter regime in which the flow is supersonic, that is when $v_\infty
\ge c_{s}^{\infty}$. As expected from previous studies the supersonic regimes
reveal interesting dynamics, but even more interesting is the presence of a bow
shock in marginally supersonic systems. A range of parameter values were
investigated to attempt to capture possible deviations from steady state
solutions, none were found. To show the steady state behaviour of each of the
flows studied we calculate the energy accretion rates on the Schwarzschild
radius. Additionally, we also find that the accretion flows are dependent on
the location of the computational boundary, that if the computational boundary
is located too close to the black hole the calculated flow profiles are marred
with numerical artifacts. This is a problem not found in previous relativistic
models for ultrarelativistic hydrodynamic systems.

Let $G$ be a group of permutations of a set $\Omega$. Let $\pi(G)$ be the set
of partitions of $\Omega$ which arise as the orbit partition of an element of
$G$. The set of partitions of $\Omega$ is naturally ordered by refinement, and
admits join and meet operations. We say that $G$ is join-coherent if $\pi(G)$
is join-closed, and meet-coherent if $\pi(G)$ is meet-closed.
  Our central theorem states that the centralizer in $\Sym(\Omega)$ of any
permutation $g$ is meet-coherent, and subject to a certain finiteness condition
on the orbits of $g$, also join-coherent. In particular, if $\Omega$ is a
finite set then the orbit partitions of elements of the centralizer in
$\Sym(\Omega)$ of $g$ form a lattice.
  A related result states that the intransitive direct product and the
imprimitive wreath product of two finite permutation groups are join-coherent
if and only if each of the groups is join-coherent. We also classify the groups
$G$ such that $\pi(G)$ is a chain and prove two further theorems classifying
the primitive join-coherent groups of finite degree, and the join-coherent
groups of degree $n$ normalizing a subgroup generated by an $n$-cycle.

that high cleaving temperature can suppress surface Fermi surface, we find that
the surface Fermi surface remains obvious and strong in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ cleaved
at high temperature, even at room temperature. This indicates that cleaving
temperature is not a key effective factor in suppressing the surface bands. On
the other hand, in the aged surface of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ that is cleaved and held
for a long time, the bulk bands can be enhanced. We have also carried out laser
ARPES measurements on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ by using vacuum ultra-violet laser (photon
energy at 6.994 eV) and found an obvious enhancement of bulk bands even for
samples cleaved at low temperature. These information are important in
realizing an effective approach in manipulating and detecting the surface and

bulk sensitivity, together with its super-high instrumental resolution of VUV

thus do not provide useful information on longer-term secular trends. Recently,
Krivova et al., 2007 reconstructed, using suitable models, the total solar
irradiance from the end of the Maunder minimum to the present, based on
variations of the surface distribution of the solar magnetic field. The latter
is calculated from the long historical record of the sunspot numbers using a
simple but consistent physical model. There are many classes of proposed
prediction methods for solar cycles behavior, based on different direct solar
activity indices or on various valuable proxies. In particular, the precursor
based methods, utilize a given proxy index to predict the future evolution of
solar activity. Long-term time series of sunspot numbers, allow us to reliably
predict the behavior of the next solar cycle, few years in advance. In previous
papers we predicted the full-shape curve of future solar cycles, using a proper
non-linear dynamics method applied to monthly smoothed sunspot numbers. In
particular, we proved that a sufficiently reliable phase-amplitude prediction
of the current solar cycle 24, requires the knowledge of the initial increasing
phase of the cycle spanning at least two years. The aim of the present paper is
to give a robust long-term prediction of solar cycle activity, many years in

method and, as solar activity proxy index, the reconstructed total solar

enhance memory coalescing significantly but also increase branch divergence.
This leaves designers with two choices: use a small warps and invest in finding
new solutions to enhance coalescing or use large warps and address branch
divergence employing effective control-flow solutions. In this work our goal is
to investigate the answer to this question. We analyze warp size impact on
memory coalescing and branch divergence. We use our findings to study two
machines: a GPU using small warps but equipped with excellent memory coalescing

coalescing-enhanced small warp GPUs is a better approach compared to pursuing a

bio-compatible communication networks using networking primitives already
available in nature. One of the most promising candidates for constructing such
networks is to adapt and engineer specific types of bacteria that are capable
of sensing, actuation, and above all, communication with each other. In this
paper, we describe a new architecture for networks of bacteria to form a data
collecting network, as in traditional sensor networks. The key to this
architecture is the fact that the node in the network itself is a bacterial
colony; as an individual bacterium (biological agent) is a tiny unreliable
element with limited capabilities. We describe such a network under two
different scenarios. We study the data gathering (sensing and multihop
communication) scenario as in sensor networks followed by the consensus problem
in a multi-node network. We will explain as to how the bacteria in the colony
collectively orchestrate their actions as a node to perform sensing and
relaying tasks that would not be possible (at least reliably) by an individual
bacterium. Each single bacterium in the colony forms a belief by sensing
external parameter (e.g., a molecular signal from another node) from the medium
and shares its belief with other bacteria in the colony. Then, after some
interactions, all the bacteria in the colony form a common belief and act as a
single node. We will model the reception process of each individual bacteria
and will study its impact on the overall functionality of a node. We will
present results on the reliability of the multihop communication for data

in a systematic dependence Tc on k1, with a distinct maximum at intermediate

us with unique insight into the role of electron-phonon interaction in relation

  '2012)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The design of biological networks using bacteria as the basic elements of the
network is initially motivated by a phenomenon called quorum sensing. Through
quorum sensing, each bacterium performs sensing the medium and communicating it
to others via molecular communication. As a result, bacteria can orchestrate
and act collectively and perform tasks impossible otherwise. In this paper, we
consider a population of bacteria as a single node in a network. In our version
of biological communication networks, such a node would communicate with one
another via molecular signals. As a first step toward such networks, this paper
focuses on the study of the transfer of information to the population (i.e.,
the node) by stimulating it with a concentration of special type of a molecules
signal. These molecules trigger a chain of processes inside each bacteria that
results in a final output in the form of light or fluorescence. Each stage in
the process adds noise to the signal carried to the next stage. Our objective
is to measure (compute) the maximum amount of information that we can transfer
to the node. This can be viewed as the collective sensing capacity of the node.
The molecular concentration, which carries the information, is the input to the
node, which should be estimated by observing the produced light as the output
of the node (i.e., the entire population of bacteria forming the node). We
focus on the noise caused by the random process of trapping molecules at the
receptors as well as the variation of outputs of different bacteria in the
node. The capacity variation with the number of bacteria in the node and the
number of receptors per bacteria is obtained. Finally, we investigated the
collective sensing capability of the node when a specific form of molecular
signaling concentration is used.

displacement fields, in analogy with the Zel'dovich approximation, and apply a
Wavelet Non-Linear Wiener Filter that decomposes the reconstructed density
fields into a Gaussian and a non-Gaussian component. From a series of 200
realizations of N-body simulations, we compute the recovery performance for
density fields obtained with both dark matter particles and haloes. We find
that the height of the Fisher information trans-linear plateau is increased by
more than an order of magnitude at k > 1.0h/Mpc for particles, whereas either
technique alone offers an individual recovery boost of only a factor of three
to five. We conclude that these two techniques work in a symbiosis, as their
combined performance is stronger than the sum of their individual contribution.
When applied to the halo catalogues, we find that the reconstruction has only a
weak effect on the recovery of Fisher Information, while the non-linear wavelet
filter boosts the information by about a factor offive. We also observe that
non-Gaussian Poisson noise saturates the Fisher information, and that shot
noise subtracted measurements exhibit a milder information recovery.

There, the normal modes around the equilibrium have been solved and various
excited states have been obtained. Those states are expected to be the origin
of a large number of resonances observed. Hence their physical quantities are
analyzed theoretically. The results are compared with the recent experiment
performed in Strasbourg and turn out to be in good agreement with the data.
Disalignments between the orbital angular momentum and the spins of the

Ti3SiC2, measured on single-crystal films has a substantial and positive value
of 4-6 muV/K. Employing a combination of polarized angle-dependent x-ray
spectroscopy and density functional theory we directly show electronic
structure anisotropy in inherently nanolaminated Ti3SiC2 single-crystal thin
films as a model system. The density of Ti 3d and C 2p states at the Fermi
level in the basal ab-plane is about 40 % higher than along the c-axis. The
Seebeck coefficient is related to electron and hole-like bands close to the
Fermi level but in contrast to ground state density functional theory modeling,
the electronic structure is also influenced by phonons that need to be taken
into account. Positive contribution to the Seebeck coefficient of the
element-specific electronic occupations in the basal plane is compensated by 73
% enhanced Si 3d electronic states across the laminate plane that give rise to
a negative Seebeck coefficient in that direction. Strong phonon vibration modes
with three to four times higher frequency along the c-axis than along the basal
ab-plane also influence the electronic population and the measured spectra by
the asymmetric average displacements of the Si atoms. These results constitute
experimental evidence explaining why the average Seebeck coefficient of Ti3SiC2

direct numerical inversion of a matrix to its Green function by taking random
walks of suitably chosen matrices within a path integral of even- and
complex-valued self-energy matrices. The application of a random walk sampling
is given by the possible separation of the total matrix, e.g. that matrix which
determines the Green function from its inversion, into a part of unity minus
(or plus) a matrix which only contains eigenvalues with absolute value smaller
than one. This allows to expand the prevailing Green function around the unit
matrix in a Taylor expansion with a separated, special matrix of sufficiently
small eigenvalues. The presented sampling method is particularly appropriate
around the saddle point solution of the self-energy in a sigma model by using
random number generators. It is also capable for random sampling of
HS-transformed path integrals from fermionic fields which interact through
gauge invariant bosons according to Yang-Mills theories.

the field theoretic model is built, and its propagators are calculated. The
nonlocality of the new action functional in the coordinate representation is
caused by the involving of the fractional spatial derivative. It is proved that
the new model is multiplicatively renormalizable, the Gell-Man-Low function in
the one-loop approximation is evaluted. The existence of the scaling behavior

established.

from the solar limb. They dominate the interface between the chromosphere and
corona and may provide significant mass and energy to the corona. We use
high-quality observations with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope to establish
that so-called type II spicules are characterized by the simultaneous action of
three different types of motion: 1. field-aligned flows of order 50-100 km/s,
2. swaying motions of order 15-20 km/s, and 3. torsional motions of order 25-30
km/s. The first two modes have been studied in detail before, but not the
torsional motions. Our analysis of many near-limb and off-limb spectra and
narrow-band images yields strong evidence that most, if not all, type-II
spicules undergo large torsional modulation and that these motions, like
spicule swaying, represent Alfvenic waves propagating outward at several
hundred km/s. The combined action of the different motions explains the similar
morphology of spicule bushes in the outer red and blue wings of chromospheric
lines, and needs to be taken into account when interpreting Doppler motions to
derive estimates for field-aligned flows in spicules and determining the
Alfvenic wave energy in the solar atmosphere. Our results also suggest that
large torsional motion is an ingredient in the production of type-II spicules
and that spicules play an important role in the transport of helicity through
the solar atmosphere.

can provide information regarding astrophysical sources, the properties of our
Galaxy, and possible exotic sources such as dark matter. To understand cosmic
ray acceleration and propagation mechanisms, accurate measurements of different
cosmic ray elements over a wide energy range are needed. The PAMELA experiment
is a satellite-borne apparatus which allows different cosmic ray species to be
identified over background. Measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton flux and
the antiproton-to-proton flux ratio from 1.5 GeV to 180 GeV are presented in
this thesis. Compared to previous experiments, PAMELA extends the energy range
of antiproton measurements and provides significantly higher statistics. The
derived antiproton flux and antiproton-to-proton flux ratio are consistent with
previous measurements and generally considered to be produced as secondary
products when cosmic ray protons and helium nuclei interact with the
interstellar medium.
  To constrain cosmic ray acceleration and propagation models, the antiproton
data measured by PAMELA were further used together with the proton spectrum
reported by PAMELA, as well as the B/C data provided by other experiments.
Statistical tools were interfaced with the cosmic ray propagation package
GALPROP to perform the constraining analyses. Diffusion models with a linear
diffusion coefficient and modified diffusion models with a low energy
dependence of the diffusion coefficient were studied in the $\chi^{2}$ study.
Uncertainties on the parameters and the goodness of fit of each model were
given. Some models are further studied using the Bayesian inference. Posterior
means and errors of the parameters base on our prior knowledge on them were
obtained in the Bayesian framework. This method also allowed us to understand
the correlation between parameters and compare models.

(SMBH) binaries in centers of galaxies can facilitate binary merger and give
rise to observational signatures both in electromagnetic and gravitational wave
domains. We explore general properties of circumbinary disks by reformulating
standard equations for the viscous disk evolution in terms of the viscous
angular momentum flux F_J. In steady state F_J is a linear function of the
specific angular momentum, which is a generalization of (but is not equivalent
to) the standard constant \dot M disk solution. If the torque produced by the
central binary is effective at stopping gas inflow and opening a gap (or
cavity) in the disk, then the inner part of the circumbinary disk can be
approximated as a constant F_J disk. We compute properties of such disks in
different physical regimes relevant for SMBH binaries and use these results to
understand the gas-assisted evolution of SMBH pairs starting at separations
10^{-4}-10^{-2} pc. We find the following. (1) Pile-up of matter at the inner
edge of the disk leads to continuous growth of the torque acting on the binary
and can considerably accelerate its orbital evolution compared to the
gravitational wave-driven decay. (2) Torque on the binary is determined
non-locally and does not in general reflect the disk properties in the vicinity
of the binary. (3) Binary evolution depends on the past history of the disk
evolution. (4) Eddington limit can be important in circumbinary disks even if
they accrete at sub-Eddington rates at late stages of binary evolution. (5)
Circumbinary disk self-consistently evolved under the action of the binary
torque emits more power and has spectrum different from the spectrum of
constant \dot M disk - it is steeper (\nu F_\nu\propto \nu^{12/7}) and extends
to shorter wavelength, facilitating its detection.

force, the mean translocation rate of ribosome increases from one lower limit
to one upper limit, and both of these two limits increase with concentrations
of the translocation factors. Under high external force, ribosome translocates
mainly through active process. At saturating concentrations of translocation
factors, the translocation is governed by mechanochemical sub-processes.

dimensions is well known to be equivalent to the imaginary-time quantum
dynamics of a 1+1-dimensional many-particle system, with polymer configurations
corresponding to particle world-lines. This equivalence motivates the
application of techniques originally designed for one-dimensional many-particle
quantum systems to the exploration of many-polymer systems, as first recognized
and exploited by P.-G. de Gennes [J.\ Chem.\ Phys.\ {\bf 48}, 2257 (1968)]. In
this low-dimensional setting interactions give rise to an emergent polymer
fluid, and we examine how topological constraints on this polymer fluid (e.g.,
due to uncrossable pins or barriers) and their geometry give rise to strong,
entropy-driven forces. In the limit of large polymer densities, in which a type
of mean-field theory is accurate, we find that a point-like pin causes a
divergent pile-up of polymer density on the high-density side of the pin and a
zero-density region (or gap) of finite area on the low-density. In addition, we
find that the force acting on a pin that is only mildly displaced from its
equilibrium position is sub-Hookean, growing less than linearly with the
displacement, and that the gap created by the pin also grows sublinearly with
the displacement. By contrast, the forces acting between multiple pins
separated along the direction preferred by the polymers are super-Hookean.
These nonlinear responses result from effective long-ranged interactions
between polymer segments, which emerge via short-ranged interactions between
distant segments of long polymer strands. In the present paper, we focus on the
case of an infinitely strong, repulsive contact interaction, which ensures that
the polymers completely avoid one another. In a companion paper, we consider
the effects of a wider set of inter-polymer interactions.

explosion, a main-sequence (MS) donor star survives the explosion but it is
stripped of mass and shock heated. An essentially unavoidable consequence of
mass loss during the explosion is that the companion must have an overextended
envelope after the explosion. While this has been noted previously, it has not
been strongly emphasized as an inevitable consequence. We calculate the future
evolution of the companion by injecting 2-6 10^47 ergs into the stellar
evolution model of a 1 Msun donor star based on the post-explosion progenitors
seen in simulations. We find that, due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz collapse of the
envelope, the companion must become significantly more luminous (10 - 10^3
Lsun) for a long period of time (10^3 - 10^4 years). The lack of such a
luminous ""leftover"" star in the LMC supernova remnant SNR 0609-67.5 provides
another piece of evidence against the SD scenario. We also show that none of
the stars proposed as the survivors of the Tycho supernova, including Tycho G,
could plausibly be the donor star. Additionally, luminous donors closer than
~10 Mpc should be observable with the Hubble Space Telescope starting ~2 years
post-peak. Such systems include SN 1937C, SN 1972E, SN 1986G, and SN 2011fe.
Thus, the SD channel is already ruled out for at least two nearby SNe Ia and
can be easily tested for a number of additional ones. We also discuss similar
implications for the companions of core-collapse SNe.

different initial densities orbiting a host galaxy that resembles the Milky Way
has been studied using a large set of Newtonian N-Body simulations. From the
simulations two maps of the orbital conditions that lead to quasi-equilibrium
objects were constructed. It has been found that several orbits of the
satellites allow for the existence, for about 1 Gyr or more, of
out-of-equilibrium bodies with high apparent mass-to-light ratios. Within this
framework the satellites in the quasi-stable phase reproduce the observed
satellite properties for about 16% of the orbit for high density progenitors,
and for about 66% for progenitors with lower densities An additional simulation
for a single satellite with initial mass of 10^7 Msun and Plummer radius of
0.15 kpc leads to remnants in the quasi- equilibrium phase that simultaneously
reproduce remarkably well the observational quantities of the UFDGs of the
Milky Way. This satellite in the quasi-stable phase reproduces the observed
satellite properties for about 42% of the orbit. The results suggest that a
fraction of the observed satellites could plausibly be galaxies without dark
matter that have true M/L ratios much lower than those measured. The inflated
M/L ratios arise because they are observed at the right time, along the right
orbit and during the quasi-equilibrium phase of their evolution. This is a
viable explanation for the high M/L ratios observed in all satellites as long
as the satellites are preferentially on certain orbits and are observed at
certain times. This could arise within the TDG scenario if all satellites are
created at the same time along a few specific orbits that are particularly
susceptible to the quasi-equilibrium phase.

has imaged the central 0.9 deg^2 of the COSMOS field down to limiting depths of
1.9 10^-16 erg cm^-2 s-1 in the 0.5-2 keV band, 7.3 10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in
the 2-10 keV band, and 5.7 10^-16 erg cm^-2 s-1 in the 0.5-10 keV band. In this
paper we report the i, K and 3.6micron identifications of the 1761 X-ray point
sources. We use the likelihood ratio technique to derive the association of
optical/infrared counterparts for 97% of the X-ray sources. For most of the
remaining 3%, the presence of multiple counterparts or the faintness of the
possible counterpart prevented a unique association. For only 10 X-ray sources
we were not able to associate a counterpart, mostly due to the presence of a
very bright field source close by. Only 2 sources are truly empty fields.
Making use of the large number of X-ray sources, we update the ""classic locus""
of AGN and define a new locus containing 90% of the AGN in the survey with full
band luminosity >10^42 erg/s. We present the linear fit between the total i
band magnitude and the X-ray flux in the soft and hard band, drawn over 2
orders of magnitude in X-ray flux, obtained using the combined C-COSMOS and
XMM-COSMOS samples. We focus on the X-ray to optical flux ratio (X/O) and we
test its known correlation with redshift and luminosity, and a recently
introduced anti-correlation with the concentration index (C). We find a strong
anti-correlation (though the dispersion is of the order of 0.5 dex) between C
and X/O, computed in the hard band, and that 90% of the obscured AGN in the
sample with morphological information live in galaxies with regular morphology
(bulgy and disky/spiral), suggesting that secular processes govern a
significant fraction of the BH growth at X-ray luminosities of 10^43- 10^44.5

(NSCs) and stellar spheroids of 51 low-mass, early-type galaxies in the Virgo
cluster with empirical mass-to-light ratios, in order to complement previous
studies that explore the dependence of NSC masses (M_{NSC}) on various
properties of their host galaxies. We confirm a roughly linear relationship
between M_{NSC} and luminous host spheroid mass (M_{Sph}), albeit with
considerable scatter (0.57 dex). We estimate velocity dispersions from the
virial theorem, assuming all galaxies in our sample share a common DM fraction
and are dynamically relaxed. We then find that M_{NSC} \sim \sigma^{2.73\pm
0.29}, with a slightly reduced scatter of 0.54 dex.
  This confirms recent results that the shape of the M_{CMO} - \sigma relation
is different for NSCs and super-massive black holes (SMBHs). We discuss this
result in the context of the generalized idea of ""central massive objects""
(CMOs).
  In order to assess which physical parameters drive the observed NSC masses,
we also carry out a joint multi-variate power-law fit to the data. In this, we
allow M_{NSC} to depend on M_{Sph} and R_{Sph} (and hence implicitly on
\sigma), as well as on the size of the globular cluster reservoir. When
considered together, the dependences on M_{Sph} and R_{Sph} are roughly
consistent with the virial theorem, and hence M_{NSC} \propto \sigma^2.
However, the only statistically significant correlation is a linear scaling
between M_{NSC} and M_{Sph}.
  We compare M_{NSC} with predictions for two popular models for NSC formation,
namely i) globular cluster infall due to dynamical friction, and ii) in-situ
formation during the early phases of galaxy formation that is regulated via
momentum feedback from stellar winds and/or supernovae. Neither model can
directly predict the observations, and we discuss possible interpretations of
our findings.

Sun-like stars, one would like to know their thermal inertia. We use a global
climate model to simulate the thermal phase variations of Earth-analogs and
test whether these data could distinguish between planets with different heat
storage and heat transport characteristics. In particular, we consider a
temperate climate with polar ice caps (like modern Earth), and a snowball state
where the oceans are globally covered in ice. We first quantitatively study the
periodic radiative forcing from, and climatic response to, rotation, obliquity,
and eccentricity. Orbital eccentricity and seasonal changes in albedo cause
variations in the global-mean absorbed flux. The responses of the two climates
to these global seasons indicate that the temperate planet has 3 times the bulk
heat capacity of the snowball planet due to the presence of liquid water
oceans. The temperate obliquity seasons are weaker than one would expect based
on thermal inertia alone; this is due to cross-equatorial oceanic and
atmospheric energy transport. Thermal inertia and cross-equatorial heat
transport have qualitatively different effects on obliquity seasons, insofar as
heat transport tends to reduce seasonal amplitude without inducing a phase lag.
For an Earth-like planet, however, this effect is masked by the mixing of
signals from low thermal inertia regions (sea ice and land) with that from high
thermal inertia regions (oceans), which also produces a damped response with
small phase lag. We then simulate thermal lightcurves as they would appear to a
high-contrast imaging mission (TPF-I/Darwin) and consider the inverse problem
of estimating thermal inertia based solely on time-resolved photometry.

the response of dust to gap formation by a single planet in the gaseous
component of a protoplanetary disk - the so-called ""dust filtration"" mechanism.
We have found that a gap opened by a giant planet at 20 AU in a \alpha=0.01,
\dot{M}=10^{-8} Msun/yr disk can effectively stop dust particles larger than
0.1 mm drifting inwards, leaving a sub-millimeter dust cavity/hole. However,
smaller particles are difficult to filter by a planet-induced gap due to 1)
dust diffusion, and 2) a high gas accretion velocity at the gap edge. An
analytic model is also derived to understand what size particles can be
filtered by the gap edge. Finally, with our updated understanding of dust
filtration, we have computed Monte-Carlo radiative transfer models with
variable dust size distributions to generate the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of disks with gaps. By comparing with transitional disk observations
(e.g. GM Aur), we have found that dust filtration alone has difficulties to
deplete small particles sufficiently to explain the near-IR deficit of
transitional disks, except under some extreme circumstances. The scenario of
gap opening by multiple planets studied previously suffers the same difficulty.
One possible solution is by invoking both dust filtration and dust growth in
the inner disk. In this scenario, a planet induced gap filters large dust
particles in the disk, and the remaining small dust particles passing to the
inner disk can grow efficiently without replenishment from fragmentation of
large grains. Predictions for ALMA have also been made based on all these
scenarios. We conclude that dust filtration with planet(s) in the disk is a
promising mechanism to explain submm observations of transitional disks but it
may need to be combined with other processes (e.g. dust growth) to explain the
near-IR deficit.

distribution of the typical mark by constructing an asymptotic
\chi^2-goodness-of-fit test. The corresponding test statistic is based on a
natural empirical version of the Palm mark distribution and a smoothed
covariance estimator which turns out to be mean-square consistent. Our approach
does not require independent marks and allows dependences between the mark
field and the point pattern. Instead we impose a suitable \beta-mixing
condition on the underlying stationary marked point process which can be
checked for a number of Poisson-based models and, in particular, in the case of
geostatistical marking. Our method needs a central limit theorem for
\beta-mixing random fields which is proved by extending Bernstein's blocking
technique to non-cubic index sets and seems to be of interest in its own right.
By large-scale model-based simulations the performance of our test is studied
in dependence of the model parameters which determine the range of spatial
correlations.

fit of -0.22+-0.03 dex per unit redshift from z=0.09-5.06. The metallicity
'floor' of ~1/600 solar continues out to z~5, despite our sensitivity for
finding DLAs with much lower metallicities. However, this floor is not
statistically different from a steep tail to the distribution. We also find
that the intrinsic scatter of metallicity among DLAs of ~0.5 dex continues out

r\,$\sim\,36"",\sim$\,4.4kpc\,$\sim$\,0.36\,$(\frac {D_{25}}{2})$ the derived
O/H ratio follows the radial gradient typical of spiral galaxies, the abundance
gradient beyond r$\sim36""$ flattens out. The analysis of the multi-wavelength
surface brightness profiles of NGC 5668 is performed by fitting these profiles
with those predicted by chemo-spectrophotometric evolutionary models of galaxy
disks. From this, we infer a spin and circular velocity of $\lambda$=0.053 and
v$_{c}$=167\,km\,s$^{-1}$, respectively. The metallicity gradient and rotation
curve predicted by this best-fitting galaxy model nicely match the values
derived from the IFU observations, especially within r\,$\sim36\arcsec$. The
same is true for the colors despite of some small offsets and a reddening in
the bluest colors beyond that radius. On the other hand, deviations of some of
these properties in the outer disk indicate that a secondary mechanism,
possibly gas transfer induced by the presence of a young bar, must have played
a role in shaping the recent chemical and star formation histories of NGC 5668.

gathering further RV data. By using available photometric and RV data, we
perform a blend analysis, compute more accurate system parameters, confine the
planetary mass and attempt to cast light on the observed transit anomalies. We
combine the original HATNet observations and various followup data to jointly
analyze the signal content and extract the transit component and use our RV
data to aid the global parameter determination. The blend analysis of the
combination of multicolor light curves yields the first independent
confirmation of the planetary nature of WASP-33b. We clearly identify three
frequency components in the 15-21 1/day regime with amplitudes 7-5 mmag. These
frequencies correspond to the delta Scuti-type pulsation of the host star. None
of these pulsation frequencies or their low-order linear combinations are in
close resonance with the orbital frequency. We show that these pulsation
components explain some but not all of the observed transit anomalies. The
grand-averaged transit light curve shows that there is a ~1.5 mmag brightening
shortly after the planet passes the mid-transit phase. Although the duration
and amplitude of this brightening varies, it is visible even through the direct
inspections of the individual transit events (some 40-60% of the followup light
curves show this phenomenon). We suggest that the most likely explanation of
this feature is the presence of a well-populated spot belt which is highly
inclined to the orbital plane. This geometry is consistent with the inference
from the spectroscopic anomalies. Finally, we constrain the planetary mass to
M_p=3.27+/-0.73 M_J by using our RV data collected by the TRES spectrograph.

singular integral equations on surfaces in three dimensions. Fredholm equations
of the second kind as arise in connection with linear elliptic boundary value
problems for scalar and vector fields are considered. In contrast to methods
based on product integration, coordinate transformations and singularity
subtraction, the family of Nystrom methods studied here is based on a local
polynomial correction determined by an auxiliary system of moment equations.
The polynomial correction is shown to remove the weak singularity in the
integral equation and provide control over the approximation error. Convergence
results for the family of methods are established under minimal regularity
assumptions consistent with classic potential theory. Rates of convergence are
shown to depend on the regularity of the problem, the degree of the polynomial
correction, and the order of the quadrature rule employed in the
discretization. As a corollary, a simple method based on singularity
subtraction which has been employed by many authors is shown to be convergent.

transitions, which occur at \sim 60 K without Cu, are monotonically depressed
with increasing Cu content. By 10% Cu for Fe, the structural transition is
hardly detectable, and the system becomes a spin glass below 22 K, with a
slightly incommensurate ordering wave vector of (0.5-d, 0, 0.5) with d being
the incommensurability of 0.02, and correlation length of 12 angstrom along the

linearly with temperature down to 37 K, below which there is a first order
transition to a long-range almost-commensurate antiferromagnetic structure. A

non-trivial Z$_2$ topological insulators such as the quantum spin Hall (QSH)
state and the 3D strong topological insulator. One of the defining properties
of this system is the robustness of the state under the addition of disorder
that preserves $T.$ In this letter, we explore the phase diagram of the

by examining the entanglement spectrum for disordered class AII symplectic
systems. As for the case of the $T$ breaking Chern insulator we show that there

feature in the statistics of the entanglement spectrum that aids the
identification of delocalized states and consequently critical energies across

extension. Under the new detection results of CDMS II, XENON, CoGeNT and
PAMELA, we find that (i) the latest detection results can exclude a large part
of the parameter space which allowed by current collider constraints in these
models. The future SuperCDMS and XENON can cover most of the allowed parameter
space; (ii) the singlet sector will decouple from the MSSM-like sector in the
NMSSM, however, singlet sector makes the nMSSM quite different from the MSSM;
(iii) the NMSSM can allow light dark matter at several GeV exists. Light
CP-even or CP-odd Higgs boson must be present so as to satisfy the measured
dark matter relic density. In case of the presence of a light CP-even Higgs
boson, the light neutralino dark matter can explain the CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA
results; (iv) the general singlet extension of the MSSM gives a perfect
explanation for both the relic density and the PAMELA result through the
Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation. Higgs decays in different scenario are also
studied.

only a few are observed to be red. The color of the other vertices is
unobserved. Typically, the unknown total number of red vertices is small. The
vertex nomination problem is to nominate one of the unobserved vertices as
being red. The edge set of the graph is a subset of the set of unordered pairs
of vertices. Suppose that each edge is also colored green or red and this is
observed for all edges. The context statistic of a vertex is defined as the
number of observed red vertices connected to it, and its content statistic is
the number of red edges incident to it. Assuming that these statistics are
independent between vertices and that red edges are more likely between red
vertices, Coppersmith and Priebe (2012) proposed a likelihood model based on
these statistics. Here, we formulate a Bayesian model using the proposed
likelihood together with prior distributions chosen for the unknown parameters
and unobserved vertex colors. From the resulting posterior distribution, the
nominated vertex is the one with the highest posterior probability of being
red. Inference is conducted using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm, and
performance is illustrated by a simulation study. Results show that (i) the
Bayesian model performs significantly better than chance; (ii) the probability
of correct nomination increases with increasing posterior probability that the
nominated vertex is red; and (iii) the Bayesian model either matches or
performs better than the method in Coppersmith and Priebe. An application
example is provided using the Enron email corpus, where vertices represent
Enron employees and their associates, observed red vertices are known
fraudsters, red edges represent email communications perceived as fraudulent,
and we wish to identify one of the latent vertices as most likely to be a
fraudster.

models for stochastic processing networks in heavy traffic. Stationary
distributions of such models give useful information on the steady state
performance of the corresponding stochastic networks and thus it is important
to develop reliable and efficient algorithms for numerical computation of such
distributions. In this work we propose and analyze a Monte-Carlo scheme based
on an Euler type discretization of the reflected stochastic differential
equation using a single sequence of time discretization steps which decrease to
zero as time approaches infinity. Appropriately weighted empirical measures
constructed from the simulated discretized reflected diffusion are proposed as
approximations for the invariant probability measure of the true diffusion
model. Almost sure consistency results are established that in particular show
that weighted averages of polynomially growing continuous functionals evaluated
on the discretized simulated system converge a.s. to the corresponding
integrals with respect to the invariant measure. Proofs rely on constructing
suitable Lyapunov functions for tightness and uniform integrability and
characterizing almost sure limit points through an extension of Echeverria's
criteria for reflected diffusions. Regularity properties of the underlying
Skorohod problems play a key role in the proofs. Rates of convergence for
suitable families of test functions are also obtained. A key advantage of
Monte-Carlo methods is the ease of implementation, particularly for high
dimensional problems. A numerical example of a eight dimensional Skorohod
problem is presented to illustrate the applicability of the approach.

controller that exactly and optimally connects any pair of states, where the
cost function is expressed as a trade-off between the duration of a trajectory
and the expended control effort. Our approach generalizes earlier work on
extending RRT* to kinodynamic systems, as it guarantees asymptotic optimality
for any system with controllable linear dynamics, in state spaces of any
dimension. Our approach can be applied to non-linear dynamics as well by using
their first-order Taylor approximations. In addition, we show that for the rich
subclass of systems with a nilpotent dynamics matrix, closed-form solutions for
optimal trajectories can be derived, which keeps the computational overhead of
our algorithm compared to traditional RRT* at a minimum. We demonstrate the
potential of our approach by computing asymptotically optimal trajectories in
three challenging motion planning scenarios: (i) a planar robot with a 4-D
state space and double integrator dynamics, (ii) an aerial vehicle with a 10-D
state space and linearized quadrotor dynamics, and (iii) a car-like robot with

stabilizers occurring in factors of such actions are highly restricted.
Specifically, the stabilizer of almost every point must be either trivial or of
finite index. Second, such actions are very chaotic in the sense that, when the
space is not essentially countable, every non-identity group element acts with
infinite Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy. Finally, we show that such actions display
behavior reminiscent of the Howe--Moore property. Specifically, if the action
is ergodic then there is an integer n such that for every non-trivial normal
subgroup K the number of K-ergodic components is at most n. Our results are
based on a new formula for f-invariant entropy.

semi-forbidden emission lines from the broad-line region (BLR) observed in its
rest-frame UV spectrum. However, our rest-frame optical spectrum from MOIRCS
shows strong [OIII] emission from the narrow-line region (NLR) suggesting that,
at variance with the BLR, NLR gas is not metal-rich. In order to reconcile
these contradictory results, there may be two alternative possibilities; (1)
the strong nitrogen lines from the BLR are simply due to a very high relative
abundance of nitrogen rather than to a very high BLR metallicity, or (2) the
BLR metallicity is not representative of the metallicity of the host galaxy,
better traced by the NLR. In either case, the strong broad nitrogen lines in
the UV spectrum are not indication of a chemically enriched host galaxy. We
estimated the black hole mass and Eddington ratio of this quasar from the
velocity width of both CIV and H_beta, that results in log(M_BH/M_sun) = 9.50
and log(L_bol/L_Edd) = -0.34. The relatively high Eddington ratio is consistent
with our earlier result that strong nitrogen emission from BLRs is associated
with high Eddington ratios. Finally, we detected significant [NeIII] emission
from the NLR, implying a quite high gas density of n~10^6 cm^-3 and suggesting
a strong coupling between quasar activity and dense interstellar clouds in the
host galaxy.

dominated plasma. We develop a statistical model of the emission from Doppler
boosted reconnection minijets and find analytical expressions for the moments
of the resulting nebula light curve (e.g. time average, variance, skewness).
The light curve has a flat power spectrum that transitions at short timescales
to a decreasing power-law of index 2. The flux distribution from minijets
follows a decreasing power-law of index ~ 1, implying the average flux from
flares is dominated by bright rare events. The predictions for the flares'
statistics can be tested against forthcoming observations. We find the observed
flare spectral energy distributions (SEDs) have several notable features: A
hard power-law index of p ~< 1 for accelerated particles that is expected in
various reconnection models, including some evidence of a pile-up near the
radiation reaction limit. Also, the photon energy at which the SED peaks is
higher than that implied by the synchrotron radiation reaction limit,
indicating the flare emission regions' Doppler factors are ~> few. We conclude
that magnetic reconnection can be an important, if not dominant, mechanism of

effect of external influences such as (a) transverse static electric field and
(b) doping of hydrogen atoms (hydrogenation) on optical properties of silicene.
Firstly, with electric field, it is observed that band gap can be opened up in
silicene at Fermi level by breaking the inversion symmetry. We see appreciable
changes in optical absorption due to band gap opening. Secondly, hydrogenation
in silicene strongly modifies the hybridization and our geometry analysis
indicates that the hybridization in silicene goes from mixture of sp^2 + sp^3
to purely sp^3. Therefore, there is no pi electron present in the system.
Consequently, the electronic structure and optical absorption spectra of

small magnetic fields two magnetic transitions occur, one at Tc = 57 K and the
second one at TN = 58 K. At Tc the non-linear susceptibility reveals the
emergence of the ferromagnetic component and below Tc the magnetization
measurements show the splitting between field-cooled and zero-field-cooled
regimes. Above 1000 Oe the magnetization saturates and the system is in a
single domain state. The temperature dependence of the saturation below Tc can
be well described by m(T) = m(0)[1 - (T/Tc)^2]^{\beta}, with m(0) = 0.56
(mu)B/Cu, corresponding to the 3-up-1-down configuration. The dielectric
constant measured on a thin single crystal shows a systematic deviation below
the transition, indicating an intrinsic magnetoelectric effect.

emitters for which the known population is steadily increasing thanks to the
Fermi/Large Area Telescope. In this paper, their gamma-ray luminosity and
spectral features are explained in the framework of synchrotron radiation from
particles located in the stripe of the pulsar wind. Apart from radiative
losses, particles are also subject to a constant re-acceleration and reheating
for instance by a magnetic reconnection induced electric field. The high-energy
luminosity scales as $L_\gamma \approx 2\times10^{26} \textrm{W} \, (L_{\rm
sd}/10^{28} \textrm{W})^{1/2} \, (P/1 \textrm{s})^{-1/2}$ where $L_{\rm sd}$ is
the pulsar spindown luminosity and $P$ its period. From this relation, we
derive important parameters of pulsar magnetosphere and wind theories. Indeed,
we find bulk Lorentz factor of the wind scaling as $\Gamma_{\rm v} \approx 10
\, \tau_{\rm rec}^{1/5} \, (L_{\rm sd}/10^{28} \textrm{W})^{1/2}$, pair
multiplicity $\kappa$ related to the magnetization parameter $\sigma$ by
$\kappa\,\sigma \, \tau_{\rm rec}^{1/5} \approx 10^8$, and efficiency $\eta$ of
spin-down luminosity conversion into particle kinetic energy according to the
relation $\eta\,\sigma\approx1$. A good guess for the associated reconnection
rate is then $\tau_{\rm rec} \approx 0.5 \, (L_{\rm sd}/10^{28}
\textrm{W})^{-5/12}$. Finally, pulses in gamma-rays are visible only if $L_{\rm
sd}/P\gtrsim 10^{27} \textrm{W/s}$. This model differs from other high-energy
emission mechanisms because it makes allowance not only for rotational kinetic
energy release but also for an additional reservoir of energy anchored to the
magnetic field of the stripe and released for instance by some magnetic
reconnection processes.

M1 transition between the radially excited charmonium S-wave spin-triplet and
the radially excited S-wave spin-singlet states: \psi(3686)\to\gamma\eta_c(2S).
Analyses of the processes \psi(2S)\to \gamma\eta_c(2S) with \eta_c(2S)\to
\K_S^0 K\pi and K^+K^-\pi^0 gave an \eta_c(2S) signal with a statistical
significance of greater than 10 standard deviations under a wide range of

obtain measurements of the \eta_c(2S) mass (M(\eta_c(2S))=3637.6\pm
2.9_\mathrm{stat}\pm 1.6_\mathrm{sys} MeV/c^2), width
(\Gamma(\eta_c(2S))=16.9\pm 6.4_\mathrm{stat}\pm 4.8_\mathrm{sys} MeV), and the

\BR(\eta_c(2S)\to K\bar K\pi) = (1.30\pm 0.20_\mathrm{stat}\pm

hole doping. The resulting electronic structure is not understood, although
changes in the state of oxygen atoms appear paramount. Hole doping first
destroys the Mott state yielding a weak insulator where electrons localize only
at low temperatures without a full energy gap. At higher doping, the
'pseudogap', a weakly conducting state with an anisotropic energy gap and
intra-unit-cell breaking of 90\degree-rotational (C4v) symmetry appears.
However, a direct visualization of the emergence of these phenomena with
increasing hole density has never been achieved. Here we report atomic-scale
imaging of electronic structure evolution from the weak-insulator through the
emergence of the pseudogap to the superconducting state in Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2. The
spectral signature of the pseudogap emerges at lowest doping from a weakly
insulating but C4v-symmetric matrix exhibiting a distinct spectral shape. At
slightly higher hole-density, nanoscale regions exhibiting pseudogap spectra
and 180\degree-rotational (C2v) symmetry form unidirectional clusters within
the C4v-symmetric matrix. Thus, hole-doping proceeds by the appearance of
nanoscale clusters of localized holes within which the broken-symmetry
pseudogap state is stabilized. A fundamentally two-component electronic
structure11 then exists in Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2 until the C2v-symmetric clusters
touch at higher doping, and the long-range superconductivity appears.

the nearby dwarf elliptical galaxy NGC 205. Using data obtained with the WIRCam
near-infrared imager of the CFHT, we selected the AGB stars in the JHKs
color-magnitude diagrams, and separated the C stars from M-giant stars in the
JHKs color-color diagram. We identified 1,550 C stars in NGC 205 with a mean
absolute magnitude of M_Ks = -7.49 \pm 0.54, and colors of (J - Ks) = 1.81 \pm
0.41 and (H - Ks) = 0.76 \pm 0.24. The ratio of C stars to M-giant stars was
estimated to be 0.15 \pm 0.01 in NGC 205, and the local C/M ratios for the
southern region are somewhat lower than those for the northern region. The (J -
Ks) color distributions of AGB stars contain the main peak of the M-giant stars
and the red tail of the C stars. A comparison of the theoretical isochrone
models with the observed color distribution indicates that most of the bright
M-giant stars in NGC 205 were formed at log(t_yr) \sim 9.0-9.7. The logarithmic
slope of the M_Ks luminosity function for M-giant stars was estimated to be
0.84 \pm 0.01, which is comparable with dwarf elliptical galaxies NGC 147 and
NGC 185. Furthermore, we found that the logarithmic slopes of the M_Ks
luminosity function for C and M-giant stars are different to places, implying a
different star formation history within NGC 205. The bolometric luminosity
function for M-giant stars extends to M_bol = -6.0 mag, and that for C stars
spans -5.6 < M_bol < -3.0. The bolometric luminosity function of C stars is
unlikely to be a Gaussian distribution and the mean bolometric magnitude of C
stars is estimated to be M_bol = -4.24 \pm 0.55, which is consistent with our
results for dwarf elliptical galaxies NGC 147 and NGC 185.

long/short gamma-ray bursts and predicts that their afterglows are the pulsed

eight candidates were discovered first by Arellano Ferro et al. (2011) but
would not have been known to Safanova & Stalin (2011) at the time of their
paper submission, while four candidates are new variables. Three of the new
variables are SX Phe type and one is a semi-regular red giant variable (SR
type). We also tentatively confirm the presence of true variability in two
other candidates and we are unable to investigate another four candidates
because they are not in our data base. However, we find that the remaining 54
candidate variable stars are spurious detections where systematic trends in the
light curves have been mistaken for true variability. We believe that the
erroneous detections are caused by the adoption of a very low detection
threshold used to identify these candidates.

definite effect in the valence quark region. The asymmetries for negative and
positive hadrons are similar in magnitude and opposite in sign. They are
compatible with model calculations in which the u-quark transversity is
opposite in sign and somewhat larger than the d-quark transversity distribution
function. The asymmetry is extracted as a function of Bjorken $x$, the relative
hadron energy $z$ and the hadron transverse momentum p_T^h. The high statistics
and quality of the data also allow for more detailed investigations of the
dependence on the kinematic variables. These studies confirm the leading-twist

uncertainties of a few percent and confirm with considerably better accuracy
the previous COMPASS measurement. The Sivers asymmetry is found to be
compatible with zero for negative hadrons and positive for positive hadrons, a
clear indication of a spin-orbit coupling of quarks in a transversely polarised
proton. As compared to measurements at lower energy, a smaller Sivers asymmetry
for positive hadrons is found in the region x > 0.03. The asymmetry is
different from zero and positive also in the low x region, where sea-quarks
dominate. The kinematic dependence of the asymmetry has also been investigated
and results are given for various intervals of hadron and virtual photon
fractional energy. In contrast to the case of the Collins asymmetry, the
results on the Sivers asymmetry suggest a strong dependence on the
four-momentum transfer to the nucleon, in agreement with the most recent

a two-level medium by numerically solving the full-wave Maxwell-Bloch
equations. The counter-rotating terms in the spontaneous emission damping are
included such that the equations of motion are slightly different from the
conventional Bloch equations. The counter-rotating terms can considerably
suppress the broadening of the pulse envelope and the decrease of the group
velocity rooted from dispersion. Furthermore, for incident single-cycle pulses
with envelope area 4$\pi$, the time-delay of the generated soliton pulse from
the main pulse depends crucially on the carrier-envelope phase of the incident

when the canonical ensemble and the microcanonical ensemble are not equivalent

simulations of gravitational collapse of a cold gas cloud followed by the
formation of a protostellar core use a grey treatment of radiative transfer
coupled to the hydrodynamics. However, dust opacities which dominate extinction
show large variations as a function of frequency. In this paper, we used
frequency-dependent radiative transfer to investigate the influence of the
opacity variations on the properties of Larson's first core. We used a
multigroup M1 moment model in a 1D radiation hydrodynamics code to simulate the
spherically symmetric collapse of a 1 solar mass cloud core. Monochromatic dust
opacities for five different temperature ranges were used to compute Planck and
Rosseland means inside each frequency group. The results are very consistent
with previous studies and only small differences were observed between the grey
and multigroup simulations. For a same central density, the multigroup
simulations tend to produce first cores with a slightly higher radius and
central temperature. We also performed simulations of the collapse of a 10 and
0.1 solar mass cloud, which showed the properties of the first core to be
independent of the initial cloud mass, with again no major differences between
grey and multigroup models. For Larson's first collapse, where temperatures
remain below 2000 K, the vast majority of the radiation energy lies in the IR
regime and the system is optically thick. In this regime, the grey
approximation does a good job reproducing the correct opacities, as long as
there are no large opacity variations on scales much smaller than the width of
the Planck function. The multigroup method is however expected to yield more
important differences in the later stages of the collapse when high energy (UV
and X-ray) radiation is present and matter and radiation are strongly
decoupled.

phenomena. For such a system, the time stamps at which water drops separate
from the faucet can be directly observed in real experiments, and the time
series of intervals \tau_n between drop separations becomes a subject of
analysis. Even if the mass m_n of a drop at the onset of the n-th separation,
which cannot be observed directly, exhibits perfectly deterministic dynamics,
it sometimes fails to obtain important information from time series of \tau_n.
This is because the return plot \tau_n-1 vs. \tau_n may become a multi-valued
function, i.e., not a deterministic dynamical system. In this paper, we propose
a method to construct a nonlinear coordinate which provides a ""surrogate"" of
the internal state m_n from the time series of \tau_n. Here, a key of the
proposed approach is to use ISOMAP, which is a well-known method of manifold
learning. We first apply it to the time series of $\tau_n$ generated from the
numerical simulation of a phenomenological mass-spring model for the dripping
faucet system. It is shown that a clear one-dimensional map is obtained by the
proposed approach, whose characteristic quantities such as the Lyapunov
exponent, the topological entropy, and the time correlation function coincide
with the original dripping faucet system. Furthermore, we also analyze data
obtained from real dripping faucet experiments which also provides promising
results.

acquisition and the processing of multidimensional datasets, in particular in
the field of spectral imaging. Benefiting from these new developments, earth
scientists try to recover the reflectance spectra of macroscopic materials
(e.g., water, grass, mineral types...) present in an observed scene and to
estimate their respective proportions in each mixed pixel of the acquired
image. This task is usually referred to as spectral mixture analysis or
spectral unmixing (SU). SU aims at decomposing the measured pixel spectrum into
a collection of constituent spectra, called endmembers, and a set of
corresponding fractions (abundances) that indicate the proportion of each
endmember present in the pixel. Similarly, when processing spectrum-images,
microscopists usually try to map elemental, physical and chemical state
information of a given material. This paper reports how a SU algorithm
dedicated to remote sensing hyperspectral images can be successfully applied to
analyze spectrum-image resulting from electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS).
SU generally overcomes standard limitations inherent to other multivariate
statistical analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or
independent component analysis (ICA), that have been previously used to analyze
EELS maps. Indeed, ICA and PCA may perform poorly for linear spectral mixture
analysis due to the strong dependence between the abundances of the different
materials. One example is presented here to demonstrate the potential of this
technique for EELS analysis.

recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2010 in proton-proton collisions at a
center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 33.4/pb is
performed, searching for supersymmetric final states containing jets and
missing transverse energy and no electrons or muons (zero-lepton channel). No
excess over the Standard Model background expectation is observed. Using the
CLs and PLR methods, exclusion limits are set in two different supergravity
models. These considerably extend the excluded parameter ranges from earlier
experiments.
  The rates and efficiencies of triggers based on combined signatures with jets
plus missing transverse energy in ATLAS are studied, which are the primary
triggers for the search for Supersymmetry in the zero-lepton channel. For the
measurement of the efficiencies in data collected in 2010 and 2011, the
bootstrap method is applied. Different sample triggers based on jets and
missing transverse energy are compared and their efficiencies are measured. A
reweighting approach is used to correct for the bias from the propagation of
the uncertainties in the bootstrap method.
  A universal model is developed to describe the contribution of fake missing
transverse energy from resolution effects to the rates of missing transverse
energy triggers as function of the level of in-time pile-up, i.e. the number of
concurrent proton-proton interactions. The input parameters are tuned to the
properties of the ATLAS trigger system, and the model predictions are compared
to measurements of trigger rates in ATLAS. Good agreement is found for low
thresholds for which the rates are dominated by resolution effects, whereas the
rates for higher thresholds are underestimated due to additional sources of
fake and real missing transverse energy, which are not incorporated in the
model.

that it is due to the t-channel exchange of a right-handed sbottom which
couples to d_R and t_R, as is present in the R-parity violating minimal
supersymmetric standard model. We show that all Tevatron and LHC experiments' t
tbar constraints may be respected for a sbottom mass between 300 and 1200 GeV,

Model contribution to the LHC charge asymmetry parameter is Delta
A_C^y=0.017-0.045, small enough to be consistent with current measurements but
non-zero and positive, allowing for LHC confirmation in the future within 20
fb^-1. A small additional contribution to the LHC t tbar production
cross-section is also predicted, allowing a further test. We estimate that 10
fb^-1 of LHC luminosity would be sufficient to rule out the proposal to 95%

be centred on the Standard Model prediction.

procedure of certain $K_{\mathbb{C}}$-orbits in $\mathfrak{p}_{\mathbb{C}}^*$
to obtain all scalar type highest weight representations. Here $K_{\mathbb{C}}$
is the complexification of a maximal compact subgroup $K\subseteq G$ with
corresponding Cartan decomposition $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k}+\mathfrak{p}$ of
the Lie algebra of $G$. We explicitly realize every such representation $\pi$
on a Fock space consisting of square integrable holomorphic functions on its
associated variety $Ass(\pi)\subseteq\mathfrak{p}_{\mathbb{C}}^*$.
  The associated variety $Ass(\pi)$ is the closure of a single nilpotent
$K_{\mathbb{C}}$-orbit
$\mathcal{O}^{K_{\mathbb{C}}}\subseteq\mathfrak{p}_{\mathbb{C}}^*$ which
corresponds by the Kostant-Sekiguchi correspondence to a nilpotent coadjoint
$G$-orbit $\mathcal{O}^G\subseteq\mathfrak{g}^*$. The known Schr\""odinger model
of $\pi$ is a realization on $L^2(\mathcal{O})$, where
$\mathcal{O}\subseteq\mathcal{O}^G$ is a Lagrangian submanifold. We construct
an intertwining operator from the Schr\""odinger model to the new Fock model,
the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform, which gives a geometric quantization
of the Kostant-Sekiguchi correspondence (a notion invented by Hilgert,
Kobayashi, {\O}rsted and the author).
  The main tool in our construction are multivariable $I$- and $K$-Bessel
functions on Jordan algebras which appear in the measure of
$\mathcal{O}^{K_{\mathbb{C}}}$, as reproducing kernel of the Fock space and as
integral kernel of the Segal-Bargmann transform. As a corollary to our
construction we also obtain the integral kernel of the unitary inversion
operator in the Schr\""odinger model in terms of a multivariable $J$-Bessel
function as well as explicit Whittaker vectors.

  and censored data","Technical Report",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In reliability and life testing studies, the topic of estimating hazard rate
has received great attention in recent years since an estimate of hazard rate
is a quite useful tool for making decisions. Some works have included
nonparametric approaches while some have considered parametric structural
models for complete as well as censored data sets; see Meeker et al. (1992),
Antoniadis and Gr\'egoire (1999), Rai and Singh (2003), Bezandry et al. (2005),
Brunel and Comte (2008), and Mahapatra et al. (2012). Depending on the shapes
of the hazard rate, efficiencies differ markedly across proposed estimators.
This situation is remarkable especially when different estimation techniques
are utilized for unknown parameters of underlying distributions in parametric
approaches. That is, estimated hazard rate (and also reliability) at a specific
time point t as functions of these estimators leads to inconsistent coverage
probabilities as distributional convergence of hazard rate estimator may not be
at the desired rate for certain sample sizes.
  This manuscript focuses on the estimation of monotone hazard rate when the
distribution of concern is of location-scale type. A very simple and efficient
approximation of hazard rate for a complete sample is introduced as a function
of order statistics, which allows a fast convergence to the asymptotic
distribution while achieving highly accurate coverage probabilities for
confidence intervals (CI). Efficiency of the method is demonstrated on
simulation studies by considering a number of location-scale distributions
having various hazard shapes. We also consider the case of censored samples by
incorporating the predicted future order statistics into the picture.

to focus on the goal of detection of gravitation waves. The detection
sensitivity is shifted 52 times toward larger wavelength compared to that of
LISA. The mission orbits of the 3 spacecraft forming a nearly equilateral
triangular array are chosen to be near the Sun-Earth Lagrange points L3, L4 and
L5. The 3 spacecraft range interferometrically with one another with arm length
about 260 million kilometers. In order to attain the requisite sensitivity for
ASTROD-GW, laser frequency noise must be suppressed below the secondary noises
such as the optical path noise, acceleration noise etc. For suppressing laser
frequency noise, we need to use time delay interferometry (TDI) to match the
two different optical paths (times of travel). Since planets and other
solar-system bodies perturb the orbits of ASTROD-GW spacecraft and affect the
(TDI), we simulate the time delay numerically using CGC 2.7 ephemeris
framework. To conform to the ASTROD-GW planning, we work out a set of 20-year
optimized mission orbits of ASTROD-GW spacecraft starting at June 21, 2028, and
calculate the residual optical path differences in the first and second
generation TDI for one-detector case. In our optimized mission orbits for 20

+5 degrees carried out at 7.6 cm on the RATAN-600 radio telescope are used to
estimate some statistical properties of radio sources. Limits on the
sensitivity of the survey due to noise imposed by background sources, which
dominates the radiometer sensitivity, are refined. The vast majority of noise
due to background sources is associated with known radio sources (for example,
from the NVSS with a detection threshold of 2.3 mJy) with normal steep spectra
({\alpha} = 0.7-0.8, S \propto {\nu}^{- \alpha}), which have also been detected
in new deep surveys at decimeter wavelengths. When all such objects are removed
from the observational data, this leaves another noise component that is
observed to be roughly identical in independent groups of observations. We
suggest this represents a new population of radio sources that are not present
in known catalogs at the 0.6 mJy level at 7.6 cm. The studied redshift
dependence of the number of steep-spectrum objects shows that the sensitivity
of our survey is sufficient to detect powerful FRII radio sources at any
redshift, right to the epoch of formation of the first galaxies. The inferred
new population is most likely associated with low-luminosity objects at

intrinsically quantum mechanical, and that do not have a simple description in
terms of weakly interacting quasi-particles. Two systems that have recently
attracted a great deal of interest are the quark-gluon plasma, a plasma of
strongly interacting quarks and gluons produced in relativistic heavy ion
collisions, and ultracold atomic Fermi gases, very dilute clouds of atomic
gases confined in optical or magnetic traps. These systems differ by more than
20 orders of magnitude in temperature, but they were shown to exhibit very
similar hydrodynamic flow. In particular, both fluids exhibit a robustly low
shear viscosity to entropy density ratio which is characteristic of quantum
fluids described by holographic duality, a mapping from strongly correlated
quantum field theories to weakly curved higher dimensional classical gravity.

and the stellar populations were derived. Five of the observed galaxies have an
ongoing star formation rate of 1-5 M_sun/yr and mean stellar population ages ~5
Gyr. The sixth galaxy shows no star formation and has an about 12 Gyr old
stellar population. All galaxies have stellar masses larger than 2E+10 M_sun
and metallicities above solar. Four galaxies show negative radial metallicity
gradients of the ionized gas up to -0.058 dex/kpc and one has nearly uniform
metallicity with a possible shallow positive slope. The stellar components show
shallower negative metallicity gradients up to -0.03 dex/kpc. We find no clear
correlation between the properties of the galaxy and those of the supernovae,
which may be because of the small ranges spanned by the galaxy parameters.
However, we note that the Hubble residuals are on average positive while
negative Hubble residuals are expected for SNe Ia in massive hosts such as the
galaxies in our sample. In conclusion, IFU spectroscopy on 4-m telescopes is a
viable technique for studying host galaxies of nearby SNe Ia. It allows one to
correlate the supernova properties with the properties of their host galaxies
at the projected positions of the supernovae. Our current sample of six

temperature-coupling strength dependence of the density (particle-hole) and
single-particle (SP) excitation spectra both in superfluid and normal phases.
The dynamic structure factor, S(q,omega), of the longitudinal excitations is
rigorously reconstructed with full information on damping. The SP spectral
function, A(q,omega), is worked out from the one-particle Matsubara Green's
function. A stochastic optimization method is applied for reconstruction from
imaginary times. In the superfluid regime sharp energy resonances are observed
both in the density and SP excitations. The involved hybridization of both
spectra is discussed. In contrast, in the normal phase, when there is no
coupling, the density modes, beyond acoustic phonons, are significantly damped.

many-body wavefunctions [F. Mazzanti et al., PRL 102, 110405 (2009), D. Hufnagl

in the presence of uncorrelated point-like disorder, both in the classical and
quantum regimes. The transport properties of those two-dimensional surface
states depend strongly on the amplitude of the hexagonal warping of their Fermi
surface. It is shown that a perturbative analysis of the warping fails to
describe the transport in experimentally available topological insulators, such
as Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3. Hence we develop a fully non-perturbative description of
these effects. In particular, we find that the dependence of the warping
amplitude on the Fermi energy manifests itself in a strong dependence of the
diffusion constant on this Fermi energy, leading to several important
experimental consequences. Moreover, the combination of a strong warping with
an in plane Zeeman effect leads to an attenuation of conductance fluctuations
in contrast to the situation of unwarped Dirac surface states.

interval of $x \in := (-L,L)\mathbb{G}^{(2)}$ (with an $\alpha-$dependent
non-Hermiticity given by Robin boundary conditions) and generalize it. In
essence, we just replace the support interval $\mathbb{G}^{(2)}$ (reinterpreted
as an equilateral two-pointed star graph with the Kirchhoff matching at the
vertex $x=0$) by a $q-$pointed equilateral star graph $\mathbb{G}^{(q)}$
endowed with the simplest complex-rotation-symmetric external
$\alpha-$dependent Robin boundary conditions. The remarkably compact form of
the secular determinant is then deduced. Its analysis reveals that (1) at any
integer $q=2,3,...$, there exists the same, $q-$independent and infinite
subfamily of the real energies, and (2) at any special $q=2,6,10,...$, there
exists another, additional and $q-$dependent infinite subfamily of the real
energies. In the spirit of the recently proposed dynamical construction of the
Hilbert space of a quantum system, the physical bound-state interpretation of
these eigenvalues is finally proposed.

This algorithm enables us to find the eigen-frequencies and pinpoint the
locations of the resonant cavities that appear in individual realizations of
random samples, for arbitrary distributions of the widths and refractive
indices of the layers. Each cavity is formed in a region whose size is a few
localization lengths. Its eigen-frequency is independent of the location inside
the sample, and does not change if the total length of the sample is increased
by, for example, adding more scatterers on the sides. We show that the total
number of cavities, $N_{\mathrm{cav}}$, and resonances, $N_{\mathrm{res}}$, per
unit frequency interval is uniquely determined by the size of the disordered
system and is independent of the strength of the disorder. In an active,
amplifying medium, part of the cavities may host lasing modes whose number is
less than $N_{\mathrm{res}}$. The ensemble of lasing cavities behaves as
distributed feedback lasers, provided that the gain of the medium exceeds the
lasing threshold, which is specific for each cavity. We present the results of
experiments carried out with single-mode optical fibers with gain and
randomly-located resonant Bragg reflectors (periodic gratings). When the fiber
was illuminated by a pumping laser with an intensity high enough to overcome
the lasing threshold, the resonances revealed themselves by peaks in the
emission spectrum. Our experimental results are in a good agreement with the
theory presented here.

solar energy with almost unit {\it quantum efficiency}. However, recent
experimental evidence of {\it quantum coherence} during the excitonic energy
transport in photosynthetic organisms challenges our understanding of this
fundamental biological function. Currently, and despite numerous efforts, the
causal connection between coherence and efficiency is still a matter of debate.
We show, through the study of extensive simulations of quantum coherent
transport on networks, that three dimensional structures characterized by
centro-symmetric Hamiltonians are statistically more efficient than random
arrangements. Moreover, we demonstrate that the experimental data available for
the electronic Hamiltonians of the Fenna-Mathew-Olson (FMO) complex of sulfur
bacteria and of the crypophyte PC645 complex of marine algae are consistent
with this strong correlation of centro-symmetry with quantum efficiency. These
results show that what appears to be geometrically disordered complexes may
well exhibit a hidden symmetry which enhances the energy transport between
chromophores. We are confident that our results will motivate research to
explore the properties of nearly centro-symmetric Hamiltonians in more
realistic environments, and to unveil the role of symmetries for quantum
effects in biology. The unravelling of such symmetries may open novel
perspectives and suggest new design principles in the development of artificial
devices.

and this oversight is the source of the predictions of time-reversal-invariance
made by these two great systems of motion. By taking into consideration
Planck's law of blackbody radiation and the Doppler effect, in thinking about
Maxwell's electromagnetic wave equation, I have shown that photons, in the
environment through which any charged particle moves, act as a source of
temperature-dependent friction on everything from elementary particles to
galaxies. Because the optomechanical friction is universal and inevitable, no
real systems are conservative, and temperature can no longer be an outsider in
a fundamental and irreducible law of motion. I have defined the change of
entropy (\Delta S) in irreversible systems at constant temperature in terms of
the optomechanical friction. The Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states
that \Delta S > 0 for spontaneous processes, is explained by electromagnetic
interactions between charged particles and the Doppler-shifted photons through
which they move as opposed to chance and statistics. \Delta S, as defined here,
is not subject to Poincar\'e's recurrence theorem. Consequently, the Second Law
of Thermodynamics is shown to be a fundamental law rather than a statistical
law. This result, which supports the idea that every instant of time is unique,
is consistent with intuition and the routine experience of botanists.

large ones. By KA2, the fundamental role of gravity in the dynamics of vacuum
geometry is being conceded to the remaining fundamental interactions. The
ground state in KA2 is of the form $\bar{\cal M}^{n+4}=\bar{\cal
C}^{n+1}\times\IR^3$, where the static (averaged-out over scales ${\rm L}>>{\rm

deeper vacuum dynamics at Planck scale. For the simplest non-trivial
implementation of KA2, the Bianchi IX subclass of SU(2)-invariant ${\cal
B}^4_{\rm IX}$ provides the $\bar{\cal C}^5=\bar{\cal B}^4_{\rm M}\times S^1$,
with the $S^1$ coming from 'augmentability', a complement to compactification.
The classical action involves (i) the gravitational and EW sectors in elegant
{\em hierarchy}, (ii) the {\em higgsless} emergence and full calculability of
the EW gauge bosons masses and (iii) gravity as a necessarily effective field,
hence non-quantizable. A conjectured ${\cal C}^{n+1}$ with $n\leq 7$ (to adjoin
