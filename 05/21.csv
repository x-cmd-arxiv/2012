The displacement current may not be treatable similar to the conductive current

In particular, when the total variation of the incoming flow perturbation

the two-dimensional steady supersonic Euler flows containing a strong vortex

are reflected after the nonlinear waves interact with the strong vortex
sheet/entropy wave and the wall boundary. Using the wave-front tracking method,
the existence of solutions in $BV$ over the Lipschitz walls is first shown,
when the total variation of the incoming flow perturbation around the

establish the $L^{1}$--stability of the solutions with respect to the incoming

$L^{1}$--distance between two solutions containing the strong vortex
sheets/entropy waves, is carefully constructed to include the nonlinear waves
generated by both the wall boundary and the incoming flow. This Lyapunov
functional is then proved to decrease in the flow direction, leading to the
$L^{1}$--stability of the solutions. Furthermore, the uniqueness of these
solutions extends to a larger class of viscosity solutions.

invariants associated with a tame real or angle valued map were recently

Morse-Novicov theory for real or angle valued Morse maps. The invariants are
""barcodes"" and ""Jordan cells"". From them one can derive all familiar
topological invariants which can be derived via Morse-Novikov theory, like the
Betti numbers and in the case of angle valued maps also the Novikov Betti
numbers and the monodromy. Stability results for (some) bar codes and the
homotopy invariance of the Jordan cells are the key results, and two new
polynomials for any nonnegative integer (up to the dimension of the source)
associated to a continuous nonzero complex valued map provide potentially
interesting refinements of the Betti numbers and of the Novikov Betti numbers.
In our theory the bar codes which are intervals with ends critical
values/angles, the Jordan cells and the "" canonical long exact sequence"" of a
tame map are the analogues of instantons between rest points, closed
trajectories and of the Morse-Smale complex of the gradient of a Morse function
in the Morse-Novikov theory.

abundances in O-type stars, to enable further constraints on the early
evolution of massive stars. We provide first theoretical predictions for the
NIV4058/NIII4640 emission line ratio in dependence of various parameters, and
confront them with results from the analysis of a sample of early LMC/SMC
O-stars. Stellar and wind parameters are determined by line profile fitting of
H/He/N lines, exploiting the helium and nitrogen ionization balance.
Corresponding synthetic spectra are calculated using the NLTE atmospheric code
FASTWIND. Though there is a monotonic relationship between the emission line
ratio and Teff, all other parameters being equal, theoretical predictions
indicate additional dependencies, most notably, on the nitrogen abundance.
These basic predictions are confirmed by results from atmospheric code CMFGEN.
The effective temperatures for the earliest O-stars, inferred from the nitrogen
ionization balance, are partly considerably hotter than indicated by previous
studies. Consistent with earlier results, effective temperatures increase from
supergiants to dwarfs for all spectral types in the LMC. The relation between
observed NIV4058/NIII4640 emission line ratio and Teff, for a given luminosity
class, turned out to be quite monotonic for our sample stars, and fairly
consistent with our model predictions. The scatter within a spectral sub-type
is mainly produced by abundance effects. Our findings suggest that the Walborn
et al. (2002) classification scheme is able to provide a meaningful relation
between spectral type and Teff, provided that it is possible to discriminate
for the luminosity class. This might be difficult to achieve in low-Z
environments such as the SMC, owing to rather low wind-strengths. According to
our predictions, the major bias of the classification scheme is due to nitrogen
content.

clusters. For a broad class of collision rates, this system reaches a
non-equilibrium stationary state at large times and the cluster size
distribution tends to a universal form characterised by a constant flux of mass
through the space of cluster sizes. Universality, in this context, means that
the stationary state becomes independent of the cut-off as the cut-off grows.
This universality is lost, however, if the aggregation rate between large and
small clusters increases sufficiently steeply as a function of cluster sizes.
We identify a transition to a regime in which the stationary state vanishes as
the cut-off grows. This non-universal stationary state becomes unstable,
however, as the cut-off is increased and undergoes a Hopf bifurcation. After
this bifurcation, the stationary kinetics are replaced by persistent and
periodic collective oscillations. These oscillations carry pulses of mass
through the space of cluster sizes. As a result, the average mass flux remains
constant. Furthermore, universality is partially restored in the sense that the
scaling of the period and amplitude of oscillation is inherited from the
dynamical scaling exponents of the universal regime. The implications of this
new type of long-time asymptotic behaviour for other driven non-equilibrium
systems are discussed.

filtering. Based on this connection we show that the normalized cut algorithm
is equivalent to repeated iterations of bilateral filtering. Then, using this
equivalence we present and implement a fast normalized cut algorithm for image
segmentation. Experiments show that our implementation can solve the original
optimization problem in the normalized cut algorithm 10 to 100 times faster.
Furthermore, we present a new algorithm called conditioned normalized cut for
image segmentation that can easily incorporate color image patches and
demonstrate how this segmentation problem can be solved with edge preserving

heat, as well as for influencing large-scale variability on the planets. Both
linear normal mode analysis and non-linear initial value calculations are
carried out -- focusing on the freely-evolving, adiabatic situation. Using a
high-resolution general circulation model (GCM) which solves the traditional
primitive equations, we show that large-scale jets similar to those observed in
current GCM simulations of hot extrasolar giant planets are likely to be
baroclinically unstable on a timescale of few to few tens of planetary
rotations, generating cyclones and anticyclones that drive weather systems. The
growth rate and scale of the most unstable mode obtained in the linear analysis
are in qualitative, good agreement with the full non-linear calculations. In
general, unstable jets evolve differently depending on their signs (eastward or
westward), due to the change in sign of the jet curvature. For jets located at
or near the equator, instability is strong at the flanks -- but not at the
core. Crucially, the instability is either poorly or not at all captured in
simulations with low resolution and/or high artificial viscosity. Hence, the
instability has not been observed or emphasized in past circulation studies of
hot extrasolar planets.

particles and hadronic jets, the measurement of the imbalance in transverse
momentum of the final state particles is the major leverage to reject the
otherwise dominant source of backgrounds in hadron colliders, i.e. the generic
production of many jets by QCD interactions. Here we discuss a novel technique
which utilizes the information derived from the spectrometer, eventually
coupled with the more straightforward calorimeter information, to infer the
passage of invisible particles. We check the validity of this technique in data

simplest, with two jets in the final state, to the ones with very large jet
multiplicities. We also suggest a new way, based on the same approach, to

measures, which exhibit spontaneous magnetization in the sense that vertices in
one sublattice have a higher probability to be in one state than in either of
the other two states. For the special case of the diced lattice, we give a good
rigorous lower bound on this probability, based on computer-assisted
calculations that are not available for the other lattices.

was proposed that a new mechanism where a light CP-odd pseudoscalar boson of
$m_{A_1^0}=214.3$ MeV makes a crucial contribution. Later, some authors have
studied the transition $\pi^0\to e^+e^-$ and $\Upsilon\to \gamma A_1^0$ in
terms of the same mechanism and their result indicates that with the suggested
mass one cannot fit the data. This discrepancy might be caused by experimental
error of $\Sigma^+\to p+\mu^+\mu^-$ because there were only a few events.
Whether the mechanism is a reasonable one motivates us to investigate the
transitions $\pi^0\to e^+e^-; \eta (\eta^\prime)\to \mu^+\mu^-; \eta_c\to
\mu^+\mu^-; \eta_b\to\tau^+\tau^-$ within the same framework. It is noted that
for $\pi^0\to e^+e^-$, the standard model (SM) prediction is smaller than the
data, whereas the experimental central value of $\eta \to \mu^+\mu^-$ is also
above the SM prediction. It means that there should be extra contributions from
other mechanisms and the contribution of $A_1^0$ may be a possible one.
Theoretically calculating the branching ratios of the concerned modes, we would
check if we can obtain a universal mass for $A_1^0$ which reconcile the
theoretical predictions and data for all the modes. Unfortunately, we find that
it is impossible to have such a mass with the same coupling $|g_\ell|$.
Therefore we conclude that the phenomenology does not favor such a light
$A_1^0$, even though a small window is still open.

mining task. In many applications, events constituting the data sequence arrive
as a stream, at furious rates, and recent trends (or frequent episodes) can
change and drift due to the dynamical nature of the underlying event generation
process. The ability to detect and track such the changing sets of frequent
episodes can be valuable in many application scenarios. Current methods for
frequent episode discovery are typically multipass algorithms, making them
unsuitable in the streaming context. In this paper, we propose a new streaming
algorithm for discovering frequent episodes over a window of recent events in
the stream. Our algorithm processes events as they arrive, one batch at a time,
while discovering the top frequent episodes over a window consisting of several
batches in the immediate past. We derive approximation guarantees for our
algorithm under the condition that frequent episodes are approximately
well-separated from infrequent ones in every batch of the window. We present
extensive experimental evaluations of our algorithm on both real and synthetic
data. We also present comparisons with baselines and adaptations of streaming
algorithms from itemset mining literature.

magnetic properties of hexagonal manganites. For these purposes, we consider
two characteristic compounds: YMnO3 and LuMnO3, which form different magnetic
structures in the ground state. First, we establish an electronic low-energy
model, which describes the behavior of the Mn 3d bands of YMnO3 and LuMnO3, and
derive parameters of this model from the first-principles calculations. From
the solution of this model, we conclude that, despite strong frustration
effects in the hexagonal lattice, the relativistic spin-orbit interactions lift
the degeneracy of the magnetic ground state so that the experimentally observed
magnetic structures are successfully reproduced by the low-energy model. Then,
we analyze this result in terms of interatomic magnetic interactions, which
were computed using different approximations (starting from the model
Hamiltonian as well as directly from the first-principles electronic structure
calculations in the local-spin-density approximation). We argue that the main
reason why YMnO3 and LuMnO3 tend to form different magnetic structures is
related to the behavior of the single-ion anisotropy, which reflects the
directional dependence of the lattice distortion: namely, the expansion and
contraction of the Mn-trimers, which take place in YMnO3 and LuMnO3,
respectively. On the other hand, the magnetic coupling between the haxagonal
planes is controlled by the next-nearest-neighbor interactions, which are less
sensitive to the direction of the trimerization. Finally, using the Berry-phase
formalism, we evaluate the magnetic-state dependence of the ferroelectric
polarization, and discuss potential applications of the latter in
magnetoelectric switching phenomena.

dependence of photon trajectories one can use the following dimensionless
parameter: $\varepsilon=\pm (\omega M)^{-1}$, where $\omega$ is the photon
frequency and the sign + (-) corresponds to the right (left) circular
polarization. We assume that $|\varepsilonl << 1$ and use the modified
geometric optics approximation developed in [1], that is we include the first
order in $\varepsilon$ polarization dependent terms into the eikonal equation.
These corrections modify late time behavior of photons. We demonstrate that the
photon moves along a null curve, which in the limit $\varepsilon=0$ becomes a
null geodesic. We focus on the scattering problem for polarized light. Namely,
we consider the following problems: (i) How does the photon bending angle
depend on its polarization; (ii) How does position of the image of a point-like
source depend on its polarization; (iii) How does the arrival time of photons
depend on their polarization. We perform the numerical calculations that
illustrate these effects for an extremely rotating black hole and discuss their

connections between this question and issues arising in quantum information

following:
  1. For any constant even integer q>=4, a graph $G$ is a ""small-set expander""
if and only if the projector into the span of the top eigenvectors of G's
adjacency matrix has bounded 2->q norm. As a corollary, a good approximation to
the 2->q norm will refute the Small-Set Expansion Conjecture--a close variant
of the UGC. We also show that such a good approximation can be obtained in
exp(n^(2/q)) time, thus obtaining a different proof of the known subexponential
algorithm for Small Set Expansion.
  2. Constant rounds of the ""Sum of Squares"" semidefinite programing hierarchy
certify an upper bound on the 2->4 norm of the projector to low-degree
polynomials over the Boolean cube, as well certify the unsatisfiability of the
""noisy cube"" and ""short code"" based instances of Unique Games considered by
prior works. This improves on the previous upper bound of exp(poly log n)
rounds (for the ""short code""), as well as separates the ""Sum of

require omega(1) rounds.
  3. We show reductions between computing the 2->4 norm and computing the
injective tensor norm of a tensor, a problem with connections to quantum
information theory. Three corollaries are: (i) the 2->4 norm is NP-hard to
approximate to precision inverse-polynomial in the dimension, (ii) the 2->4
norm does not have a good approximation (in the sense above) unless 3-SAT can
be solved in time exp(sqrt(n) polylog(n)), and (iii) known algorithms for the
quantum separability problem imply a non-trivial additive approximation for the
2->4 norm.

transition temperature (Tc) is measured from both DC and AC magnetic
susceptibility, which decrease with increase in Ni or Co content. Both Co and
Ni suppress Tc and drive the system into the normal state. Interestingly, Ni
suppresses the superconductivity much faster than the Co. This indicates less

Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) in the redshift range 0.0055 to 0.073, obtained
between 2006 and 2011. There are a total of 5522 light curve points. We show
that our natural system SN photometry has a precision of roughly 0.03 mag or
better in BVr'i', 0.06 mag in u', and 0.07 mag in U for points brighter than
17.5 mag and estimate that it has a systematic uncertainty of 0.014, 0.010,
0.012, 0.014, 0.046, and 0.073 mag in BVr'i'u'U, respectively. Comparisons of
our standard system photometry with published SN Ia light curves and comparison
stars reveal mean agreement across samples in the range of ~0.00-0.03 mag. We
discuss the recent measurements of our telescope-plus-detector throughput by
direct monochromatic illumination by Cramer et al (in prep.). This technique
measures the whole optical path through the telescope, auxiliary optics,
filters, and detector under the same conditions used to make SN measurements.
Extremely well-characterized natural-system passbands (both in wavelength and
over time) are crucial for the next generation of SN Ia photometry to reach the
0.01 mag accuracy level. The current sample of low-z SN Ia is now sufficiently
large to remove most of the statistical sampling error from the dark energy
error budget. But pursuing the dark-energy systematic errors by determining
highly-accurate detector passbands, combining optical and near-infrared (NIR)
photometry and spectra, using the nearby sample to illuminate the population
properties of SN Ia, and measuring the local departures from the Hubble flow
will benefit from larger, carefully measured nearby samples.

circuit balanced Nb-$\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$-Nb
superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) quasiparticle mixer with 4-8 GHz
instantaneous intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth to quantitatively determine
local oscillator (LO) noise. A balanced mixer is a unique tool to separate
noise at the mixer's LO port from other noise sources. This is not possible in
single-ended mixers. The antisymmetric IV characteristic of a SIS mixer further
helps to simplify the measurements. The double-sideband receiver sensitivity of
the balanced mixer is 2-4 times the quantum noise limit $h\nu/k_B$ over the
measured frequencies with a maximum LO noise rejection of 15 dB. This work
presents independent measurements with three different LO sources that produce
the reference frequency but also an amount of near-carrier noise power which is
quantified in the experiment as a function of the LO and IF frequency in terms
of an equivalent noise temperature $T_{LO}$. In a second experiment we use only
one of two SIS mixers of the balanced mixer chip, in order to verify the
influence of near-carrier LO noise power on a single-ended heterodyne mixer
measurement. We find an IF frequency dependence of near-carrier LO noise power.
The frequency-resolved IF noise temperature slope is flat or slightly negative
for the single-ended mixer. This is in contrast to the IF slope of the balanced
mixer itself which is positive due to the expected IF roll-off of the mixer.
This indicates a higher noise level closer to the LO's carrier frequency. Our
findings imply that near-carrier LO noise has the largest impact on the
sensitivity of a receiver system which uses mixers with a low IF band, for
example superconducting hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers.

Kroupa and the Chabrier IMF, have emerged over the last decade to explain the
observed distribution of stellar masses. The possibility of the universal
nature of the stellar IMF leads us to the interesting prospect of a universal
mode of star-formation. It is well-known that turbulent fragmentation of gas in
the interstellar medium produces a lognormal distribution of density which is
further reflected by the mass-function for clumps at low and intermediate
masses. Stars condense out of unstable clumps through a complex interplay
between a number of dynamic processes which must be accounted for when tracing
the origin of the stellar IMF. In the present work, applying the theory of
gravitational fragmentation we first derive the mass function (MF) for clumps.
Then a core mass function (CMF) is derived by allowing the clumps to fragment,
having subjected each one to a random choice of gas temperature. Finally, the
stellar IMF is derived by applying a random core-to-star conversion efficiency,
$\epsilon$, in the range of 5%-15% to each CMF. We obtain a power-law IMF that
has exponents within the error-bars on the Kropua IMF. This derived IMF is
preceded by a similar core mass function which suggests, gravoturbulent
fragmentation plays a key role in assembling necessary conditions that relate
the two mass-functions. In this sense the star-formation process, at least at
low redshifts where gas cooling is efficient, is likely to be universal. We
argue that the observed knee in the CMF and the stellar IMF may alternatively
be interpreted in terms of the characteristic temperature at which gas in
potential star-forming clouds is likely to be found. Our results also show that
turbulence in star-forming clouds is probably driven on large spatial scales
with a power-spectrum steeper than Kolmogorov-type.

leads to a complicated topology of surviving clusters as soon as $d>1$. Even if
one starts from a Cayley tree, the network of surviving renormalized clusters
will contain loops, so that no analytical solution can been obtained. Here we
introduce a modified procedure called 'Boundary Strong Disorder
Renormalization' that preserves the tree structure, so that one can write
simple recursions with respect to the number of generations. We first show that
this modified procedure allows to recover exactly most of the critical
exponents for the one-dimensional chain. After this important check, we study
the RG equations for the quantum Ising model on a Cayley tree with a uniform
ferromagnetic coupling $J$ and random transverse fields with support
$[h_{min},h_{max}]$. We find the following picture (i) for $J>h_{max}$, only
bonds are decimated, so that the whole tree is a quantum ferromagnetic cluster
(ii) for $J<h_{min}$, only sites are decimated, so that no quantum
ferromagnetic cluster is formed, and the ferromagnetic coupling to the boundary
coincides with the partition function of a Directed Polymer model in a random
medium (iii) for $h_{min}<J<h_{max}$, both sites and bonds can be decimated :
the quantum ferromagnetic clusters can either remain finite (the physics is
then similar to (ii), with a quantitative mapping to a modified Directed
Polymer model) or an infinite quantum ferromagnetic cluster appears. We find
that the quantum transition can be of two types : (a) either the quantum
transition takes place in the region where quantum ferromagnetic clusters
remain finite, and the singularity of the ferromagnetic coupling to the
boundary involves the typical correlation length exponent $\nu_{typ}=1$ (b) or
the quantum transition takes place at the point where an extensive quantum

bands in the electronic structure. However, they do not all have the same
status for an ARPES experiment. There are interference effects between the 2 Fe
that modulate strongly the intensity of the bands and that can even switch
their parity. We give a simple description of these effects, notably showing
that ARPES polarization selection rules in these systems cannot be applied by
reference to a single Fe ion. We show that ARPES data for the electron pockets
in Ba(Fe0.92Co0.08)2As2 are in excellent agreement with this model. We observe
both the total suppression of some bands and the parity switching of some other
bands. Once these effects are properly taken into account, the structure of the
electron pockets, as measured by ARPES, becomes very clear and simple. By
combining ARPES measurements in different experimental configurations, we
clearly isolate each band forming one of the electron pockets. We identify a
deep electron band along one ellipse axis with the dxy orbital and a shallow
electron band along the perpendicular axis with the dxz/dyz orbitals, in good
agreement with band structure calculations. We show that the electron pockets
are warped as a function of kz as expected theoretically, but that they are
much smaller than predicted by the calculation.

related to the notion of chaos as firstly formulated by M. Kac in his study of
mean-field limit for systems of $N$ undistinguishable particles. First, we
quantitatively liken three usual measures of Kac's chaos, some involving the
all $N$ variables, other involving a finite fixed number of variables. Next, we
define the notion of entropy chaos and Fisher information chaos in a similar
way as defined by Carlen et al (KRM 2010). We show that Fisher information
chaos is stronger than entropy chaos, which in turn is stronger than Kac's
chaos. More importantly, with the help of the HWI inequality of Otto-Villani,
we establish a quantitative estimate between these quantities, which in
particular asserts that Kac's chaos plus Fisher information bound implies
entropy chaos. We then extend the above quantitative and qualitative results
about chaos in the framework of probability measures with support on the Kac's
spheres. Additionally to the above mentioned tool, we use and prove an optimal
rate local CLT in $L^\infty$ norm for distributions with finite 6-th moment and
finite $L^p$ norm, for some $p>1$. Last, we investigate how our techniques can
be used without assuming chaos, in the context of probability measures mixtures
introduced by De Finetti, Hewitt and Savage. In particular, we define the
(level 3) Fisher information for mixtures and prove that it is l.s.c. and
affine, as that was done previously for the level 3 Boltzmann's entropy.

maintained by a permanent throughput of energy. Specifically, we consider a
""particle"" as a bouncer whose oscillations are phase-locked with those of the
energy-momentum reservoir of the zero-point field (ZPF), and we combine this
with the random-walk model of the walker, again driven by the ZPF. Starting
with this classical toy model of the bouncer-walker we were able to derive
fundamental elements of quantum theory. Here this toy model is revisited with
special emphasis on the mechanism of emergence. Especially the derivation of
the total energy hbar.omega and the coupling to the ZPF are clarified. For this
we make use of a sub-quantum equipartition theorem. It can further be shown
that the couplings of both bouncer and walker to the ZPF are identical. Then we
follow this path in accordance with previous work, expanding the view from the
particle in its rest frame to a particle in motion. The basic features of
ballistic diffusion are derived, especially the diffusion constant D, thus
providing a missing link between the different approaches of our previous
works.

properties by a novel covariant formulation of the electronic partition
function. By using a rigorous variational upper bound to the free energy we are
led to the evaluation of a partition function that can be computed
stochastically by sampling electronic wave functions and atomic positions
(assumed classical). In order to achieve this target we show that it is
extremely important to consider the non trivial geometry of the space defined
by the wave function ansatz. The method can be extended to any technique
capable to provide an energy value over a given wave function ansatz depending
on several variational parameters and atomic positions. In particular we can
take into account electronic correlation, by using the standard variational
quantum Monte Carlo method, that has been so far limited to zero temperature
ground state properties. We show that our approximation reduces correctly to
the standard Born-Oppenheimer (BO) one at zero temperature and to the correct
high temperature limit. At large enough temperatures this method allows to
improve the BO, providing lower values of the electronic free energy, because
within this method it is possible to take into account the electron entropy. We
test this new method on the simple hydrogen molecule, where at low temperature
we recover the correct BO low temperature limit. Moreover, we show that the
dissociation of the molecule is possible at a temperature much smaller than the
BO prediction. Several extension of the proposed technique are also discussed,
as for instance the calculation of critical (magnetic, superconducting)
temperatures, or transition rates in chemical reactions.

inverse S-shaped filament gradually formed in the EUV filament channel. The
filament experienced two eruptions. In the first eruption, the filament rose
quickly and then the filament loops carrying the cool and the hot material were
seen to spiral into the sunspot counterclockwise. About ten minutes later, the
filament became active and finally erupted. The filament eruption was
accompanied with a C-class flare and a halo coronal mass ejection (CME). These
results provide evidence that sunspot rotation plays an important role in the
formation and eruption of the sigmoidal active-region filament.

Because of thermal fluctuations, they cannot undergo a conventional phase
transition associated to the breaking of a continuous symmetry. Nevertheless
they may exhibit a phase transition to a state with quasi-long range order via
the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism. A paradigm example is the
2D Bose fluid, such as a liquid helium film, which cannot Bose-condense at
non-zero temperature although it becomes superfluid above a critical phase
space density. Ultracold atomic gases constitute versatile systems in which the
2D quasi-long range coherence and the microscopic nature of the BKT transition
were recently explored. However, a direct observation of superfluidity in terms
of frictionless flow is still missing for these systems. Here we probe the
superfluidity of a 2D trapped Bose gas with a moving obstacle formed by a
micron-sized laser beam. We find a dramatic variation of the response of the
fluid, depending on its degree of degeneracy at the obstacle location. In
particular we do not observe any significant heating in the central, highly
degenerate region if the velocity of the obstacle is below a critical value.

performance. We study this relation in the context of the {\em Ants Nearby
Treasure Search (ANTS)} problem \cite{FKLS}, which models natural cooperative
foraging behavior such as that performed by ants around their nest. In this
problem, $k$ (probabilistic) agents, initially placed at some central location,
collectively search for a treasure on the two-dimensional grid. The treasure is
placed at a target location by an adversary and the goal is to find it as fast
as possible as a function of both $k$ and $D$, where $D$ is the (unknown)
distance between the central location and the target. It is easy to see that
$T=\Omega(D+D^2/k)$ time units are necessary for finding the treasure.
Recently, it has been established that $O(T)$ time is sufficient if the agents
know their total number $k$ (or a constant approximation of it), and enough
memory bits are available at their disposal \cite{FKLS}. In this paper, we
establish lower bounds on the agent memory size required for achieving certain
running time performances. To the best our knowledge, these bounds are the
first non-trivial lower bounds for the memory size of probabilistic searchers.
For example, for every given positive constant $\epsilon$, terminating the
search by time $O(\log^{1-\epsilon} k \cdot T)$ requires agents to use
$\Omega(\log\log k)$ memory bits. Such distributed computing bounds may provide
a novel, strong tool for the investigation of complex biological systems.

modeling plasma confined in the solar corona. Spectral models are continuously
updated to include the emission from more spectral lines, with significant
effects on radiative losses, especially around 1 MK. We investigate the effect
of changing the radiative losses temperature dependence due to upgrading of
spectral codes on predictions obtained from modeling plasma confined in the
solar corona. The hydrodynamic simulation of a pulse-heated loop strand is
revisited comparing results using an old and a recent radiative losses
function. We find significant changes in the plasma evolution during the late
phases of plasma cooling: when the recent radiative loss curve is used, the
plasma cooling rate increases significantly when temperatures reach 1-2 MK.
Such more rapid cooling occurs when the plasma density is larger than a
threshold value, and therefore in impulsive heating models that cause the loop
plasma to become overdense. The fast cooling has the effect of steepening the
slope of the emission measure distribution of coronal plasmas with temperature
at temperatures lower than ~2 MK. The effects of changes in the radiative
losses curves can be important for modeling the late phases of the evolution of
pulse-heated coronal loops, and, more in general, of thermally unstable

proposed to contribute to the generation of planetary magnetic fields. We
detect this weak secondary flow using a particle image velocimetry system

incorporating the method recently developed by Benito-Villamayor into our
framework. Although (a global version of) our algorithm only implies embedded
resolution of surfaces in the smooth ambient space of dimension 3, a classical
result known before, we introduce some new invariant which effectively measures
how much singularities are improved in the process of our algorithm and which
strictly drops after each blow up. This is in contrast to the well-known
Abhyankar-Moh pathology of the increase of the residual order under blow up and
the phenomenon of the ""Kangaroo"" points observed by Hauser.

doping in superconducting FeAs and also in charge reservoir REO layers. The
un-doped SmFeAsO is charge neutral SDW (Spin Density Wave) compound with
magnetic ordering below 150 K. The Superconducting FeAs layers are doped with
Co and Ni at Fe site, whereas REO layers are doped with F at O site. The
electron doping in SmFeAsO through Co results in superconductivity with
transition temperature (Tc) maximum up to 15 K, whereas F doping results in Tc
upto 47 K in SmFeAsO. All these REFe/Co/NiAsO/F compounds are iso-structural to
ZrCuSiAs structure. The samples are crystallized in a tetragonal structure with
space group P4/nmm. Variation of Tc with different doping routes shows the
versatility of the structure and mechanism of occurrence of superconductivity.
It seems doping in redox layer is more effective than direct doping in
superconducting FeAs layer.

are included in the deformed QRPA. In this work, we use a realistic two-body

reduce the ambiguity on the nucleon-nucleon interactions inside nuclei. We
applied our formalism to the GT transition strengths for $^{76}$Ge,
$^{76,82}$Se, and $^{90,92}\textrm{Zr}$, and compared to available experimental

as well as its sign, {\it i.e.}, oblate or prolate. The Ikeda sum rule, which
is usually thought to be satisfied under the one-body current approximation
irrespective of nucleon models, is used to test our numerical calculations and
shown to be satisfied without introducing the quenching factor, if high-lying
GT excited states are properly taken into account. Most of the GT strength

high-lying GT excited states beyond one nucleon threshold, which are shown to

galaxy even if the Ha emission line measurement is not reliable. We calculate
the LIR by integrating from 8 up to 1000 {\mu}m the SED that is best fitting
our data. We compare SFR(Ha) with the SFR(LIR). We find a very good agreement
between the two SFR estimates, with a slope of m = 1.01 \pm 0.03 in the
SFR(LIR) vs SFR(Ha) diagram, a normalization constant of a = -0.08 \pm 0.03 and
a dispersion of sigma = 0.28 dex.We study the effect of some intrinsic
properties of the galaxies in the SFR(LIR)-SFR(Ha) relation, such as the
redshift, the mass, the SSFR or the metallicity. The metallicity is the
parameter that affects most the SFR comparison. The mean ratio of the two SFR
estimators log[SFR(LIR)/SFR(Ha)] varies by approx. 0.6 dex from metal-poor to
metal-rich galaxies (8.1 < log(O/H) + 12 < 9.2). This effect is consistent with
the prediction of a theoretical model for the dust evolution in spiral
galaxies. Considering different morphological types, we find a very good
agreement between the two SFR indicators for the Sa, Sb and Sc morphologically
classified galaxies, both in slope and normalization. For the Sd, irregular
sample (Sd/Irr), the formal best-fit slope becomes much steeper (m = 1.62 \pm
0.43), but it is still consistent with 1 at the 1.5 sigma level, because of the

transformation which recasts the magnetic spin interaction under a diagonal
form. Rewriting the kinetic term in the ""rotated"" frame requires the
introduction of non-Abelian covariant derivatives, involving the gradients of
the Euler angles which define the orientation of the local field. Within the
rotated frame, we have built a perturbation scheme,assuming that the
longitudinal non-Abelian field component dominates the transverse ones, to be
evaluated to second-order. The geometry embedded in the longitudinal gauge
vector field and its curl, the geometric magnetic field, is described by the
associated Aharonov-Bohm phase. As an illustration, we study the physics of
cold 171Yb atoms dressed by two sets of circularly polarized beams, forming
square or triangular 2D optical lattices. The geometric field is computed
explicitly from the Euler angles. The magnitude of 2nd-order corrections due to
transverse fields can be reduced to the percent level by a choice of light
intensity which keeps the dressed atom loss rate below 5 s^{-1}. An auxiliary
optical lattice confines the atoms within 2D domains where the geometric field

meV lower in energy than the one of helical spin-structure. A detailed analysis
revealed that the uniaxial on-site anisotropy of the central atom is mainly
responsible to this energy difference. This high uniaxial anisotropy energy is
accompanied by a huge enhancement and anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moment
of the central atom. By varying the magnetic orientation at the central atom,
we identified the term related to exchange couplings (Weiss-field term),
various on-site anisotropy terms, and also those due to higher order

pathway for translocation of a polymer chain through a lipid bilayer. We
consider a polymer chain composed of repeat units with a given hydrophobicity
and a coarse-grained model of a lipid bilayer in the self-organized liquid
state. By varying the degree of hydrophobicity the chain undergoes an
adsorption transition with respect to the lipid bilayer. Close to the
transition point, at a properly balanced hydrophobicity of the chain, the
membrane becomes transparent with respect to the chain. At the same time the
solvent permeability of the bilayer is strongly increased in the region close

of the polymer chain interacting with the fluctuating lipid bilayer could play
a key role for the translocation of molecules though biological membranes.

come from the small Stark splitting of an atomic Rydberg level, which lifts the

controlled by the external electric field. We discuss two different geometries

law lacks physical basis. This paper reviews the orthodox, or Dirac-von Neumann
interpretation, and makes explicit that Hilbert space describes propositions
about measurement results. Kets are defined as conditional clauses referring to
measurements in a formal language. It is seen that these clauses are elements
of a Hilbert space, such that addition is logical disjunction, the dual space
consists of consequent clauses, and the inner product is a set of statements in
the subjunctive mood. The probability interpretation gives truth values for
corresponding future tense statements when the initial state is actually
prepared and the final state is to be measured. The mathematical structure of
quantum mechanics is formulated in terms of discrete measurement results at
finite level of accuracy and does not depend on an assumption of a substantive,
or background, space-time continuum. A continuum of kets, |x> for x in R^3, is
constructed from linear combinations of kets in a finite basis. The inner
product can be expressed either as a finite sum or as an integral. Discrete
position functions are uniquely embedded into smooth wave functions in such a
way that differential operators are defined. It is shown that the choice of
basis has no effect on underlying physics (quantum covariance). The Dirac delta
has a representation as a smooth function. Operators do not in general have an
integral form. The Schroedinger equation is shown from the requirements of the
probability interpretation. It is remarked that a formal construction of qed
avoiding divergence problems has been completed using finite dimensional
Hilbert space. I conclude that quantum mechanics makes statements about the

heating for each particle species, in which the energy input is assumed to come
from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We first created an empirical
description of the radial evolution of Alfven, fast-mode, and slow-mode MHD
waves. This model provides the total wave power in each mode as a function of
distance along an expanding flux tube in the high-speed solar wind. Next we
solved a set of cascade advection-diffusion equations that give the time-steady
wavenumber spectra at each distance. An approximate term for nonlinear coupling
between the Alfven and fast-mode fluctuations is included. For reasonable
choices of the parameters, our model contains enough energy transfer from the
fast mode to the Alfven mode to excite the high-frequency ion cyclotron
resonance. This resonance is efficient at heating protons and other ions in the
direction perpendicular to the background magnetic field, and our model
predicts heating rates for these species that agree well with both
spectroscopic and in situ measurements. Nonetheless, the high-frequency waves
comprise only a small part of the total Alfvenic fluctuation spectrum, which
remains highly two-dimensional as is observed in interplanetary space.

comparatively studied. This synergy of observations and theory distinguishes
the program, and should lead to fundamental discoveries regarding the sources
of deviations from the expansion of the universe. Specifically, the program

radioactive beams, there has been a renew interest in the investigation of
nuclear reactions with heavy ions. I first present the role of inelastic and
transfer channel couplings in fusion reactions induced by stable heavy ions.
Analysis of experimental fusion cross sections by using standard
coupled-channel calculations is discussed. The role of multi-neutron transfer
is investigated in the fusion process below the Coulomb barrier by analyzing
$^{32}$S+$^{90,96}$Zr as benchmark reactions. The enhancement of fusion cross
sections for $^{32}$S+$^{96}$Zr is well reproduced at sub-barrier energies by
NTFus code calculations including the coupling of the neutron-transfer channels
following the Zagrebaev semi-classical model. Similar effects for
$^{40}$Ca+$^{90}$Zr and $^{40}$Ca+$^{96}$Zr fusion excitation functions are
found. The breakup coupling in both the elastic scattering and in the fusion
process induced by weakly bound stable projectiles is also shown to be crucial.
In this lecture, full coupled-channel calculations of the fusion excitation
functions are performed by using the breakup coupling for the more neutron-rich
reaction and for the more weakly bound projectiles. I clearly demonstrate that
Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channel calculations are capable to reproduce the
fusion enhancement from the breakup coupling in $^{6}$Li+$^{59}$Co.

on charge multiplicity asymmetry correlations in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV

CME alone. To gain further insights, we study our results as a function of the
measured azimuthal angle range as well as the event-by-event anisotropy
parameter $v_2$. The results indicate that the charge separation effect appears
to be in-plane rather than out-of-plane. We found that the charge separation
effect is proportional to the event-by-event $v_2$ and consistent with zero in
events with $v_2 \approx 0$. Our studies suggest that the charge separation
effect, within the statistical error, may be a net effect of event anisotropy
and correlated particle production. Possible upper limit on the CME imposed by

and Spitzer data allows us to identify a total of 210 cluster member candidates
with masses in the interval 0.25-0.004Msun, 23 of which are new planetary-mass
object findings. These discoveries double the number of cluster planetary-mass
candidates known so far. One object has colors compatible with a T spectral
type. The cluster harbors about as many brown dwarfs (69, 0.072-0.012Msun) and
planetary-mass objects (37, 0.012-0.004Msun) as very low-mass stars (104,
0.25-0.072Msun). Based on Spitzer data, we derive a disk frequency of ~40% for
very low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary mass objects in sigma Orionis.
The radial density distributions of these three mass intervals are alike: all
are spatially concentrated within an effective radius of 12arcmin (1.2pc)
around the multiple star sigma Ori, and no obvious segregation between
disk-bearing and diskless objects is observed. Using the VISTA data and the
Mayrit catalog, we derive the cluster mass spectrum (DeltaN/DeltaM ~
M^{-alpha}) from ~19 to 0.006Msun (VISTA ZJ completeness), which is reasonably
described by two power-law expressions with indices of alpha=1.7+/-0.2 for

smoothly extends into the planetary-mass regime down to 0.004Msun. Our findings
of T-type sources (<0.004Msun) in the VISTA sigma Orionis exploration appear to
be smaller than what is predicted by the extrapolation of the cluster mass

vortex DW, and an antivortex DW) and periodic vortex-core reversals in a
circular magnetic dot which are accompanied by oscillatory displacements of the
vortex from the dot center. In nanostructures of smaller thicknesses
(comparable to the exchange length), where nonlocal magnetostatic effects are
very strong because of fast spatial variation of the magnetization, similar
phenomena have been widely studied previously. Here, the dynamics is
investigated within a local approach including magnetostatic field via boundary
conditions on solutions to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation only. Both the
DWs in stripes and vortex states of the dot are treated as fragments of a
cross-tie DW. Despite similarity of the cyclic transformations of the ordering
to the dynamics of more strongly confined nanomagnets, details of motion
(trajectories) of the vortices and antivortices (Bloch lines) of the textures
under study are different, which is related to prohibition of rapid jumps of
the polarization of Bloch lines. In addition to the magnetization rotation
about the direction of magnetic field or current polarization, the evolution of

requirements. The image is encoded as a set of contractive affine
transformations. The image is partitioned into non-overlapping range blocks,
and a best matching domain block larger than the range block is identified.
There are many attempts on improving the encoding time by reducing the size of
search pool for range-domain matching. But these methods are attempting to
prepare a static domain pool that remains unchanged throughout the encoding
process. This paper proposes dynamic preparation of separate domain pool for
each range block. This will result in significant reduction in the encoding
time. The domain pool for a particular range block can be selected based upon a
parametric value. Here we use classification based on local fractal dimension.
