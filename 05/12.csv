astronomical data publication. However, the number of radio astronomical
archives is still low in general, and even lower is the number of radio
astronomical data available through the VO. In order to facilitate the building
of new radio astronomical archives, easing at the same time their
interoperability with VO framework, we have developed a VO-compliant data model
which provides interoperable data semantics for radio data. That model, which
we call the Radio Astronomical DAta Model for Single-dish (RADAMS) has been
built using standards of (and recommendations from) the International Virtual
Observatory Alliance (IVOA). This article describes the RADAMS and its
components, including archived entities and their relationships to VO metadata.
We show that by using IVOA principles and concepts, the effort needed for both
the development of the archives and their VO compatibility has been lowered,
and the joint development of two radio astronomical archives have been
possible. We plan to adapt RADAMS to be able to deal with interferometry data
in the future.

acetylation and H3K79 methylation, and explores whether the presence of
multiple marks lead to a qualitatively different systems behavior. We find that
having both modifications is important for the robustness of epigenetic
silencing. Besides the silenced and transcriptionally active fate of chromatin,
our model leads to a novel state with bivalent (i.e., both active and
silencing) marks under certain perturbations (knock-out mutations, inhibition
or enhancement of enzymatic activity). The bivalent state appears under several
perturbations and is shown to result in patchy silencing. We also show that the
titration effect, owing to a limited supply of silencing proteins, can result
in counter-intuitive responses. The design principles of the silencing system
is systematically investigated and disparate experimental observations are
assessed within a single theoretical framework. Specifically, we discuss the
behavior of Sir protein recruitment, spreading and stability of silenced

interpretational tool to understand phenomena of energy localization in the FPU
space of linear normal modes. In the present paper i) we employ the method of
Poincare - Lindstedt series, for a fixed set of frequencies, in order to
compute an explicit quasi-periodic representation of the trajectories lying on
q-tori in the alpha model, and ii) we consider more general types of initial
excitations in both the alpha and beta models. Furthermore we turn into
questions of physical interest related to the dynamical features of the q-tori.
We focus on particular q-tori solutions describing low-frequency `packets' of
modes, and excitations of a small set of modes with an arbitrary distribution
in q-space. In the former case, we find formulae yielding an exponential
profile of energy localization, following an analysis of the size of the
leading order terms in the Poincare - Lindstedt series. In the latter case, we
explain the observed localization patterns on the basis of a rigorous result

much attention, the properties of the close-knit friendship structures remain
an important question. Here, we mainly focus on how these mesoscale structures
are affected by the local and global structural properties. Analyzing the data
of four large-scale online social networks reveals several common structural
properties. It is found that not only the local structures given by the
indegree, outdegree, and reciprocal degree distributions follow a similar
scaling behavior, the mesoscale structures represented by the distributions of
close-knit friendship structures also exhibit a similar scaling law. The degree
correlation is very weak over a wide range of the degrees. We propose a simple
directed network model that captures the observed properties. The model
incorporates two mechanisms: reciprocation and preferential attachment. Through
rate equation analysis of our model, the local-scale and mesoscale structural
properties are derived. In the local-scale, the same scaling behavior of
indegree and outdegree distributions stems from indegree and outdegree of nodes
both growing as the same function of the introduction time, and the reciprocal
degree distribution also shows the same power-law due to the linear
relationship between the reciprocal degree and in/outdegree of nodes. In the
mesoscale, the distributions of four closed triples representing close-knit
friendship structures are found to exhibit identical power-laws, a behavior
attributed to the negligible degree correlations. Intriguingly, all the
power-law exponents of the distributions in the local-scale and mesoscale
depend only on one global parameter -- the mean in/outdegree, while both the
mean in/outdegree and the reciprocity together determine the ratio of the
reciprocal degree of a node to its in/outdegree.

tensor of size $I_1\times I_N$ with rank $R$, the algorithm is computationally
demanding due to construction of large approximate Hessian of size $(RT \times
RT)$ and its inversion where $T = \sum_n I_n$. In this paper, we propose a fast
implementation of the dGN algorithm which is based on novel expressions of the
inverse approximate Hessian in block form. The new implementation has lower
computational complexity, besides computation of the gradient (this part is
common to both methods), requiring the inversion of a matrix of size
$NR^2\times NR^2$, which is much smaller than the whole approximate Hessian, if
$T \gg NR$. In addition, the implementation has lower memory requirements,
because neither the Hessian nor its inverse never need to be stored in their

proposed as well. Complexity and performance of the proposed algorithm is
compared with those of dGN and ALS with line search on examples of difficult

quantization of gravity would be feasible, and some problems of Quantum Field
Theory would go away if, somehow, the spacetime would undergo a dimensional
reduction at high energy scales. But an identification of the deep mechanism
causing this dimensional reduction would still be desirable. The main
contribution of this article is to show that dimensional reduction effects are
due to General Relativity at singularities, and do not need to be postulated
ad-hoc.
  Recent advances in understanding the geometry of singularities do not require
modification of General Relativity, being just non-singular extensions of its
mathematics to the limit cases. They turn out to work fine for some known types
of cosmological singularities (black holes and FLRW Big-Bang), allowing a
choice of the fundamental geometric invariants and physical quantities which
remain regular. The resulting equations are equivalent to the standard ones
outside the singularities.
  One consequence of this mathematical approach to the singularities in General
Relativity is a special, (geo)metric type of dimensional reduction: at
singularities, the metric tensor becomes degenerate in certain spacetime
directions, and some properties of the fields become independent of those
directions. Effectively, it is like one or more dimensions of spacetime just
vanish at singularities. This suggests that it is worth exploring the
possibility that the geometry of singularities leads naturally to the
spontaneous dimensional reduction needed by Quantum Gravity.

intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in valence bands and does not rely on the Rashba
or Dresselhaus effect. The light-spin current interaction results in an optical
birefringence effect of the spin current. The symmetry analysis indicates that
in a semiconductor with inversion symmetry, the linear birefringence effect
vanishes and only the circular birefringence effect exists. The circular
birefringence effect is similar to the Faraday rotation in magneto-optics but
involves no net magnetization nor breaking the time-reversal symmetry.
Moreover, a spin current can induce the second-order nonlinear optical

of measuring a pure spin current where and when it flows with the standard

granularity of the electron bunch density originating from shot noise is
maintained throughout the analysis. Three-dimensional effects like transverse
emittance and diffraction are taken into account in simulations via an
effective FEL parameter calculated from Xie's fitting formula. Calculations are
performed for an FEL model with the SwissFEL injector bunch parameters. It
turns out that a reduction of noise by several orders of magnitude below the
level of shot noise is required to mitigate the noise effect. We propose a
novel scheme that allows for formation of electron bunches with a reduced level
of noise and a high gradient of the current at the bunch tail to enhance
coherent spontaneous emission. The presented scheme uses effects of noise
reduction and controlled microbunching instability and consists of a laser
heater, a shot noise suppression section as well as a bunch compressor. The

exerted by measurements alone. Sophisticated quantum control is now available
in several experimental systems, exposing discrepancies between quantum and

interrogated system. In practice, such discrepancies may frequently be
explained as the back-action required by quantum mechanics adding quantum noise
to a classical signal. Here we implement the 'three-box' quantum game of
Aharonov and Vaidman in which quantum measurements add no detectable noise to a
classical signal, by utilising state-of-the-art control and measurement of the
nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond.
  Quantum and classical mechanics then make contradictory predictions for the
same experimental procedure, however classical observers cannot invoke
measurement-induced disturbance to explain this discrepancy. We quantify the
residual disturbance of our measurements and obtain data that rule out any
classical model by > 7.8 standard deviations, allowing us for the first time to
exclude the property of macroscopic state-definiteness from our system. Our

Hereby the algorithm becomes protected against position dependent effects as
caused by spontaneously broken translational invariance. So far, these have
been a major obstacle to convergence for the iMPS algorithm if no prior
knowledge of the systems translational symmetry was accessible. Further, we
investigate some more general methods to speed up calculations and improve
convergence, which might be partially interesting in a much broader context,
too. As a more special problem, we also look into translational invariant
states close to an invariance braking phase transition and show how to avoid
convergence into wrong local minima for such systems. Finally, we apply the new
methods to polar bosons with long-range interactions. We calculate several
detailed Devil's Staircases with the corresponding phase diagrams and
investigate some supersolid properties.

a relay is considered. The relay is contracted to forward the symbols that it
receives back to the sources in the amplify-and-forward manner. However there
is a chance that the relay may send altered symbols back to the sources. Each
source attempts to individually detect such malicious acts of the relay by
comparing the empirical distribution of the symbols that it receives from the
relay conditioned on its own transmitted symbols with known stochastic
characteristics of the channel. It is shown that maliciousness of the relay can
be asymptotically detected with sufficient channel observations if and only if
the channel satisfies a non-manipulable condition, which can be easily checked.
As a result, the non-manipulable condition provides us a clear-cut criterion to
determine the detectability of the aforementioned class of symbol manipulation
attacks potentially conducted by the relay.

Wiener chaoses. Assume further that it converges in distribution towards
$F_\infty$ satisfying ${\rm Var}(F_\infty)>0$. Our first result is a sequential
version of a theorem by Shigekawa (1980). More precisely, we prove, without
additional assumptions, that the sequence ${F_n}$ actually converges in total
variation and that the law of $F_\infty$ is absolutely continuous. We give an
application to discrete non-Gaussian chaoses. In a second part, we assume that
each $F_n$ has more specifically the form of a multiple Wiener-It\^o integral
(of a fixed order) and that it converges in $L^2(\Omega)$ towards $F_\infty$.
We then give an upper bound for the distance in total variation between the
laws of $F_n$ and $F_\infty$. As such, we recover an inequality due to Davydov
and Martynova (1987); our rate is weaker compared to Davydov and Martynova
(1987) (by a power of 1/2), but the advantage is that our proof is not only
sketched as in Davydov and Martynova (1987). Finally, in a third part we show
that the convergence in the celebrated Peccati-Tudor theorem actually holds in
the total variation topology.

thorough understanding of the effects of different population densities is
therefore crucial. Here we study the evolution of cooperation in social
dilemmas on different interaction graphs with a certain fraction of vacant
nodes. We find that sparsity may favor the resolution of social dilemmas,
especially if the population density is close to the percolation threshold of
the underlying graph. Regardless of the type of the governing social dilemma as
well as particularities of the interaction graph, we show that under pairwise
imitation the percolation threshold is a universal indicator of how dense the
occupancy ought to be for cooperation to be optimally promoted. We also
demonstrate that myopic updating, due to the lack of efficient spread of
information via imitation, renders the reported mechanism dysfunctional, which
in turn further strengthens its foundations.

a second monochromatic photon peak at 114 GeV due to XX-> gamma Z. The S is
colored under a hidden sector SU(N) or QCD to help boost the XX -> gamma gamma

naturally increase the partial width for h -> gamma gamma by an amount
comparable to its standard model value, as suggested by recent measurements
from CMS. Due to the hidden sector SU(N) (or QCD), S binds to its antiparticle
to form S-mesons, which will be pair-produced in colliders and then decay
predominantly to XX, hh, or to glueballs of the SU(N) which subsequently decay
to photons. The cross section for X on nucleons is close to the Xenon100 upper

show that an energy-driven outflow model in which the wind velocity decreases

observations, can produce a good match to the low-mass end of the observed
galaxy stellar mass function. The high-mass end can be recovered simultaneously
if feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a correction for diffuse
stellar light plausibly missed in observations are included. At the same time,
our model is in good agreement with the stellar mass functions at redshifts z=1

rate density. In addition, it accurately reproduces the observed gas to stellar
mass ratios and specific star formation rates of galaxies as a function of
their stellar mass. This agreement with a diverse set of data marks significant
progress in hydrodynamically modelling the formation of a representative galaxy

strongly increase towards low-mass galaxies. Without this assumption, an
overproduction of galaxies at the faint-end of the galaxy luminosity function

correlated with galaxies only because they lie in the same over-dense LSS, and
(3) associated with under-dense LSS with a very low auto-correlation amplitude

on small scales in the f(R) models compared to GR at redshifts z<1. We measure
the velocity divergence (P_\theta \theta) and matter (P_\delta \delta) power

0.03<k/(h/Mpc)<0.5. In linear theory these ratios equal the growth rate of

with the growth rate for each cosmology (which is scale dependent in the case
of modified gravity) only for extremely large scales, k<0.06h/Mpc at z=0. The
velocity power spectrum is substantially different in the f(R) models compared

from the 2D redshift space power spectrum, P(k,\mu), and can recover the
nonlinear matter power spectrum to within a few percent for k<0.1h/Mpc.
However, the model fails to describe the shape of the 2D power spectrum

creating and dispersing metals. We introduce a method to measure the number of
SNe and relative contribution of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and core-collapse
supernovae (SNe cc) by directly fitting X-ray spectral observations. The method
has been implemented as an XSPEC model called snapec. snapec utilizes a single
temperature thermal plasma code (apec) to model the spectral emission based on
metal abundances calculated using the latest SN yields from SN Ia and SN cc
explosion models. This approach provides a self-consistent single set of
uncertainties on the total number of SN explosions and relative fraction of SN
types in the ICM over the cluster lifetime by directly allowing these
parameters to be determined by SN yields provided by simulations. We apply our
approach to the XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC), Reflection
Grating Spectrometer (RGS), and 200 ks simulated Astro-H observations of a
cooling flow cluster, A3112. We find that various sets of SN yields present in
the literature produce an acceptable fit to the EPIC and RGS spectra of A3112.
We infer that 30.3% +/- 5.4% of the total SN explosions are SNe Ia, and the
total number of SN explosions required to create the observed metals is in the
order of (1.06 +/- 0.34)*10^{9}, from snapec fits to RGS spectra. These values
may be compared to the enrichment expected based on well-established
empirically-measured SN rates per star formed. The proportions of SNe Ia and
SNe cc inferred to have enriched the ICM in the inner 52 kpc of A3112 is
consistent with these specific rates, if one applies a correction for the
metals locked up in stars. At the same time, the inferred level of SN
enrichment corresponds to a star-to-gas mass ratio that is several times
greater than the 10% estimated globally for clusters in the A3112 mass range.

a competition between the dispersive effects which stem from the leading-order

spatial derivatives. We show that the dispersive effects can dominate the
backwards diffusion: we find a condition which guarantees well-posedness of the
initial value problem for linear, variable coefficient equations of this kind,
even when such anti-diffusion is present. In fact, we show that even in the
presence of localized backwards diffusion, the dispersion will in some cases
lead to an overall effect of parabolic smoothing. By contrast, we also show
that when our condition is violated, the backwards diffusion can dominate the
dispersive effects, leading to an ill-posed initial value problem. We use these
results on linear evolution equations as a guide when proving well-posedness of
the initial value problem for some quasilinear equations which also exhibit
this competition between dispersion and anti-diffusion: a Rosenau-Hyman
compacton equation, the Harry Dym equation, and equations which arise in the
numerical analysis of finite difference schemes for dispersive equations. For
these quasilinear equations, the well-posedness theorem requires that the
initial data be uniformly bounded away from zero.

basis of a stochastic process that involves the statistics of both the particle
velocity and local compressibility along particle trajectories. The PDF
equation gives rise to contributions to both the drift and particle diffusion
coefficient that depend upon the correlation of these quantities with the local
carrier flow velocity. Key Words: turbulent structures, particle dispersion,
drift, PDF approach

populations in nineteen nearby starburst dwarf galaxies observed with the
Hubble Space Telescope, we measure the stellar mass surface densities of stars
newly formed in the bursts. By assuming a star formation efficiency (SFE), we
then calculate the inferred gas surface densities present at the onset of the
starbursts. Assuming a SFE of 1%, as is often assumed in normal star-forming
galaxies, and assuming that the gas was purely atomic, translates to very high
HI surface densities (~10^2-10^3 Msun pc^-2), which are much higher than have
been observed in dwarf galaxies. This implies either higher values of SFE in
these dwarf starburst galaxies or the presence of significant amounts of H_2 in
dwarfs (or both). Raising the assumed SFEs to 10% or greater (in line with
observations of more massive starbursts associated with merging galaxies),
still results in HI surface densities higher than observed in 10 galaxies.
Thus, these observations appear to require that a significant fraction of the
gas in these dwarf starbursts galaxies was in the molecular form at the onset
of the bursts. Our results imply molecular gas column densities in the range
10^19-10^21 cm^-2 for the sample. In those galaxies where CO observations have
been made, these densities correspond to values of the CO-H_2 conversion factor
(X_CO) in the range >3-80x10^20 cm^-2 (K km s^-1)^-1, or up to 40x greater than
Galactic X_CO values.

  Noncommutative Partial Differential Equations","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:0909.4884",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solutions to Laplace's equation are called harmonic functions. Harmonic
functions arise in many applications, such as physics and the theory of
stochastic processes. Of interest classically are harmonic polynomials, which
have a simple classification. Further, the work of Reznick, building on the
work of others, namely Sylvester, Clifford, Rosanes, Gundelfinger, Cartan,
Maass and Helgason, has led to a classification of all polynomial solutions to
a differential equation of arising from a homogeneous polynomial over an
algebraically closed field.
  The definition of harmonicity can be extended to the space of polynomials in
free variables using the concept of a noncommutative Laplacian. Given a
positive integer $\ell$, the $\ell$-Laplacian of a noncommutative (abbreviated
NC) polynomial $p$ in the direction $h$ is defined to be $$ \lap_{\ell}[p,h] :=
\sum_{i=1}^g \frac{d^{\ell}}{dt^{\ell}} p(x_1,..., x_i + th,..., x_g).$$ A NC
polynomial $p$ is said to be $\ell$-harmonic if $\lap_{\ell}[p,h] = 0$. When
$\ell = 2$, then the $\ell$-Laplacian is simply called the Laplacian and a
$\ell$-harmonic NC polynomial is simply called harmonic. More generally, the
concept of a constant coefficient differential equation can be extended to the
space of NC polynomials via the NC directional derivative.
  The main contribution of this paper is to classify the set of $\ell$-harmonic
NC polynomials. The result is analogous to the classification of polynomial
solutions to a differential equation of the form $q(\partial/\partial x_1, ...,
\partial/\partial x_g)y = 0$ given by Reznick. Additionally, this thesis proves
new results about NC ""subharmonic"" polynomials.
  This work extends results of Helton, McAllaster, and Hernandez on NC harmonic
and subharmonic polynomials, which classified solutions for the $\ell = 2$ case
in two noncommuting variables $x_1$ and $x_2$.

have recently examined a number of factors that affect information diffusion in
online social networks, including: the novelty of information, users' activity
levels, who they pay attention to, and how they respond to friends'
recommendations. Using URLs as markers of information, we carry out a detailed
study of retweeting, the primary mechanism by which information spreads on the
Twitter follower graph. Our empirical study examines how users respond to an
incoming stimulus, i.e., a tweet (message) from a friend, and reveals that
%retweeting behavior is constrained by a few simple principles. the ""principle
of least effort"" combined with limited attention plays a dominant role in
retweeting behavior. Specifically, we observe that users retweet information
when it is most visible, such as when it near the top of their Twitter stream.
Moreover, our measurements quantify how a user's limited attention is divided
among incoming tweets, providing novel evidence that highly connected
individuals are less likely to propagate an arbitrary tweet. Our study
indicates that the finite ability to process incoming information constrains
social contagion, and we conclude that rapid decay of visibility is the primary
barrier to information propagation online.

conjugate prior for precision matrices satisfying general GGM constraints, has
now been in existence for over a decade. However, due to the lack of a direct
sampler, its use has been limited in hierarchical Bayesian contexts, relegating
mixing over the class of GGMs mostly to situations involving standard Gaussian
likelihoods. Recent work, however, has developed methods that couple model and
parameter moves, first through reversible jump methods and later by direct
evaluation of conditional Bayes factors and subsequent resampling. Further,
methods for avoiding prior normalizing constant calculations--a serious
bottleneck and source of numerical instability--have been proposed. We review
and clarify these developments and then propose a new methodology for GGM
comparison that blends many recent themes. Theoretical developments and
computational timing experiments reveal an algorithm that has limited
computational demands and dramatically improves on computing times of existing
methods. We conclude by developing a parsimonious multivariate stochastic
volatility model that embeds GGM uncertainty in a larger hierarchical
framework. The method is shown to be capable of adapting to the extreme swings
in market volatility experienced in 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers,
offering considerable improvement in posterior predictive distribution
calibration.

propose a general weighted directed graph framework for investigating
properties of a large class of quantum states which are defined by three types
of Laplacian matrices associated with such graphs. We generalize the standard
framework of defining density matrices from simple connected graphs to density
matrices using both combinatorial and signless Laplacian matrices associated
with weighted directed graphs with complex edge weights and with/without
self-loops. We also introduce a new notion of Laplacian matrix, which we call
signed Laplacian matrix associated with such graphs. We produce necessary
and/or sufficient conditions for such graphs to correspond to pure and mixed
quantum states. Using these criteria, we finally determine the graphs whose
corresponding density matrices represent entangled pure states which are well
known and important for quantum computation applications. We observe that all
these entangled pure states share a common combinatorial structure.

in the setting when the completeness-soundness gap is small. Small means that
we only lower-bound the gap with an inverse-exponential function of the input
length, or with an even smaller function. Using the protocol of Blier and Tapp
[arXiv:0709.0738], we show that in this case the proof system has the same
expressive power as non-deterministic exponential time (NEXP). Since
single-proof QMA proof systems, with the same bound on the gap, have expressive
power at most exponential time (EXP), we get a separation between single and
multi-prover proof systems in the 'small-gap setting', under the assumption
that EXP is not equal to NEXP. This implies, among others, the nonexistence of
certain operators called disentanglers (defined by Aaronson et al.
[arXiv:0804.0802]), with good approximation parameters.
  We also show that in this setting the proof system has the same expressive
power if we restrict the verifier to be able to perform only Bell-measurements,
i.e., using a BellQMA verifier. This is not known to hold in the usual setting,
when the gap is bounded by an inverse-polynomial function of the input length.
To show this we use the protocol of Chen and Drucker [arXiv:1011.0716]. The
only caveat here is that we need at least a linear amount of proofs to achieve
the power of NEXP, while in the previous setting two proofs were enough.
  We also study the case when the proof-lengths are only logarithmic in the
input length and observe that in some cases the expressive power decreases.
However, we show that it doesn't decrease further if we make the proof lengths

variances. Their BH masses are estimated to be 1.1-6.6x10^6 M_solar by using a
correlation between excess variance and BH mass. Seven sources have estimated
BH masses smaller than 2x10^6 M_solar, which are in the range for
intermediate-mass black holes. Eddington ratios of sources with known redshifts
range from 0.07 to 0.46 and the mean Eddington ratio is 0.24. These results
imply that some of our sources are growing supermassive black holes, which are
expected to have relatively low masses with high Eddington ratios. X-ray photon
indices of the 15 sources are in the range of ~0.57-2.57, and 5 among them have
steep (>2) photon indices, which are the range for narrow-line Seyfert 1s. Soft
X-ray excess is seen in 12 sources, and is expressed by a blackbody model with
kT~83-294 eV. We derive a correlation between X-ray photon indices and
Eddington ratios, and find that the X-ray photon indices of about a half of our

disk-dominated state. This object was found in the second XMM serendipitous
source catalogue as a highly variable X-ray source. In three separate
observations, its X-ray spectrum can be represented either by a multicolor disk
blackbody model with an inner temperature of kT_in~0.16-0.21 keV or a Wien
spectrum Comptonized by an optically thick plasma with kT~0.14-0.18 keV. The
soft X-ray luminosity in the 0.5--2 keV band is estimated to be (1.6-3.8)x10^42
erg/s. Hard emission above ~2 keV is not detected. The ratio of the soft to
hard emission is the strongest among AGNs observed thus far. Spectra selected
in high/low flux time intervals are examined in order to study spectral
variability. In the second observation with the highest signal-to-noise ratio,
the low energy (below 0.7 keV) spectral regime flattens when the flux is high,
while the shape of the high energy part (1-1.7 keV) remains unchanged. This
behavior is qualitatively consistent with being caused by strong
Comptonization. Both the strong soft excess and spectral change consistent with

that is not solely topological, relying on both the distribution of sources and

relevant cases by simulation. For certain parameter values, a picture emerges
of two regimes. The first occurs when the flows go from many sources to a small
number of sinks. In this case, network utility is largest when the coupling is
at its maximum and the average shortest path is minimized. The second regime
arises when many sources correspond to many sinks. Here, the optimal coupling
no longer corresponds to the minimum average shortest path, as the congestion
of traffic must also be taken into account. More generally, results indicate
that coupled spatial systems can give rise to behavior that relies subtly on
the interplay between the coupling and randomness in the source-sink

components involved in the system is very large. Estimating dynamic networks is
an important task because they compromise valuable information about
interactions among genes. Graphical models are a powerful class of models to
estimate conditional independence among random variables, e.g. interactions in
dynamic systems. Indeed, these interactions tend to vary over time. However,
the literature has been focused on static networks, which can only reveal
overall structures. Time-course experiments are performed in order to tease out
significant changes in networks. It is typically reasonable to assume that
changes in genomic networks are few because systems in biology tend to be
stable. We introduce a new model for estimating slowly changes in dynamic
gene-regulatory networks which is suitable for a high-dimensional dataset, e.g.
time-course genomic data. Our method is based on i) the penalized likelihood
with $\ell_1$-norm, ii) the penalized differences between conditional
independence elements across time points and iii) the heuristic search strategy
to find optimal smoothing parameters. We implement a set of linear constraints
necessary to estimate sparse graphs and penalized changing in dynamic networks.
These constraints are not in the linear form. For this reason, we introduce
slack variables to re-write our problem into a standard convex optimization
problem subject to equality linear constraints. We show that GL$_\Delta$
performs well in a simulation study. Finally, we apply the proposed model to a
time-course genetic dataset T-cell.

time of arrival in quantum systems. The time of arrival is identified with the
time instant when a transition in the detector's degrees of freedom takes
place. Thus, its definition is embedded within the larger issue of defining
probabilities with respect to time for general quantum transitions. The key
point in our analysis is that we manage to reduce the problem of defining a
quantum time observable to a mathematical model where time is associated to a
transition from a subspace of the Hilbert space of the total system to its
complementary subspace. This property makes it possible to derive a general
expression for the probability for the time of transition, valid for any
quantum system, with the only requirement that the time of transition is
correlated with a definite macroscopic record.
  The framework developed here allows for the consideration of any experimental
configuration for the measurement of the time of arrival and it also applies to
relativistic systems with interactions described by quantum field theory. We
use the method in order to describe time-of-arrival measurements in high-energy
particle reactions and for a rigorous derivation of the time-integrated

recovered. A graphical language based on the notion of collision history
originally introduced by Spohn is developed, as a useful tool for the
description of the expansion and of the elimination of degrees of freedom.

using the 3D bispectrum of Ly-alpha forest. The strength of the quadratic
non-Gaussian correction to an otherwise Gaussian primordial gravitational field
is assumed to be dictated by a single parameter fnl. We present the first
prediction for bounds on fnl using Ly-alpha flux spectra along multiple lines
of sight. The 3D Ly-$\alpha$ transmitted flux field is modeled as a biased
tracer of the underlying matter distribution sampled along 1D skewers
corresponding to quasars sight lines. The precision to which fnl can be
constrained depends on the survey volume, pixel noise and aliasing noise
(arising from discrete sampling of the density field). We consider various
combinations of these factors to predict bounds on fnl. We find that in an
idealized situation of full sky survey and negligible Poisson noise one may
constrain fnl ~ 23 in the equilateral limit. Assuming a Ly-alpha survey
covering large parts of the sky (k_{min} = 8 * 10^{-4} Mpc^{-1}) and with a
quasar density of \bar n = 5 * 10^{-3} Mpc^{-2} it is possible to constrain fnl
~ 100 for equilateral configurations. The possibility of measuring fnl at a
precision comparable to LSS studies maybe useful for joint constraining of
inflationary scenarios using different data sets.

of imaginary-time Green's functions, we develop an alternate representation for
the Green's functions of quantum impurity models and combine it with the
hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver.
This representation is based on the kernel polynomial method, which introduces
various integral kernels to filter fluctuations caused by the explicit
truncations of polynomial expansion series and improve the computational
precision significantly. As an illustration of the new representation, we
reexamine the imaginary-time Green's functions of single-band Hubbard model in
the framework of dynamical mean-field theory. The calculated results suggest
that with carefully chosen integral kernels the Gibbs oscillations found in
previous orthogonal polynomial representation have been suppressed vastly and
remarkable corrections to the measured Green's functions have been obtained.

time dynamical systems. These two quantities are used to explore the behavior
of the global error induced by round off in the computation of orbits. The
similarity of results found for any system we have analysed suggests the use of
the reversibility error, whose computation is straightforward since it does not
require the knowledge of the exact orbit, as a dynamical indicator. The
statistics of fluctuations induced by round off for an ensemble of initial
conditions has been compared with the results obtained in the case of random
perturbations. Significant differences are observed in the case of regular
orbits due to the correlations of round off error, whereas the results obtained
for the chaotic case are nearly the same. Both the reversibility error and the
orbit divergence computed for the same number of iterations on the whole phase
space provide an insight on the local dynamical properties with a detail
comparable with other dynamical indicators based on variational methods such as
the finite time maximum Lyapunov characteristic exponent, the mean exponential
growth factor of nearby orbits and the smaller alignment index. For 2D
symplectic maps the differentiation between regular and chaotic regions is well
full-filled. For 4D symplectic maps the structure of the resonance web as well
as the nearby weakly chaotic regions are accurately described.
