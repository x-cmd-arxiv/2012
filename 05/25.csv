the vertices with r vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles. So far, this
conjecture has been proven only for r = 2. In this paper we show that in fact
this conjecture is false for all r > 2. In contrast to this, we show that in
any edge-colouring of a complete graph with three colours, it is possible to
cover all the vertices with three vertex-disjoint monochromatic paths, proving
a particular case of a conjecture due to Gy\'arf\'as. As an intermediate result
we show that in any edge-colouring of the complete graph with the colours red

disjoint blue balanced complete bipartite graph.

algorithm, are widely used for Bayesian inference. One of the most important
issues for any MCMC method is the convergence of the Markov chain, which
depends crucially on a suitable choice of the proposal density. Adaptive
Rejection Metropolis Sampling (ARMS) is a well-known MH scheme that generates
samples from one-dimensional target densities making use of adaptive piecewise
proposals constructed using support points taken from rejected samples. In this
work we pinpoint a crucial drawback in the adaptive procedure in ARMS: support
points might never be added inside regions where the proposal is below the
target. When this happens in many regions it leads to a poor performance of
ARMS, with the proposal never converging to the target. In order to overcome
this limitation we propose two improved adaptive schemes for constructing the
proposal. The first one is a direct modification of the ARMS procedure that
incorporates support points inside regions where the proposal is below the
target, while satisfying the diminishing adaptation property, one of the
required conditions to assure the convergence of the Markov chain. The second
one is an adaptive independent MH algorithm with the ability to learn from all
previous samples except for the current state of the chain, thus also
guaranteeing the convergence to the invariant density. These two new schemes
improve the adaptive strategy of ARMS, thus simplifying the complexity in the
construction of the proposals. Numerical results show that the new techniques
provide better performance w.r.t. the standard ARMS.

on the MILES and CaT empirical stellar spectral libraries. For this purpose we
combine these two libraries with the Indo-U.S. to construct composite stellar
spectra to feed our models. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) computed
with these models and the originally published models are combined to construct
composite SEDs for single-age, single-metallicity stellar populations (SSPs)
covering the range 3465 - 9469\AA at moderately high, and uniform, resolution
(FWHM=2.51\AA). The colours derived from these SSP SEDs provide good fits to
Galactic globular cluster data. We find that the colours involving redder
filters are very sensitive to the IMF, as well as a number of features and
molecular bands throughout the spectra. To illustrate the potential use of
these models we focus on the NaI doublet at 8200 \AA and with the aid of the
newly synthesized SSP model SEDs we define a new IMF-sensitive index that is
based on this feature, which overcomes various limitations from previous index
definitions for low velocity dispersion stellar systems. We propose an
index-index diagram based on this feature and the neighboring CaII triplet at
8600 \AA, to constrain the IMF if the age and [Na/Fe] abundance are known.
Finally we also show a survey-oriented spectrophotometric application which
evidences the accurate flux calibration of these models for carrying out
reliable spectral fitting techniques. These models are available through our

to measure at 1 km baseline experiments because its disappearance effects are
degenerate with that of theta_13. The flux normalization independent
measurement of theta_13 at Daya Bay breaks this degeneracy, allowing an

shows that a quintom cosmology is just compatible at 2 sigma with a sterile
neutrino with the right mass to reproduce the reactor anomaly and to a lesser

the chiral condensate and the quark number density for varying chemical
potential and volume. The statistical errors on the results only show a mild
dependence on the matrix size and chemical potential, which confirms the
absence of sign problem in the subset method. This strongly contrasts with the
exponential growth of the statistical error in standard reweighting methods,
which was also analyzed quantitatively using the subset method. Finally, we
show how the method elegantly resolves the Silver Blaze puzzle in the
microscopic limit of the matrix model, where it is equivalent to QCD.

black hole evolutions despite their shortcomings, most notably the inherent
lack of gravitational radiation at the initial time that is later followed by a
burst of spurious radiation. We study the evolution of three alternative
initial data schemes. Two of the three alternatives are based on post-Newtonian
expansions that contain realistic gravitational waves. The first scheme is
based on a second-order post-Newtonian expansion in Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner
transverse-traceless (ADMTT) gauge that has been resummed to approach standard
puncture data at the black holes. The second scheme is based on asymptotic
matching of the 4-metrics of two tidally perturbed Schwarzschild solutions to a
first-order post-Newtonian expansion in ADMTT gauge away from the black holes.
The final alternative is obtained through asymptotic matching of the 4-metrics
of two tidally perturbed Schwarzschild solutions to a second-order
post-Newtonian expansion in harmonic gauge away from the black holes. When
evolved, the second scheme fails to produce quasicircular orbits (and instead
leads to a nearly head-on collision). This failure can be traced back to
inaccuracies in the extrinsic curvature due to low order matching. More
encouraging is that the latter two alternatives lead to quasicircular orbits
and show gravitational radiation from the onset of the evolution, as well as a
reduction of spurious radiation. Current deficiencies compared to standard
punctures data include more eccentric trajectories during the inspiral and
larger constraint violations, since the alternative data sets are only
approximate solutions of Einstein's equations. The eccentricity problem can be
ameliorated by adjusting the initial momentum parameters.

which the soft m_{H_u}^2 and m_{H_d}^2 masses receive extra contributions due
to the presence of direct couplings between the Higgs and the messenger sector.
We are motivated by the well-known result that minimal gauge mediation is
phenomenologically incompatible with the NMSSM due to the small value of the
induced effective mu term. The model considered in the present paper solves the
aforementioned problem through a modified RG running of the singlet soft mass
m_N^2. This effect, which is induced by the dominant m_{H_d}^2 term in the
one-loop beta-function of m_N^2, shifts the singlet soft mass towards large
negative values at the electroweak scale. That is sufficient to ensure a large
VEV for the scalar component of the singlet which in turn translates into a
sizeable effective mu term. We also describe a mechanism for generating large
soft trilinear terms at the messenger scale. This allows us to make the mass of
the lightest Higgs boson compatible with the current LHC bound without relying
on exceedingly heavy stops.

focus on flow across a circular cylinder at three Reynolds numbers, Re_D=20,

the cylinder. We use classical fluid mechanics approaches to analyze the
adjoint solution, which is a vector field similar to a flow field. Production
and dissipation of kinetic energy of the adjoint field is discussed. We also
derive the evolution of circulation of the adjoint field along a closed
material contour. These analytical results are used to explain three numerical
solutions of the adjoint equations presented in this paper. The adjoint
solution at Re_D=20, a viscous steady state flow, exhibits a downstream suction
and an upstream jet, opposite of the expected behavior of a flow field. The
adjoint solution at Re_D=100, a periodic 2D unsteady flow, exhibits periodic,
bean shaped circulation in the near wake region. The adjoint solution at
Re_D=500, a turbulent 3D unsteady flow, has complex dynamics created by the
shear layer in the near wake. The magnitude of the adjoint solution increases
exponentially at the rate of the first Lyapunov exponent. These numerical
results correlate well with the theoretical analysis presented in this paper.

result from an asymmetric explosion in the iron-peak elements resulting in a
larger mass of $^{56}$Ni and higher excitation of hydrogen on the far side of
the SN explosion. We also observe a gradual blue-shifting of this H$\alpha$
peak which is indicative of dust formation in the ejecta. Although showing a
normal peak brightness, V $\sim$ -17.2, for a core-collapse SN, 2006bc fades by
$\sim$6 mag during the first 400 days suggesting either a relatively low
$^{56}$Ni yield, an increase in extinction due to new dust, or both. A short
duration flattening of the light curve is observed from day 416 to day 541
suggesting an optical light echo. Based on the narrow time window of this echo,
we discuss implications on the location and geometry of the reflecting ISM.
With our radiative transfer models, we find an upper limit of 2 x 10$^{-3}$

formed during the SN explosion, this quantity of dust is still several orders
of magnitude lower than that needed to explain the large quantities of dust

genus, orientability, and a new invariant that we call aggregate slope. That
is, given an alternating link, we determine all possible combinations of genus,
orientability, and aggregate slope that a surface spanning that link can have.
To this end, we describe a straightforward algorithm, much like Seifert's
Algorithm, through which to construct certain spanning surfaces called layered
surfaces. A particularly important subset of these will be what we call basic
layered surfaces. We can alter these surface by performing the entirely local
operations of adding handles and/or crosscaps, each of which increases genus.
  The main result then shows that if we are given an alternating projection
P(L) and a surface S spanning L, we can construct a surface T spanning L with
the same genus, orientability, and aggregate slope as S that is a basic layered
surface with respect to P, except perhaps at a collection of added crosscaps
and/or handles. Furthermore, S must be connected if L is non-splittable. This
result has several useful corollaries. In particular, it allows for the
determination of nonorientable genus for alternating links. It also can be used
to show that mutancy of alternating links preserves nonorientable genus. And it
allows one to prove that there are knots that have a pair of minimal
nonorientable genus spanning surfaces, one boundary-incompressible and one
boundary-compressible.

approach to modeling such networks is by a master equation that governs the
dynamic evolution of the joint probability mass function of the underling

Due however to the nonlinear nature of most reactions, the computation and
analysis of the resulting stochastic population dynamics is a difficult task.
This review article provides a coherent and comprehensive coverage of recently

general framework for modeling Markovian reaction networks and giving specific

in which the network topology changes (arbitrarily) from round to round.
  Our first contribution is a rigorous framework for design and analysis of
distributed random walk algorithms in dynamic networks. We then develop a fast
distributed random walk based algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\tau
\Phi})$ rounds (with high probability), where $\tau$ is the dynamic mixing time
and $\Phi$ is the dynamic diameter of the network respectively, and returns a
sample close to a suitably defined stationary distribution of the dynamic
network. We also apply our fast random walk algorithm to devise fast
distributed algorithms for two key problems, namely, information dissemination
and decentralized computation of spectral properties in a dynamic network.
  Our next contribution is a fast distributed algorithm for the fundamental
problem of information dissemination (also called as gossip) in a dynamic
network. In gossip, or more generally, $k$-gossip, there are $k$ pieces of
information (or tokens) that are initially present in some nodes and the
problem is to disseminate the $k$ tokens to all nodes. We present a random-walk
based algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(\min\{n^{1/3}k^{2/3}(\tau \Phi)^{1/3},
nk\})$ rounds (with high probability). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first $o(nk)$-time fully-distributed token forwarding algorithm that
improves over the previous-best $O(nk)$ round distributed algorithm [Kuhn et
al., STOC 2010], although in an oblivious adversary model.
  Our final contribution is a simple and fast distributed algorithm for
estimating the dynamic mixing time and related spectral properties of the
underlying dynamic network.

requires a common microscopic origin for the long-range order. Here, we
formulate a complete theory for a novel form of ferroelectricity, whereby a
spontaneous and switchable polarization emerges from the destruction of an

crystal-chemistry descriptors rooted in group theory, which enables the facile
design of artificial oxides with large electric polarizations, P, simultaneous
with small energetic switching barriers between +P and -P. We validate the
theory with first principles density functional calculations on more than 16
perovskite-structured oxides, illustrating it could be operative in any
materials classes exhibiting two- or three-dimensional corner-connected
octahedral frameworks. We show the principles governing materials selection of
the ""layered"" systems originate in the lattice dynamics of the A cation
displacements stabilized by the pervasive BO$_6$ rotations of single phase

show that the pushforward to the full level modular curve of the mass of f
equidistributes as qk -> infinity. This generalizes known results in the case
that q is squarefree. We obtain a power savings in the rate of equidistribution
as q becomes sufficiently ""powerful"" (far away from being squarefree), and in
particular in the ""depth aspect"" as q traverses the powers of a fixed prime.
  We compare the difficulty of such equidistribution problems to that of
corresponding subconvexity problems by deriving explicit extensions of Watson's
formula to certain triple product integrals involving forms of non-squarefree
level. By a theorem of Ichino and a lemma of Michel--Venkatesh, this amounts to
a detailed study of Rankin--Selberg integrals int|f|^2 E attached to newforms f
of arbitrary level and Eisenstein series E of full level.
  We find that the local factors of such integrals participate in many amusing
analogies with global L-functions. For instance, we observe that the mass
equidistribution conjecture with a power savings in the depth aspect is
equivalent to the union of a global subconvexity bound and what we call a
""local subconvexity bound""; a consequence of our local calculations is what we
call a ""local Lindelof hypothesis"".

high spatial-resolution adaptive optics images of 90 Kepler planetary

Non-documentary biographies were written by people who based themselves on
documentary biographies and on other non-documentary biographies. Documentary
biographies were written by people who knew Einstein personally, and received

him. This type can be further divided into two subgroups: books that were
written while Einstein was still alive, and books that were written after his
death. Among the first group there were some biographies that Einstein
considered to be more reliable, others he thought were less reliable, and still
other biographies which he considered to be almost pure imagination. I will

background which contains several branes in type II string theory compactified

geometry near the 5^2_2-brane is shown to approach the non-geometric background

string rotating along a non-trivial cycle in the 5^2_2 background. Although the
background is not axisymmetric in the usual sense, we show that it is actually
axisymmetric as a doubled geometry by explicitly finding a generalized Killing
vector. We perform a generalized coordinate transformation into a system where
the generalized isometry is manifest, and show that the winding and momentum
charges of the string solution is explicitly conserved in that system.

from the general picture of collapse from initial density fluctuations in an

predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions
are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The
former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter
halos hosting cluster, their mass function and clustering properties. Their
study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for
testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure
formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar
fractions, the thermodynamical and non-thermal processes in the intracluster
plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and
plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the
observed thermal properties of the intra-cluster plasma exhibit the most
regular behavior and thus can be used to define robust observational proxies
for the total cluster mass. We put particular emphasis on examining assumptions
and limitations of the widely used self-similar model of clusters. Finally, we
discuss the formation of clusters in non-standard cosmological models, such as
non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified

large cluster surveys in the near future.

a physical consequence of the too steep (superadiabatic) temperature gradient
beyond the peak of coronal temperature that can be determined from white light
brightness distributions observed during solar eclipses. The thermodynamic
argument for the existence of a continuous solar wind expansion which is

Hydrodynamic simulations. The local abundances of H2 are calculated by
integrating over the hydrogen chemical network. This calculation includes the
gas-phase and dust grain formation of H2, shielding of HI and H2, and
photodissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation from nearby stellar
populations. Because this model does not assume equilibrium abundances, it is
particularly well suited for simulations that model low-metallicity
environments, such as dwarf galaxies and the early Universe. We further
introduce an explicit link between star formation and local H2 abundance. This
link limits star formation to ""star-forming regions,"" represented by areas with
abundant H2.
  With this implementation, we determine the effect of H2 on star formation in
a cosmological simulation of a dwarf galaxy. This simulation is the first
cosmological simulation with non-equilibrium H2 abundances to be integrated to
a redshift of zero or to include efficient SN feedback. We find that our
simulations are consistent with the observed Tully-Fisher, global
Kennicutt-Schmidt, and resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relations. We find that the
inclusion of shielding of both the atomic and molecular hydrogen and, to a
lesser extent, the additional cooling from H2 at temperatures between 200 and
5000 K increases the amount of cold gas in the galaxies. The changes to the ISM
result in an increased amount of cold, dense gas in the disk of the galaxy and
the formation of a clumpier interstellar media (ISM). The explicit link between
star formation and H2 and the clumpier ISM results in a bluer galaxy with a
greater spatial distribution of star formation at a redshift of zero.

published VMAT treatment planning algorithm vmerge to automatically generate
optimal partial-arc plans.
  Methods and materials: A high-quality initial plan is created by solving a
convex multicriteria optimization problem using 180 equi-spaced beams. This
initial plan is used to form a set of dose constraints, and a set of
partial-arc plans is created by searching the space of all possible partial-arc
plans that satisfy these constraints. For each partial-arc, an iterative
fluence map merging and sequencing algorithm (vmerge) is used to improve the
delivery efficiency. Merging continues as long as the dose quality is
maintained above a user-defined threshold. The final plan is selected as the
partial arc with the lowest treatment time. The complete algorithm is called
pmerge.
  Results: Partial-arc plans are created using pmerge for a lung, liver and
prostate case, with final treatment times of 127, 245 and 147 seconds.
Treatment times using full arcs with vmerge are 211, 357 and 178 seconds. Dose
quality is maintained across the initial, vmerge, and pmerge plans to within 5%
of the mean doses to the critical organs-at-risk and with target coverage above
98%. Additionally, we find that the angular distribution of fluence in the
initial plans is predictive of the start and end angles of the optimal
partial-arc.
  Conclusions: The pmerge algorithm is an extension to vmerge that
automatically finds the partial-arc plan that minimizes the treatment time.
VMAT delivery efficiency can be improved by employing partial-arcs without
compromising dose quality. Partial arcs are most applicable to cases with
non-centralized targets, where the time savings is greatest.

by the observation that retrieval is about the relevance matching between two
sets of properties (features), namely, the information need representation and
information item representation. However, many probabilistic retrieval models
rely on fixing one representation and optimizing the other (e.g. fixing the
single information need and tuning the document) but not both. Therefore, it is
difficult to use the available related information on both the document and the
query at the same time in calculating the probability of relevance. In this
paper, we address the problem by hypothesizing the relevance as a logical
relationship between the two sets of properties; the relationship is defined on
two separate mappings between these properties. By using the hypothesis we
develop a unified probabilistic relevance model which is capable of using all
the available information. We validate the proposed theory by formulating and
developing probabilistic relevance ranking functions for both ad-hoc text
retrieval and collaborative filtering. Our derivation in text retrieval
illustrates the use of the theory in the situation where no relevance
information is available. In collaborative filtering, we show that the
resulting recommender model unifies the user and item information into a
relevance ranking function without applying any dimensionality reduction
techniques or computing explicit similarity between two different users (or
items), in contrast to the state-of-the-art recommender models.

spectroscopic redshifts drawn from the XMM Cluster Survey first data release
(XCS-DR1). This is the first study spanning this redshift range using a single,
large, homogeneous cluster sample. Using an orthogonal regression technique, we
find no evidence for evolution in the slope or intrinsic scatter of the
relation since z~1.5, finding both to be consistent with previous measurements
at z~0.1. However, the normalisation is seen to evolve negatively with respect
to the self-similar expectation: we find E(z)^{-1} L_X = 10^{44.67 +/- 0.09}
(T/5)^{3.04 +/- 0.16} (1+z)^{-1.5 +/- 0.5}, which is within 2 sigma of the zero
evolution case. We see milder, but still negative, evolution with respect to
self-similar when using a bisector regression technique. We compare our results
to numerical simulations, where we fit simulated cluster samples using the same
methods used on the XCS data. Our data favour models in which the majority of
the excess entropy required to explain the slope of the L_X-T relation is
injected at high redshift. Simulations in which AGN feedback is implemented
using prescriptions from current semi-analytic galaxy formation models predict
positive evolution of the normalisation, and differ from our data at more than
5 sigma. This suggests that more efficient feedback at high redshift may be
needed in these models.

H(z), the angular-diameter distance D_A(z), and the linear redshift-space
distortion parameter beta(z). Here we present a method for using effective
multipoles of the galaxy two-point correlation function (\xi_0(s), \xi_2(s),
\xi}_4(s), and \xi_6(s), with s denoting the comoving separation) to measure
H(z), D_A(z)$, and beta(z), and validate it using LasDamas mock galaxy
catalogs. Our definition of effective multipoles explicitly incorporates the
discreteness of measurements, and treats the measured correlation function and
its theoretical model on the same footing. We find that for the mock data,
\xi_0+\xi_2+\xi_4 captures nearly all the information, and gives significantly
stronger constraints on H(z), D_A(z), and beta(z), compared to using only
\xi_0+\xi_2.
  We apply our method to the sample of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) without assuming a dark
energy model or a flat Universe. We find that \xi}_4(s) deviates on scales of
s<60Mpc/h from the measurement from mock data (in contrast to \xi_0(s),
\xi_2(s), and \xi_6(s)), thus we only use \xi_0+\xi_2 for our fiducial

dimensions and to space-time allows for a consistent description of the

analogy is manifested by the inclusion in the traditional Lagrangian of general
relativity of an additional term accounting for the strain induced in the
manifold (i.e. in space-time) by the curvature, be it induced by the presence
of a texture defect or by a matter/energy distribution. The additional term is
sufficient to account for various observed features of the universe and to give
a simple interpretation for the so called dark energy. Then, we show how the
same approach can be adopted back in three dimensions to obtain the equilibrium
configuration of a given solid subject to strain induced by defects or applied
forces. Finally, it is shown how concepts coming from the familiar elasticity
theory can inspire new approaches to cosmology and in return how methods
appropriated to General Relativity can be applied back to classical problems of
elastic deformations in three dimensions.

  covariates",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the problem of nonparametric testing for the effect of a
random functional covariate on a real-valued error term. The covariate takes
values in $L^2[0,1]$, the Hilbert space of the square-integrable real-valued
functions on the unit interval. The error term could be directly observed as a
response or \emph{estimated} from a functional parametric model, like for
instance the functional linear regression. Our test is based on the remark that
checking the no-effect of the functional covariate is equivalent to checking
the nullity of the conditional expectation of the error term given a
sufficiently rich set of projections of the covariate. Such projections could
be on elements of norm 1 from finite-dimension subspaces of $L^2[0,1]$. Next,
the idea is to search a finite-dimension element of norm 1 that is, in some
sense, the least favorable for the null hypothesis. Finally, it remains to
perform a nonparametric check of the nullity of the conditional expectation of
the error term given the scalar product between the covariate and the selected
least favorable direction. For such finite-dimension search and nonparametric
check we use a kernel-based approach. As a result, our test statistic is a
quadratic form based on univariate kernel smoothing and the asymptotic critical
values are given by the standard normal law. The test is able to detect
nonparametric alternatives, including the polynomial ones. The error term could
present heteroscedasticity of unknown form. We do no require the law of the
covariate $X$ to be known. The test could be implemented quite easily and
performs well in simulations and real data applications. We illustrate the
performance of our test for checking the functional linear regression model.

hints at the existence of a resonance at 124.5 GeV and a single Higgs doublet
at that mass is inconsistent with a fourth fermion generation, we examine a

space where the Higgs sector can potentially counteract the effects of the

a superposition of possible states into a single, albeit probabilistic,

weak measurements so that it takes the form of a gradual random walk towards a
final state. Remarkably, the interim measurement record is sufficient to

  1.1",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In [3] the radius of convergence of the generating function of the collision
local time of two independent copies of an irreducible, symmetric and transient
random walk on Zd, d \geq 1, was studied. Two versions were considered: z1, the
radius of convergence when one walk is averaged over and the other is kept
fixed; z2, the radius of convergence when both walks are averaged over. While
z2 can be easily computed, no explicit expression is available for z1. In [3]
it was conjectured that z1 > z2 under a weak regularity assumption on the
random walk. However, this gap was only proved for strongly transient random
walk. Subsequently, in [1], [4] and [5] the gap was proved for a subclass of
random walks that are transient but not strongly transient. In the present note
we settle the full conjecture. The proof is based on a comparison of
variational formulas for z1 and z2 derived in [3]. Under additional weak
regularity assumptions on the random walk, we derive an upper bound for z1. We
further show that the gap persists when the random walk has exponential waiting
times. The gaps imply the presence of an intermediate phase for a model of two
random walks with a pinning interaction. As explained in [3], they also imply
the presence of intermediate phases in three classes of interacting stochastic
systems: coupled branching processes, interacting diffusions, and directed
polymers with bulk disorder.

can be expressed in terms of a basis of scalar integrals and rational terms.
Since the scalar bubble integrals are the only UV divergent integrals, the sum
of the bubble coefficients captures the 1-loop UV behavior. In particular, in a
renormalizable theory the sum of the bubble coefficients equals the tree-level
amplitude times a proportionality constant that is related to the one-loop beta
function coefficient beta_0. In this paper, we study how this proportionality
is achieved from the viewpoint of on-shell amplitudes. For n-point MHV
amplitude in (super) Yang-Mills theory, we demonstrate the existence of a
hidden structure in each individual bubble coefficient which directly leads to
systematic cancellations within the sum of them. The origin of this structure
can be attributed to the collinear poles within a two-particle cut. Due to the
cancellation, the one-loop beta function coefficient can be identified as a sum
over the residues of unique collinear poles in particular two-particle cuts.
Using CSW recursion relations, we verify the generality of this statement by
reproducing the correct proportionality factor from such cuts for n-point
split-helicity N^kMHV amplitudes.

fluctuations preserve long-range order without creating topological defects,
unlike thermal phase fluctuations near the critical temperature in

  meson production in the nucleus","12 pages, 3 figures",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The energy transfer spectra have been calculated for the coherent $\eta$
meson production in the proton nucleus reaction. The elementary reaction
occurring in the nucleus is considered as $ pN \to pN^*(1535) $; $ N^*(1535)
\to N\eta $. The $N^*(1535)$ excitation for the forward going proton and $\eta$
meson is occurred due to the $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ meson exchange interactions,
other mesons do not contribute in this process. The cross sections are
calculated for the $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ meson exchange interactions, and the
effect of their interference on the cross section is also studied. The initial
and final state interactions as well as the $N^*(1535)$ nucleus interaction are
addressed by the optical potentials. The distorted wave functions for proton
and $\eta$ meson are described by the eikonal form. The sensitivity of the
cross section to the hadron nucleus potential is presented.

schemes in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) dual-hop amplify-and-forward
(AF) systems. Assuming channel state information is not available at the source
and relay, the optimal transmit and receive beamforming vectors are computed at
the destination, and the transmit beamforming vector is sent to the transmitter
via a dedicated feedback link. Then, a set of new closed-form expressions for
the statistical properties of the maximum eigenvalue of the resultant channel
is derived, i.e., the cumulative density function (cdf), probability density
function (pdf) and general moments, as well as the first order asymptotic
expansion and asymptotic large dimension approximations. These analytical
expressions are then applied to study three important performance metrics of
the system, i.e., outage probability, average symbol error rate and ergodic
capacity. In addition, more detailed treatments are provided for some important
special cases, e.g., when the number of antennas at one of the nodes is one or
large, simple and insightful expressions for the key parameters such as
diversity order and array gain of the system are derived. With the analytical
results, the joint impact of source, relay and destination antenna numbers on
the system performance is addressed, and the performance of optimal beamforming
schemes and orthogonal space-time block-coding (OSTBC) schemes are compared.
Results reveal that the number of antennas at the relay has a great impact on
how the numbers of antennas at the source and destination contribute to the
system performance, and optimal beamforming not only achieves the same maximum
diversity order as OSTBC, but also provides significant power gains over OSTBC.

explain how the method that I used to obtain the observable particle number

adiabatic regularization) and the quantum theory of measurement of particle

to the discovery in 1964 that there would be no particle creation by these
spatially-flat FLRW universes for free fields of any integer or half-integer

scheme, we use the same chemical scheme as in Visscher and Fegley. Yung's

decoherence: at long times the reduced density matrix of the system evolves in
time to a limit which is independent of its initial value, losing all the
quantum information stored in its initial state. Under special circumstances, a
subspace of the system's Hilbert space remains coherent, or ""decoherence free"",
and the reduced density matrix approaches a non-trivial limit which contains
information on its initial quantum state, despite the coupling to the
environment. This situation is called ""partial decoherence"". Here we find the
conditions for partial decoherence for a mesoscopic system (with $N$ quantum
states) which is coupled to an environment. When the Hamiltonian of the system
commutes with the total Hamiltonian, one has ""adiabatic decoherence"", which
yields N-1 time-independent combinations of the reduced density matrix
elements. In the presence of a magnetic flux, one can measure circulating
currents around loops in the system even at long times, and use them to
retrieve information on the initial state. For N=2, we demonstrate that partial
decoherence can happen only under adiabatic decoherence conditions. However,
for $N>2$ we find partial decoherence even when the Hamiltonian of the system
does not commute with the total Hamiltonian, and we obtain the general
conditions for such non-adiabatic partial decoherence. For an electron moving
on a ring, with $N>2$ single-level quantum dots, non-adiabatic partial
decoherence can arise only when the total flux through the ring vanishes (or
equals an integer number of flux quanta), and therefore there is no asymptotic
circulating current.

consistent with the corresponding STAR data. Non-statistical moments are
calculated as the difference between the moments derived from real events and
the ones from mixed events, which are constructed by combining particles
randomly selected from different real events. An evidence of singularity at

non-statistical $S$ and $S\sigma$.

have used high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra from three different
spectrographs. We used the iterative spectral synthesis method VWA to derive
the fundamental parameters from carefully selected high-quality iron lines.
After determination of the fundamental parameters, abundances of 13 elements
were measured using equivalent widths of the spectral lines. Results: We
identify discrepancies in log g and [Fe/H], compared to the parameters based on
photometric indices in the Kepler Input Catalogue (larger than 2.0 dex for log
g and [Fe/H] for individual stars). The Teff found from spectroscopy and
photometry shows good agreement within the uncertainties. We find good
agreement between the spectroscopic log g and the log g derived from
asteroseismology. Also, we see indications of a potential metallicity effect on
the stellar oscillations. Conclusions: We have determined the fundamental
parameters and element abundances of 82 red giants. The large discrepancies
between the spectroscopic log g and [Fe/H] and values in the Kepler Input

If (n-1) has a `large' r-smooth divisor s, then we find a nontrivial factor of

($\lambda_{p}$) and coordinate time ($t$) principal Lyapunov exponent
($\lambda_{c}$) for Reissner Nordstr{\o}m (RN) black hole (BH) . We also
compute their ratio. For RN space-time, it is shown that the ratio is
$\frac{\lambda_{p}}{\lambda_{c}}=\frac{r_{0}}{\sqrt{r_{0}^2-3Mr_{0}+2Q^2}}$ for
time-like circular geodesics and for Schwarzschild BH it is
$\frac{\lambda_{p}}{\lambda_{c}}=\frac{\sqrt{r_{0}}}{\sqrt{r_{0}-3M}}$. We
further show that their ratio $\frac{\lambda_{p}}{\lambda_{c}}$ may vary from
orbit to orbit. For instance, Schwarzschild BH at innermost stable circular
orbit(ISCO), the ratio is
$\frac{\lambda_{p}}{\lambda_{c}}\mid_{r_{ISCO}=6M}=\sqrt{2}$ and at marginally
bound circular orbit (MBCO) the ratio is calculated to be
$\frac{\lambda_{p}}{\lambda_{c}}\mid_{r_{mb}=4M}=2$. Similarly, for extremal RN
BH the ratio at ISCO is
$\frac{\lambda_{p}}{\lambda_{c}}\mid_{r_{ISCO}=4M}=\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}}$.
We also further analyse the geodesic stability via this exponent. By evaluating
the Lyapunov exponent, it is shown that in the eikonal limit , the real and
imaginary parts of the quasi-normal modes of RN BH is given by the frequency
and instability time scale of the unstable null circular geodesics.

Google has introduced Google+ (G+) and reported a significant growth in its

  This paper tackles the above question by presenting a detailed
characterization of G+ based on large scale measurements. We identify the main
components of G+ structure, characterize the key features of their users and
their evolution over time. We then conduct detailed analysis on the evolution
of connectivity and activity among users in the largest connected component
(LCC) of G+ structure, and compare their characteristics with other major OSNs.
We show that despite the dramatic growth in the size of G+, the relative size
of LCC has been decreasing and its connectivity has become less clustered.
While the aggregate user activity has gradually increased, only a very small
fraction of users exhibit any type of activity. To our knowledge, our study
offers the most comprehensive characterization of G+ based on the largest
collected data sets.

atom in each configuration, with field strengths validating the single-photon

Certain correlation properties observed are generic, model independent and
consistent with known results, e.g., MID is an upper bound on QD, QD and WD are
monotonic, and the generic correlation behavior is strongly affected by the
purity of the photon states. We observe that the qualitative hierarchy,
monotonicity and steady-state behavior of the correlations can be controlled by
the choice of parameters such as atomic decay constants and external driving
field strengths. We point out how particular configurations are better suited
at generating monotonic correlations in specific regimes and how the
steady-state correlation behavior and hierarchy are affected by the population
dynamics of the density matrix for different parameters. The possibility of
using well studied quantum optical systems such as the three-level atom to
generate, characterize and parametrically control mixed state quantum
correlations establishes an important step in the direction of their
implementation in quantum information tasks.

term trend in the growth rate is modelled by an inverse function of real GDP
per capita with a constant numerator. This numerator is equivalent to a
constant annual increment of real GDP per capita. For the most advanced
economies, the GDP estimates between 1950 and 2007 have shown very weak and
statistically insignificant linear trends (both positive and negative) in the
annual increment. The fluctuations around relevant mean increments are
characterized by practically normal distribution. For many countries, there
exist historical estimates of real GDP since 1870. These estimates extend the
time span of our analysis together with a few new estimates from 2008 to 2011.
There are severe structural breaks in the corresponding time series between
1940 and 1950, with the slope of linear regression increasing by a factor of
4.0 (Switzerland) to 22.1 (Spain). Therefore, the GDP estimates before 1940 and
after 1950 have been analysed separately. All findings of the original study
are validated by the newly available data. The most important is that all
slopes (except that for Australia after 1950) of the regression lines obtained
for the annual increments of real GDP per capita are small and statistically
insignificant, i.e. one cannot reject the null hypothesis of a zero slope and
thus constant increment. Hence the growth in real GDP per capita is a linear
one since 1870 with a break in slope between 1940 and 1950.

extension of the minimal left-right symmetric model with a single Higgs
bi-doublet is motivated to realize both spontaneous P and CP violation while
consistent with the low energy phenomenology without significant fine tuning.
By carefully investigating the Higgs potential of the model, we find that
sizable CP-violating phases are allowed after the spontaneous symmetry
breaking. The mass spectra of the extra scalars in the 2HBDM are significantly
different from the ones in the minimal left-right symmetric model. In
particular, we demonstrate in the decoupling limit when the right-handed gauge
symmetry breaking scale is much higher than the electroweak scale, the 2HBDM
decouples into general two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) with spontaneous CP
violation and has rich induced sources of CP violation. We show that in the
decoupling limit, it contains extra light Higgs bosons with masses around
electroweak scale, which can be directly searched at the ongoing LHC and future
ILC experiments.

diffuse ISM with no star-formation activity. The Meudon PDR code is then
applied to a number of lines of sight through this model, to derive their
chemical structures. It is found that, compared to the uniform density
assumption, maximal chemical abundances for H2, CO, CH and CN are increased by
a factor 2 to 4 when taking into account density fluctuations on the line of
sight. The correlations between column densities of CO, CH and CN with respect
to those of H2 are also found to be in better overall agreement with
observations. For instance, at N(H2) > 2.10^{20} cm-2, while observations
suggest that d[log N(CO)]=d[log N(H2)] = 3.07 +/- 0.73, we find d[log

redshifts only in the XMM-LSS and Lockman Hole fields from the SWIRE
photometric redshift catalogue. The 70 micron and TIR LFs were constructed in
the redshift range 0<z<1.2 and the 160 micron LF was constructed in the
redshift range 0<z<0.5 using a parametric Bayesian and the vmax methods. We
assume in our models, that the faint-end power-law index of the LF does not
evolve with redshifts. We find the the double power-law model is a better
representation of the IR LF than the more commonly used power-law and Gaussian
model. We model the evolution of the FIR LFs as a function of redshift where
where the characteristic luminosity, $L^\ast$ evolve as
$\propto(1+z)^{\alpha_\textsc{l}}$. The rest-frame 70 micron LF shows a strong
luminosity evolution out to z=1.2 with alpha_l=3.41^{+0.18}_{-0.25}. The
rest-frame 160 micron LF also showed rapid luminosity evolution with
alpha_l=5.53^{+0.28}_{-0.23} out to z=0.5. The rate of evolution in luminosity
is consistent with values estimated from previous studies using data from IRAS,
ISO and Spitzer. The TIR LF evolves in luminosity with
alpha_l=3.82^{+0.28}_{-0.16} which is in agreement with previous results from
Spitzer 24 micron which find strong luminosity evolution. By integrating the LF
we calculated the co-moving IR luminosity density out to z=1.2, which confirm
the rapid evolution in number density of LIRGs and ULIRGs which contribute
~68^{+10}_{-07} % to the co-moving star formation rate density at z=1.2. Our
results based on 70 micron data confirms that the bulk of the star formation at

that the quantum-mechanical unitarity problem of the fourth-order derivative

appropriate to the theory is not the Dirac norm associated with a Hermitian

constant. There are more C-normal stars in the b-SGB than in the f-SGB. This is
consistent with what is found for HB stars, if b-SGB are the progenitors of red
HB stars, and f-SGB those of blue HB ones. The abundances of the n-capture
elements Sr and Ba have a bimodal distribution, reflecting the separation
between f-SGB (Sr and Ba-rich) and b-SGB stars (Sr and Ba-poor). In both
groups, there is a clear correlation between [Sr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe], suggesting
that there is a real spread in the abundances of n-capture elements. There is
some correlation between C and Ba abundances, while the same correlation for Sr
is much more dubious. We identified six C-rich stars, which have a moderate
overabundance of Sr and Ba and rather low N abundances. This group of stars
might be the progenitors of these on the anomalous RGB in the (v, v-y) diagram.
These results are discussed within different scenarios for the formation of
NGC1851. It is possible that the two populations originated in different
regions of an inhomogeneous parent object. However, the striking similarity
with M22 calls for a similar evolution for these two clusters. Deriving
reliable CNO abundances for the two sequences would be crucial.

differential rotation. Both stars were discovered by us to be young stars and
were observed by the NASA Kepler mission. The stellar parameters (vsini,
spectral type, Teff, log g, and [Fe/H]) were derived from optical spectroscopy
which allowed us also to study the chromospheric activity from the emission in
the core of H\alpha\ and CaII IRT lines. The high-precision Kepler photometric
data spanning over 229 days were then fitted with a robust spot model. Model
selection and parameter estimation are performed in a Bayesian manner, using a
Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Both stars came out to be Sun-like with an age
of about 100-200 Myr, based on their lithium content and kinematics. Their
youth is confirmed by the high level of chromospheric activity, comparable to
that displayed by the early G-type stars in the Pleiades cluster. The flux
ratio of the CaII-IRT lines suggests that the cores of these lines are mainly
formed in optically-thick regions analogous to solar plages. The model of the
light curves requires at least seven enduring spots for KIC 7985370 and nine
spots for KIC 7765135 for a satisfactory fit. The assumption of longevity of
the star spots, whose area is allowed to evolve in time, is at the heart of our
approach. We found, for both stars, a rather high value of the equator-to-pole
differential rotation (d\Omega~0.18 rad/day) which is in contrast with the
predictions of some mean-field models of differential rotation for
fast-rotating stars. Our results are instead in agreement with previous works
on solar-type stars and with other models which predict a higher latitudinal
shear, increasing with equatorial angular velocity.

practical throughput in a QKD device. Historically, reconciliation has been
mainly done using close to minimal information disclosure but heavily
interactive procedures, like Cascade, or using less efficient but also less
interactive -just one message is exchanged- procedures, like the ones based in
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The price to pay in the LDPC case is
that good efficiency is only attained for very long codes and in a very narrow
range centered around the quantum bit error rate (QBER) that the code was
designed to reconcile, thus forcing to have several codes if a broad range of
QBER needs to be catered for. Real world implementations of these methods are
thus very demanding, either on computational or communication resources or
both, to the extent that the last generation of GHz clocked QKD systems are
finding a bottleneck in the classical part. In order to produce compact, high
performance and reliable QKD systems it would be highly desirable to remove
these problems. Here we analyse the use of short-length LDPC codes in the
information reconciliation context using a low interactivity, blind, protocol
that avoids an a priori error rate estimation. We demonstrate that 2x10^3 bits
length LDPC codes are suitable for blind reconciliation. Such codes are of high

interpreted as evidence of fast (~100-300 km/s) quasi-periodic flows. We have
performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) modeling of a bipolar
AR that contains impulsively generated waves and flows in coronal loops. The
model AR is initiated with a dipole magnetic field and gravitationally
stratified density, with an upflow driven steadily or periodically in localized
regions at the footpoints of magnetic loops. The resulting flows along the
magnetic field lines of the AR produce higher density loops compared to the
surrounding plasma by injection of material into the flux-tubes and the
establishment of siphon flow. We find that the impulsive onset of flows with
subsonic speeds result in the excitation of damped slow magnetosonic waves that
propagate along the loops and coupled nonlinearly driven fast mode waves. The
phase speed of the slow magnetosonic waves is close to the coronal sound speed.
When the amplitude of the driving pulses is increased we find that slow
shock-like wave trains are produced. When the upflows are driven periodically,
undamped oscillations are produced with periods determined by the periodicity
of the upflows. Based on the results of the 3D MHD model we suggest that the
observed slow magnetosonic waves and persistent upflows may be produced by the
same impulsive events at the bases of ARs.

It is analogous to Warschawski's boundary structure modulus and closely related
to annuli crossings. The main application we have in mind is that of a random
discrete-model curve approaching a Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) curve in the
lattice size scaling limit. We carry out the approach in the case of

show that the tip structure modulus gives a sufficient geometric condition for
a Loewner curve to be H\""{o}lder continuous in the capacity parameterization,

branching fraction B(t to charged Higgs b) in the range of 2-4% are established
for charged Higgs boson masses between 80 and 160 GeV, under the assumption
that B(charged Higgs to tau anti-tau neutrino) = 1.

filters which transmit emission from the expanding supernova remnant in HI,
HeI, HeII, [CI], [NII], [OI], [SII], and [SIII] emission lines. We present both
raw and flux-calibrated data. Arrays of 19,440 photoionization models, with
extensive input abundance ranges, were matched pixel by pixel to the calibrated
data in order to derive corresponding element abundance or mass-fraction
distributions for helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. These maps show
distinctive structure, and they illustrate regions of gas in which various
stages of nucleosynthesis have apparently occurred, including the CNO-cycle,
helium-burning, carbon-burning, and oxygen-burning. It is hoped that the
calibrated observations and chemical abundance distribution maps will be useful
for developing a better understanding of the precursor star evolution and the
supernova explosive process.

science for studying the three-dimensional morphologies and chemical
compositions of nanostructures. The image quality obtained by many current
algorithms is seriously affected by the problems of missing wedge artefacts and
nonlinear projection intensities due to diffraction effects. The former refers
to the fact that data cannot be acquired over the full $180^\circ$ tilt range;
the latter implies that for some orientations, crystalline structures can show
strong contrast changes. To overcome these problems we introduce and discuss
several algorithms from the mathematical fields of geometric and discrete
tomography. The algorithms incorporate geometric prior knowledge (mainly
convexity and homogeneity), which also in principle considerably reduces the
number of tilt angles required. Results are discussed for the reconstruction of
an InAs nanowire.

angle theta_qq-bar traversing a medium of length L. Multiple interactions with
the medium are handled in the harmonic oscillator approximation, valid for soft
gluon emissions. We discuss the time-scales relevant to the decoherence of
correlated partons traversing the medium and demonstrate how this relates to
the hard scale that govern medium-induced radiation. For large angle radiation,
the hard scale is given by Qhard = max(r_perp^{-1}, Qs), where r_perp =
theta_qq-bar L is the probed transverse size and Qs is the maximal transverse
momentum accumulated by the emitted gluon in the medium. These situations
define in turn two distinct regimes, which we call ""dipole"" and ""decoherence""
regimes, respectively, and which are discussed in detail. A feature common to
both cases is that coherence of the radiation is restored at large transverse
momenta, k_\perp > Qhard.

region and the discovery of asym- metric fission in 180 Hg [1] have stimulated
theoretical interest in the mechanism of fission in heavy nuclei. Purpose: We
study fission modes and fusion valleys in 180 Hg and 198 Hg to reveal the role
of shell effects in pre-scission region and explain the experimentally observed
fragment mass asymmetry and its variation with A. Methods: We use the
self-consistent nuclear density functional theory employing Skyrme and Gogny
energy density functionals. Results: The potential energy surfaces in
multi-dimensional space of collective coordinates, including elongation,
triaxiality, reflection-asymmetry, and necking, are calculated for 180 Hg and
198 Hg. The asymmetric fission valleys - well separated from fusion valleys
associated with nearly spherical fragments - are found in in both cases. The
density distributions at scission configurations are studied and related to the
experimentally observed mass splits. Conclusions: The energy density
functionals SkM\ast and D1S give a very consistent description of the fission
process in 180 Hg and 198 Hg. We predict a transition from asymmetric fission
in 180 Hg towards more symmetric distribution of fission fragments in 198 Hg.
For 180 Hg, both models yield 100 Ru/80 Kr as the most probable split. For 198
Hg, the most likely split is 108 Ru/90 Kr in HFB-D1S and 110 Ru/88 Kr in
HFB-SkM\ast.
