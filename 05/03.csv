gravity. In particular we calculate the running of the gravitational and
cosmological constants. The flow of these couplings shows that there exist both
Gaussian and nontrivial fixed points in the theory, thus confirming that the
theory is asymptotically safe. It is shown that the new massive gravity or
$f(R)$ gravity in three dimensions do not correspond to the fixed point within
the approximation that the coefficients of the higher curvature terms are not
subject to the flow. The fixed point value of the cosmological constant is
found to be gauge-independent, positive and small. We also find that if we
start with Einstein term with negative sign, the fixed point only exists when
the coefficient of the Einstein term has positive sign.

  Byzantine Faults",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Renaming is a fundamental problem in distributed computing, which consists of
a set of processes picking distinct names from a given namespace. The paper
presents algorithms that solve order-preserving renaming in synchronous message
passing systems with Byzantine processes. To the best of our knowledge, this
work is the first to address order-preserving renaming in the given model.
Although this problem can be solved by using consensus, it is known that
renaming is ""weaker"" than consensus, therefore we are mainly concerned with the
efficiency of performing renaming and make three contributions in this
direction. We present an order-preserving renaming algorithm for $N > 3t$ with
target namespace of size $N+t-1$ and logarithmic step complexity (where $N$ is
the number of processes and $t$ is an upper bound on the number of faults).
Similarly to the existing crash-tolerant solution, our algorithm employs the
ideas from the approximate agreement problem. We show that our algorithm has
constant step complexity if $N>t^2+2t$ and achieves tight namespace of size
$N$. Finally, we present an algorithm that solves order-preserving renaming in
just 2 communication steps, if $N > 2t^2 + t$.

As
quantified by X-ray surface flux, these are the most inactive M dwarfs ever
observed with X-ray grating spectroscopy. We focus on measuring coronal
abundances, in particular searching for evidence of abundance anomalies related
to First Ionization Potential (FIP). In the solar corona and wind, low FIP
elements are overabundant, which is the so-called ""FIP effect."" For other
stars, particularly very active ones, an ""inverse FIP effect"" is often
observed, with low FIP elements being underabundant. For both members of the GJ
338 binary, we find evidence for a modest inverse FIP effect, consistent with
expectations from a previously reported correlation between spectral type and
FIP bias. This amounts to strong evidence that all M dwarfs should exhibit the
inverse FIP effect phenomenon, not just the active ones. We take the first step
towards modeling the inverse FIP phenomenon in M dwarfs, building on past work
that has demonstrated that MHD waves coursing through coronal loops can lead to
a ponderomotive force that fractionates elements in a manner consistent with
the FIP effect. We demonstrate that in certain circumstances this model can
also lead to an inverse FIP effect, pointing the way to more detailed modeling
of M dwarf coronal abundances in the future.

probability density function (PDF), we show that the transformed area obtained
using the generalized ratio of uniforms method can be found equivalently by
applying the transformed rejection sampling approach to the inverse function of

density idea, showing that it is completely equivalent to the GRoU method for
monotonic densities. Although we concentrate on monotonic probability density
functions (PDFs), we also discuss how the results presented here can be
extended to any non-monotonic PDF that can be decomposed into a collection of
intervals where it is monotonically increasing or decreasing. In this general
case, we show the connections with transformations of certain random variables
and the generalized inverse PDF with the GRoU technique. Finally, we also
introduce a GRoU technique to handle unbounded target densities.

to achieve a redundancy system for all the services running on a data center.
This new approach to high availability allows the running virtual machines to

the virtualization layer: start, stop and move virtual machines between
physical hosts. The 3RC system is based on a finite state machine, providing
the possibility to restart each virtual machine over any physical host, or
reinstall it from scratch. A complete infrastructure has been developed to

than reported so far. At room temperature, Ba1-xKxFe2As2 crystallizes in a
tetragonal structure with the space group symmetry of I4/mmm, but at low
doping, the samples undergo a coincident first-order structural and magnetic
phase transition to an orthorhombic (O) structure with space group Fmmm and a
striped antiferromagnet (AF) with space group Fcmm'm'. The transition
temperature falls from a maximum of 139K in the undoped compound to 0K at x =
0.252, with a critical exponent as a function of doping of 0.25(2) and 0.12(1)
for the structural and magnetic order parameters, respectively. The onset of
superconductivity occurs at a critical concentration of x = 0.130(3) and the
superconducting transition temperature grows linearly with x until it crosses
the AF/O phase boundary. Below this concentration, there is microscopic phase
coexistence of the AF/O and superconducting order parameters, although a slight
suppression of the AF/O order is evidence that the phases are competing. At
higher doping, superconductivity has a maximum Tc of 38 K at x = 0.4 falling to
3 K at x = 1.0. We discuss reasons for the suppression of the spin-density-wave
order and the electron-hole asymmetry in the phase diagram.

interference between coherent and Fock states using quantum catalysis. By
modulating the coherent field strength, the number of catalyst photons and the
ratio of the beam splitter upon which they interfere, a wide range of
nonclassical phenomena can be created, including squeezing of up to 1.25 dB,
anti- and super-bunched photon statistics and states exhibiting over 90%
fidelity to displaced coherent superposition states. We perform quantum
catalysis experimentally, showing tunability into the nonclassical regime. Our
protocol is not limited by weak nonlinearities that underlie most known
strategies of preparing multi-photon nonclassical states. Successive iterations
of this protocol can lead to direct control over the weights of higher-order
terms in the Fock basis, paving the way towards conditional preparation of
""designer"" multi-photon states for applications in quantum computation,
communication and metrology.

estimating properties of complicated distributions. While their use has become
commonplace and there is a large literature on MCMC theory and practice, MCMC
users still have to contend with several challenges with each implementation of
the algorithm. These challenges include determining how to construct an
efficient algorithm, finding reasonable starting values, deciding whether the
sample-based estimates are accurate, and determining an appropriate length
(stopping rule) for the Markov chain. We describe an approach for resolving
these issues in a theoretically sound fashion in the context of spatial
generalized linear models, an important class of models that result in
challenging posterior distributions. Our approach combines analytical
approximations for constructing provably fast mixing MCMC algorithms, and takes
advantage of recent developments in MCMC theory. We apply our methods to real
data examples, and find that our MCMC algorithm is automated and efficient.
Furthermore, since starting values, rigorous error estimates and theoretically
justified stopping rules for the sampling algorithm are all easily obtained for
our examples, our MCMC-based estimation is practically as easy to perform as
Monte Carlo estimation based on independent and identically distributed draws.

neither spaced evenly throughout the profit landscape, which makes the
optimization notoriously hard and hypersensitive for partial or limited

field contains: five protoplanetary discs (also known as proplyds), the
high-velocity jet HH 514 and a bowshock. Spatial distribution maps are obtained
for different emission line fluxes, the c(H{\beta}) coefficient, electron
densities and temperatures, ionic abundances of different ions from
collisionally excited lines (CELs), C2+ and O2+ abundances from recombination
lines (RLs) and the abundance discrepancy factor of O2+, ADF(O2+). We find that
collisional de-excitation has a major influence on the line fluxes in the
proplyds. If this is not properly accounted for then physical conditions
deduced from commonly used line ratios will be in error, leading to unreliable
chemical abundances for these objects. We obtain the intrinsic emission of the
proplyds 177-341, 170-337 and 170-334 by a direct subtraction of the background
emission, though the last two present some background contamination due to
their small sizes. A detailed analysis of 177-341 spectra reveals the presence
of high-density gas (3.8\times10^5 cm^-3) in contrast to the typical values
observed in the background gas of the nebula (3800 cm^-3). We also explore how
the background subtraction could be affected by the possible opacity of the
proplyd. We construct a physical model for the proplyd 177-341 finding a good
agreement between the predicted and observed line ratios. Finally, we find that
the use of reliable physical conditions returns an ADF(O2+) about zero for the
intrinsic spectra of 177-341, while the background emission presents the
typical ADF(O2+) observed in the Orion Nebula. We conclude that the presence of
high-density ionized gas is severely affecting the abundances determined from
CELs and, therefore, those from RLs should be considered as a better
approximation to the true abundances.

molecular non-equilibrium processes and chemical reactions. It is thus a
long-standing scientific dream to measure the dynamics of two bound correlated
electrons in the quantum regime. Quantum wave packets were previously observed
for single-active electrons on their natural attosecond timescales. However, at
least two active electrons and a nucleus are required to address the quantum
three-body problem. This situation is realized in the helium atom, but direct
time-resolved observation of two-electron wave-packet motion remained an
unaccomplished challenge. Here, we measure a 1.2-femtosecond quantum beating
among low-lying doubly-excited states in helium to evidence a correlated
two-electron wave packet. Our experimental method combines attosecond
transient-absorption spectroscopy at unprecedented high spectral resolution (20
meV near 60 eV) with an intensity-tuneable visible laser field to couple the
quantum states from the perturbative to the strong-coupling regime. This
multi-dimensional transient-coupling scheme reveals an inversion of the
characteristic Fano line shapes for a range of doubly-excited states. Employing
Fano-type autoionization as a natural quantum interferometer, a dynamical phase
shift by laser coupling to the N=2 continuum is postulated and experimentally
quantified. This phase maps a transition from effectively
single-active-electron to two-electron dynamics as the electron-electron
interaction increases in lower-lying quantum states. In the future, such
experiments will provide benchmark data for testing dynamical few-body quantum
theory. They will boost our understanding of chemically and biologically
important metastable electronic transition states and their dynamics on
attosecond time scales.

solutions for all generalized Dirac equations are found in the helicity basis

sum rules that connect the form of the fundamental field anticommutators with
the tensor sums of the fundamental plane-wave eigenspinors and the projectors
over positive-energy and negative-energy states. In the massless case, the sum
rules are fulfilled by two egregiously simple, distinguished functional forms.
The first sum rule remains valid in the case of a tardyonic theory and leads to
the canonical massive Dirac field. The second sum rule is valid for a tachyonic
mass term and leads to a natural suppression of the right-handed helicity
states for tachyonic particles, and left-handed helicity states for tachyonic
spin-1/2 antiparticles. When applied to neutrinos, the theory contains a free
tachyonic mass parameter. Tachyons are known to be repulsed by gravity. We

features of both leptonic and hadronic models are reviewed. I present sample
modeling results of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of different types of
Fermi-detected blazars along the traditional blazar sequence, using both types
of models. In many cases, the SEDs of high-frequency peaked blazars (HBLs) have
been found to be well represented by simple synchrotron + synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) models. However, a few HBLs recently discovered as
very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitters by VERITAS are actually better
represented by either external-Compton or hadronic models. Often, spectral
modeling with time-independent single-zone models alone is not sufficient to
constrain models, as both leptonic and lepto-hadronic models are able to
provide acceptable fits to the overall SED. This degeneracy can be lifted by
considering further constraints from spectral variability. Recent developments
of time-dependent and inhomogeneous blazar models will be discussed, including
detailed numerical simulations as well as a semi-analytical approach to the

comparison with observations is non-trivial, we show that our predicted break

extra dark radiation being linked directly to the physics of cold dark matter
(CDM). In particular, we consider a generic scenario where dark radiation, as a
result of an interaction, is produced directly by a fraction of the dark matter
density effectively decaying into dark radiation. At an early epoch when the
dark matter density is negligible, as an obvious consequence, the density of
dark radiation is also very small. As the Universe approaches matter radiation
equality, the dark matter density starts to dominate thereby increasing the
content of dark radiation and changing the expansion rate of the Universe. As
this increase in dark radiation content happens naturally after Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN), it can relax the possible tension with lower values of
radiation degrees of freedom measured from light element abundances compared to
that of the CMB. We numerically confront this scenario with WMAP+ACT and
WMAP+SPT data and derive an upper limit on the allowed fraction of dark matter
decaying into dark radiation.

perform a comparison of star formation rates (SFRs) determined from SED
modeling (SFRs[SED]) and those calculated from deep Keck UV and Spitzer/MIPS 24
micron imaging (SFRs[IR+UV]). Exponentially declining SFHs yield SFRs[SED] that
are 5-10x lower on average than SFRs[IR+UV], indicating that declining SFHs may
not be accurate for typical galaxies at z>2. The SFRs of z~2-3 galaxies are
directly proportional to their stellar masses M*, with unity slope---a result
that is confirmed with Spitzer/IRAC stacks of 1179 UV-faint (R>25.5)
galaxies---for M*>5e8 Msun and SFRs >2 Msun/yr. We interpret this result in the
context of several systematic biases that can affect determinations of the
SFR-M* relation. The average specific SFRs at z~2-3 are similar within a factor
of two to those measured at z>4, implying an average SFH where SFRs increase
with time. A consequence of these rising SFHs is that (a) a substantial
fraction of UV-bright z~2-3 galaxies had faint sub-L* progenitors at z>4; and
(b) gas masses must increase with time from z=7 to 2, over which time the net
cold gas accretion rate---as inferred from the specific SFR and the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation---is ~2-3x larger than the SFR . However, if we
evolve to higher redshift the SFHs and masses of the halos that are expected to
host L* galaxies at z~2, we find that <10% of the baryons accreted onto typical
halos at z>4 actually contribute to star formation at those epochs. These
results highlight the relative inefficiency of star formation even at early
cosmic times when galaxies were first assembling. [Abridged]

Comparisons between LAT and non-LAT detected samples were made using
contemporaneous data. In total, 232 sources were used in the LAT-detected
sample. This very large, radio flux-limited sample of active galactic nuclei
(AGN) provides insights into the mechanism that produces strong gamma-ray
emission. It has been found that LAT-detected BL Lac objects are very similar
to the non-LAT BL Lac objects in most properties, although LAT BL Lac objects
may have longer jets. The LAT flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are
significantly different from non-LAT FSRQs and are likely extreme members of
the FSRQ population. Contemporaneous observations showed a strong correlation,
whereas no correlation is found using archival radio data. Most of the
differences between the LAT and non-LAT populations are related to the cores of
the sources, indicating that the gamma-ray emission may originate near the base
of the jets (i.e., within a few pc of the central engine). There is some
indication that LAT-detected sources may have larger jet opening angles than
the non-LAT sources. Strong core polarization is significantly more common
among the LAT sources, suggesting that gamma-ray emission is related to strong,
uniform magnetic fields at the base of the jets of the blazars. Observations of
sources in two epochs indicate that core fractional polarization was higher
when the objects were detected by the LAT. Included in our sample are several

manifolds. It plays the same role as the eta invariant of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer,
which is for odd dimensional manifolds. It is associated to $K^1$
representatives on even dimensional manifolds and is closely related to the so
called WZW theory in physics. In fact, it is an intrinsic interpretation of the
Wess-Zumino term without passing to the bounding 3-manifold. Spectrally the eta
invariant is defined on a finite cylinder, rather than on the manifold itself.
Thus it is an interesting question to find an intrinsic spectral interpretation
of this new invariant. We address this issue here using adiabatic limit
technique. The general formulation relates the (mod $\mathbb Z$ reduction of)
eta invariant for even dimensional manifolds with the holonomy of the
determinant line bundle of a natural family of Dirac type operators. In this
sense our result might be thought of as an even dimensional analogue of
Witten's holonomy theorem proved by Bismut-Freed and Cheeger independently.

cross-correlation between the CMB anisotropies and the 21 cm fluctuations from
the epoch of reionization. We assume an analytic reionization model and an
ionization fraction with $f_{\rm NL}$ induced scale dependent bias. We estimate
the angular power spectrum of the cross-correlation of the CMB and 21 cm. In
order to evaluate the detectability, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for only a
single redshift slice is also calculated for current and future observations,
such as CMB observations by Planck satellite and 21 cm observations by
Omniscope. The existence of the $f_{\rm NL}$ increases the signal of the
cross-correlation at large scales and the amplification does not depend on the
reionization parameters in our reionization model. However the cosmic variance
is significant on such scales and the S/N ratio is suppressed. The obtained S/N
ratio is 2.8 (2.4) for $f_{\rm NL}=10$ (100) in our fiducial reionization
model. Our work suggests in the absence of significant foregrounds and
systematics, the auto-correlations of 21 cm is a better probe of $f_{\rm NL}$
than the cross-correlations (as expected since it depends on $b^2$), while the
cross-correlations contain only one factor of $b$. Nevertheless, it is
interesting to examine the cross-correlations between 21 cm and CMB, as the
signal-to-noise ratio is not negligible and it is more likely we can rid
ourselves of systematics and foregrounds that are common to both CMB and 21 cm
experiments than completely clean 21 cm of all of the possible foregrounds and
systematics in large scales.

instability in a double-degenerate plasma. Three different regimes, namely,
low, intermediate and high magnetic field strengths are considered which span
the applicability of the work to a wide variety of environments. Distinct
behavior is observed for different regimes, for instance, in the
laboratory-scale field regime no frequency-mode instability occurs unlike those
of intermediate and high magnetic-field strength regimes. It is also found that
the instability of this kind is due to the heavy-fermions which appear below a
critical effective-mass parameter ($\mu_{cr}=\sqrt{3}$) and that the responses
of the two (lower and upper frequency) modes to fractional effective-mass
change in different effective-mass parameter ranges (below and above the
critical value) are quite opposite to each other. It is shown that, the
heavy-fermion instability due to extremely high magnetic field such as that
encountered for a neutron-star crust can lead to confinement of stable
propagations in both lower and upper frequency modes to the magnetic poles.
Current study can have important implications for linear wave dynamics in both

different, which leads to a spin imbalance, or spin polarization. Two different
atomic species also lead to a mass imbalance. Imbalanced Fermi gases are
relevant to condensed-matter physics, nuclear physics and astroparticle
physics. They have been studied intensively in recent years, following their
experimental realization in ultracold atomic Fermi gases. The experimental
control in such a system allows for a systematic study of the equation of state
and the phase diagram as a function of temperature, spin polarization and
interaction strength. In this review, we discuss the progress in understanding
strongly-interacting imbalanced Fermi gases, where a main goal is to describe
the results of the highly controlled experiments. We start by discussing
Feshbach resonances, after which we treat the imbalanced Fermi gas in
mean-field theory to give an introduction to the relevant physics. We encounter
several unusual superfluid phases, including phase separation, gapless Sarma
superfluidity, and supersolidity. To obtain a more quantitative description of
the experiments, we review also more sophisticated techniques, such as
diagrammatic methods and the renormalization-group theory. We end the review by
discussing two theoretical approaches to treat the inhomogeneous imbalanced

the relative magnitude of the fluctuations in the Galactic magnetic field (the

Faraday rotation and synchrotron polarization, the observations are
inconsistent with local energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic
fields. Our analysis of relative synchrotron intensity fluctuations indicates
that the distribution of cosmic rays is nearly uniform at the scales of the
order of and exceeding $100\p$, in contrast to strong fluctuations in the
interstellar magnetic field at those scales. A conservative upper limit on the
ratio of the the fluctuation magnitude in the cosmic ray number density to its
mean value is 0.2--0.4 at scales of order 100\,pc. Our results are consistent
with a mild anticorrelation between cosmic-ray and magnetic energy densities at

cosmic rays and magnetic fields may still hold, but at scales exceeding 1\,kpc.
Therefore, we suggest that equipartition estimates be applied to the observed
synchrotron intensity smoothed to a linear scale of kiloparsec order (in spiral
galaxies) to obtain the cosmic ray distribution and a large-scale magnetic
field. Then the resulting cosmic ray distribution can be used to derive the
fluctuating magnetic field strength from the data at the original resolution.

the LHCb and CDF Collaborations. Adopting the topological diagram approach, we
study flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking effects in the weak decay tree amplitudes
of singly Cabibbo-suppressed $D\to PP$ decays. The symmetry breaking in the
color-allowed and color-suppressed amplitudes is estimated with the help of the
factorization ansatz, while that in the $W$-exchange amplitude is done by
fitting to related branching fraction data. We find that the $W$-exchange
amplitudes stay in the second quadrant relative to the color-allowed tree
amplitude, albeit there are two possibilities for one type of $W$-exchange
amplitude. The weak decay penguin amplitudes, on the other hand, are evaluated
within the framework of QCD factorization. Using the input of topological tree
amplitudes extracted from the Cabibbo-favored decay modes and the perturbative
results for QCD penguin amplitudes, we make predictions for the branching
fractions and CP asymmetries of singly Cabibbo-suppressed modes. The
predictions of branching fractions are generally improved from those in the
SU(3) limit. We conclude that the direct CP asymmetry difference between $D^0
\to K^+ K^-$ and $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ is about $-(0.139\pm 0.004)%$ and
$-(0.151\pm 0.004)%$ for the two solutions of $W$-exchange amplitudes,
respectively. We also find that the CP asymmetry of $D^0\to K^0\ov K^0$
dominated by the interference between $W$-exchange amplitudes ranges from
$-0.62\times 10^{-3}$ to $-1.82\times 10^{-3}$. We study phenomenological
implications of two new physics scenarios for explaining the observed CP
asymmetry in the charm sector, one with large penguin amplitudes and the other
with a large chromomagnetic dipole operator. We find that the two scenarios can
be discriminated by the measurements of CP asymmetries of a set of decay modes.

are selfish but rational. In recent work, Kol and Naor show that, when there
are two players, in the non-simultaneous communication model, i.e. when rushing
is possible, there is no Nash equilibrium that ensures both players learn the
secret. However, they describe a mechanism for this problem, for any number of
players, that is an epsilon-Nash equilibrium, in that no player can gain more
than epsilon utility by deviating from it. Unfortunately, the Kol and Naor
mechanism, and, to the best of our knowledge, all previous mechanisms for this
problem require each agent to send O(n) messages in expectation, where n is the
number of agents. This may be problematic for some applications of rational
secret sharing such as secure multi-party computation and simulation of a
mediator.
  We address this issue by describing mechanisms for rational secret sharing
that are designed for large n. Both of our results hold for n > 2, and are Nash
equilbria, rather than just epsilon-Nash equilbria.
  Our first result is a mechanism for n-out-of-n rational secret sharing that
is scalable in the sense that it requires each agent to send only an expected
O(log n) bits. Moreover, the latency of this mechanism is O(log n) in
expectation, compared to O(n) expected latency for the Kol and Naor result. Our
second result is a mechanism for a relaxed variant of rational m-out-of-n
secret sharing where m = Theta(n). It requires each processor to send O(log n)
bits and has O(log n) latency. Both of our mechanisms are non-cryptographic,
and are not susceptible to backwards induction.

nucleation in the 3d Ising model in the presence of cuboidal pores. Pores of
well-chosen aspect ratio can dramatically speed nucleation relative to a planar
surface made of the same material, while badly-chosen pores provide no such
enhancement. For a given pore, the maximum nucleation rate is achieved when one
of its two horizontal dimensions attains a critical length, largely
irrespective of the other dimension (provided that the latter is large enough).
This observation implies that patterning a surface in a raster-like fashion is
a better strategy for speeding nucleation than e.g. scoring long grooves in it.

greatly deteriorate the throughput gains of network coding and seriously

random linear network coding. In this paper, we enhance the error correction
capability of these two families of codes by using a novel two-tier decoding

second-tier decoding, we propose to perform a first-tier decoding on the packet
level by taking advantage of Hamming distance properties of subspace and rank
metric codes. This packet-level decoding can also be implemented by
intermediate nodes to reduce error propagation. To support the first-tier
decoding, we also investigate Hamming distance properties of three important

Kotter--Kschischang codes, and Mahdavifar--Vardy codes. Both the two-tier

binaries at a rate about 200 times greater than in the field. If globular
clusters also produce SNe Ia at a high rate, it would account for much of the
SN Ia events in early type galaxies and provide insight into their formation.
Here we use archival HST images of nearby galaxies that have hosted SNe Ia to
examine the rate at which globular clusters produce these events. The location
of the SN Ia is registered on an HST image obtained before the event or after
the supernova faded. Of the 36 nearby galaxies examined, 21 had sufficiently
good data to search for globular cluster hosts. None of the 21 supernovae have
a definite globular cluster counterpart, although there are some ambiguous
cases. This places an upper limit to the enhancement rate of SN Ia production
in globular clusters of about 42 at the 95% confidence level, which is an order
of magnitude lower than the enhancement rate for luminous X-ray binaries. Even
if all of the ambiguous cases are considered as having a globular cluster
counterpart, the upper bound for the enhancement rate is 82 at the 95%
confidence level, excluding an enhancement rate of 200. Barring unforeseen
selection effects, we conclude that globular clusters are not responsible for
producing a significant fraction of the SN Ia events in early-type galaxies.

Gyr old, solar metallicity stellar population. Ionization models suggest the
majority of the structure is cold gas surrounding a shock heated cloud that is
kinematically adjacent to a multi-phase group of clouds with detected CIII, CIV

deduced metallicities are consistent with the moderate in situ enrichment

accretes into the halo of the galaxy. The data support the scenario of an early
formation period (z > 4) in which the galaxy was presumably fed by cold-mode
gas accretion that was later quenched via virial shocking by the hot halo such
that, by intermediate redshift, the cold filamentary accreting gas is
continuing to be disrupted by shock heating. Thus, continued filamentary
accretion is being mixed into the hot halo, indicating that the star formation
of the galaxy will likely remain quenched. To date, the galaxy and the HI
absorption complex provide some of the most compelling observational data
supporting the theoretical picture in which accretion is virial shocked in the
hot coronal halos of high mass galaxies.

and the average X-ray luminosity in the 0.7-200 keV band is estimated to be
2.9E38 erg/s for a distance of 8 kpc. We fit the spectrum with both simple
(independent disk and corona) and sophisticated (energetically coupled disk and
corona) models, but all fits imply that the underlying optically thick disk is
truncated significantly before the innermost stable circular orbit around the
black hole. We show this directly by a comparison with similarly broadband data
from a disk dominated spectrum at almost the same luminosity observed by
XMM-Newton and RXTE 3 days after the Suzaku observation.
  During the Suzaku observation, the QPO frequency changes from 4.3 Hz to 5.5
Hz, while the spectrum softens. The energetically coupled model gives a
corresponding 5+/- 8 % decrease in derived inner radius of the disk. While this
is not significant, it is consistent with the predicted change in QPO frequency
from Lense-Thirring precession of the hot flow interior to the disk and/or a
deformation mode of this flow, as a higher QPO frequency implies a smaller size
scale for the corona. This is consistent with the truncated disk extending
further inwards towards the black hole.

ordered. If X admits at least one continuous tournament and each continuous
tournament on X has a king, then X must be compact. We show that a complete
reversal of our theorem is impossible, by giving an example of a dense
connected subspace Y of the unit square admitting precisely two continuous
tournaments both of which have a king, yet Y is not even analytic (much less
compact).

energy models characterized by the length scale $L=\frac1{a^n(t)}\int_0^t dt'
a^m(t')$. We show that $n \geq 0$ is required by the recent cosmic accelerated
expansion of universe. In the early universe dominated by the constituent with
constant equation of state $w_m$, we have $w_{de}\simeq -1-\frac{2n}{3}$ for $n
\geq 0$ and $m<0$, and $w_{de}\simeq-\frac23(n-m)+w_m$ for $n > m \geq 0$. The
models with $n > m \geq 0$ become single-parameter models like the $\Lambda$CDM
model due to the analytic feature $\Omega_{de}\simeq
\frac{d^2}4(2m+3w_m+3)^2a^{2(n-m)}$ at radiation- and matter-dominated epoch.
Whereas the cases $n=m\geq 0$ should be abandoned as the dark energy cannot
dominate the universe forever and there might be too large fraction of dark
energy in early universe, and the cases $m> n \geq 0$ are forbidden by the
self-consistent requirement $\Omega_{de}\ll1 $ in the early universe. Thus a
detailed study on the single-parameter models corresponding to cases $n >m \geq
0$ is carried out by using recent observations. The best-fit analysis indicates
that the conformal-age-like models with $n=m+1$, i.e. $L\propto\frac1{Ha}$ in
early universe, are more favored and also the models with smaller $n$ for the
given $n-m$ are found to fit the observations better. The equation of state of
the dark energy in models with $n=m+1 >0$ transits from $w_{de}<-1$ during
inflation to $w_{de}>-1$ in radiation- and matter-dominated epoch, and then
back to $w_{de}<-1$ eventually. The best-fit result of the case $(n=0, m=-1)$
which is so-called $\eta$HDE model proposed in \cite{Huang:2012xm} is the most
favorable model and compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM model.

potentially offers great convenience to mobile users. Yet practical receiver
designs impose technical constraints on its hardware realization, as practical
circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode
the carried information directly. To make theoretical progress, we propose a
general receiver operation, namely, dynamic power splitting (DPS), which splits
the received signal with adjustable power ratio for energy harvesting and
information decoding, separately. Three special cases of DPS, namely, time
switching (TS), static power splitting (SPS) and on-off power splitting (OPS)
are investigated. The TS and SPS schemes can be treated as special cases of
OPS. Moreover, we propose two types of practical receiver architectures,
namely, separated versus integrated information and energy receivers. The
integrated receiver integrates the front-end components of the separated
receiver, thus achieving a smaller form factor. The rate-energy tradeoff for
the two architectures are characterized by a so-called rate-energy (R-E)
region. The optimal transmission strategy is derived to achieve different
rate-energy tradeoffs. With receiver circuit power consumption taken into
account, it is shown that the OPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. For the
ideal case when the receiver circuit does not consume power, the SPS scheme is
optimal for both receivers. In addition, we study the performance for the two
types of receivers under a realistic system setup that employs practical
modulation. Our results provide useful insights to the optimal practical
receiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer

depend on the requirement of perfect recall: players always remember

In games without perfect recall, however, CFR's guarantees do not apply. In
this paper, we present the first regret bound for CFR when applied to a general
class of games with imperfect recall. In addition, we show that CFR applied to
any abstraction belonging to our general class results in a regret bound not

arcmin$^2$ region centered on the 6.7 GHz methanol maser associated with the
RCW 34 star forming region using the 1.4m IRSF telescope at Sutherland. A total
of 1283 objects were detected simultaneously in J, H, and K for an exposure
time of 10800 seconds. The J-H, H-K two-colour diagram revealed a strong
concentration of more than 700 objects with colours similar to what is expected
of reddened classical T Tauri stars. The distribution of the objects on the K
{\it vs} J-K colour-magnitude diagram is also suggestive that a significant
fraction of the 1283 objects is lower mass pre-main sequence stars. We also
present the luminosity function for the subset of about 700 pre-main sequence
stars and show that it suggests ongoing star formation activity for about
$10^7$ years. An examination of the spatial distribution of the pre-main
sequence stars shows that the fainter (older) part of the population is more
dispersed over the observed region and the brighter (younger) subset is more
concentrated around the position of the O8.5V star. This suggests that the
physical effects of the O8.5V star and the two early B-type stars on the
remainder of the cloud out of which they formed, could have played a role in
the onset of the more recent episode of star formation in RCW 34.

described with similar building blocks of icosahedrally coordinated atoms. The
atomic positions of zinc atoms comprise the vertices of these icosahedra and

across the interfaces between the two phases. Near the interface with MgZn2,
transition structures formed in Mg4Zn7 phase, with Zn:Mg atom ratio between

two lasers strongly driving two photoassociative transitions. The theory
predicts the occurrence of a coherence between two excited ro-vibrational bound
states due to the photoassociative dipole-couplings of ground-state d-wave
scattering state to the bound states. We show that this excited-state coherence
significantly influences atom-atom interaction. In particular, this leads to
the enhancement of d-wave elastic scattering and to the suppression of
inelastic scattering. In the presence of an s-wave magnetic Feshbach resonance,
the two lasers can couple the s-wave resonance with the d-wave scattering state
leading to the further enhancement in d-wave scattering at relatively low
energy. Our numerical calculations based on realistic parameters show that
d-wave manipulation would be most effective in case of atoms having excited
diatomic states with narrow natural linewidth. We estimate that at 100 $\mu$K
the inelastic scattering rate in Yb can be reduced to 20 s$^{-1}$ while the
elastic scattering rate can be two orders of magnitude larger.

  We extend this study for baryons produced in all above colliding systems at

differently from mesons but are found to scale with protons for both p+p and
d+Au collisions. In case of Au+Au collisions, the strange baryons behave
differently from protons.
  This study has also been performed on the meson spectra in p+p collisions at
62.4 GeV which lies in between the highest RHIC energy and SPS energy where the
$m_T$ scaling was first observed and we arrive at same conclusions as those at

not scale with pions. Thus $m_T$ scaling which was working well up to p+p

meV. To achieve the last goal certain hurdles have to be overcome involving
particle, nuclear and experimental physics. Nuclear physics is important for
extracting the useful information from the data. One must accurately evaluate
the relevant nuclear matrix elements, a formidable task. To this end, we review
the sophisticated nuclear structure approaches recently been developed, which
give confidence that the needed nuclear matrix elements can be reliably
calculated. From an experimental point of view it is challenging, since the
life times are long and one has to fight against formidable backgrounds. If a
signal is found, it will be a tremendous accomplishment. Then, of course, the
real task is going to be the extraction of the neutrino mass from the
observations. This is not trivial, since current particle models predict the
presence of many mechanisms other than the neutrino mass, which may contribute
or even dominate this process. We will, in particular, consider the following
processes: (i)The neutrino induced, but neutrino mass independent contribution.
(ii)Heavy left and/or right handed neutrino mass contributions.
(iii)Intermediate scalars (doubly charged etc). (iv)Supersymmetric (SUSY)

the signatures of the reaction are searched in a sufficient number of nuclear
isotopes.

statistics and machine learning and almost all the methods that exists in

entropy classification method with feature selection for large dimensional data
such as text datasets that is generative in nature. To tackle the curse of
dimensionality of large data sets, we employ conditional independence
assumption (Naive Bayes) and we perform feature selection simultaneously, by
enforcing a `maximum discrimination' between estimated class conditional
densities. For two class problems, in the proposed method, we use Jeffreys
($J$) divergence to discriminate the class conditional densities. To extend our
method to the multi-class case, we propose a completely new approach by
considering a multi-distribution divergence: we replace Jeffreys divergence by
Jensen-Shannon ($JS$) divergence to discriminate conditional densities of
multiple classes. In order to reduce computational complexity, we employ a
modified Jensen-Shannon divergence ($JS_{GM}$), based on AM-GM inequality. We
show that the resulting divergence is a natural generalization of Jeffreys
divergence to a multiple distributions case. As far as the theoretical
justifications are concerned we show that when one intends to select the best
features in a generative maximum entropy approach, maximum discrimination using
$J-$divergence emerges naturally in binary classification. Performance and
comparative study of the proposed algorithms have been demonstrated on large
dimensional text and gene expression datasets that show our methods scale up
very well with large dimensional datasets.

considerably if one can make use of human mobility in terms of social

centrality and similarity of nodes by using solutions for traditional social
networks, this is mainly because of the transient node contact and the
intermittently connected environment. In this work, we are interested in the
following question: Can we explore some other stable social attributes to
quantify the centrality and similarity of nodes? Taking GPS traces of human
walks from the real world, we find that there exist two known phenomena. One is
public hotspot, the other is personal hotspot. Motivated by this observation,
we present Hoten (hotspot and entropy), a novel routing metric to improve
routing performance in DTNs. First, we use the relative entropy between the
public hotspots and the personal hotspots to compute the centrality of nodes.
Then we utilize the inverse symmetrized entropy of the personal hotspots
between two nodes to compute the similarity between them. Third, we exploit the
entropy of personal hotspots of a node to estimate its personality. Besides, we
propose a method to ascertain the optimized size of hotspot. Finally, we
compare our routing strategy with other state-of-the-art routing schemes
through extensive trace-driven simulations, the results show that Hoten largely
outperforms other solutions, especially in terms of combined overhead/packet
delivery ratio and the average number of hops per message.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1109.4480",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semi-discrete Galerkin formulations of transient wave equations, either with
conforming or discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretizations, typically
lead to large systems of ordinary differential equations. When explicit time
integration is used, the time-step is constrained by the smallest elements in
the mesh for numerical stability, possibly a high price to pay. To overcome
that overly restrictive stability constraint on the time-step, yet without
resorting to implicit methods, explicit local time-stepping schemes (LTS) are
presented here for transient wave equations either with or without damping. In
the undamped case, leap-frog based LTS methods lead to high-order explicit LTS
schemes, which conserve the energy. In the damped case, when energy is no
longer conserved, Adams-Bashforth based LTS methods also lead to explicit LTS
schemes of arbitrarily high accuracy. When combined with a finite element
discretization in space with an essentially diagonal mass matrix, the resulting
time-marching schemes are fully explicit and thus inherently parallel.
Numerical experiments with continuous and discontinuous Galerkin finite element
discretizations validate the theory and illustrate the usefulness of these
local time-stepping methods.

all fields are non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar and have non-canonical

curvature perturbations compared. We confirm that they are indeed not the same

This result leads us to conclude that the notion of adiabaticity is not
invariant under conformal transformations. Using a two-field example we show
that even if in one frame the evolution is adiabatic, meaning that the
curvature perturbation is conserved on super-horizon scales, in general in the
other frame isocurvature perturbations continue to source the curvature
perturbation. We also find that it is possible to realise a particular model in
which curvature perturbations in both frames are conserved but with each being
of different magnitude. These examples highlight that the curvature
perturbation itself, despite being gauge-invariant, does not correspond
directly to an observable. The non-equivalence of the two curvature
perturbations would also be important when considering the addition of Standard

shown to be much longer than that of phonons. We propose an experimental setup

scales is of utmost importance in ecology, both theoretically and for
conservation policies. Species-area relationships (SARs), measuring how the
number of observed species increases upon enlarging the sampled area,
constitute a convenient tool for quantifying the spatial structure of
biodiversity. While general features of species-area curves are quite universal
across ecosystems, some quantitative aspects can change significantly. Several
attempts have been made to link these variations to ecological forces. Within
the framework of spatially explicit neutral models, here we scrutinize the
effect of varying the local population size (i.e. the number of individuals per
site) and the level of habitat saturation (allowing for empty sites). We
conclude that species-area curves become shallower when the local population
size increases, while habitat saturation, unless strongly violated, plays a
marginal role. Our findings provide a plausible explanation of why SARs for
microorganisms are flatter than those for larger organisms.

implications are investigated using the noncommutative gauge theory with the
Seiberg-Witten map expanded scenario. Particularly, the $e^+e^- \to\mu^+ \mu^-$
process is studied with a generalized noncommutative standard model (NCSM)
including massive neutrinos and neutrino-photon interaction. In this model, the
hybrid gauge transformation in the lepton sector is naturally introduced
through the requirement of gauge invariance of the seesaw neutrino mass term.
It is shown that in the NCSM without hybrid gauge transformation the
noncommutative correction to the scattering amplitude of the $e^+e^- \to\mu^+
\mu^-$ process appears only as a phase factor, predicting no new physical
deviation in the cross section. However, when the hybrid feature is considered,
the noncommutative effect appears in the single channel process. The cross
section and angular distribution are analyzed in the laboratory frame including
Earth's rotation. It is proposed that pair production of muons in the upcoming
TeV International Linear Collider (ILC) can provide an ideal opportunity for
exploring not only the NC space-time, but also the mathematical structure of
the corresponding gauge theory.

To realize this effect, the flux bias of the transmon is modulated by a
controllable pseudo-random telegraph noise, resulting in stochastic jumping of
the energy separation between two discrete values. When the jumping is faster
than a dynamical threshold set by the frequency displacement of the levels, the
two separated spectral lines merge into a single narrow-width,
motional-averaged line. With sinusoidal modulation a complex pattern of
additional sidebands is observed. We demonstrate experimentally that the
modulated system remains quantum coherent, with modified transition
frequencies, Rabi couplings, and dephasing rates. These results represent the
first steps towards more advanced quantum simulations using artificial atoms.

synchronizing} if $G$ together with any non-invertible map on $X$ generates a
constant map. It is known (by some recent results proved by P. M. Neumann) that
for some primitive groups $G$ and for some singular transformations $t$ of
uniform kernel (that is, all blocks have the same number of elements), the
semigroup $< G,t>$ does not generate a constant map. Therefore the following
concept is very natural: a primitive group $G$ on $X$ is said to be {\em almost
synchronizing} if $G$ together with any map of non-uniform kernel generates a
constant map. In this paper we use two different methods to provide several
infinite families of groups that are not synchronizing, but are almost
synchronizing. The paper ends with a number of problems on synchronization
likely to attract the attention of experts in computer science, combinatorics
and geometry, groups and semigroups, linear algebra and matrix theory.

Regression, to data with very high dimensions and many more covariates than

improved performance for prediction when compared with other penalised

the associated flares and CMEs. The solar eruptions are very intense involving
X-class flares and extreme CME speeds (average ~2000 km/s). The active regions
in which the GLE events originate are generally large: 1290 msh (median 1010
msh) compared to 934 msh (median: 790 msh) for SEP-producing active regions.
The initial acceleration of GLE-associated CMEs is much larger (by a factor of
2) than that of ordinary CMEs (2.3 km/s2 vs.1 km/s2). The GLE particle release
is delayed with respect to the onset of all electromagnetic signatures of the
eruptions: type II bursts, low frequency type III bursts, soft X-ray flares and
CMEs. The presence of metric type II radio bursts some 17 min (median: 16 min;
range: 3 to 48 min) before the GLE onset indicates shock formation well before
the particle release. The release of GLE particles occurs when the CMEs reach
an average height of ~3.09 Rs for well-connected events. For poorly connected
events, the average CME height at GLE particle release is ~66% larger (mean:
5.18 Rs). The longitudinal dependence is consistent with shock accelerations
because the shocks from poorly connected events need to expand more to cross
the field lines connecting to an Earth observer. The CME height at metric type
II burst onset is in the narrow range 1.29 to 1.8 Rs, with A mean of 1.53 Rs.
The CME heights at metric type II burst onset and GLE particle release
correspond to the minimum and maximum in the Alfven speed profile. The CME
heights at GLE particle release are in good agreement with those obtained from
the velocity dispersion analysis (Reames, 2009a,b) including the source
longitude dependence. We also discuss the implications of the delay of GLE

coding gain), for unknown channel state information at the transmitter and for
maximal rate, can be achieved by approximately universal space-time codes, but
comes at a price of large detection complexity, infeasible for most practical

latter as Ergodic Mutual Information (EMI) code. The EMI code achieves the
maximal multiplexing gain and full diversity is proved in terms of the outage
probability. Contrary to most of the literature, our work is not based on the
elegant but difficult classical algebraic MIMO theory. Instead, the relation
between MIMO and parallel channels is exploited. The theoretical proof of full
diversity is corroborated by means of numerical simulations for many MIMO
scenarios, in terms of outage probability and word error rate of LDPC coded
systems. The full-diversity and full-rate at low detection complexity comes at
a price of a small coding gain loss for outer coding rates close to one, but
this loss vanishes with decreasing coding rate.

for long enough. In this class of models, heavy fields influence the evolution
of adiabatic modes in a manner that is consistent with decoupling of physical
low and high energy degrees of freedom. We emphasize the distinction between
the effective masses of the isocurvature modes and the eigenfrequencies of the
propagating high energy modes. Crucially, we find that the mass gap that
defines the high frequency modes increases with the strength of the turn, even
as the naive heavy (isocurvature) and light (curvature) modes become more
strongly coupled. Adiabaticity is preserved throughout, and the derived
effective field theory remains in the weakly coupled regime, satisfying all
current observational constraints on the resulting primordial power spectrum.
In addition, these models allow for an observably large equilateral
non-Gaussianity.

provides a fundamental standard ruler which is widely used to constrain
cosmological parameters. In most analyses, the comoving length of the ruler is
inferred from a combination of CMB observations and theory. However, this
inferred length may be biased by various non-standard effects in early universe
physics; this can lead to biased inferences of cosmological parameters such as
H_0, \Omega_m and w, so it would be valuable to measure the absolute BAO length
by combining a galaxy redshift survey and a suitable direct low-z distance
measurement. One obstacle is that low-redshift BAO surveys mainly constrain the
ratio r_S / D_V(z), where D_V is a dilation scale which is not directly
observable by standard candles. Here, we find a new approximation D_V(z) \simeq
(3/4) D_L(4z/3) (1+ 4z/3)^{-1} (1 - 0.02455 z^3 + 0.0105 z^4) which connects
D_V to the standard luminosity distance D_L at a somewhat higher redshift; this
is shown to be very accurate (relative error < 0.2 percent) for all
WMAP-compatible Friedmann models at z < 0.4, with very weak dependence on
cosmological parameters H_0, \Omega_m, \Omega_k, w. This provides a route to
measure the absolute BAO length using only observations at z < 0.3, including
type-Ia supernovae, and potentially future H_0-free physical distance
indicators such as gravitational lenses or gravitational wave standard sirens.
This would provide a zero-parameter check of the standard cosmology at 10^3 < z
< 10^5, and can constrain the number of relativistic species N_{eff} with fewer
degeneracies than the CMB.

Lee-Low and Pines theory. On the basis of our model, the influence of
electron-optical phonon interaction onto the graphene electronic spectrum is
examined. In this paper, we only considered doubly degenerate optical phonon
modes of E_2g symmetry near the zone center Gamma. We show analytically that
the energy dispersions of both valance and conduction bands of the pristine
graphene differ significantly than those obtained through the standard electron
self energy calculations due to the electron-phonon interactions. Furthermore,
we prove that the degenerate band structure of the graphene promote the chiral
polaron formation.

coronagraph located along the Sun-Earth line because of the occulting disk.
However, the expansion speed (the speed with which the CME appears to spread in
the sky plane) can be measured by such a coronagraph. In order to convert the
expansion speed to radial speed (which is important for space weather
applications) one can use an empirical relationship between the two that
assumes an average width for all CMEs. If we have the width information from
quadrature observations, we can confirm the relationship between expansion and
radial speeds derived by Gopalswamy et al. (2009a). The STEREO spacecraft were
in qudrature with SOHO (STEREO-A ahead of Earth by 87o and STEREO-B 94o behind
Earth) on 2011 February 15, when a fast Earth-directed CME occurred. The CME
was observed as a halo by the Large-Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO)
on board SOHO. The sky-plane speed was measured by SOHO/LASCO as the expansion
speed, while the radial speed was measured by STEREO-A and STEREO-B. In
addition, STEREO-A and STEREO-B images provided the width of the CME, which is
unknown from Earth view. From the SOHO and STEREO measurements, we confirm the
relationship between the expansion speed (Vexp) and radial speed (Vrad) derived
previously from geometrical considerations (Gopalswamy et al. 2009a): Vrad =
1/2 (1 + cot w)Vexp, where w is the half width of the CME. STEREO-B images of
the CME, we found that CME had a full width of 76o, so w = 38o. This gives the
relation as Vrad = 1.14 Vexp. From LASCO observations, we measured Vexp = 897
km/s, so we get the radial speed as 1023 km/s. Direct measurement of radial
speed yields 945 km/s (STEREO-A) and 1058 km/s (STEREO-B). These numbers are
different only by 7.6% and 3.4% (for STEREO-A and STEREO-B, respectively) from

  Relativity for Uniform Linear Motion?","8 pages (12pt), 3 figures. Comments pertaining to arXiv:1205.0096",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I show that no force or torque is generated in cases involving a charge and a
magnet with their relative velocity zero, in any inertial frame of reference. A
recent suspicion of an anomalous torque and conflict with relativity in this
case is rested. What is distilled as `Lorentz force' in standard
electrodynamics, with relative velocity as the parameter, is an
under-representation of two distinct physical phenomena, an effect due to
Lorentz contraction and another due to the Ampere current-current interaction,
rolled into one due to prejudice from special relativity applied only to linear
motion. When both are included in the analysis of the problem there is no
anomalous force or torque, ensuring the validity of Poincare's principle of
relativity. The issue of validity of electrodynamics without the concept of
absolute rest, however, is subtle and empirically open when general noninertial
motion is considered, as I will discuss in another paper.

represent possible drug to be docked to the active site of the target protein.
The structure is represented as a tree where each non-empty node represents a
functional group. It is assumed that the active site configuration of the
target protein is known with position of the essential residues. In this paper
the interaction energy of the ligands with the protein target is minimized.
Moreover, the size of the tree is difficult to obtain and it will be different
for different active sites. To overcome the difficulty, a variable tree size
configuration is used for designing ligands. The optimization is done using a
novel Neighbourhood Based Genetic Algorithm (NBGA) which uses dynamic
neighbourhood topology. To get variable tree size, a variable-length version of
the above algorithm is devised. To judge the merit of the algorithm, it is
initially applied on the well known Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

co-operative box pushing problem as a multi objective optimization problem
using modified Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization. The method proposed
here allows both turning and translation of the box, during shift to a desired
goal position. We have employed local planning scheme to determine the
magnitude of the forces applied by the two mobile robots perpendicularly at
specific locations on the box to align and translate it in each distinct step
of motion of the box, for minimization of both time and energy. Finally the
results are compared with the results obtained by solving the same problem
using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The proposed scheme
is found to give better results compared to NSGA-II.
