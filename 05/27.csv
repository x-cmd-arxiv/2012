statistical mechanics for many years. In the absence of a closed-form solution,
much of the past efforts have focused on locating its critical manifold,
trajectory in the parameter $\{q, e^J\}$ space where $J$ is the reduced
interaction, along which the free energy is singular. However, except in
isolated cases, antiferromagnetic (AF) models with $J<0$ have been largely
neglected. In this paper we consider the Potts model with AF interactions
focusing on deducing its critical manifold in exact and/or closed-form
expressions.
  We first re-examine the known critical frontiers in light of AF interactions.
For the square lattice we confirm the Potts self-dual point to be the sole
critical point for $J>0$. We also locate its critical frontier for $J<0$ and
find it to coincide with a solvability condition observed by Baxter in 1982.
For the honeycomb lattice we show that the known critical point holds for {all}
$J$, and determine its critical $q_c = \frac 1 2 (3+\sqrt 5) = 2.61803$ beyond
which there is no transition. For the triangular lattice we confirm the known
critical point to hold only for $J>0$.
  More generally we consider the centered-triangle (CT) and Union-Jack (UJ)
lattices consisting of mixed $J$ and $K$ interactions, and deduce critical
manifolds under homogeneity hypotheses. For K=0 the CT lattice is the diced
lattice, and we determine its critical manifold for all $J$ and find $q_c =
3.32472$. For K=0 the UJ lattice is the square lattice and from this we deduce
both the $J>0$ and $J<0$ critical manifolds and find $q_c=3$ for the square
lattice. Our theoretical predictions are compared with recent tensor-based
numerical results and Monte Carlo simulations.

electrodynamics in the general case of material media that contain linearly
polarizable as well as linearly magnetizable substances. The excitation source
is taken to be a point-dipole, either electric or magnetic, and the monitored
field at the observation point can be electric or magnetic, regardless of the
nature of the source dipole. The electric and magnetic susceptibility tensors
of the material system may vary from point to point in space, but they cannot
be functions of time. In the case of spatially non-dispersive media, the only
other constraint on the local susceptibility tensors is that they be symmetric
at each and every point. The proof is readily extended to media that exhibit
spatial dispersion: For reciprocity to hold, the electric susceptibility tensor
Chi_E_mn that relates the complex-valued magnitude of the electric dipole at
location r_m to the strength of the electric field at r_n must be the transpose
of Chi_E_nm. Similarly, the necessary and sufficient condition for the magnetic
susceptibility tensor is Chi_M_mn = Chi^T_M_nm.

the cone, because the reflected beam picks up an orbital angular momentum that

lifetimes, and the central densities of their environments). In particular, the
radio and kinetic luminosity functions of FRIIs are investigated using the
complete, flux limited radio catalogues of 3CRR and Best et al. We construct
multidimensional Monte Carlo simulations using semi-analytical models of FRII
radio source growth to create artificial samples of radio galaxies. Unlike
previous studies, we compare radio luminosity functions found with both the
observed and simulated data to explore the fundamental source parameters. We
allow the source physical properties to co-evolve with redshift, and we find
that all the investigated parameters most likely undergo cosmological
evolution. Strikingly, we find that the break in the kinetic luminosity
function must undergo redshift evolution of at least (1+z)^3. The fundamental
parameters are strongly degenerate, and independent constraints are necessary
to draw more precise conclusions. We use the estimated kinetic luminosity
functions to set constraints on the duty cycles of these powerful radio
sources. A comparison of the duty cycles of powerful FRIIs with those
determined from radiative luminosities of AGN of comparable black hole mass
suggests a transition in behaviour from high to low redshifts, corresponding to
either a drop in the typical black hole mass of powerful FRIIs at low
redshifts, or a transition to a kinetically-dominated, radiatively-inefficient

the prediction of Grossmann and Lohse.
  For $\Ra > \Ra_1^*$ the data rise above the classical-state power-law and
show greater scatter. In analogy to similar behavior observed for $\Gamma =
0.50$, we interpret this observation as the onset of the transition to the
ultimate state. Within our resolution this onset occurs at nearly the same
value of $\Ra_1^*$ as it does for $\Gamma = 0.50$. This differs from an earlier
estimate by Roche {\it et al.} which yielded a transition at $\Ra_U \simeq
1.3\times 10^{11} \Gamma^{-2.5\pm 0.5}$. A $\Gamma$-independent $\Ra^*_1$ would
suggest that the boundary-layer shear transition is induced by fluctuations on
a scale less than the sample dimensions rather than by a global
$\Gamma$-dependent flow mode. Within the resolution of the measurements the
heat transport above $\Ra_1^*$ is equal for the two $\Gamma$ values, suggesting
a universal aspect of the ultimate-state transition and properties. The
enhanced scatter of \Nu\ in the transition region, which exceeds the
experimental resolution, indicates an intrinsic irreproducibility of the state
of the system.

vector algebra that expands on it in two ways:
  1. In addition to scalars and vectors, it defines new objects representing
subspaces of any dimension.
  2. It defines a product that's strongly motivated by geometry and can be
taken between any two objects. For example, the product of two vectors taken in
a certain way represents their common plane.
  This system was invented by William Clifford and is more commonly known as
Clifford algebra. It's actually older than the vector algebra that we use today
(due to Gibbs) and includes it as a subset. Over the years, various parts of
Clifford algebra have been reinvented independently by many people who found
they needed it, often not realizing that all those parts belonged in one
system. This suggests that Clifford had the right idea, and that geometric
algebra, not the reduced version we use today, deserves to be the standard
""vector algebra."" My goal in these notes is to describe geometric algebra from
that standpoint and illustrate its usefulness. The notes are work in progress;
I'll keep adding new topics as I learn them myself.

$\gamma$ immersed in $\R^n$. Equipping the ambient Euclidean space with a
vector field $\ca:\R^n\rightarrow\R^n$ and a function $f:\R^n\rightarrow\R$, we
assume the energy of $\gamma$ is smallest when the curvature $\k$ of $\gamma$
is parallel to $\c = (\ca \circ \gamma) + (f \circ \gamma) \tau$, where $\tau$
is the unit vector field spanning the tangent bundle of $\gamma$. This leads us
to consider a generalisation of the Helfrich functional $\SH$, defined as the
sum of the integral of $|\k-\c|^2$ and $\lambda$-weighted length. We primarily
consider the case where $f:\R^n\rightarrow\R$ is uniformly bounded in
$C^\infty(\R^n)$ and $\ca:\R^n\rightarrow\R^n$ is an affine transformation. Our
first theorem is that the steepest descent $L^2$-gradient flow of $\SH$ with
smooth initial data exists for all time and subconverges to a smooth solution
of the Euler-Lagrange equation for a limiting functional. We additionally
perform some asymptotic analysis. In the broad class of gradient flows for
which we obtain global existence and subconvergence, there exist many examples
for which full convergence of the flow does not hold. This may manifest in its
simplest form as solutions translating or spiralling off to infinity. We prove
that if either $\ca$ and $f$ are constant, the derivative of $\ca$ is
invertible and non-vanishing, or $(f,\gamma_0)$ satisfy a `properness'
condition, then one obtains full convergence of the flow and uniqueness of the
limit. This last result strengthens a well-known theorem of Kuwert, Sch\""atzle

theory for the spinon excitations and their coupling to the phonons. The
coupling of acoustic longitudinal phonons to spinons gives rise to
hybridization of spinons and phonons, and provides an enhanced $B$-dependant
scattering of phonons on spinons. Using a memory matrix approach, we show that
the interplay between several scattering mechanisms, namely: umklapp, disorder

Mercury, such as Einstein's theory; it led to a Perihelion like the one
predicted by Newton's law, and, it could not explain the deflection of light
near the sun, because in Nordstr\""om's theory the velocity of light was
constant. Einstein's 1913-1914 theory, the field equations of which were not
generally covariant, remained without empirical support. Thus a decision in
favor of one or the other theory - Einstein's or Nordstr\""om's - was impossible
on empirical grounds. Einstein began to study Nordstr\""om's theory from the
theoretical point of view and he developed his own Einstein-Nordstr\""om theory

generally covariant formalism is presented from which Nordstr\""om's theory
follows if a single assumption is made that it is possible to choose preferred
systems of reference in such a way that the velocity of light is constant; and
this was done after Einstein had failed to develop a generally covariant

and technological applications. These very simple systems, composed by
agglomerations of mesoscopic particles, are characterized, in specific regimes,
by a large number of metastable states and an extreme sensitivity (e.g., in
sound transmission) on the arrangement of grains; they are not substantially
affected by thermal phenomena, but can be controlled by mechanical
solicitations. Laser emission from shaken granular matter is so far unexplored;
here we provide experimental evidence that it can be affected and controlled by
the status of motion of the granular, we also find that competitive random
lasers can be observed. We hence demonstrate the potentialities of gravity
affected moving disordered materials for optical applications, and open the
road to a variety of novel interdisciplinary investigations, involving modern
statistical mechanics and disordered photonics.

  Oscillating Coefficients","My PhD thesis oral defense PPT",,,,"math.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Rosseland equation is one of the most popular models of the
conduction-radiation coupled heat transfer in the thermal protection system.
The well-posedness, the corresponding mathematical theory and the Multi-scale
analysis method for the Rosseland-type equations with small periodic
oscillating coefficients are concerned, which provides a theoretical basis for
the Multi-scale computation of the conduction-radiation coupled heat transfer
in an optically thick medium with a small periodic structure.
  The global well-posedness of the Rosseland-type (parabolic) equations is
given in the first part. The corresponding solving algorithms and their
convergence analysis are presented in the second part. In the third part we
study the well-posedness and the second-order two-scale asymptotic expansion of
the Rosseland-type (elliptic) equations with small periodic oscillating
coefficients. The convergence analysis of the second-order two-scale asymptotic
expansion is studied in the last part.

channel (MAC) with side information partially known (estimated or sensed
version) at the transmitters. Actually, we extend the lattice strategies used
by Philosof-Zamir for the MAC with full side information at the transmitters to
the partially known case. We show that the sensed or estimated side information
reduces the rate regions, the same as that occurs for Costa Gaussian channel.

rigorous bounds on block error probability and by numerically simulating them.
We evaluate our bounds for quantum erasure channels with coding block lengths
between 2^10 and 2^20, and we report the results of simulations for quantum
erasure channels, quantum depolarizing channels, and ""BB84"" channels with
coding block lengths up to N = 1024. For quantum erasure channels, we observe
that high quantum data rates can be achieved for block error rates less than
10^(-4) and that somewhat lower quantum data rates can be achieved for quantum
depolarizing and BB84 channels. Our results here also serve as bounds for and
simulations of private classical data transmission over these channels,
essentially due to Renes' duality bounds for privacy amplification and
classical data transmission of complementary observables. Future work might be
able to improve upon our numerical results for quantum depolarizing and BB84
channels by employing a polar coding rule other than the heuristic used here.
