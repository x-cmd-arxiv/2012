jet of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 111 on sub-pc scales. We make use of
published X-ray observations of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) and new 43GHz VLBA
images to track the jet knots ejection. We find that the superluminal jet
coexists with the mildly relativistic outflows on sub-pc scales, possibly
indicating a transverse stratification of a global flow. The two are roughly in
pressure equilibrium, with the UFOs potentially providing additional support
for the initial jet collimation. The UFOs are much more massive than the jet,
but their kinetic power is probably about an order of magnitude lower, at least
for the observations considered here. However, their momentum flux is
equivalent and both of them are powerful enough to exert a concurrent feedback
impact on the surrounding environment. A link between these components is
naturally predicted in the context of MHD models for jet/outflow formation.
However, given the high radiation throughput of AGNs, radiation pressure should
also be taken into account. From the comparison with the long-term 2-10keV RXTE
light curve we find that the UFOs are preferentially detected during periods of
increasing flux. We also find the possibility to place the UFOs within the
known X-ray dips-jet ejection cycles, which has been shown to be a strong proof
of the disc-jet connection, in analogue with stellar-mass black holes. However,
given the limited number of observations presently available, these relations
are only tentative and additional spectral monitoring is needed to test them
conclusively.

vector field which possibly is only a distribution in the space variable. We
quantify the regularising properties of an arbitrary continuous path $w$ on the
existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equation. In this context we
introduce the notion of $\rho$-\tmtextit{irregularity} and show that it plays a
key role in some instances of the regularisation by noise phenomenon. In the
particular case of a function $w$ sampled according to the law of the
fractional Brownian motion of Hurst index $H \in (0,1)$, we prove that almost
surely the ODE admits a solution for all $b$ in the Besov-H\~A{\P}lder space
$B^{\alpha+1}_{\infty , \infty}$ with $\alpha >-1/2H$. If $\alpha >1-1/2H$ then
the solution is unique among a natural set of continuous solutions. If $H>1/3$
and $\alpha >3/2-1/2H$ or if $\alpha >2-1/2H$ then the equation admits a unique
Lipschitz flow. Note that when $\alpha <0$ the vector field $b$ is only a
distribution, nonetheless there exists a natural notion of solution for which
the above results apply.

production have not yet been clearly understood, and there is no established
theory that can account for the statistics of their production, in particular,
the number of DSBs per base pair per unit Gy, here denoted by P1, which is the
most important parameter for evaluating the degree of risk posed by DSBs. Here,
using the single-molecule observation method with giant DNA molecules (166
kbp), we evaluate the number of DSBs caused by gamma-ray irradiation. We find
that P1 is nearly inversely proportional to the DNA concentration above a
certain threshold DNA concentration. A simple model that accounts for the
marked decrease of P1 shows that it is necessary to consider the
characteristics of giant DNA molecules as semiflexible polymers to interpret
the intrinsic mechanism of DSBs.

the coherence-length (upper-critical field) anisotropy, thereby explaining
recent results on the critical current in these materials. In less anisotropic

the QD. The interplay between the bulk Kondo effect and the so called Kondo box

by the application of the magnetic field. The crossover between these two

differential conductance develops a sequence of Fano-Kondo antiresonances due
to destructive interferences between the discrete quantum ring levels and the
conducting Kondo channel provided by the leads. In the strong coupling regime
the differential conductance has very sharp resonances when one of the Kondo
discrete sub-level characterizing the Kondo box is tunned by the applied
potential. The conductance, the current fluctuations and the Fano coefficient

advanced statistics based on weighted shots outperform traditional statistics

target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) for single-fraction
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).Methods: In previous publications on the margin
between the CTV and the PTV, a Gaussian function with zero mean was assumed for
the systematic error and the ma-chine systematic error was completely ignored.
In this work we adopted a Dirac delta function for the machine system-atic
error for a given machine with nonzero mean systematic error. Mathematical
formulas for calculating the CTV-PTV margin for single-fraction SRS treatments
were proposed. Results: Margins for single fraction treatments were derived
such that the CTVs received the prescribed dose in 95% of the SRS patients. The
margin defined in this study was machine specific and accounted for nonzero
mean systematic error. The differences between our formulas and a previously
published formula were discussed. Conclusion: Clinical margin formulas were
proposed for deter-mining the margin between the CTV and the PTV in SRS
treatments. Previous margin's recipes, being derived specifi-cally for
conventional treatments, may be inappropriate for single-fraction SRS and could
result in geometric miss of the target and even treatment failure for machines
possessing of large systematic errors.

photometric correction techniques, including polynomial detrending and
pixel-mapping, that yield consistent results at the 1-sigma level. In a second

yields an occultation depth of 131+-28ppm, translating to a brightness
temperature of 2360+-300 K in the IRAC-4.5 micron channel. This occultation
depth suggests a low Bond albedo coupled to an inefficient heat transport from
the planetary dayside to the nightside, or else possibly that the 4.5-micron
observations probe atmospheric layers that are hotter than the maximum
equilibrium temperature (i.e., a thermal inversion layer or a deep hot layer).
The measured occultation phase and duration are consistent with a circular

simulations of the Pink model [D. Pink {\it et al.}, Biochemistry {\bf 19}, 349

main transition temperature that is systematically below experimental values.
This resolves an issue that was first pointed out by Corvera and co-workers
[Phys. Rev. E {\bf 47}, 696 (1993)]. In order to yield the correct transition
temperature, the strength of the van der Waals coupling in the Pink model must
be increased; by using finite-size scaling, a set of optimal values is
proposed. We also provide finite-size scaling evidence that the Pink model
belongs to the universality class of the two-dimensional Ising model. This
finding holds irrespective of the number of conformational states. Finally, we
address the main transition in the presence of quenched disorder, which may
arise in situations where the membrane is deposited on a rough support. In this
case, we observe a stable multi-domain structure of gel and fluid domains, and
the absence of a sharp transition in the thermodynamic limit.

demand very tight tolerances on alignment and stability of their elements:
magnets, accelerating cavities, vacuum chambers, etc. In this article we
describe the instruments developed for and used in such accelerators as
Fermilab's Tevatron (FNAL, Batavia, IL USA) and for the studies toward an
International Linear Collider (ILC). The instrumentation includes Hydrostatic
Level Sensors (HLS) for very low frequency measurements. We present design
features of the sensors, outline their technical parameters, describe test and

results of the ground motion measurements with these detectors will be

sample would have been contaminated at the 30% -40% level by simple automated
classification methods (e.g. based on Sersic index). In luminosity selected
samples, both clusters and groups show high fractions of Sa galaxies. The ETG
fractions never rise above ~50% in the clusters, which is low compared to the
fractions observed in clusters at z~1. However, ETG plus Sa fractions are
similar to those observed for ETGs in clusters at z~1. Bulge-dominated galaxies
visually classified as Sas might also be ETGs with tidal features or merger
remnants. They are mainly red and passive, and span a large range in
luminosity. Their star formation seems to have been quenched before
experiencing a morphological transformation. Because their fraction is smaller
at lower redshifts, they might be the spiral population that evolves into ETGs.
For mass-selected samples, the ETG fraction show no significant evolution with
respect to local clusters, suggesting that morphological transformations occur
at lower masses and densities. The ETG mass-size relation shows evolution
towards smaller sizes at higher redshift in both clusters and groups, while the
late-type mass-size relation matches that observed locally. The group ETG red
sequence shows lower zero points and larger scatters than in clusters, both
expected to be an indication of a younger galaxy population. The estimated age
difference is small when compared to the difference in age at different galaxy
masses.

required to explain the anomalies consistent with the observations of other
experiments. At the same time, there is a strong tension between the positive
signals of LSND and MB and the null results of nu_e and nu_mu disappearance
experiments. We explore a scenario, first proposed in \cite{Nelson:2010hz},
where the presence of an additional heavy sterile neutrino (with mass well
above an eV) can alleviate tension between LSND, MB and the null results of
disappearance experiments. We compare and contrast this 3+1+1 scenario with the
more standard 3+1 scenario and carry out global fits to all oscillation data
including new 2011 MB anti-nu data. We find that the tension can be somewhat
alleviated and that a phenomenologically viable window for the heavy neutrino,
consistent with rare decays and BBN constraints, can be found if the fifth
neutrino has a mass of order 0.3 - 10 GeV. We also find, however, that the 2011
MB anti-nu data exacerbates the tension with null experiments in both the 3+1

improvement in the global fit. We also discuss the implications of an
additional neutrino for the reactor and gallium anomalies, and show that an
oscillation explanation of the anomalies is disfavored by cosmological

processes such as mergers, accretion and the gravitational interaction with

spherical or elliptical bins and the velocity distributions are often assumed
to be constant within those bins. However, the velocity anisotropy, which
describes differences between the radial and tangential velocity dispersion,
has recently been show to have a strong dependence on direction in the triaxial
halos formed in cosmological simulations. In this study we derive properties of
particles in cones parallel or perpendicular to the collision axis of merger
remnants. We find that the velocity anisotropy has a strong dependence on
direction. The finding that the direction-dependence of the velocity anisotropy

a minority (~45%) of nearby Compton-thick AGN have strong Si-absorption

dust attenuation. The majority (~60%) are star-formation dominated (AGN:SB<0.5)
at mid-IR wavelengths and lack the spectral signatures of AGN activity at
optical wavelengths, most likely because the AGN emission-lines are
optically-extinguished. Those Compton-thick AGN hosted in low-inclination angle
galaxies exhibit a narrow-range in Si-absorption (S_9.7 ~ 0-0.3), which is
consistent with that predicted by clumpy-torus models. However, on the basis of
the IR spectra and additional lines of evidence, we conclude that the dominant
contribution to the observed mid-IR dust extinction is dust located in the host
galaxy (i.e., due to disturbed morphologies; dust-lanes; galaxy inclination
angles) and not necessarily a compact obscuring torus surrounding the central
engine.

III]4959,5007 emission-line doublet of eight high-redshift (z=1.4-3.4)
ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) that host Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) activity, including known sub-millimetre luminous galaxies (SMGs). The
targets have moderate radio luminosities that are typical of high-redshift
ULIRGs (L(1.4GHz)=10^(24)-10^(25)W/Hz) and therefore are not radio-loud AGN. We
de-couple kinematic components due to the galaxy dynamics and mergers from
those due to outflows. We find evidence in the four most luminous systems (L([O
III])>~10^(43)erg/s) for the signatures of large-scale energetic outflows:
extremely broad [O III] emission (FWHM ~ 700-1400km/s) across ~4-15kpc, with
high velocity offsets from the systemic redshifts (up to ~850km/s). The four
less luminous systems have lower quality data displaying weaker evidence for
spatially extended outflows. We estimate that these outflows are potentially
depositing energy into their host galaxies at considerable rates
(~10^(43)-10^(45)erg/s); however, due to the lack of constraints on the density
of the outflowing material and the structure of the outflow, these estimates
should be taken as illustrative only. Based on the measured maximum velocities
(v(max)~400-1400km/s) the outflows observed are likely to unbind some fraction
of the gas from their host galaxies, but are unlikely to completely remove gas
from the galaxy haloes. By using a combination of energetic arguments and a
comparison to ULIRGs without clear evidence for AGN activity, we show that the
AGN activity could be the dominant power source for driving all of the observed
outflows, although star formation may also play a significant role in some of
the sources.

Suzaku in March 2006 for a net exposure of \sim88 ks. The source was detected
at an average 10-60 keV flux of \sim4 x10^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1. The
phase-averaged spectrum is reproduced well by combining a negative and positive
power-law times exponential cutoff (NPEX) model modified at \sim 37 keV by a
cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF). The phase-resolved analysis
shows that the spectra at the bright phases are well fit by the NPEX with CRSF
model. On the other hand, the spectrum in the dim phase lacks the NPEX
high-energy cutoff component, and the CRSF can be reproduced by either an
emission or an absorption profile. When fitting the dim phase spectrum with the
NPEX plus Gaussian model, we find that the feature is better described in terms
of an emission rather than an absorption profile. The statistical significance
of this result, evaluated by means of an F-test, is between 2.91 x 10^-3 and
1.53 x 10^-5, taking into account the systematic errors in the background
evaluation of HXD-PIN. We find that, the emission profile is more feasible than
the absorption one for comparing the physical parameters in other phases.
Therefore, we have possibly detected an emission line at the cyclotron
resonance energy in the dim phase.

sets and analysis procedures can lead to systematic underestimates of the

for the 15 other X-ray transients with low-mass donors suggests that this
effect may significantly reduce the black hole mass estimates in several other
cases, most notably that of GRO J0422+32. With these revisions, our analysis of
the black hole mass distribution in soft X-ray transients does not suggest any
""mass gap"" between the low end of the distribution and the maximum theoretical
neutron star mass, as has been identified in previous studies. Nevertheless, we
find that the mass distribution retains other previously identified

that the theory of diffraction by wedges developed a century ago by Sommerfeld

general-relativistic quantum field theory during the last quarter of the
twentieth century: the vacuum energy associated with an infinitely thin,
straight cosmic string, and (after an interchange of time with a space
coordinate) the apparent vacuum energy of empty space as viewed by an
accelerating observer. In a sense the string problem is more elementary than
the wedge, since Sommerfeld's technique was to relate the wedge problem to that
of a conical manifold by the method of images. Indeed, Minkowski space, as well
as all cone and wedge problems, are related by images to an infinitely sheeted
master manifold, which we call Dowker space. We review the research in this
area and exhibit in detail the vacuum expectation values of the energy density
and pressure of a scalar field in Dowker space and the cone and wedge spaces
that result from it. We point out that the (vanishing) vacuum energy of
Minkowski space results, from the point of view of Dowker space, from the
quantization of angular modes, in precisely the way that the Casimir energy of
a toroidal closed universe results from the quantization of Fourier modes; we
hope that this understanding dispels any lingering doubts about the reality of

in solids carry electric charge and spin, respectively. There are, however,
other properties of charge carriers that might be exploited in new families of
devices. In particular, if there are two or more conduction (or valence) band
extrema in momentum space, then confining charge carriers in one of these
valleys allows the possibility of valleytronic devices. Such valley
polarization has been demonstrated by using strain and magnetic fields, but
neither of these approaches allow for dynamic control. Recently, optical
control of valley occupancy in graphene with broken inversion symmetry has been
proposed but remains experimentally difficult to realize. Here we demonstrate
that optical pumping with circularly-polarized light can achieve complete
dynamic valley polarization in monolayer MoS2, a two dimensional (2D)
non-centrosymmetric crystal with direct energy gaps at two valleys. Moreover,
this polarization is retained for longer than 1 ns. Our results demonstrate the
viability of optical valley control and valley-based electronic and
optoelectronic applications in MoS2 monolayers.

the problem was proposed and partially solved by Jerison and Lee for CR

can be translated in terms of the study of a fully nonlinear equation of type

points of a suitable geometric functional constrained to pseudohermitian
structures of unit volume. Thanks to this variational property, we establish a
Obata type result for the problem and also compute the infimum of the
functional on the CR sphere. Furthermore, we show that this value is an upper
bound for the corresponding one on any compact CR manifolds and, assuming the
CR Yamabe invariant is positive, we prove that such an upper bound is only

(2011), we found a total of 1054 dynamically distinct voids in the SDSS with
radius larger than 10h^-1 Mpc. The voids are underdense, with delta rho/rho <
-0.9 in their centers. Here we study the photometric properties of these void
galaxies. We look at the u - r colours as an indication of star formation
activity and the inverse concentration index as an indication of galaxy type.
We find that void galaxies are statistically bluer than galaxies found in
higher density environments with the same magnitude distribution. We examine
the colours of the galaxies as a function of magnitude, and we fit each colour
distribution with a double-Gaussian model for the red and blue subpopulations.
As we move from bright to dwarf galaxies, the population of red galaxies
steadily decreases and the fraction of blue galaxies increases in both voids
and walls, however the fraction of blue galaxies in the voids is always higher
and bluer than in the walls. We also split the void and wall galaxies into
samples depending on galaxy type. We find that late type void galaxies are
bluer than late type wall galaxies and the same holds for early galaxies. We
also find that early type, dwarf void galaxies are blue in colour. We also
study the properties of void galaxies as a function of their distance from the
center of the void. We find very little variation in the properties, such as
magnitude, colour and type, of void galaxies as a function of their location in
the void. The only exception is that the dwarf void galaxies may live closer to
the center. The centers of voids have very similar density contrast and hence
all void galaxies live in very similar density environments (ABRIDGED)

systematic cross-correlation study of the following key parameters:
$\Gamma_{2-10keV}$, $L_{2-10keV}$, $L_{bol}$, $L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$,
$\kappa_{2-10keV}$, $\kappa_{5100A}$, FWHM$_{H\beta}$, M$_{BH}$, $\alpha_{ox}$,
$\alpha_{X}$ and $\alpha_{UV}$, and identify various strong correlations among
these parameters. The principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on the
correlation matrix of the above parameters, which shows that the three physical
parameters, i.e. black hole mass, mass accretion rate and Eddington ratio,
drive the majority of the correlations. This is consistent with PCA results
found from previous optical spectral studies.
  We produce various mean SEDs classified by each of the key parameters. Most
parameters, except L$_{bol}$, show similar systematic changes in the mean SEDs
such that the temperature at which the disc peaks is correlated with the ratio
of power in the disc versus the Comptonised components and the hard X-ray
spectral index. This underlying change in SED shape shows that AGN do exhibit
intrinsically different spectral states. This is superficially similar to the
SED differences in BHB seen as $\lambda_{Edd}$ increases, but the analogy does
not hold in detail. Only objects with the highest $\lambda_{Edd}$ appear to
correspond to a BHB spectral state (the disc dominated high/soft state). The
AGN with typical mass accretion rates have spectra which do not match well with
any state observed in BHB. We speculate that this could be due to the presence
of a powerful UV line driven disc wind, which complicates simple mass scaling
between stellar and supermassive black holes.

depends not only on the refractive index n of the liquid, but also on the phase
angle psi_0 of the Fresnel reflection coefficient of the mirror, which could be
anywhere between 0^{\circ} and 180^{\circ}. Depending on the value of psi_0,
the momentum per incident photon picked up by the mirror covers the range
between the Abraham and Minkowski values, i.e., the interval
(2\hbarw_0/nc,2n\hbarw_0/c). Here \hbar is the reduced Planck constant, w_0 is
the frequency of the incident photon, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. We
argue that a simple experimental setup involving a dielectric slab of
refractive index n, a vibrating mirror placed a short distance behind the slab,
a collimated, monochromatic light beam illuminating the mirror through the
slab, and an interferometer to measure the phase of the reflected beam, is all
that is needed to deduce the precise magnitude of the radiation pressure on a
submerged mirror. In the proposed experiment, the transparent slab plays the
role of the submerging liquid (even though it remains detached from the mirror
at all times), and the adjustable gap between the mirror and the slab simulates
the variable phase-angle psi_0. The phase of the reflected beam, measured as a
function of time during one oscillation period of the mirror, then provides the
information needed to determine the gap-dependence of the reflected beam's
Doppler shift and, consequently, the radiation pressure experienced by the
mirror.

preconditioner which takes an advantage of the recursive hierarchy in the
structure of the global matrices. In particular, the matrices posses a
recursive hierarchical two-by-two structure, with one of the submatrices block
diagonal. Each one of the diagonal blocks in this submatrix is closely related
to the deterministic mean-value problem, and the action of its inverse is in
the implementation approximated by inner loops of Krylov iterations. Thus our
hierarchical Schur complement preconditioner combines, on each level in the
approximation of the hierarchical structure of the global matrix, the idea of
Schur complement with loops for a number of mutually independent inner Krylov
iterations, and several matrix-vector multiplications for the off-diagonal
blocks. Neither the global matrix, nor the matrix of the preconditioner need to
be formed explicitly. The ingredients include only the number of stiffness

tearing instability and will develop magnetic islands that grow due to magnetic
reconnection. We investigate whether the growth of magnetic islands in a
current sheet can continue indefinitely, or in the case of the heliosheath
until reaching a neighboring current sheet, and at what rate the islands grow.
We investigate the development and growth of magnetic islands using a
particle-in-cell code, starting from particle noise. Performing a scaling of
the growth of magnetic islands versus the system size, we find that the growth
rate is independent of the system size up to the largest simulation we were
able to complete. The islands are able to continue growing as long as they
merge with each other and maintain a high aspect ratio. Otherwise there is not
enough magnetic tension to sustain reconnection. When applied to the sectored
magnetic fields in the heliosheath, we show that the islands can continue
growing until they reach the sector width and do so in much less time than it
takes for the islands to convect through the heliosheath.

characterized by intermittent connectivity amongst the nodes and communication
largely depends upon the mobility of the participating nodes. The network being
highly dynamic, traditional MANET protocols cannot be applied and the nodes
must adhere to store-carry-forward mechanism. Nodes do not have the information
about the network topology, number of participating nodes and the location of
the destination node. Hence, message transfer reliability largely depends upon
the mobility pattern of the nodes. In this paper we have tried to find the
impact of RWP (Random Waypoint) mobility on packet delivery ratio. We estimate
mobility factors like number of node encounters, contact duration(link time)
and inter-contact time which in turn depends upon parameters like playfield
area (total network area), number of nodes, node velocity, bit-rate and RF
range of the nodes. We also propose a restricted form of RWP mobility model,
called the affinity based mobility model. The network scenario consists of a
source and a destination node that are located at two extreme corners of the
square playfield (to keep a maximum distance between them) and exchange data
packets with the aid of mobile 'helper' nodes. The source node and the
destination node are static. The mobile nodes only help in relaying the
message. We prove how affinity based mobility model helps in augmenting the
network reliability thereby increasing the message delivery ratio and reduce
message delivery latency.

superradiant scattering occurs for frequencies in the range $\omega<m\Omega$,
where $\Omega$ is the angular frequency of the black hole and $m$ is the

but important challenge in molecular physics and chemistry. Collective cavity
cooling of molecules is a promising method that does not rely on molecular
energy level and thus can be applied to all molecules in principle. However,
the initial lack of cold molecules leads to the difficulty in its experimental
implementation. We show that efficient collective sympathetic cooling of
molecules to sub-mK temperatures using a large ensemble of atoms within a
cavity is feasible. This approach is a new type of sympathetic cooling which
does not rely on direct collisions between atoms and molecules, but utilizes
thermalization via their mutual interaction with a cavity field. Two important
mechanisms are identified. This include: (1) giant enhancement of cavity
optical field from the efficient scattering of the pump light by the atoms; (2)
cavity-mediated collective interaction between the atoms and the molecules. We
show an optimal cavity detuning for maximizing cooling, which is dependent on
the atom and molecule numbers. We determine a threshold for the molecular pump
strength and show that it is independent of molecule number when the number of
atoms is much greater than the molecules. This can be reduced by orders of
magnitude when compared to cavity cooling of single molecular species only.
Using this new sympathetic cavity cooling technique, cooling molecules to
sub-mK within a high-Q cavity could be within reach of experimental
demonstration.

electron-phonon interaction has important consequences on the dynamics,
especially when the quantum dot and cavity are tuned out of resonance, in which
case the phonons may add or remove energy leading to an effective non-resonant
coupling between quantum dot and cavity. The system is investigated using two
different theoretical approaches: (i) a second-order expansion in the bare
phonon coupling constant, and (ii) an expansion in a polaron-photon coupling
constant, arising from the polaron transformation which allows an accurate
description at high temperatures. In the low temperature regime we find
excellent agreement between the two approaches. An extensive study of the
quantum dot decay dynamics is performed, where important parameter dependencies
are covered. We find that in general the electron-phonon interaction gives rise
to a greatly increased bandwidth of the coupling between quantum dot and
cavity. At low temperature an asymmetry in the quantum dot decay rate is
observed, leading to a faster decay when the quantum dot has a larger energy
than to the cavity. We explain this as due to the absence of phonon absorption
processes. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the
quantum dot decay rate, applicable when the cavity can be adiabatically
eliminated. The expressions lead to a clear interpretation of the physics and
emphasizes the important role played by the effective phonon density,

outcomes also depend on geometrical cross sections of initial aggregates. In
the previous paper, we performed three-dimensional N-body simulations of
sequential collisions of aggregates composed of a number of sub-micron-sized
icy particles and examined radii of gyration (and bulk densities) of the
obtained aggregates. We showed that collisional compression of aggregates is
not efficient and that aggregates remain fluffy. In the present study, we
examine geometrical cross sections of the aggregates. Their cross sections
decreases due to the compression as well as their gyration radii. It is found
that a relation between the cross section and the gyration radius proposed by
Okuzumi et al. is valid for the compressed aggregates. We also refine the
compression model proposed in our previous paper. The refined model enables us
to calculate the evolution of both gyration radii and cross sections of growing
aggregates and reproduces well our numerical results of sequential aggregate
collisions. The refined model can describe non-equal-mass collisions as well as
equal-mass case. Although we do not take into account oblique collisions in the

clusters, seem to associate with shock waves, especially those developed during

shocks in intracluster media (ICMs), provided we understand the electron
acceleration and re-acceleration at those shocks. In this paper, we describe
time-dependent simulations for diffusive shock acceleration at weak shocks that
are expected to be found in ICMs. Freshly injected as well as pre-existing
populations of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons are considered, and energy losses via
synchrotron and inverse Compton are included. We then compare the synchrotron
flux and spectral distributions estimated from the simulations with those in
two well-observed radio relics in CIZA J2242.8+5301 and ZwCl0008.8+5215.
Considering that the CR electron injection is rather inefficient at weak shocks
with Mach number M <~ a few, the existence of radio relics could indicate the
pre-existing population of low-energy CR electrons in ICMs. The implication of

and nonlinearity of the maps in this class. We then find that the network
degrees fluctuate at all scales with an amplitude that increases as the size of
the network grows. This suggests the definition of a graph-theoretical Lyapunov
exponent that measures the expansion rate of trajectories in network space. On
good agreement with the map's counterpart, while at the onset of chaos this
exponent vanishes, the subexponential expansion and contraction of network
degrees can be fully described via a Tsallis-type scalar deformation of the
expansion rate, that yields a discrete spectrum of non-null generalized
exponents. We further explore the possibility of defining an entropy growth
rate that describes the amount of information created along the trajectories in
network space. Making use of the trajectory distributions in the map's

show that such entropic growth rate coincides with the spectrum of

maximizing the overall Ricci curvature. Furthermore, the flow through such
systems as a function of the number of curvature perturbations presents a
sublinear behavior for large concentrations due to the interference between
curvature perturbations that, consequently, produces a less curved space. For
the purpose of this study, we have developed and validated a lattice kinetic
model capable of describing fluid flow in arbitrarily curved manifolds, which
allows to deal with highly complex spaces in a very compact and efficient way.

graphs under partially nested information patterns. We show a duality result
that is very similar to the classical duality result between state estimation
and state feedback control with a classical information pattern, under the
condition that the disturbances entering different systems on the graph are
uncorrelated. The distributed estimation problem decomposes into $N$ separate
estimation problems, where $N$ is the number of interconnected subsystems over
the graph, and the solution to each subproblem is simply the optimal Kalman
filter. This also gives the solution to the distributed control problem due to
the duality of distributed estimation and control under partially nested
information pattern. We then consider a weighted distributed estimation
problem, where we get coupling between the estimators, and separation between
the estimators is not possible. We propose a solution based on linear quadratic
team decision theory, which provides a generalized Riccati equation for teams.
We show that the weighted estimation problem is the dual to a distributed state
feedback problem, where the disturbances entering the interconnected systems
are correlated.

comparing the angular diameter distances of a set of clusters, inferred from X

using the local regression technique to estimate $D_L(z)$ from Type Ia
Supernovae (SNeIa) Hubble diagram. In order to both strengthen the constraints
on the DDR and get rid of the systematics related to the unknown cluster

we consider the proposed Euclid mission investigating the precision can be
afforded on $\eta(z)$ from the expected SNeIa and BAO data. We find that the
combination of BAO and the local regression coupled allows to reduce the errors
on $\eta_a = d\eta/dz|_{z = 0}$ by a factor two if one $\eta_0 = \eta(z = 0) =

statistical error on $\eta_0$ is not significantly reduced, the constraints on
this quantity will be nevertheless ameliorated thanks to the reduce impact of

insensitive to the dark-matter particle mass. They also reduce properly to the
oscillation modes of the corresponding ordinary neutron star, with the same
total mass, when the mass fraction of dark matter tends to zero. On the other
hand, the second class of modes is due mainly to the dark-matter fluid. In the
small dark-matter mass fraction limit, these modes are characterized purely by
the oscillations of dark matter, while the normal matter is essentially at
rest. In the intermediate regime where the mass fractions of the two fluids are
comparable, the normal matter oscillates with the dark matter due to their
coupling through gravity. In contrast to the first class of modes, the
frequencies of these dark-matter dominated modes depend sensitively on the mass

coupled to gauge fields. Noncommutativity is encoded in a twisted star product
between forms, with a set of commuting background vector fields defining the
(abelian) twist. A first order action for the gauge fields avoids the use of
the Hodge dual. The NC action is invariant under diffeomorphisms and twisted
gauge transformations. The Seiberg-Witten map, adapted to our geometric setting
and generalized for an arbitrary abelian twist, allows to re-express the NC

under diffeomorphisms and usual gauge transformations. This deformed action is
a particular higher derivative extension of the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled
to Yang-Mills fields, and to the background vector fields defining the twist.
Here noncommutativity of the original NC action dictates the precise form of

measurement and comparison of blank and analyzed sample evident features. In
the first step of BBTA procedure, the number of compounds is reduced by
max-to-mean ratio thresholding, which extensively reduce the computational
time. Simple thresholding is followed by selection of time markers defined from
blank inflex points which are then used for the transformation function,
polynomial of second degree, in the example. BBTA approach was compared on real
HPLC-MS measurement with Correlation Optimized Warping (COW) method. It was
proved to have distinctively shorter computational time as well as lower level
of mathematical presumptions. The BBTA is computationally much easier, quicker
(more then 1000x) and accurate in comparison with warping. Moreover, markers
selection works efficiently without any peak detection. It is sufficient to
analyze only baseline contribution in the analyte measurement with sparse
knowledge of blank behavior. Finally, BBTA does not required usage of extra

mixed with non-thermal components, i.e. highly relativistic particles and
large-scale magnetic fields, detected through their synchrotron emission. The
knowledge of the properties of these non-thermal ICM components has increased
significantly, owing to sensitive radio images and to the development of
theoretical models. Diffuse synchrotron radio emission in the central and
peripheral cluster regions has been found in many clusters. Moreover
large-scale magnetic fields appear to be present in all galaxy clusters, as
derived from Rotation Measure (RM) studies. Non-thermal components are linked
to the cluster X-ray properties, and to the cluster evolutionary stage, and are
crucial for a comprehensive physical description of the intracluster medium.
They play an important role in the cluster formation and evolution. We review
here the observational properties of diffuse non-thermal sources detected in

typical for MIR-selected massive clusters found in other galaxies. The ages of
the MIR-selected clusters are in the range of 5.9\pm0.3 Myr. The age spread

Instead, it appears more likely that the gas density build up more gradually

Chakaravarthy, Sambuddha Roy, Yogish Sabharwal","Distributed Algorithms for Scheduling on Line and Tree Networks","Accepted to PODC 2012, full version",,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have a set of processors (or agents) and a set of graph networks defined
over some vertex set. Each processor can access a subset of the graph networks.
Each processor has a demand specified as a pair of vertices $<u, v>$, along
with a profit; the processor wishes to send data between $u$ and $v$. Towards
that goal, the processor needs to select a graph network accessible to it and a
path connecting $u$ and $v$ within the selected network. The processor requires
exclusive access to the chosen path, in order to route the data. Thus, the
processors are competing for routes/channels. A feasible solution selects a
subset of demands and schedules each selected demand on a graph network
accessible to the processor owning the demand; the solution also specifies the
paths to use for this purpose. The requirement is that for any two demands
scheduled on the same graph network, their chosen paths must be edge disjoint.
The goal is to output a solution having the maximum aggregate profit. Prior
work has addressed the above problem in a distibuted setting for the special
case where all the graph networks are simply paths (i.e, line-networks).
Distributed constant factor approximation algorithms are known for this case.
  The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First we design a
distributed constant factor approximation algorithm for the more general case
of tree-networks. The core component of our algorithm is a tree-decomposition
technique, which may be of independent interest. Secondly, for the case of
line-networks, we improve the known approximation guarantees by a factor of 5.
Our algorithms can also handle the capacitated scenario, wherein the demands
and edges have bandwidth requirements and capacities, respectively.

implicit Euler method in time and the consequent one time step elastoplastic

of nonlinear equations with a strongly semismooth and strongly monotone

system. Corresponding linearized problems arising in the Newton iterations are
solved in parallel by the above mentioned TFETI domain decomposition method.
The proposed TFETI based algorithm was implemented in Matlab parallel

benchmark. Numerical results for different time discretizations and mesh levels
are presented and discussed and a local quadratic convergence of the semismooth

unprecedented opportunity to search for blazars at sub-mm wavelengths. We
cross-matched the FIRST radio source catalogue with the 11655 sources brighter
than 35 mJy at 500{\mu}m in the \sim 135 square degrees of the sky covered by
the H-ATLAS equatorial fields at 9 h and 15 h, plus half of the field at 12 h.
We found that 379 of the H-ATLAS sources have a FIRST counterpart within 10
arcsec, including 8 catalogued blazars (plus one known blazar that was found at
the edge of one the H-ATLAS maps). To search for additional blazar candidates
we have devised new diagnostic diagrams and found that known blazars occupy a
region of the log(S500{\mu}m/S350{\mu}m) vs. log(S500{\mu}m/S1.4GHz) plane
separated from that of the other sub-mm sources with radio counterparts. Using
this diagnostic we have selected 12 further candidates that turn out to be
scattered in the (r-z) vs. (u-r) plane or in the WISE colour-colour diagram
proposed by Massaro et al. (2012), where known blazars are concentrated in well
defined strips. This suggests that the majority of them either are not blazars
or have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. A
significant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forming
galaxies. This finding, supported by an analysis of blazars detected in Planck
545 and 857 GHz bands, is at odds with the notion that blazar hosts are passive
ellipticals and indicates that the sub-mm selection is providing a novel
prospect on blazar properties. Based on an inspection of the available
photometric data, including the WISE all-sky survey, the unpublished VIKING
survey and new radio observations, we tentatively estimate that there are 11
blazars with synchrotron flux density S500{\mu}m > 35mJy over the considered

constant and (ii) heterogeneous, with diffusion constants drawn from a
heavy-tailed power-law distribution. In parallel, the full FPTD for fractional
Brownian motion [fBm - defined by the Hurst parameter, 0<H<1] is studied, of
interest here as fBm and SFD systems belong to the same universality class.
  Extensive stochastic (non-Markovian) SFD and fBm simulations are performed
and compared to two analytical Markovian techniques: the Method of Images
approximation (MIA) and the Willemski-Fixman approximation (WFA). We find that
the MIA cannot approximate well any temporal scale of the SFD FPTD. Our exact
inversion of the Willemski-Fixman integral equation captures the long-time
power-law exponent, when H >= 1/3, as predicted by Molchan [1999] for fBm. When
H<1/3, which includes homogeneous SFD (H=1/4), and heterogeneous SFD (H<1/4),
the WFA fails to agree with any temporal scale of the simulations and Molchan's
long-time result.
  SFD systems are compared to their fBm counter parts; and in the homogeneous
system both scaled FPTDs agree on all temporal scales including also, the
result by Molchan, thus affirming that SFD and fBm dynamics belong to the same
universality class. In the heterogeneous case SFD and fBm results for
heterogeneity-averaged FPTDs agree in the asymptotic time limit. The
non-averaged heterogeneous SFD systems display a lack of self-averaging. An
exponential with a power-law argument, multiplied by a power-law pre-factor is
shown to describe well the FPTD for all times for homogeneous SFD and
sub-diffusive fBm systems.

of the most fundamental curves in science. In this regard, Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM) represents the most powerful tool in nanoscience but with
severe limits when it is to probe attractive interactions with high
sensitivity. The Force Feedback Microscope (FFM) described here, removes from
AFM the well known jump to contact problem that precludes the complete
exploration of the interaction curve and the study of associated energy
exchanges. The FFM makes it possible to explore tip-surface interactions in the
entire range of distances with a sensitivity better than 1 pN. FFM stands out
as a radical change in AFM control paradigms. With a surprisingly simple
arrangement it is possible to provide the AFM tip with the right counterforce
to keep it fixed at any time. The counterforce is consequently equal to the
tip-sample force. The force, force gradient and damping are simultaneously
measured independently of the tip position. This permits the measurement of
energy transfer in thermodynamic transformations. Here we show some FFM
measurement examples of the complete interaction force curve and in particular
that the FFM can follow the nucleation of a water bridge by measuring the
capillary attractive force at all distances, without jump to contact despite
the large attractive capillary force. Real time combination of the measured
parameters will lead to new imaging modalities with chemical contrast in
different environments.

five of the twelve galaxies in our sample; the emission is mainly associated
with disk star formation. Only two of the detected galaxies had extended radio
emission; the others had patchy disk emission. In the former two galaxies,
NGC3445 and NGC4027, the radio continuum is associated with star formation
triggered by tidal interactions with nearby companion galaxies. We did
follow-up Halpha imaging and nuclear spectroscopy of both galaxies using the
Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). The Halpha emission is mainly associated
with the strong spiral arms. The nuclear spectra indicate ongoing nuclear star
formation in NGC3445 and NGC4027 which maybe associated with nuclear star
clusters. No obvious signs of AGN activity were detected. Although nearly
bulgeless, both galaxies appear to have central oval distortions in the R band
images; these could represent pseudobulges that may later evolve into large
bulges. We thus conclude that tidal interactions are an important means of
bulge formation and disk evolution in bulgeless galaxies; without such triggers
these galaxies appear to be low in star formation and overall disk evolution.

multiplets in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, and the
realisation of such scenarios in F-theory is the subject of this paper. The
chiral adjoints drastically alter the usual picture of gauge coupling
unification, but this is disturbed anyway in F-theory models with non-trivial
hypercharge flux. The interplay between these two factors is explored, and it
is found for example that viable F-theory unification can be achieved at around
the reduced Planck scale, if there is an extra vector-like pair of singlet
leptons with TeV-scale mass. I then discuss the conditions which must be
satisfied by the geometry and hypercharge flux of an F-theory model with Dirac
gauginos. One nice possibility is for the visible sector to be localised on a
K3 surface, and this is discussed in some detail. Finally, I describe how to
achieve an unbroken discrete R-symmetry in such compactifications, which is an
important ingredient in many models with Dirac gauginos, and write down a
simple example which has adjoint chiral multiplets, an appropriate R-symmetry,

framework compounds Ag3Co(CN)6 and Ag3Fe(CN)6. Phonon spectra have been
measured using the inelastic neutron scattering technique as a function of
temperature and pressure. The data has been analyzed using ab-initio
calculations. We find that the bonding is very similar in both compounds. At
ambient pressure modes in the intermediate frequency part of the vibrational
spectra in the Co compound are shifted to slightly higher energies as compared
to the Fe compound. The temperature dependence of the phonon spectra gives
evidence for large explicit anharmonic contribution to the total anharmonicity
for low-energy modes below 5 meV. We found that modes are mainly affected by
the change in the size of unit cell, which in turn changes the bond lengths and
vibrational frequencies. Thermal expansion has been calculated via the volume
dependence of phonon spectra. Our analysis indicates that Ag phonon modes in
the energy range from 2 to 5 meV are strongly anharmonic and major contributors
to thermal expansion in both compounds. The application of pressure hardens the
low-energy part of the phonon spectra involving Ag vibrations and confirms the
highly anharmonic nature of these modes.

with its gravitational acceleration. The former is known from the dipole of the
cosmic microwave background radiation and the latter is estimated here from the
clustering dipole of galaxies in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) Extended
Source Catalog. We start by presenting the general framework of perturbation
theory of gravitational instability in the expanding Universe and how it
applies to the peculiar motion of the LG. Next, we study a particular effect
for the dipole measurement, related to the fact that a nearby Local Void is
partially hidden behind our Galaxy. We then describe in detail how we handled
the 2MASS extragalactic data for the purpose of our analysis. Finally, we
present two methods to estimate the density Omega_m, combined with the linear
biasing b into the parameter beta = (Omega_m)^{0.55} / b, from the comparison
of the LG velocity and acceleration. The first approach is to study the growth
of the 2MASS clustering dipole with increased depth of the sample and compare
it with theoretical expectations. The second is to apply the maximum-likelihood
method in order to improve the precision of the measurement. With both these
methods we find beta=0.4 and Omega_m=0.2, which is consistent with various
independent estimates. We also briefly mention some future prospects in the

HIV/AIDS-related high risk populations. However, recent studies have shown that
traditional RDS methods are likely to generate large variances and may be
severely biased since the assumptions behind RDS are seldom fully met in real
life. To improve estimation in RDS studies, we propose a new method to generate
estimates with ego network data, which is collected by asking RDS respondents
about the composition of their personal networks, such as ""what proportion of
your friends are married?"". By simulations on an extracted real-world social
network of gay men as well as on artificial networks with varying structural
properties, we show that the new estimator, RDSI^{ego} shows superior
performance over traditional RDS estimators. Importantly, RDSI^{ego} exhibits
strong robustness to the preference of peer recruitment and variations in
network structural properties, such as homophily, activity ratio, and community
structure. While the biases of traditional RDS estimators can sometimes be as
large as 10%~20%, biases of all RDSI^{ego} estimates are well restrained to be
less than 2%. The positive results henceforth encourage researchers to collect
ego network data for variables of interests by RDS, for both hard-to-access
populations and general populations when random sampling is not applicable. The
limitation of RDSI^{ego} is evaluated by simulating RDS assuming different
level of reporting error.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In infrastructure-less highly dynamic networks, computing and performing even
basic tasks (such as routing and broadcasting) is a very challenging activity
due to the fact that connectivity does not necessarily hold, and the network
may actually be disconnected at every time instant. Clearly the task of
designing protocols for these networks is less difficult if the environment
allows waiting (i.e., it provides the nodes with store-carry-forward-like
mechanisms such as local buffering) than if waiting is not feasible. No
quantitative corroborations of this fact exist (e.g., no answer to the
question: how much easier?). In this paper, we consider these qualitative
questions about dynamic networks, modeled as time-varying (or evolving) graphs,
where edges exist only at some times.
  We examine the difficulty of the environment in terms of the expressivity of
the corresponding time-varying graph; that is in terms of the language
generated by the feasible journeys in the graph. We prove that the set of
languages $L_{nowait}$ when no waiting is allowed contains all computable
languages. On the other end, using algebraic properties of quasi-orders, we
prove that $L_{wait}$ is just the family of regular languages. In other words,
we prove that, when waiting is no longer forbidden, the power of the accepting
automaton (difficulty of the environment) drops drastically from being as
powerful as a Turing machine, to becoming that of a Finite-State machine. This
(perhaps surprisingly large) gap is a measure of the computational power of
waiting.
  We also study bounded waiting; that is when waiting is allowed at a node only
for at most $d$ time units. We prove the negative result that $L_{wait[d]} =
L_{nowait}$; that is, the expressivity decreases only if the waiting is finite
but unpredictable (i.e., under the control of the protocol designer and not of
the environment).

of pressure up to 0.8 GPa. The present X-ray diffraction data show that the
room temperature polymorph consists of the lattice doubled along the c axis
with respect to the CeCoAl-type structure consistent with previous reports.
Upon cooling, the compound undergoes two successive transitions, first to a
quintuple (290 K) and than to a triple CeCoAl superstructure at 225 K. The
transitions are accompanied by a tremendous volume change due to a strong
shrinking of the lattice along the c axis, which is clearly observed in thermal
expansion. We advance arguments that the volume collapse originates from an
increasing number of crystallographically inequivalent Ce sites and the change
of ratio between the short and long Ce-Ru bonds. The observed properties of the
polymorphic transition in CeRuSn are reminiscent of the transition in
elementary Cerium, suggesting that similar physics, i.e., a Kondo influenced

model, under sparsity constraints induced by presence of grouping structures on
the input covariates and on the output predictors. This problem is primarily
motivated by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, of which the
goal is to discover genetic variations in the genome (inputs) that influence
the expression levels of multiple co-expressed genes (outputs), either
epistatically, or pleiotropically, or both. A structured input-output lasso
(SIOL) model based on an intricate l1/l2-norm penalty over the regression
coefficient matrix is employed to enable discovery of complex sparse
input/output relationships; and a highly efficient new optimization algorithm
called hierarchical group thresholding (HiGT) is developed to solve the
resultant non-differentiable, non-separable, and ultra high-dimensional
optimization problem. We show on both simulation and on a yeast eQTL dataset
that our model leads to significantly better recovery of the structured sparse
relationships between the inputs and the outputs, and our algorithm
significantly outperforms other optimization techniques under the same model.
Additionally, we propose a novel approach for efficiently and effectively
detecting input interactions by exploiting the prior knowledge available from
biological experiments.

2 scenarios. In the first, clouds travel fast enough to shock-heat warm
environmental gas. In this scenario, the X-ray productivity depends strongly on
the speed of the cloud and the radiative cooling rate. In order to shock-heat
environmental gas to temperatures of > or = 10^6 K, cloud speeds of > or = 300
km/s are required. If cooling is quenched, then the shock-heated ambient gas is
X-ray emissive, producing bright X-rays in the 1/4 keV band and some X-rays in
the 3/4 keV band due to O VII and other ions. If, in contrast, the radiative
cooling rate is similar to that of collisional ionizational equilibrium plasma
with solar abundances, then the shocked gas is only mildly bright and for only
about 1 Myr. The predicted count rates for the non-radiative case are bright
enough to explain the count rate observed with XMM-Newton toward a Magellanic
Stream cloud and some enhancement in the ROSAT 1/4 keV count rate toward
Complex C, while the predicted count rates for the fully radiative case are
not. In the second scenario, the clouds travel through and mix with hot ambient
gas. The mixed zone can contain hot gas, but the hot portion of the mixed gas

porous medium. For the observed decrease in current yield, we propose other
causes than difference in diffusivity, which we consider unaltered by the
porous medium. The physical situation we try to model consists of systems of
reduced dimensions (~0.001-1.0 cm^3) with pores of sub micrometric dimension.
This is particularly suitable to represent organic structures or special cells
in electrochemical devices. We try to explore two basic contributions as an
answer for diffusion fading in porous medium, namely, the effect of the void
geometry and a dissipative process as well. This dissipative process is in the
kernel of our analysis and it is related to the heterogeneous fluctuations of
the flux lines occurring at the border among pores. To mimic biophysical and
electrochemical conditions we also include in our model a reactive process,
such migration of species do not need, necessarily, a pressure gradient because
of the reaction diffusion process. As usual, the mathematical description of
the phenomenon is introduced through the prescription of boundary and initial
conditions for a transport equation, however here we decouple the geometry from
the reaction-diffusion-convection problem examining a unitary conduct, in which
the fluid flows and that, replicated in the space, is able to generate the
entire system. We estimate the current transient provided by our model and
compare it to the one obtained by the process of controlled growth of metallic
inverse opals prepared by electrochemical crystallization of matter, so the
theoretical results can be compared with experimental data.

Scattering, absorption, and radiation processes deteriorate the signal-to-noise

therefore, important to accurately estimate the wavelength-dependent effect of
the Earth's atmosphere on the observed flux. In order to increase the accuracy
of the exposure time calculator of the European Southern Observatory's (ESO)
Very Large Telescope (VLT) at Cerro Paranal, an atmospheric model was developed
as part of the Austrian ESO In-Kind contribution. It includes all relevant
components, such as scattered moonlight, scattered starlight, zodiacal light,
atmospheric thermal radiation and absorption, and non-thermal airglow emission.
This paper focuses on atmospheric scattering processes that mostly affect the
blue (< 0.55 mum) wavelength regime, and airglow emission lines and continuum
that dominate the red (> 0.55 mum) wavelength regime. While the former is
mainly investigated by means of radiative transfer models, the intensity and
variability of the latter is studied with a sample of 1186 VLT FORS1 spectra.
For a set of parameters such as the object altitude angle, Moon-object angular
distance, ecliptic latitude, bimonthly period, and solar radio flux, our model
predicts atmospheric radiation and transmission at a requested resolution. A
comparison of our model with the FORS1 spectra and photometric data for the
night-sky brightness from the literature, suggest a model accuracy of about
20%. This is a significant improvement with respect to existing predictive
atmospheric models for astronomical exposure time calculators.

quantum dynamics in the classically forbidden region features two time scales,
the typical time that characterizes the probability density's decay of the
ionizing electron under the barrier (Keldysh time) and the time interval which
the electron spends inside the barrier (Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith tunneling time).
In the relativistic regime, an electron momentum shift as well as a spatial
shift along the laser propagation direction arise during the under-the-barrier
motion which are caused by the laser magnetic field induced Lorentz force. The
momentum shift is proportional to the Keldysh time, while the wave-packet's
spatial drift is proportional to the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith time. The signature
of the momentum shift is shown to be present in the ionization spectrum at the
detector and, therefore, observable experimentally. In contrast, the signature

This is interpreted as a tail of gas stripped from the offset core. Gas in the

In addition, the offset core shows marginally lower temperature and metallicity

the observed properties of the system, including the placement of the cold

challenging to determine from just the numerical time course data alone what is
coordinating the visible processes, to separate the underlying prima facie
causes into genuine and spurious causes and to do so with a feasible
computational complexity. For this purpose, we have been developing a novel
algorithm based on a framework that combines notions of causality in philosophy
with algorithmic approaches built on model checking and statistical techniques
for multiple hypotheses testing. The causal relationships are described in
terms of temporal logic formulae, reframing the inference problem in terms of
model checking. The logic used, PCTL, allows description of both the time
between cause and effect and the probability of this relationship being
observed. We show that equipped with these causal formulae with their
associated probabilities we may compute the average impact a cause makes to its
effect and then discover statistically significant causes through the concepts
of multiple hypothesis testing (treating each causal relationship as a
hypothesis), and false discovery control. By exploring a well-chosen family of
potentially all significant hypotheses with reasonably minimal description
length, it is possible to tame the algorithm's computational complexity while
exploring the nearly complete search-space of all prima facie causes. We have

used to formulate decision-making problems under uncertainty. However, it lacks
a natural mechanism to reason about objects, classes of objects, and relations.
First-order logic (FOL), on the other hand, excels at reasoning about classes
of objects, but lacks a rich representation of uncertainty. While representing
propositional logic in MILP has been extensively explored, no theory exists yet
for fully combining FOL with MILP. We propose a new representation, called
first-order programming or FOP, which subsumes both FOL and MILP. We establish
formal methods for reasoning about first order programs, including a sound and
complete lifted inference procedure for integer first order programs. Since FOP
can offer exponential savings in representation and proof size compared to FOL,
and since representations and proofs are never significantly longer in FOP than
in FOL, we anticipate that inference in FOP will be more tractable than
inference in FOL for corresponding problems.

cross-products of many local state and action spaces spread over a large

uncertainty, have complex utility functions involving spatial constraints and
we generally must rely on simulations rather than an explicit transition model.
We define LSST problems as reinforcement learning problems and present a
solution using policy gradients. We compare two different policy formulations:
an explicit policy that identifies each location in space and the action to
take there; and an abstract policy that defines the proportion of actions to
take across all locations in space. We show that the abstract policy is more
robust and achieves higher rewards with far fewer parameters than the
elementary policy. This abstract policy is also a better fit to the properties
