the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) applications to medicine and biology. Two
models based on the Bloch-McConnell (B-M) and the Bloch-Torrey (B-T) equations
are commonly used for modelling the physical processes which determine the NMR
lineshapes. Qualitative arguments for each of the two methods can be found in
various studies in the literature. However, there is a lack of systematic
quantitative investigations of the diffusive exchange spectra calculated with
the two methods for the same physical system or model. In this work exact
frequency-domain transverse magnetization solutions of the B-M and the B-T
equations with boundary conditions for a two-compartment radial diffusive
exchange model are presented. Theoretical spectra and the two corresponding
metrics were computed by varying three different parameters: diffusive
permeability of the separating membrane between the two compartments (P), the
radius of the inner spherical compartment (a), and the chemical shift between
the two compartments (\Deltaf). In general, the two models predicted different
spectral broadening for the same parameters in agreement with the different
analytical solutions. However, the numerical analysis of the spectral
broadening demonstrated that the two models converge to the same results in the
limit of large chemical shift on the scale of the exchange rate. The results
were qualitatively interpreted based on the difference between the two models:
the B-M model assumes a single average exchange time constant while the B-T
model implies a more realistic continuous distribution of diffusive exchange
times.

\alpha_k and polarization \beta_k generated by scalar metric perturbations in
synchronous gauge, parallel to our previous work with RGW as a generating
source. This is realized primarily by an analytic time-integration of
Boltzmann's equation, yielding the closed forms of \alpha_k and \beta_k.
Approximations, such as the tight-coupling approximation for photons a prior to
the recombination and the long wavelength limit for scalar perturbations are
used. The residual gauge modes in scalar perturbations are analyzed and a
proper joining condition of scalar perturbations at the radiation-matter
equality is chosen, ensuring the continuity of energy perturbation.
  The resulting analytic expressions of the multipole moments of polarization
a^E_l, and of temperature anisotropies a^T_l are explicit functions of the
scalar perturbations, recombination time, recombination width, photon free
streaming damping factor, baryon fraction, initial amplitude, primordial scalar
spectral index, and the running index. These results show that a longer
recombination width yields higher amplitudes of polarization on large scales
and more damping on small scales, and that a late recombination time shifts the
peaks of C^{XX'}_l to larger angular scales.
  The analytic spectra C^{XX'}_l agree with the numerical ones and with those
observed by WMAP on large scales (l \lesssim 500), but deviate considerably
from the numerical results on smaller scales, showing the limitations of our
approximate analytic calculations. Several possible improvements are pointed

for each AGN, summed over all of its absorbers. These calculations make use of
values (or limits) for the radial locations of the absorbers determined from
variability, excited-state absorption, and other considerations. From a sample
of 10 Seyfert 1 galaxies with detailed photoionization models for their
absorbers, we find that 7 have sufficient constraints on the absorber locations
to determine feedback parameters. For the low-luminosity AGN NGC 4395, these
values are low, although we do not have sufficient constraints on the X-ray
absorbers to make definitive conclusions. At least 5 of the 6 Seyfert 1s with
moderate bolometric luminosities have mass outflow rates that are 10 - 1000
times the mass accretion rates needed to generate their observed luminosities,
indicating that most of the mass outflow originates from outside the inner
accretion disk. Three of these (NGC 4051, NGC 3516, and NGC 3783) have kinetic
luminosities in the range 0.5 to 5% bolometric, which is the range typically
required by feedback models for efficient self-regulation of black-hole and
galactic bulge growth. At least 2 of the other 3 (NGC 5548, NGC 4151, and NGC
7469) have kinetic luminosities > 0.1% bolometric, although these values may
increase if radial locations can be determined for more of the absorbers. We
conclude that the outflowing UV and X-ray absorbers in moderate-luminosity AGN
have the potential to deliver significant feedback to their environments.

Chromatic Clustering}, in high dimensional space. Chromatic clustering seeks to
partition a set of colored points into groups (or clusters) so that no group
contains points with the same color and a certain objective function is
optimized. In this paper, we consider two variants of the problem, chromatic
$k$-means clustering (denoted as $k$-CMeans) and chromatic $k$-medians
clustering (denoted as $k$-CMedians), and investigate their hardness and
approximation solutions. For $k$-CMeans, we show that the additional coloring
constraint destroys several key properties (such as the locality property) used
in existing $k$-means techniques (for ordinary points), and significantly
complicates the problem. There is no FPTAS for the chromatic clustering
problem, even if $k=2$. To overcome the additional difficulty, we develop a
standalone result, called {\em Simplex Lemma}, which enables us to efficiently
approximate the mean point of an unknown point set through a fixed dimensional
simplex. A nice feature of the simplex is its independence with the
dimensionality of the original space, and thus can be used for problems in very
high dimensional space. With the simplex lemma, together with several random
sampling techniques, we show that a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation of $k$-CMeans
can be achieved in near linear time through a sphere peeling algorithm. For
$k$-CMedians, we show that a similar sphere peeling algorithm exists for
achieving constant approximation solutions.

which couples a property of a system, i.e., polarization or which-path

frequency. Unfortunately, the weak amplification process is generally
accompanied by severe losses of the detected signal, which limits the
applicability of the weak amplification concept. However, we will show here
that since the weak measurement concept is essentially an interference
phenomena, it should be possible to use the degree of interference to get
relevant information about the physical system under study in a more general

multiple latent factors (e.g., the words in each document are generated as a
mixture of several active topics, as opposed to just one). This increased
representational power comes at the cost of a more challenging unsupervised
learning problem of estimating the topic probability vectors (the distributions
over words for each topic), when only the words are observed and the
corresponding topics are hidden.
  We provide a simple and efficient learning procedure that is guaranteed to
recover the parameters for a wide class of mixture models, including the
popular latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. For LDA, the procedure
correctly recovers both the topic probability vectors and the prior over the
topics, using only trigram statistics (i.e., third order moments, which may be
estimated with documents containing just three words). The method, termed
Excess Correlation Analysis (ECA), is based on a spectral decomposition of low
order moments (third and fourth order) via two singular value decompositions
(SVDs). Moreover, the algorithm is scalable since the SVD operations are
carried out on $k\times k$ matrices, where $k$ is the number of latent factors
(e.g. the number of topics), rather than in the $d$-dimensional observed space
(typically $d \gg k$).

arbitrary, but they are connected with all the parameters involved with the
global model. Moreover, the value of the local energy is also connected with
the value of the global energy. Low and high energy stars in the global model
display chaotic motion. Comparison with previous research reveals that the
presence of the massive nucleus is responsible for the chaotic motion of the
low energy stars. In the local motion, the low energy stars show interesting
resonance phenomena, but the chaotic motion, if any, is negligible. On the

importance and has received a great deal of attentions in recent years. Given a
set of points $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ space, projective clustering is to find a
set $\mathbb{F}$ of $k$ lower dimensional $j$-flats so that the average
distance (or squared distance) from points in $P$ to their closest flats is
minimized. Existing approaches for this problem are mainly based on
adaptive/volume sampling or core-sets techniques which suffer from several
limitations. In this paper, we present the first uniform random sampling based
approach for this challenging problem and achieve linear time solutions for
three cases, general projective clustering, regular projective clustering, and
$L_{\tau}$ sense projective clustering. For the general projective clustering
problem, we show that for any given small numbers $0<\gamma, \epsilon <1$, our
approach first removes $\gamma|P|$ points as outliers and then determines $k$
$j$-flats to cluster the remaining points into $k$ clusters with an objective
value no more than $(1+\epsilon)$ times of the optimal for all points. For
regular projective clustering, we demonstrate that when the input points
satisfy some reasonable assumption on its input, our approach for the general
case can be extended to yield a PTAS for all points. For $L_{\tau}$ sense
projective clustering, we show that our techniques for both the general and
regular cases can be naturally extended to the $L_{\tau}$ sense projective
clustering problem for any $1 \le \tau < \infty$. Our results are based on
several novel techniques, such as slab partition, $\Delta$-rotation, symmetric
sampling, and recursive projection, and can be easily implemented for
applications.

the weak solution space by introducing interior states on a set of measure
zero, associated with stationary discontinuities at the junction. In the
demand-supply space, we demonstrate that the Riemann problem is uniquely
solved, in the sense that stationary states and, therefore, kinematic waves on
all links can be uniquely determined from feasible conditions on both
stationary and interior states as well as the entropy condition that prescribes
boundary fluxes from interior states. In addition, the resulting global flux
function is the same as the local one. Thus the flux function is both invariant
and Godunov.

topological entropy is greater than the bound implied by this action. We
associate this gap between the bound and the true entropy with 'secondary

(GW) observations of neutron-star binaries by the proposed Einstein Telescope

neutron-star (DNS) binaries are expected to be one of the first sources
detected after ""first-light"" of Advanced LIGO and are expected to be detected
at a rate of a few tens per year in the advanced era. However the proposed ET
could catalog tens of thousands per year. Combining the measured source
redshift distributions with GW-network distance determinations will permit not
only the precision measurement of background cosmological parameters, but will
provide an insight into the astrophysical properties of these DNS systems. Of
particular interest will be to probe the distribution of delay times between
DNS-binary creation and subsequent merger, as well as the evolution of the
star-formation rate density within ET's detection horizon. Keeping H_0,
\Omega_{m,0} and \Omega_{\Lambda,0} fixed and investigating the precision with
which the dark-energy equation-of-state parameters could be recovered, we found
that with 10^5 detected DNS binaries we could constrain these parameters to an
accuracy similar to forecasted constraints from future CMB+BAO+SNIa
measurements. Furthermore, modeling the merger delay-time distribution as a
power-law, and the star-formation rate (SFR) density as a parametrized version
of the Porciani and Madau SF2 model, we find that the associated astrophysical
parameters are constrained to within ~ 10%. All parameter precisions scaled as
1/sqrt(N), where N is the number of cataloged detections. We also investigated
how precisions varied with the intrinsic underlying properties of the Universe
and with the distance reach of the network (which may be affected by the
low-frequency cutoff of the detector).

points to historical, time-averaged rates significantly higher than the
currently observed episodes at their DAZ counterparts. The difference between
the ongoing, instantaneous accretion rates witnessed at DAZ white dwarfs, which
often exceed 1e8 g/s, and those inferred over the past 1e5-1e6 yr for the DBZ
stars can be a few orders of magnitude, and therefore must result from
high-rate episodes of tens to hundreds of years so they remain undetected to
date. This paper explores the likelihood that such brief, intense accretion
episodes of gas-phase material can account for existing data. For reasonable
assumptions about the circumstellar gas, accretion rates approaching or
exceeding 1e15 g/s are possible, similar to rates observed in quiescent
cataclysmic variables, and potentially detectable with future x-ray missions or
wide-field monitoring facilities. Gaseous debris that is prone to such rapid
accretion may be abundant immediately following a tidal disruption event via
collisions and sublimation, or if additional bodies impinge upon an extant
disk. Particulate disk matter accretes at or near the Poynting-Robertson drag
rate for long periods between gas-producing events, consistent with rates
inferred for dusty DAZ white dwarfs. In this picture, warm DAZ stars without
infrared excesses have rates consistent with accretion from particulate disks
that remain undetected. This overall picture has implications for quasi-steady

to model the temperature, density, column density, and filling factor of
multiple components of molecular gas traced by 12CO and 13CO, adding further
evidence to the high-J lines tracing a much warmer (~ 500 K), less massive
component than the low-J lines. The addition of 13CO (and [CI]) is new and
indicates that [CI] may be tracing different gas than 12CO. No
temperature/density gradients can be inferred from the map, indicating that the
single-pointing spectrum is descriptive of the bulk properties of the galaxy.
At such a high temperature, cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen.
Photon-dominated region (PDR) models require higher densities than those
indicated by our Bayesian likelihood analysis in order to explain the high-J CO
line ratios, though cosmic-ray enhanced PDR models can do a better job
reproducing the emission at lower densities. Shocks and turbulent heating are
likely required to explain the bright high-J emission.

explicitly that our limits are competitive to strategies employing standard
spectral features. More importantly, we find robust limits even in the case of
non-degenerate dark matter and intermediate particle masses. This result is
particularly relevant in constraining dark matter frameworks with gamma-ray

generates an active neutrino mass at 1-loop level. In addition to other
benefits, the main advantage of the mechanism exploited in this model is to
lead to a natural loop-suppression of the neutrino mass, and therefore to an
explanation for its smallness. However, since the structure of the neutrino
mass matrix is altered compared to the ordinary type I seesaw case, the
corresponding running is altered as well. We have derived the full set of
renormalization group equations for the scotogenic model which, to our
knowledge, had not been presented previously in the literature. This set of
equations reflects some interesting structural properties of the model, and it
is an illustrative example for how the running of neutrino parameters in
radiative models is modified compared to models with tree-level mass
generation. We also study a simplified numerical example to illustrate some
general tendencies of the running. Interestingly, the structure of the RGEs can
be exploited such that a bimaximal leptonic mixing pattern at the high-energy
scale is translated into a valid mixing pattern at low energies, featuring a
large value of \theta_{13}. This suggests very interesting connections to
flavour symmetries.

authors, the choice of input SPS models can be a significant source of
systematic uncertainty. A key strength of EzGal is that it enables simple,
direct comparison of different models sets. EzGal is also capable of generating
composite stellar population models (CSPs) and can interpolate between
metallicities for a given model set. We have created a web interface to run
EzGal and generate observables for a variety of star formation histories and
model sets. We make many commonly used SPS models available from this
interface; the BC03 models, an updated version of these models, the Maraston
models, the BaSTI models, and finally the FSPS models. We use EzGal to compare
magnitude predictions for the model sets as a function of wavelength, age,
metallicity, and star formation history. We recover the well-known result that
the models agree best in the optical for old, solar metallicity models, with
differences at the ~0.1 magnitude level. The most problematic regime for SPS
modeling is for young ages (<2 Gyrs) and long wavelengths (lambda >7500
Angstroms) where scatter between models can vary from 0.3 mags (Sloan i) to 0.7
mags (Ks). We find that these differences are best understood as general
uncertainties in SPS modeling. Finally we explore a more physically motivated
example by generating CSPs with a star formation history matching the global
star formation history of the universe. We demonstrate that the wavelength and
age dependence of SPS model uncertainty translates into a redshift dependent
model uncertainty, highlighting the importance of a quantitative understanding
of model differences when comparing observations to models as a function of

investigate the Kepler-11 system in detail and provide estimates of both the
current and past planetary compositions. We find that a H/He atmosphere on
Kepler-11b is highly vulnerable to mass loss. By comparing to formation models,
we show that in situ formation of the system is unlikely. Instead we propose
that it is a water-rich system of sub-Neptunes that migrated from beyond the

is a threshold in bulk planet density and incident flux above which no low-mass
transiting planets have been observed. We suggest that this threshold is due to
the instability of H/He atmospheres to XUV-driven mass loss. Importantly, we
find that this flux-density threshold is well reproduced by our thermal
evolution/contraction models that incorporate a standard mass loss
prescription. Treating the planets' contraction history is essential because
the planets have significantly larger radii during the early era of high XUV
fluxes. Over time low mass planets with H/He envelopes can be transformed into
water-dominated worlds with steam atmospheres or rocky super-Earths. Finally,
we use this threshold to provide likely minimum masses and radial velocity
amplitudes for the general population of Kepler candidates. Likewise, we use
this threshold to provide constraints on the maximum radii of low-mass planets

from clouds of various sizes, densities, and velocities as they pass through
the hot Galactic halo. The ablated material mixes with the environmental gas,
producing an intermediate-temperature mixture that is rich in high ions and
that slows to the speed of the surrounding gas. We find that the slow mixed
material is a significant source of the low-velocity O VI that is observed in
the halo, as it can account for at least ~1/3 of the observed O VI column
density. Hence, any complete model of the high ions in the halo should include
the contribution to the O VI from ablated HVC material. However, such material
is unlikely to be a major source of the observed C IV, presumably because the
observed C IV is affected by photoionization, which our models do not include.
We discuss a composite model that includes contributions from HVCs, supernova
remnants, a cooling Galactic fountain, and photoionization by an external
radiation field. By design, this model matches the observed O VI column
density. This model can also account for most or all of the observed C IV, but

approximately 500 GeV, while the LHC bound with 5/fb of data at sqrt(s)=7 TeV

that galaxies that appear to be quiescent cannot be assumed to host only Type

line emission is practically constant. This supports a scenario in which the
broad line region is not affected by jet continuum variations. We thus infer
the thermal component of the continuum from the line luminosity and we show
that it is comparable with the continuum level observed during the phases of
minimum optical activity. The mass of the black hole is estimated through the
virial method from the FWHM of MgII, Hbeta, and Halpha broad lines and from the
thermal continuum luminosity. This yields a consistent black hole mass value of

difficulty, we establish the uniform Lipschitz property of optimal spline
coefficients in the $\ell_\infty$-norm by exploiting piecewise linear and
polyhedral theory. Based upon this property, it is shown that this estimator
attains optimal rates of convergence on the entire interval of interest over
the H\""older class under both the risks. In addition, adaptive estimates are
constructed under both the sup-norm risk and the pointwise risk when the

a maximal risk within a constant factor of the minimax risk over the H\""older

2003 and 2008/9 to verify whether the eclipsing body in the system is indeed a
dark disk and to understand the observed changes in the depth and durations of
the eclipses. Multicolour photometric data and spectroscopic observations at
both low and high resolution were collected. We numerically modelled the
variations in brightness and colour during the eclipses. We tested models with
different disk structure. We considered the possibility of disk precession. The
complete set of observational data collected during the last three eclipses are
made available to the astronomical community. Two blue maxima in the colour
indices were detected during these two eclipses, one before and one after the
photometric minimum. The first (stronger) blue maximum is simultaneous with a
""bump"" that is very clear in all the UBVRI light curves. Variations in the
spectral line profiles seem to be recurrent during each cycle. NaI lines always
show at least three absorption components during the eclipse minimum and strong
absorption is superimposed on the H_alpha emission. These observations confirm
that the eclipsing object in EE Cep system is indeed a dark, dusty disk around
a low luminosity object. The primary appears to be a rapidly rotating Be star
that is strongly darkened at the equator and brightened at the poles. Some of
the conclusions of this work require verification in future studies: (i) a
complex, possibly multi-ring structure of the disk in EE Cep; (ii) our
explanation of the ""bump"" observed during the last two eclipses in terms of the
different times of obscuration of the hot polar regions of the Be star by the
disk; and (iii) our suggested period of the disk precession (~11-12 P_orb) and
predicted depth of about 2 mag the forthcoming eclipse in 2014.

observations may advance our understanding of the accretion flows in LLAGN, the
fate of the obscuring torus at low accretion rates, and, perhaps, the star
formation histories of these objects. However, while comprehensively studied in
higher-luminosity Seyferts and quasars, the nuclear IR properties of LLAGN have
not yet been well-determined. We separate the present LLAGN sample into three
categories depending on their Eddington ratio and radio emission, finding
different IR characteristics for each class. (I) At the low-luminosity,
low-Eddington ratio (log Lbol/LEdd < -4.6) end of the sample, we identify
""host-dominated"" galaxies with strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bands
that may indicate active (circum-)nuclear star formation. (II) Some very
radio-loud objects are also present at these low Eddington ratios. The IR
emission in these nuclei is dominated by synchrotron radiation, and some are
likely to be unobscured type 2 AGN that genuinely lack a broad line region.
(III) At higher Eddington ratios, strong, compact nuclear sources are visible
in the MIR images. The nuclear SEDs of these galaxies are diverse; some
resemble typical Seyfert nuclei, while others lack a well-defined MIR ""dust
bump"". Strong silicate emission is present in many of these objects. We
speculate that this, together with high ratios of silicate strength to hydrogen
column density, could suggest optically thin dust and low dust-to-gas ratios,
in accordance with model predictions that LLAGN do not host a Seyfert-like
obscuring torus.

based on the [O III]$\lambda$5007 optical emission line which we assume to be
an approximate indicator of the intrinsic AGN luminosity. We find that the
means of the column density and photon index of our sample are $\log N_{\rm
H}=23.0$ cm$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma=1.87$ respectively, which are consistent with
results from deep X-ray surveys. The observed ratios of hard X-ray and [O III]
line luminosities imply that the majority of our sample suffer significant
amounts of obscuration in the hard X-ray band. A more physically realistic
model which accounts for both Compton scattering and a potential partial
covering of the central X-ray source was used to estimate the true absorbing
column density. We find that the absorbing column density estimates based on
simple power-law models significantly underestimate the actual absorption in
approximately half of the sources. Eleven sources show a prominent Fe K$\alpha$
emission line, and we detect this line in the other sources through a joint fit
(spectral stacking). The correlation between the Fe K$\alpha$ and [O III]
fluxes and the inverse correlation of the equivalent width of Fe K$\alpha$ line
with the ratio of hard X-ray and [O III] fluxes is consistent with previous
results for lower luminosity Seyfert 2 galaxies. We conclude that obscuration
is the cause of the weak hard X-ray emission rather than intrinsically low
X-ray luminosities. We find that about half of the population of
optically-selected type 2 quasars are likely to be Compton-thick. We also find
no evidence that the amount of X-ray obscuration depends on the AGN luminosity

  http://sites.google.com/site/cliqueperccomp",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  K-clique percolation is an overlapping community finding algorithm which
extracts particular structures, comprised of overlapping cliques, from complex
networks. While it is conceptually straightforward, and can be elegantly
expressed using clique graphs, certain aspects of k-clique percolation are
computationally challenging in practice. In this paper we investigate aspects
of empirical social networks, such as the large numbers of overlapping maximal
cliques contained within them, that make clique percolation, and clique graph
representations, computationally expensive. We motivate a simple algorithm to
conduct clique percolation, and investigate its performance compared to current
best-in-class algorithms. We present improvements to this algorithm, which
allow us to perform k-clique percolation on much larger empirical datasets. Our
approaches perform much better than existing algorithms on networks exhibiting
pervasively overlapping community structure, especially for higher values of k.
However, clique percolation remains a hard computational problem; current
algorithms still scale worse than some other overlapping community finding
algorithms.

$M$ of dimension $m \times n$ is at most $r$ which runs in time
$(nm)^{O(r^2)}$. This is the first exact algorithm that runs in time
singly-exponential in $r$. This algorithm (and earlier algorithms) are built on
methods for finding a solution to a system of polynomial inequalities (if one
exists). Notably, the best algorithms for this task run in time exponential in
the number of variables but polynomial in all of the other parameters (the
number of inequalities and the maximum degree).
  Hence these algorithms motivate natural algebraic questions whose solution
have immediate {\em algorithmic} implications: How many variables do we need to
represent the decision problem, does $M$ have nonnegative rank at most $r$? A
naive formulation uses $nr + mr$ variables and yields an algorithm that is
exponential in $n$ and $m$ even for constant $r$. (Arora, Ge, Kannan, Moitra,
STOC 2012) recently reduced the number of variables to $2r^2 2^r$, and here we
exponentially reduce the number of variables to $2r^2$ and this yields our main
algorithm. In fact, the algorithm that we obtain is nearly-optimal (under the
Exponential Time Hypothesis) since an algorithm that runs in time $(nm)^{o(r)}$
would yield a subexponential algorithm for 3-SAT .
  Our main result is based on establishing a normal form for nonnegative matrix
factorization - which in turn allows us to exploit algebraic dependence among a
large collection of linear transformations with variable entries. Additionally,
we also demonstrate that nonnegative rank cannot be certified by even a very
large submatrix of $M$, and this property also follows from the intuition
gained from viewing nonnegative rank through the lens of systems of polynomial
inequalities.

enhancement due to shock-heated, >20keV gas immediately adjacent to extended
radio emission seen in low-frequency radio maps. The MUSTANG data also detect
pressure substructure that is not well-constrained by the X-ray data in the
remnant core of a merging subcluster. We find that the small-scale pressure
enhancements in the MUSTANG data amount to ~2% of the total pressure measured
in the 140GHz Bolocam observations. The X-ray template also fails on larger
scales to accurately describe the Bolocam data, particularly at the location of
a subcluster known to have a high line of sight optical velocity (~3200km/s).
Our Bolocam data are adequately described when we add an additional component -
not described by a thermal SZE spectrum - coincident with this subcluster.
Using flux densities extracted from our model fits, and marginalizing over the
temperature constraints for the region, we fit a thermal+kinetic SZE spectrum
to our data and find the subcluster has a best-fit line of sight proper
velocity of 3600+3440/-2160km/s. This agrees with the optical velocity
estimates for the subcluster. The probability of velocity<0 given our
measurements is 2.1%. Repeating this analysis using flux densities measured
non-parametrically results in a 3.4% probability of a velocity<=0. We note that
this tantalizing result for the kinetic SZE is on resolved, subcluster scales.

different environmental density contrast probability distributions, the former
more likely to have high matter density, which in turn suppressing the effect
of the fifth force in matter clustering and halo formation. The use of Eulerian
environments also evades the unphysical restriction of having an upper mass

In equiaffine geometry, there is no invariant notion of inner product on

Nevertheless, it is possible to define an invariant notion of arc length for
nondegenerate curves, and an invariant first fundamental form for nondegenerate

permutation on the space XxU, where U={0,1,...,Q-1}, to the start state
(x_0,u_0), with u_0 drawn uniformly from U. This result can be applied to a
non-uniform distribution with probabilities that are integer multiples of 1/P,
for some integer P, by representing it as the marginal distribution for X from
the uniform distribution on a suitably-defined subset of XxY, where
Y={0,1,...,P-1}. By letting Q, P, and the cardinality of X go to infinity, this
result can be generalized to non-rational probabilities and to continuous state
spaces, with permutations on a finite space replaced by volume-preserving
one-to-one maps from a continuous space to itself. These constructions can be
efficiently implemented for chains commonly used in Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) simulations. I present two applications in this context - simulation of
K realizations of a chain from K initial states, but with transitions defined

processor or multiple processors, and use of MCMC to improve an importance
sampling distribution that already has substantial overlap with the

gaining increased attention with a growing awareness to safeguard critical
infrastructure networks against natural and man-induced disruptions. Routing
under limited information and the possibility of cascades through the network
adds serious challenges to this problem. This abstract considers the framework
of dynamical networks introduced in our earlier work [1,2], where the network
is modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations derived from mass
conservation laws on directed acyclic graphs with a single origin-destination
pair and a constant inflow at the origin. The rate of change of the particle
density on each link of the network equals the difference between the inflow
and the outflow on that link. The latter is modeled to depend on the current
particle density on that link through a flow function. The novel modeling
element in this paper is that every link is assumed to have finite capacity for
particle density and that the flow function is modeled to be strictly
increasing as density increases from zero up to the maximum density capacity,
and is discontinuous at the maximum density capacity, with the flow function
value being zero at that point. This feature, in particular, allows for the
possibility of spill-backs in our model. In this paper, we present our results
on resilience of such networks under distributed routing, towards perturbations
that reduce link-wise flow functions.

In the second part of that book, Durer gives compass and straightedge
constructions for the 'regular' polygons from the triangle to the 16-gon. We
will examine each of these constructions using the original 1525 text and
diagrams along with a translation. Then we will use Mathematica to carry out
the constructions which are only approximate, in order to compare them with the
regular case. In Appendix A, we discuss Durer's approximate trisection method
for angles, which is surprisingly accurate. Appendix B outlines what is known
currently about compass and straightedge constructions and includes two elegant
19th century constructions.

atomic systems in the context of coherent population transfer with the chirped

investigated by numerically solving the appropriate density matrix equations
beyond the rotating wave approximation. On the other hand, optical dipole force
is calculated by numerically solving the force equation and density matrix
equations self-consistently. By analysing the centre-of-mass motion, it is
shown that the optical dipole force with chirped pulses may be used for
focusing and defocusing of atoms in an atomic beam similar to the near or
non-resonant optical dipole force. Moreover, the robustness of the population
transfer against the variation of the pulse parameters and the effect of the
variation of the Rabi frequencies and the chirp rates on the optical dipole
force are also investigated. The proposed scheme may open new perspectives in
the focusing and de-focusing of atoms and molecules in an atomic beam, since
this scheme mitigates the demand for the generation of transform-limited pulse
laser fields at arbitrary frequencies.

Regions with shock-like excitation were identified in two kinematically
distinct regimes, characterized by broad ($\sigma >$ 150 \kms) and narrow
linewidths. Here we investigate the physical origin of the high-velocity
(broad) emission with shock-like line ratios. Considering the large amount of
extinction in these galaxies, the blueshift of the broad emission suggests an
origin on the near side of the galaxy and therefore an interpretation as a
galactic outflow. The large spatial extent of the broad, shocked emission
component is generally inconsistent with an origin in the narrow-line region of
a AGN, so we conclude that energy and momentum supplied by the starburst drives
these outflows. The new data are used to examine the fraction of the supernova
energy radiated by shocks and the mass loss rate in the warm-ionized phase of
the wind. We show that the shocks produced by galactic outflows can be
recognized in moderately high-resolution, integrated spectra of these nearby,
ultraluminous starbursts. The spectral fitting technique introduced in Paper I
may therefore be used to improve the accuracy of the physical properties

novel application of this concept in which the secondary cooperation aims at
improving secrecy of the primary network by creating more interference to the
eavesdropper than to the primary receiver. To generate the interference in a
positive way, this work studies an optimal design of a beamformer at the
secondary transmitter with multiple antennas that maximizes a secrecy rate of

eavesdropper tries to decode and remove the secondary signal (joint decoding).
Numerical results confirm that, for a wide range of required secondary rate
constraints, the proposed spectrum-leasing strategy increases the secrecy rate

the other four being Maxwell's macroscopic equations. The Lorentz law is the
universal expression of the force exerted by electromagnetic fields on a volume
containing a distribution of electrical charges and currents. If electric and
magnetic dipoles also happen to be present in a material medium, they are
traditionally treated by expressing the corresponding polarization and
magnetization distributions in terms of bound-charge and bound-current
densities, which are subsequently added to free-charge and free-current
densities, respectively. In this way, Maxwell's macroscopic equations are
reduced to his microscopic equations, and the Lorentz law is expected to
provide a precise expression of the electromagnetic force density on material
bodies at all points in space and time. This paper presents incontrovertible
theoretical evidence of the incompatibility of the Lorentz law with the
fundamental tenets of special relativity. We argue that the Lorentz law must be
abandoned in favor of a more general expression of the electromagnetic force
density, such as the one discovered by A. Einstein and J. Laub in 1908. Not

directly contributes to the fate as to how long the population would exist, a
process often described as Muller's ratchet with the absorbing phenomenon. The
key to understand this absorbing phenomenon is to characterize the decaying
time of the fittest class of the population. Adaptive landscape introduced by
Wright, a re-emerging powerful concept in systems biology, is used as a tool to
describe biological processes. To our knowledge, the dynamical behaviors for
Muller's ratchet over the full parameter regimes are not studied from the point
of the adaptive landscape. And the characterization of the absorbing phenomenon
is not yet quantitatively obtained without extraneous assumptions as well.
  Results: We describe the dynamical behavior of the population exposed to
Muller's ratchet in all parameters regimes by adaptive landscape. The adaptive
landscape has rich structures such as finite and infinite potential, real and
imaginary fixed points. We give the formula about the single click time with
finite and infinite potential. And we find the single click time increases with
selection rates and population size increasing, decreases with mutation rates
increasing. These results provide a new understanding of infinite potential. We
analytically demonstrate the adaptive and unadaptive states for the whole
parameters regimes. Interesting issues about the parameters regions with the
imaginary fixed points is demonstrated. This can help understand the biological
meaning of the critical points such as the intersection points of regimes. Most
importantly, we find that the absorbing phenomenon is characterized by the
adaptive landscape and the single click time without any extraneous
assumptions. These results suggest a graphical and quantitative framework to
study the absorbing phenomenon.

the effect of this vector potential is equivalent to a magnetic field that
corresponds in particular to a conservative irrotational one if it is
considered in connection with the correlation potential. An analysis of the

micro-simulation and agent-based model such as UrbanSim, ILUMAS and SIMFIRMS,

this purpose. These models, however, have limitations with respect to
simulating structural changes in spatial economic systems and the impact of
proximity. The present paper proposes a model of firm development that is based
on behavioural rules such as growth, closure, spin-off and relocation. An
important aspect of the model is that locational preferences of firms are based
on agglomeration advantages, accessibility of markets and congestion, allowing
for a proper description of concentration and deconcentration tendencies. By
comparing the outcomes of the proposed model with real world data, we will
calibrate the parameters and assess how well the model predicts existing
spatial configurations and decide. The model is implemented as an agent-based
simulation model describing firm development in the Netherlands in 21

an advanced photon flux performance of our instrumentation. We explore the

on the basis of a three-component Flory-Rehner theory. When the selectivity of
the minority solvent component to the polymer network is strong, the gel tends
to shrink with an increasing concentration of the additive, regardless of
whether it is good or poor. This behavior originates from the difference of the
additive concentration between inside and outside the gel. We also found the
gap of the gel volume at the transition point can be controlled by adding the
strongly selective solutes. By dissolving a strongly poor additive, for
instance, the discontinuous volume phase transition can be extinguished.
Furthermore, we observed that another volume phase trasition occurs far from
the original transition point. These behaviors can be well explained by a
simplified theory neglecting the non-linearity of the additive concentration.

first principles semi-empirical wave function theory and Kohn-Sham density
functional theory. Under these refinements the close-packed motif is shown to
be stable. For the case of the 7/2 motif a similar stability exists. The
electronic circular dichroism of the close-packed model has a significant
negative bias and a large signal. An interesting feature of the close-packed
structure is the existence of a central channel. Simulations show that, if
hydrogen atoms are placed in the cavity, a chain of molecular hydrogens is
formed suggesting a possible biological function for molecular hydrogen.

optimal scheduling algorithm for uniprocessor real time systems use for
scheduling the periodic task in soft real-time multiprocessor systems. In hard
real-time systems, a significant disparity exists EDF-based schemes and RMA
scheduling (which is the only known way of optimally scheduling recurrent
real-time tasks on multiprocessors): on M processors, all known EDF variants
have utilization-based schedulability bounds of approximately M/2, while RMA
algorithms can fully utilize all processors. This is unfortunate because EDF
based algorithms entail lower scheduling and task migration overheads. In work
on hard real-time systems, it has been shown that this disparity in
Schedulability can be lessened by placing caps on per task utilizations. Our
main contribution is a new EDF based scheme that ensures bounded deadline
tardiness. In this scheme, per-task utilizations must be focused,but overall
utilization need not be stricted. Our scheme should enable a wide range of soft
real-time applications to be scheduled with no constraints on total
utilization. Also propose techniques and heuristics that can be used to reduce
tardiness as well as increase the efficiency of task.

generalize models with zero and one free parameter to study a model with two
free parameters: besides perturbative terms ~T^4, we introduce terms ~T^2 and
~T^0. The two N-dependent parameters are determined by fitting to data from
numerical simulations on the lattice for the pressure, including the latent
heat. Good agreement is found for the pressure in the semi-quark gluon plasma
(QGP), which is the region from Tc, the critical temperature, to about ~4 Tc.
Above ~1.2 Tc, the pressure is a sum of a perturbative term, ~ +T^4, and a
simple non-perturbative term, essentially just a constant times ~ -Tc^2 T^2.
For the pressure, the details of the matrix model only enter within a very
narrow window, from Tc to ~1.2 Tc, whose width does not change significantly
with N. Without further adjustment, the model also agrees well with lattice
data for the 't Hooft loop. This is notable, because in contrast to the
pressure, the 't Hooft loop is sensitive to the details of the matrix model
over the entire semi-QGP. For the (renormalized) Polyakov loop, though, our
results disagree sharply with those from the lattice. Matrix models provide a
natural and generic explanation for why the deconfining phase transition in
SU(N) gauge theories is of first order not just for three, but also for four or
more colors. Lastly, we consider gauge theories where there is no strict order
parameter for deconfinement, such as for a G(2) gauge group. To agree with
lattice measurements, in the G(2) matrix model it is essential to add terms

implying similar hard X-ray/infrared emission processes in both. In contrast,
Compton-thick sources show a large deficit in the hard X-ray band, because high

isolated from the others in the sample. The other uses the X-ray vs. infrared
color as a useful redshift-independent indicator for identifying Compton-thick
AGN. Importantly, Compton-thick AGN and starburst galaxies in composite systems

(small number of edges) or light (low total weight) has skipped spanners that
are everywhere-sparse (small maximum degree). This disparity is in line with
other network design problems, where the maximum-degree objective has been a
notorious technical challenge. Our main result is for the Lowest Degree
2-Spanner (LD2S) problem, where the goal is to compute a 2-spanner of an input
graph so as to minimize the maximum degree. We design a polynomial-time
algorithm achieving approximation factor $\tilde O(\Delta^{3-2\sqrt{2}})
\approx \tilde O(\Delta^{0.172})$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the
input graph. The previous $\tilde O(\Delta^{1/4})$ -approximation was proved
nearly two decades ago by Kortsarz and Peleg [SODA 1994, SICOMP 1998].
  Our main conceptual contribution is to establish a formal connection between
LD2S and a variant of the Densest k-Subgraph (DkS) problem. Specifically, we
design for both problems strong relaxations based on the Sherali-Adams linear
programming (LP) hierarchy, and show that ""faithful"" randomized rounding of the
DkS-variant can be used to round LD2S solutions. Our notion of faithfulness
intuitively means that all vertices and edges are chosen with probability
proportional to their LP value, but the precise formulation is more subtle.
  Unfortunately, the best algorithms known for DkS use the Lov\'asz-Schrijver
LP hierarchy in a non-faithful way [Bhaskara, Charikar, Chlamtac, Feige, and
Vijayaraghavan, STOC 2010]. Our main technical contribution is to overcome this
shortcoming, while still matching the gap that arises in random graphs by
planting a subgraph with same log-density.

planetary debris formed from the destruction of asteroids. Combined with
optical data, a minimum of five and a maximum of eleven different metals are
detected in their photospheres. With metal sinking time scales of only a few
days, these stars are in accretion/diffusion equilibrium, and the photospheric
abundances closely reflect those of the circumstellar material. We find C/Si
ratios that are consistent with that of the bulk Earth, corroborating the rocky
nature of the debris. Their C/O values are also very similar to those of bulk
Earth, implying that the planetary debris is dominated by Mg and Fe silicates.
The abundances found for the debris at the four white dwarfs show substantial
diversity, comparable at least to that seen across different meteorite classes
in the solar system. PG0843+516 exhibits significant over-abundances of Fe and
Ni, as well as of S and Cr, which suggests the accretion of material that has
undergone melting, and possibly differentiation. PG1015+161 stands out by
having the lowest Si abundance relative to all other detected elements. The
Al/Ca ratio of the planetary debris around different white dwarfs is remarkably
similar. This is analogous to the nearly constant abundance ratio of these two
refractory lithophile elements found among most bodies in the solar system.
Based on the detection of all major elements of the circumstellar debris, we
calculate accretion rates of ~1.7e8g/s ~1.5e9g/s. We detect additional
circumstellar absorption in the SiIV 1394,1403 doublet in PG0843+516 and

infinitesimal calculus of the 17th century and 20th century developments such

theory of infinitesimals, require the resources of modern logic; thus many
commentators are comfortable denying a historical continuity. A notable
exception is Robinson himself, whose identification with the Leibnizian
tradition inspired Lakatos, Laugwitz, and others to consider the history of the
infinitesimal in a more favorable light. Inspite of his Leibnizian sympathies,
Robinson regards Berkeley's criticisms of the infinitesimal calculus as aptly
demonstrating the inconsistency of reasoning with historical infinitesimal
magnitudes. We argue that Robinson, among others, overestimates the force of
Berkeley's criticisms, by underestimating the mathematical and philosophical
resources available to Leibniz. Leibniz's infinitesimals are fictions, not
logical fictions, as Ishiguro proposed, but rather pure fictions, like
imaginaries, which are not eliminable by some syncategorematic paraphrase. We
argue that Leibniz's defense of infinitesimals is more firmly grounded than
Berkeley's criticism thereof. We show, moreover, that Leibniz's system for
differential calculus was free of logical fallacies. Our argument strengthens
the conception of modern infinitesimals as a development of Leibniz's strategy
of relating inassignable to assignable quantities by means of his
transcendental law of homogeneity.

Theory of Electric and Magnetic Susceptibilities. We highlight the continuity
of formalism and technique in the transition from dealing with spectra in the
old quantum theory to dealing with susceptibilities in the new quantum
mechanics. Our main focus is on the checkered history of a numerical factor in
the Langevin-Debye formula for the electric susceptibility of gases. Classical
theory predicts that this factor is equal to 1/3. The old quantum theory
predicted values up to 14 times higher. Van Vleck showed that quantum mechanics
does away with this ""wonderful nonsense"" (as Van Vleck called it) and restores
the classical value 1/3. The Langevin-Debye formula thus provides an
instructive example of a Kuhn loss in one paradigm shift that was regained in
the next. In accordance with Kuhn's expectation that textbooks sweep Kuhn
losses under the rug, Van Vleck did not mention this particular Kuhn loss
anywhere in his 1926 NRC Bulletin (though he prominently did flag a Kuhn loss
in dispersion theory that had recently been regained). Contrary to Kuhn's
expectations, however, he put the regained Kuhn loss in susceptibility theory
to good pedagogical use in his 1932 book. Kuhn claimed that textbooks must
suppress, truncate, and/or distort the prehistory of their subject matter if
they are to inculcate the exemplars of the new paradigm in their readers. This
claim is not borne out in this case. Because of the continuity of formalism and
technique that we draw attention to that Van Vleck could achieve his
pedagogical objectives in his 1932 book even though he devoted about a third of
it to the treatment of susceptibilities in classical theory and the old quantum
theory in a way that matches the historical record reasonably well.

effective approach to maximize the sum utility (e.g., system throughput) in

base station associations. In this paper we first show that this joint
optimization problem is NP-hard and thus is difficult to solve to global
optimality. To find a locally optimal solution, we formulate the problem as a
noncooperative game in which the users and the BSs both act as players. We
introduce a set of new utility functions for the players and show that every
Nash equilibrium (NE) of the resulting game is a stationary solution of the
original sum utility maximization problem. Moreover, we develop a best-response

an analytical derivation of the critical switching current based on the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, and the write error rate derived from a
solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, this model provides us a quick estimate
of the energydelay- reliability tradeoffs in perpendicular STTRAMs due to
thermal fluctuations. In other words, the model provides a simple way to
calculate the energy consumed during a write operation that ensures a certain
error rate and delay time, while being numerically far less intensive than a
full-fledged stochastic calculation. We calculate the worst case energy

data on the OVI troughs, which we compare to those available from an earlier

well-constrained photoionization solution for each outflow component. Two of
these kinematic components show troughs associated with transitions from
excited states of SiII\ and CII. The number density inferred from these
troughs, in combination with the deduced ioinization parameter, allows us to
determine the distance to these outflow components from the central source. We
find these components to be at a distance of ~ 10 kpc. The distances and the
number densities derived are consistent with the outflow being part of a

  The Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) is the foundation of many algorithms for
compression and indexing of text data, but the cost of computing the BWT of
very large string collections has prevented these techniques from being widely
applied to the large sets of sequences often encountered as the outcome of DNA
sequencing experiments. In previous work, we presented a novel algorithm that
allows the BWT of human genome scale data to be computed on very moderate
hardware, thus enabling us to investigate the BWT as a tool for the compression
of such datasets.
  Results
  We first used simulated reads to explore the relationship between the level
of compression and the error rate, the length of the reads and the level of
sampling of the underlying genome and compare choices of second-stage
compression algorithm.
  We demonstrate that compression may be greatly improved by a particular
reordering of the sequences in the collection and give a novel `implicit
sorting' strategy that enables these benefits to be realised without the
overhead of sorting the reads. With these techniques, a 45x coverage of real
human genome sequence data compresses losslessly to under 0.5 bits per base,
allowing the 135.3Gbp of sequence to fit into only 8.2Gbytes of space (trimming
a small proportion of low-quality bases from the reads improves the compression
still further).
  This is more than 4 times smaller than the size achieved by a standard
BWT-based compressor (bzip2) on the untrimmed reads, but an important further
advantage of our approach is that it facilitates the building of compressed
full text indexes such as the FM-index on large-scale DNA sequence collections.

through a pairwise potential in the presence of noise and communication time
delay. Previous work [Phys. Rev. E 77, 035203(R) (2008)] has shown that a
communication time delay in the swarm induces a pattern bifurcation that
depends on the size of the coupling amplitude. We extend these results by
completely unfolding the bifurcation structure of the mean field approximation.
Our analysis reveals a direct correspondence between the different dynamical
behaviors found in different regions of the coupling-time delay plane with the
different classes of simulated coherent swarm patterns. We derive the
spatio-temporal scales of the swarm structures, and also demonstrate how the
complicated interplay of coupling strength, time delay, noise intensity, and
choice of initial conditions can affect the swarm. In particular, our studies
show that for sufficiently large values of the coupling strength and/or the
time delay, there is a noise intensity threshold that forces a transition of
the swarm from a misaligned state into an aligned state. We show that this
alignment transition exhibits hysteresis when the noise intensity is taken to
be time dependent.

introduced an idea called ""effective static friction"" in our last paper to
balance the ""force"", $\frac{dV}{d\phi}|_{\phi=\phi(t_{rest})}$, of inflaton.
According to this idea, we now discover that, after the course of particle
creation, there will be a relationship between the final relativistic particle
number inside an arbitrary chosen comoving volume $N_r(t_{rest})$ and the
effective cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in our Universe. This relationship
can be expressed as $N_r(t_{rest})=(\frac{\ell^2m_\phi^2\Lambda}{4\pi
G\sigma^2(t_{rest})})^{3/2}$ when we employ the classical chaotic model,
$V(\phi)=1/2m_{\phi}^2\phi^2$, and consider that $\phi$ comes to rest at
$t_{rest}$. Moreover, we obtain an evolution equation for the particle number
($N_r(t)$) inside the comoving volume. Meanwhile, a new inflaton field equation
which contains parameters of $N_r(t)$ and ""particle creation coefficients"" can
also be found. Importantly, the results illustrate the fact that $\Lambda$ and
$N_r$ are the results of probability.
