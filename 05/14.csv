descriptions to better capture the semantics associated with locations. The
fusion of spatial locations and text descriptions in trajectories engenders a
new type of top-$k$ queries that take into account both aspects. Each
trajectory in consideration consists of a sequence of geo-spatial locations
associated with text descriptions. Given a user location $\lambda$ and a
keyword set $\psi$, a top-$k$ query returns $k$ trajectories whose text
descriptions cover the keywords $\psi$ and that have the shortest match
distance. To the best of our knowledge, previous research on querying
trajectory databases has focused on trajectory data without any text
description, and no existing work has studied such kind of top-$k$ queries on
trajectories. This paper proposes one novel method for efficiently computing
top-$k$ trajectories. The method is developed based on a new hybrid index,
cell-keyword conscious B$^+$-tree, denoted by \cellbtree, which enables us to
exploit both text relevance and location proximity to facilitate efficient and
effective query processing. The results of our extensive empirical studies with
an implementation of the proposed algorithms on BerkeleyDB demonstrate that our
proposed methods are capable of achieving excellent performance and good
scalability.

the classical Young's relation, since the solid is deformed elastically by the

the contact angles different from that predicted by Neumann's law, which
applies when the drop is floating on another liquid. Here we derive an
elasto-capillary model for contact angles on a soft solid, by coupling a
mean-field model for the molecular interactions to elasticity. We demonstrate
that the limit of vanishing elastic modulus yields Neumann's law or a slight
variation thereof, depending on the force transmission in the solid surface
layer. The change in contact angle from the rigid limit (Young) to the soft
limit (Neumann) appears when the length scale defined by the ratio of surface
tension to elastic modulus $\gamma/E$ reaches a few molecular sizes.

homeomorphic to the quotient R/A_5 of the open rectangular box R in the

Although the intersection of the image of omega and E is not necessarily a
singleton set, it is always a finite set of cardinality at most 60. By abuse of
language, we say that any state in this intersection is a canonical form of
states rho in E. In particular, we show that all checkerboard PPT entangled

We also summarize the known results on two-qutrit extreme PPT states and edge
states, and examine which other interesting properties they may have. Thus we
find the first examples of extreme PPT states whose rank is different from the

processes, from cell biology and epidemiology to sociology and finance. There
are many aspects of dynamical networks that require statistical considerations.
In this paper we focus on determining network structure. Estimating dynamic
networks is a difficult task since the number of components involved in the
system is very large. As a result, the number of parameters to be estimated is
bigger than the number of observations. However, a characteristic of many
networks is that they are sparse. For example, the molecular structure of genes
make interactions with other components a highly-structured and therefore
sparse process.
  Penalized Gaussian graphical models have been used to estimate sparse
networks. However, the literature has focussed on static networks, which lack
specific temporal constraints. We propose a structured Gaussian dynamical
graphical model, where structures can consist of specific time dynamics, known
presence or absence of links and block equality constraints on the parameters.
Thus, the number of parameters to be estimated is reduced and accuracy of the
estimates, including the identification of the network, can be tuned up. Here,
we show that the constrained optimization problem can be solved by taking
advantage of an efficient solver, logdetPPA, developed in convex optimization.
Moreover, model selection methods for checking the sensitivity of the inferred
networks are described. Finally, synthetic and real data illustrate the
proposed methodologies.

facts observed in financial markets when the density around the door is
compared with the logarithm of the price. The stylized properties are present
already when the agents in the pedestrian model are assumed to display a
zero-intelligent behavior. If agents are given decision-making capacity and
adapt to partially follow the majority, periods of herding behavior may
additionally occur. This generates the very slow decay of the autocorrelation
of absolute return due to an intermittent dynamics. Our finding suggest that
the stylized facts in the fluctuations of the financial prices result from a
competition of two groups with opposite interests in the presence of a
constraint funneling the flow of transactions to a narrow band of prices.

spaces. In this setting, N points are chosen randomly on a hyperbolic space and
any two of them are joined by an edge with probability that depends on their
hyperbolic distance, independently of every other pair. In particular, when the
positions of the points have been fixed, the distribution over the set of
graphs on these points is the Boltzmann distribution, where the Hamiltonian is
given by the sum of weighted indicator functions for each pair of points, with
the weight being proportional to a real parameter \beta>0 (interpreted as the
inverse temperature) as well as to the hyperbolic distance between the
corresponding points. This class of random graphs was introduced by Krioukov et
al. We provide a rigorous analysis of aspects of this model and its dependence
on the parameter \beta, verifying some of their observations. We show that a
phase transition occurs around \beta =1. More specifically, we show that when
\beta > 1 the degree of a typical vertex is bounded in probability (in fact it
follows a distribution which for large values exhibits a power-law tail whose
exponent depends only on the curvature of the space), whereas for \beta <1 the
degree is a random variable whose expected value grows polynomially in N. When
\beta = 1, we establish logarithmic growth.
  For the case \beta > 1, we establish a connection with a class of
inhomogeneous random graphs known as the Chung-Lu model. Assume that we use the
Poincar\'e disc representation of a hyperbolic space. If we condition on the
distance of each one of the points from the origin, then the probability that
two given points are adjacent is expressed through the kernel of this
inhomogeneous random graph.

topological surface states are present, with the Dirac point more exposed than
it is in Bi2Te3 and similar to that seen in Bi2Te2Se. Single crystal structure
determination indicates that the S in the outer chalcogen layers is closer to
the Bi than the Te, and therefore that the layers supporting the surface states
are corrugated on the atomic scale.

is geodesic, Cr(X) is the same as the homotopy critical spectrum, which differs
from the covering spectrum by a factor of 3/2. The latter two spectra are known
to be discrete for compact geodesic spaces, and correspond to the values at
which certain special covering maps, called delta-covers (Sormani-Wei) or
epsilon-covers (Plaut-Wilkins), change equivalence type. In this paper we
initiate the study of these ideas for non-geodesic spaces, motivated by the
need to understand the extent to which the accompanying covering maps are
topological invariants. We show that discreteness of the critical spectrum for
general metric spaces can fail in several ways, which we classify. The
""newcomer"" critical values for compact, non-geodesic spaces are completely
determined by the homotopy critical values and refinement critical values, the
latter of which can, in many cases, be removed by changing the metric in a

like machine learning, data mining and pattern recognition. Recently,
hashing-based approaches, e.g., Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), are proved to
be effective for scalable high dimensional nearest neighbors search. Many
hashing algorithms found their theoretic root in random projection. Since these
algorithms generate the hash tables (projections) randomly, a large number of
hash tables (i.e., long codewords) are required in order to achieve both high
precision and recall. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hashing
algorithm called {\em Density Sensitive Hashing} (DSH) in this paper. DSH can
be regarded as an extension of LSH. By exploring the geometric structure of the
data, DSH avoids the purely random projections selection and uses those
projective functions which best agree with the distribution of the data.
Extensive experimental results on real-world data sets have shown that the
proposed method achieves better performance compared to the state-of-the-art

short chains (a few nodes) the qualitative behavior of the entanglement and the
discord are very similar (the difference is quantitative), this is not valid
for longer chains ($N\gtrsim 10$). In this case, there are qualitative and
quantitative distinctions between the entanglement and the discord in all three
cases. We underline three most important features: (i) the quantum discord is
static in the $\beta$-representation, where the entanglement is identical to
zero; (ii) in the $c$-representation, the concurrence may be non-zero only
between the nearest neighbors (with a single exception), while the discord is
nonzero between any two nodes; (iii) there is so-called ""echo"" in the evolution
of the discord, which is not observed in the evolution of the concurrence.

correlations which allows a given quantum system to be more flexible in

interactions within edge modes. In this work, performed mainly in the nu=2/3
state, we placed a quantum dot a few micrometers upstream of an ohmic contact,
which served as a neutral modes source. We showed the neutral modes heat the
input of the dot, causing a net thermo-electric current to flow through it.
Heating of the electrons led to a decay of the neutral mode, manifested in the
vanishing of the thermo-electric current at T>110mK. This setup provides a
straightforward method to investigate upstream neutral modes without turning to
the more cumbersome noise measurements.

  and Using GPUs for Fast Preprocessing with Simple Hash Functions",,,,,"cs.IR cs.DB cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study several critical issues which must be tackled before
one can apply b-bit minwise hashing to the volumes of data often used
industrial applications, especially in the context of search.
  1. (b-bit) Minwise hashing requires an expensive preprocessing step that
computes k (e.g., 500) minimal values after applying the corresponding
permutations for each data vector. We developed a parallelization scheme using
GPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of
20-80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time.
  2. One major advantage of b-bit minwise hashing is that it can substantially
reduce the amount of memory required for batch learning. However, as online
algorithms become increasingly popular for large-scale learning in the context
of search, it is not clear if b-bit minwise yields significant improvements for
them. This paper demonstrates that $b$-bit minwise hashing provides an
effective data size/dimension reduction scheme and hence it can dramatically
reduce the data loading time for each epoch of the online training process.
This is significant because online learning often requires many (e.g., 10 to
100) epochs to reach a sufficient accuracy.
  3. Another critical issue is that for very large data sets it becomes
impossible to store a (fully) random permutation matrix, due to its space
requirements. Our paper is the first study to demonstrate that $b$-bit minwise
hashing implemented using simple hash functions, e.g., the 2-universal (2U) and
4-universal (4U) hash families, can produce very similar learning results as
using fully random permutations. Experiments on datasets of up to 200GB are
presented.

characterization of the response, and demonstrate that low frequency response
displays dynamic critical scaling near unjamming. Viscoelastic shear response
is governed by the relaxational eigenmodes of a packing. We use scaling
arguments to explain the distribution of eigenrates, which develops a
divergence at unjamming. We then derive the critical exponents characterizing
response, including a vanishing shear modulus, diverging viscosity, and
critical shear thinning regime. Finally, we demonstrate that macroscopic
rheology is sensitive to details of the local viscous force law. By varying the
ratio of normal and tangential damping coefficients, we identify and explain a
qualitative difference between systems with strong and weak damping of sliding
motion. When sliding is weakly damped there is no diverging time scale, no

generalized Besov-type and Triebel-Lizorkin-type function spaces is developed.
Many function spaces appearing in harmonic analysis fall under the scope of
this new framework. Among others, the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood
maximal operator or the related vector-valued maximal function on any of these
function spaces is not required to construct these generalized scales of
smoothness spaces. Instead of this, a key idea used in this framework is an
application of the Peetre maximal function. This idea originates from recent
findings in the abstract coorbit space theory obtained by Holger Rauhut and
Tino Ullrich. Under this new setting, the authors establish the boundedness of
pseudo-differential operators based on atomic and molecular characterizations
and also the boundedness of the Fourier multipliers. The characterizations of
these function spaces by means of differences and oscillations are also

15000 plasmas produced in the Joint European Torus (JET) have been carefully
reviewed using the two main diagnostics available over this time period:
Michelson interferometer and Thomson scattering systems. Long term stability of
JET Te is experimentaly observed by defining the ECE TS ratio as the ratio of
central Te measured by Michelson and LIDAR.
  This paper, based on a careful review of Te measurement from 15 years of JET
plasmas, concludes that JET Te exhibits a 15-20% effective uncertainty mostly
made of large-scale temporal drifts, and an overall uncertainty of 16-22%.
  Variations of 18 plasma parameters are checked in another data set, made of a
""reference data set"" made of ohmic pulses as similar as possible between 1998
and 2009. Time drifts of ECE TS ratios appear to be mostly disconnected from
the variations observed on these 18 plasma parameters, except for the very low
amplitude variations of the field which are well correlated with off-plasma
variations of a 8-channel integrator module used for measuring many magnetic
signals from JET.
  From mid-2002 to 2009, temporal drifts of ECE TS ratios are regarded as
calibration drifts possibly caused by unexpected sensitivity to unknown
parameters; the external temperature on JET site might be the best parameter
suspected so far.
  Off-plasma monitoring of MI made of calibration performed in the laboratory
are reported and do not appear to be clearly correlated with drifts of ECE TS
ratio and variations of magnetics signals integrators. Comparison of
estimations of plasma thermal energy for purely Ohmic and NBI-only plasmas does
not provide any definite information on the accuracy of \mi or \lidar
measurements.
  Whatever causes these Te drifts, this experimental issue is regarded as
crucial for JET data quality.

this paper. In this model, to keep the form of the stress-energy of the vacuum
required by general covariance, the holographic vacuum is enforced to exchange
energy with dark matter. It is demonstrated that for the holographic model the
best choice for the IR cutoff of the effective quantum field theory is the
event horizon size of the universe. We derive the evolution equations of the
holographic $\Lambda(t)$CDM model in a non-flat universe. We constrain the
model by using the current observational data, including the 557 Union2 type Ia
supernovae data, the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data from the 7-yr
WMAP, and the baryon acoustic oscillation data from the SDSS. Our fit results
show that the holographic $\Lambda(t)$CDM model tends to favor a spatially
closed universe (the best-fit value of $\Omega_{k0}$ is -0.042), and the 95%
confidence level range for the spatial curvature is $-0.101<\Omega_{k0}<0.040$.
We show that the interaction between the holographic vacuum and dark matter
induces an energy flow of which the direction is first from vacuum to dark
matter and then from dark matter to vacuum. Thus, the holographic
$\Lambda(t)$CDM model is just a time-varying vacuum energy scenario in which
the interaction between vacuum and dark matter changes sign during the
expansion of the universe.

stationary ergodic distributions. In proving this, we obtain new game-theoretic

ergodic theorem and convergence properties of conditional distributions, we
prove that a classical Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem holds for a restricted

prediction strategies.
  If a game is mixable, then there is an optimal aggregating strategy which
loses at most an additive constant when compared to any other lower
semicomputable strategy. The loss incurred by this algorithm on an infinite
sequence of outcomes is called its predictive complexity. We use our version of
Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem to prove that when a restriced regular game
has a predictive complexity, the predictive complexity converges to the
generalized entropy of the game almost everywhere with respect to the
stationary ergodic distribution.

the dimension of the i-th extension group between an atom and an object
coincides with the i-th Bass number of the object with respect to the atom. As
an application, we give a bijection between the E-stable subcategories closed
under arbitrary direct sums and direct summands and the subsets of the atom
spectrum and show that such subcategories are also closed under extensions,
kernels of epimorphisms, and cokernels of monomorphisms. We show some
relationships to the theory of prime ideals in the case of noetherian algebras.

propagation and consensus formation in societies. Its main feature is that its
rules favour bigger groups of agreeing people. In a previous work, we
generalized the bounded confidence rule in order to model biases and prejudices
in discrete opinion models. In that work, we applied this modification to the
Sznajd model and presented some preliminary results. The present work extends
what we did in that paper. We present results linking many of the properties of
the mean-field fixed points, with only a few qualitative aspects of the
confidence rule (the biases and prejudices modelled), finding an interesting
connection with graph theory problems. More precisely, we link the existence of
fixed points with the notion of strongly connected graphs and the stability of
fixed points with the problem of finding the maximal independent sets of a
graph. We present some graph theory concepts, together with examples, and
comparisons between the mean-field and simulations in Barab\'asi-Albert
networks, followed by the main mathematical ideas and appendices with the
rigorous proofs of our claims. We also show that there is no qualitative
difference in the mean-field results if we require that a group of size q>2,
instead of a pair, of agreeing agents be formed before they attempt to convince
other sites (for the mean-field, this would coincide with the q-voter model).

August of 2004. In the referendum, voters were to vote YES if they wished to
recall the President and NO if they wanted him to continue in office. The
official results were 59% NO and 41% YES. Even though the election was
monitored by various international groups including the Organization of
American States and the Carter Center (both of which declared that the
referendum had been conducted in a free and transparent manner), the outcome of
the election was questioned by other groups both inside and outside of
Venezuela. The collection of manuscripts that comprise this issue of
Statistical Science discusses the general topic of election forensics but also
focuses on different statistical approaches to explore, post-election, whether
irregularities in the voting, vote transmission or vote counting processes
could be detected in the 2004 presidential recall referendum. In this
introduction to the Venezuela issue, we discuss the more recent literature on
post-election auditing, describe the institutional context for the 2004
Venezuelan referendum, and briefly introduce each of the five contributions.

obtaining high vertical resolution atmospheric profiles. We present an
objective and simple technique to derive the parameters used in the optimal
estimation method that retrieve atmospheric states from the spectra. The
retrievals obtained in this way are optimal in the sense of providing the best
possible validation statistics obtained from the difference between retrievals
and a chosen calibration/validation dataset of atmospheric states. This is
demonstrated analytically. To illustrate this result several real world
examples using IASI retrievals fine tuned to ECMWF analyses are shown. The
analytical equations obtained give further insight into the various
contributions to the biases and errors of the retrievals and the consequences
of using other types of fine tuning. Retrievals using IASI show an error of 0.9
to 1.9 K in temperature and below 6.5 K in humidity dew point temperature in
the troposphere on the vertical radiative transfer model pressure grid
(RTIASI-4.1), which has a vertical spacing between 300 and 400 m. The more
accurately the calibration dataset represents the true state of the atmosphere,
the better the retrievals will be when compared to the true states.

formation of giant planets. We study the gravitational stability for the
protoplanetary disks around a protostar. The temperature and Toomre's Q-value
are calculated by assuming local equilibrium between viscous heating and
radiative cooling (local thermal equilibrium). We assume constant $\alpha$
viscosity and use a cooling function with realistic opacity. Then, we derive
the critical surface density $\Sigma_{\rm{c}}$ that is necessary for a disk to
become gravitationally unstable as a function of $r$. This critical surface
density $\Sigma_{\rm c}$ is strongly affected by the temperature dependence of
the opacity. At the radius $r_{\rm c}\sim 20$AU, where ices form, the value of
$\Sigma_{\rm c}$ changes discontinuously by one order of magnitude. This
$\Sigma_{\rm c}$ is determined only by local thermal process and criterion of
gravitational instability. By comparing a given surface density profile to
$\Sigma_{\rm c}$, one can discuss the gravitational instability of
protoplanetary disks. As an example, we discuss the gravitational instability
of two semi-analytic models for protoplanetary disks. One is the steady state
accretion disk, which is realized after the viscous evolution. The other is the
disk that has the same angular momentum distribution with its parent cloud
core, which corresponds to the disk that has just formed. As a result, it is
found that the disks tend to become gravitationally unstable for $r\ge r_{\rm
c}$ because ices enable the disks to become low temperature. In the region
closer to the protostar than $r_{\rm c}$, it is difficult for a typical
protoplanetary disk to fragment because of the high temperature and the large
Coriolis force. From this result, we conclude that the fragmentation near the
central star is possible but difficult.

BHT-BP focuses on sparse support recovery rather than sparse signal estimation.
The key idea behind BHT-BP is to detect the support set of a sparse vector
using hypothesis test where the posterior densities used in the test are
obtained by aid of belief propagation (BP). Since BP provides precise posterior
information using the noise statistic, BHT-BP can recover the support with
robustness against the measurement noise. In addition, BHT-BP has low
computational cost compared to the other algorithms by the use of BP. We show
the support recovery performance of BHT-BP on the parameters (N; M; K; SNR) and
compare the performance of BHT-BP to OMP and Lasso via numerical results.

and how these can be used to recognise which homotopy equivalences of
reasonable topological spaces are homotopic to homeomorphisms. Let $f:X\to Y$

We prove that $f$ has contractible point inverses if and only if it is an
$\epsilon$-controlled homotopy equivalences for all $\epsilon>0$, if and only
if $f\times\mathrm{id}:X\times\mathbb{R} \to Y\times\mathbb{R}$ is a homotopy
equivalence bounded over the open cone $O(Y^+)$ of Pedersen and Weibel. This
approach can be generalised to algebra using geometric categories: the
$X$-controlled categories $\mathbb{A}^*(X)$, $\mathbb{A}_*(X)$ of Ranicki and
Weiss together with the bounded categories $\mathcal{C}_M(\mathbb{A})$ of
Pedersen and Weibel. Analogous to the barycentric subdivision of a simplicial
complex, we define the algebraic subdivision of a chain complex over that
simplicial complex. The main theorem of the thesis is that a chain complex $C$
is chain contractible in $\mathbb{A}(X)$ if and only if

squeezing result: a chain complex with a small enough chain contraction has
arbitrarily small chain contractions. We conclude with consequences for
Poincar\'e Duality spaces. Squeezing tells us that a $PL$ Poincar\'e duality
space with small enough Poincar\'e duality is a homology manifold and the main
theorem tells us that a $PL$ Poincar\'e duality space $X$ is a homology

researchers try to understand ever more complex systems, there is a continual
need for software with new capabilities. Because of the wide range of questions
being investigated, new software is often developed rapidly by individuals or
small groups. In these cases, it can be hard to demonstrate that the software
gives the right results. Software developers are often open about the code they
produce and willing to share it, but there is little appreciation among
potential users of the great diversity of software development practices and
end results, and how this affects the suitability of software tools for use in
research projects. To help clarify these issues, we have reviewed a range of
software tools and asked how the culture and practice of software development
affects their validity and trustworthiness. We identified four key questions
that can be used to categorize software projects and correlate them with the
type of product that results. The first question addresses what is being
produced. The other three concern why, how, and by whom the work is done. The
answers to these questions show strong correlations with the nature of the
software being produced, and its suitability for particular purposes. Based on
our findings, we suggest ways in which current software development practice in
computational neuroscience can be improved and propose checklists to help
developers, reviewers and scientists to assess the quality whether particular
pieces of software are ready for use in research.

constraints on gas and ice giant formation in the core accretion scenario. The
approximately 10-Earth-mass solid core responsible for the attraction of the
gaseous envelope has to form before gas dissipation in the protoplanetary disc
is completed within 1-10 million years. Building up the core by collisions
between km-sized planetesimals fails to meet this time-scale constraint,
especially at wide stellar separations. Nonetheless, gas-giant planets are
detected by direct imaging at wide orbital distances. In this paper, we
numerically study the growth of cores by the accretion of cm-sized pebbles
loosely coupled to the gas. We measure the accretion rate onto seed masses
ranging from a large planetesimal to a fully grown 10-Earth-mass core and test
different particle sizes. The numerical results are in good agreement with our
analytic expressions, indicating the existence of two accretion regimes, one
set by the azimuthal and radial particle drift for the lower seed masses and
the other, for higher masses, by the velocity at the edge of the Hill sphere.
In the former, the optimally accreted particle size increases with core mass,
while in the latter the optimal size is centimeters, independent of core mass.
We discuss the implications for rapid core growth of gas-giant and ice-giant
cores. We conclude that pebble accretion can resolve the long-standing core
accretion time-scale conflict. This requires a near-unity dust-to-gas ratio in
the midplane, particle growth to mm and cm and the formation of massive
planetesimals or low radial pressure support. The core growth time-scale is
shortened by a factor 30-1,000 at 5 AU and by a factor 100-10,000 at 50 AU,
compared to the gravitationally focused accretion of, respectively,
low-scale-height planetesimal fragments or standard km-sized planetesimals.

Galactic halo.A series of grid lens models are built by assuming firstly that a
SGMC is a lattice with clumps of $\rm 10^{-3} M_\odot$, 10 AU in size, and
assuming various filling factors of the cloud, and secondly a fractal
structure. Local amplifications are calculated for these lenses by using the
public software LensTool, and the single plane approximation. A complex network
of caustics due to the clumpy structure is present. Our best single plane lens
model capable of explaining Longo's effect, \sl at least in sparse regions, \rm
requires a mass $\rm (1.5-4.1) \times 10^{10} ~M_\odot$ within $\rm 8.7 \times
8.7 \times (5-8.6) kpc^3$ at a lens plane distance of 20 kpc. It is constructed
from a molecular cloud building block of $5 \times 10^5 M_\odot$ within a scale
of 30 pc expanded by fractal scaling with dimension $D = 1.8-2$ up to 5-8.6 kpc
for the SGMC. If such a Supergiant Molecular Cloud were demonstrated, it might
be part of a lens explanation for the luminous anomaly discovered in quasars
and in red galaxies. The mass budget may be varied by changing the cloud depth
and the fractal dimension.

continuum, obtained by combining XRT and IBIS data, is flat (Gamma ~ 1.3) with

X-ray observations indicate flux variability which is further supported by a
comparison with a previous ROSAT measurement. IGR J12319-0749 is also a radio
emitting object likely characterized by a flat spectrum and high radio
loudness; optically it is a broad-line emitting object with a massive black
hole (2.8 x 10^{9}$ solar masses) at its center. The source Spectral Energy

dependence in resistivity and magnetization in the phase separated state of Al
doped Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$MnO$_3$. The rate of time dependence in resistivity
is much higher than that of magnetization and it exhibits a different cooling
field dependence due to percolation effects. Our analysis show that the time
dependence in physical properties depends on the phase transition dynamics
which can be effectively tuned by variation of temperature, cooling field and
metastable phase fraction. The phase transition dynamics can be broadly divided
into the arrested and un-arrested regimes, and in the arrested regime, this
dynamics is mainly determined by time taken in the growth of critical nuclei.
An increase in cooling field and/or temperature shifts this dynamics from
arrested to un-arrested regime, and in this regime, this dynamics is determined
by thermodynamically allowed rate of formation of critical nuclei which in turn
depends on the cooling field and available metastable phase fraction. At a
given temperature, a decrease in metastable phase fraction shifts the crossover
from arrested to un-arrested regimes towards lower cooling field. It is rather
significant that inspite of the metastable phase fraction calculated from
resistivity being somewhat off from that of magnetization, their cooling field
dependence exhibits a striking similarity which indicate that the dynamics in
arrested and un-arrested regimes are so different that it comes out vividly
provided that the measurements are done around percolation threshold.

features of this particular microstructure: first, the limit orders sent by the
high frequency trader are only partially executed, and therefore she has no
control on the executed quantity. For this purpose, cumulative executed volumes
are modelled by compound Poisson processes. Second, the high frequency trader
faces the overtrading risk, which is the risk of brutal variations in her
inventory. The consequences of this risk are investigated in the context of
optimal liquidation. The optimal trading problem is studied by stochastic
control and dynamic programming methods, which lead to a characterization of
the value function in terms of an integro quasi-variational inequality. We then
provide the associated numerical resolution procedure, and convergence of this
computational scheme is proved. Next, we examine several situations where we
can on one hand simplify the numerical procedure by reducing the number of
state variables, and on the other hand focus on specific cases of practical
interest. We examine both a market making problem and a best execution problem

multipartite entanglement that generalizes the well-known notion of
concurrence. We define an observable for GME concurrence. The observable
permits us to avoid full state tomography and leads to different analytic lower
bounds. By means of explicit examples we show that entanglement criteria based
on the bounds have a better performance with respect to the known methods.

(RCE), may be used to quantify the emergence of coherent low-entropy
configurations, such as time-dependent or time-independent topological and
nontopological spatially-extended structures. As an illustration, we
investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of spontaneous symmetry-breaking in
three spatial dimensions. In particular, we focus on a model where a real
scalar field, prepared initially in a symmetric thermal state, is quenched to a
broken-symmetric state. For a certain range of initial temperatures,
spatially-localized, long-lived structures known as oscillons emerge in
synchrony and remain until the field reaches equilibrium again. We show that
the RCE correlates with the number-density of oscillons, thus offering a
quantitative measure of the emergence of nonperturbative spatiotemporal
patterns that can be generalized to a variety of physical systems.

recent paper (Zheng et al. 2012c), we found that GRBs with photons detected in

respect to the photon number above background. Extrapolation of our empirical
fit to numbers of photons below our quoted detection limit suggests that the
overall rate of such events could be determined by standard image co-adding
techniques. In this case, we have taken advantage of the excellent angular
resolution of the Swift mission to provide accurate reference points for 79 GRB

find a small but significant signal. Guided by the power law fit obtained

distribution inside a physical body from boundary measurements of current and

functionality of impedance tomography relies heavily on accurate modelling of
the measurement geometry. In particular, almost all reconstruction algorithms
require the precise shape of the imaged body as an input. In this work, the
need for prior geometric information is relaxed by introducing a Newton-type
output least squares algorithm that reconstructs the admittivity distribution
and the object shape simultaneously. The method is built in the framework of
the complete electrode model and it is based on the Fr\'echet derivative of the
corresponding current-to-voltage map with respect to the object boundary shape.
The functionality of the technique is demonstrated via numerical experiments
with simulated measurement data.

is that for protoplanetary disks, where significant grain growth and settling
has occurred, the dust disk has flattened to the point that it can be partially
or largely shadowed by the innermost material at or near the dust sublimation
radius. When the self-shadowing has already started, the outer disk is expected
to be detected in scattered light only in the exceptional cases that the scale
height of the dust disk at the sublimation radius is smaller than usual.
High-contrast imaging combined with the IR spectral energy distribution allow
us to measure the degree of flattening of the disk, as well as to determine the
properties of the outer disk. We present polarimetric differential imaging in
$H$ band obtained with Subaru/HiCIAO of one such system, MWC 480. The HiCIAO
data were obtained at a historic minimum of the NIR excess. The disk is
detected in scattered light from 0\farcs2-1\farcs0 (27.4-137AU). Together with
the marginal detection of the disk from 1998 February 24 by HST/NICMOS, our
data constrain the opening half angle for the disk to lie between
1.3$\leq\theta\leq 2.2^\circ$. When compared with similar measures in CO for
the gas disk from the literature, the dust disk subtends only $\sim$30% of the
gas disk scale height (H/R$\sim$0.03). Such a dust disk is a factor of 5-7
flatter than transitional disks, which have structural signatures that giant
planets have formed.

cosmologies for different fluids are explicitly realized, and their properties
are also explored. It is shown that all the above dark energy universes may

current acceleration with the features of quintessence/phantom cosmology, and
demonstrate their equivalence to the corresponding fluid descriptions. In the
