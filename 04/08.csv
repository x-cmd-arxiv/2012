Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA). It is pointed out the possibility of
appearance of the lines, caused by totally symmetric vibrations transforming
after the unit irreducible representation, which are forbidden in usual
infrared absorption spectra in molecules with sufficiently high symmetry.
Observation of such lines in the SEIRA spectra of diprotonated and ethylene,
adsorbed on and on mordenites is pointed out. The results well agree with our
ideas about surface enhanced optical processes, based on the conception of a
strong quadrupole light-molecule interaction, which allows us to develop the
SERS and SEHRS theories.

the mankind and the reason behind all the evolutions of science; such as
medicine, communication, education, and physics. At this edge of technology
engineers and scientists are trying to model a machine that behaves the same as
they do, which pushed us to think about designing and implementing ""Things

of the major discoveries and studies in the field of machine cognition, which
are the ""Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer""(EPAM) and ""The General Problem
Solver""(GPS). The First one focus mainly on implementing the human-verbal
learning behavior, while the second one tries to model an architecture that is
able to solve problems generally (e.g. theorem proving, chess playing, and
arithmetic). We will cover the major goals and the main ideas of each model, as
well as comparing their strengths and weaknesses, and finally giving their
fields of applications. And Finally, we will suggest a real life implementation

efficient routing protocols in opportunistic networks. But this kind of
information is not always available. When users are very isolated, context
information cannot be distributed, and cannot be used for taking efficient
routing decisions. In such cases, context oblivious based schemes are only way
to enable communication between users. As soon as users become more social,
context data spreads in the network, and context based routing becomes an
efficient solution. In this paper we design an integrated routing protocol that
is able to use context data as soon as it becomes available and falls back to
dissemination based routing when context information is not available. Then, we
provide a comparison between Epidemic and PROPHET, these are representative of
context oblivious and context aware routing protocols. Our results show that

delivery probability and message delay in both cases when context information

asymptotic series which are also typically not Borel resummable in the sense
that the resummed series is ambiguous. The ambiguity is associated with
singularities in the Borel plane on the positive real axis. In quantum
mechanics there are cases in which the ambiguity that arises in perturbation
theory cancels against a similarly ambiguous contribution from
instanton--anti-instanton events. In asymptotically free gauge theories this
mechanism does not suffice because perturbation theory develops ambiguities
associated with singularities in the Borel plane which are closer to the origin
by a factor of about N (the rank of the gauge group) compared to the
singularities realized by instanton events. These are called IR renormalon
poles, and on R**4 they do not possess any known semiclassical realization. By
using continuity on R**3 x S**1, and by generalizing the works of Bogomolny and
Zinn-Justin to QFT, we identify saddle point field configurations, e.g.,
bion--anti-bion events, corresponding to singularities in the Borel plane which
are of order N times closer to the origin than the 4d BPST
instanton--anti-instanton singularity. We conjecture that these are the leading
singularities in the Borel plane and that they are the incarnation of the
elusive renormalons in the weak coupling regime.

dynamic discrete choice models, not only of some particular conditional
characteristics such as moments or symmetry. Knowing the true distribution is
important in many circumstances, in particular to apply efficient maximum
likelihood methods, obtain consistent estimates of partial effects and
appropriate predictions of the probability of future events. We propose a
transformation of data which under the true conditional distribution leads to
continuous uniform iid series. The uniformity and serial independence of the
new series is then examined simultaneously. The transformation can be
considered as an extension of the integral transform tool for noncontinuous
data. We derive asymptotic properties of such tests taking into account the
parameter estimation effect. Since transformed series are iid we do not require
any mixing conditions and asymptotic results illustrate the double simultaneous
checking nature of our test. The test statistics converges under the null with
a parametric rate to the asymptotic distribution, which is case dependent,
hence we justify a parametric bootstrap approximation. The test has power
against local alternatives and is consistent. The performance of the new tests
is compared with classical specification checks for discrete choice models.

the energy of interaction between the particles in a dimer depending on their

recursive computation of the partition function for ""Manhattan"" EDM systems

Markov random field of Pickard type which behaves in space like autoregressive
processes do in time. For one-dimensional Manhattan EDM systems, we compute the
MLE of the resulting Gaussian Markov chain as the largest eigenvalue of a

paid. This model has been generalised to the setting that $X$ is a spectrally
negative L\'evy process by Albrecher et al. \cite{albr_ren_zhou}. Finally
Kyprianou and Zhou (2009) extend this model further by allowing the rate at
which tax is paid with respect to the process $S = \{S_t : t\geq 0\}$ to vary
as a function of the current value of $S$. Specifically, they consider the
so-called perturbed spectrally negative Levy process, \[
U_t=X_t-\int_{(0,t]}\gamma(S_u)\,{\rm d} S_u,\qquad t\geq 0, \] under the
assumptions $\gamma :[0,\infty)\rightarrow [0,1)$ and $\int_0^\infty

Korovkin-type theorems are proved for convergence of completely positive maps

entanglement entropy. In particular, we establish that the causal holographic

with the entanglement entropy in all cases where one has a microscopic

by dropping 4 elements of the bitplane in such a away that the pixel values of

in level three, the size of the statistical moments is reduced. The experiments

which is related to the initial orbital data in the simulations. For GJ 1214
system, different cases of initial eccentricity are also considered as only an
upper limit of its eccentricity (0.27) is shown, and the outcome suggests a
possible maximum initial eccentricity (0.4) in the adopted dynamical model.
Moreover, additional runs with alternative values of dissipation factor
$Q^\prime_1$ are carried out to explore tidal evolution for GJ 1214b, and these
results further indicate that the real $Q^\prime_1$ of GJ 1214b may be much
larger than its typical value, which may reasonably suggest that GJ 1214b bears
a present-day larger eccentricity, undergoing tidal circularization at a slow
rate. For the CoRoT-7 system, tidal forces make two planets migrating towards
their host star as well as producing tidal circularization, and in this process
tidal effects and mutual gravitational interactions are coupled with each
other. Various scenarios of the initial eccentricity of the outer planet have
also been done to investigate final planetary configuration. Tidal decay
arising from stellar tides may still work for each system as the eccentricity
decreases to zero, and this is in association with the remaining lifetime of
each planet used to predict its future.

surface of the iron-based superconductors vary as the Fe-As-Fe bond angle
changes. We discuss how these Fermi surface configurations affect the
superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations, and show that in several
situations, frustration in the sign of the gap function arises due to the
repulsive pairing interactions that requires sign change of the order
parameter. Such a frustration can result in nodes or very small gaps, and
generally works destructively against superconductivity. Conversely, we propose
that the optimal condition for superconductivity is realized for the Fermi
surface configuration that gives the least frustration while maximizing the
Fermi surface multiplicity. This is realized when there are three hole Fermi
surfaces, where two of them have $d_{XZ/YZ}$ orbital character and one has
$d_{X^2-Y^2}$ {\it for all $k_z$} in the three dimensional Brillouin zone.
Looking at the band structures of various iron-based superconductors, the
occurrence of such a ""sweet spot"" situation is limited to a narrow window.

To solve the dynamics in the Rigged QED, we need different techniques from
those developed for the conventional QED. As a first step toward this issue, we
propose a procedure to expand the Dirac field operator, which represents
electrons, by the electron annihilation/creation operators and solutions of the
Dirac equation for electrons in nuclear potential. Similarly, the Schrodinger
field operators, which represent atomic nuclei, are expanded by nucleus
annihilation/creation operators. Then we derive time evolution equations for
these annihilation and creation operators and discuss how time evolution of the

method to approximate the evolution equations of the operators by the evolution

secure connection. In cellular networks, we show that without relay, it is
difficult to establish secure connections from the base station to the cell
edge users. The effect of relay placement for the cell edge users is
demonstrated by simulation. For both scenarios, we find that the benefit of
relay transmission increases when path loss becomes severer.

underlying picture of electrons and deuterons as elementary Dirac particles.
Within this model there appears a term in which lattice vibrations are coupled
to internal nuclear transitions. This is interesting as it has the potential to
provide a connection between experiment and models that describe coherent
energy transfer between two-level systems and an oscillator. In this work we
describe a calculation of the coupling matrix element in the case of the
deuteron based on the old empirical Hamada-Johnston model for the
nucleon-nucleon interaction. The triplet S and D states of the the deuteron in
the rest frame couples to a singlet P state through this new interaction. The
singlet P state in this calculation is a virtual state with an energy of 125
MeV, and a coupling matrix element for $z$-directed motion given by $2.98
\times 10^{-3} ~M_J c \hat{P}_z$.

the context of solvable k-essence cosmologies. For this purpose, we construct
equations of state parameter of this model for some particular values of the
parameter $n$. The graphical behavior of these equations are also discussed by
using power law form of potential. The relationship between k-essence and
modified Chaplygin gas model shows viable results in the dark energy scenario.
We conclude that the universe behaves as a cosmological constant, quintessence
phase or phantom phase depending upon $n$.
