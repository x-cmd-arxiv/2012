quantifying uncertainty in a number of challenging dynamic, state estimation,
or data assimilation, problems such as weather forecasting and ocean modeling.
In these problems a high-dimensional state parameter is successively updated
based on recurring physical observations, with the aid of a computationally
demanding forward model that prop- agates the state from one time step to the
next. More recently, the EnKF has proven effective in history matching in the
petroleum engineering community (Evensen, 2009; Oliver and Chen, 2010). Such
applications typically involve estimating large numbers of parameters,
describing an oil reservoir, using data from production history that accumulate
over time. Such history matching problems are especially challenging examples
of computer model calibration since they involve a large number of model
parameters as well as a computationally demanding forward model. More
generally, computer model calibration combines physical observations with a
computational model - a computer model - to estimate unknown parameters in the
computer model. This paper explores how the EnKF can be used in computer model
calibration problems, comparing it to other more common approaches, considering
applications in climate and cosmology.

As a source of photon irradiation, we used an operating second SINIS-type SET B
positioned in the vicinity of the trap. In the experiment, the average hold
time of the trap was found to be critically dependent on the voltage across SET
B. Starting in a certain voltage range, a photon-assisted electron escape was
observed at a rate roughly proportional to the emission rate of the photons
with energies exceeding the superconducting gap of S-electrodes in the trap.
The discussed mechanism of photon emission and detection is of interest for
low-temperature noise spectrometry and it can be of relevance for the ampere

aspects of the model, including injection of thermal and kinetic energy by SN
explosions, radiative cooling, photoelectric heating and various transport
processes. With 3D domain extending 1 kpc^2 horizontally and 2 kpc vertically,
the model routinely spans gas number densities 10^-5 - 10^2 cm^-3, temperatures
10-10^8 K, local velocities up to 10^3 km s^-1 (with Mach number up to 25).
  The thermal structure of the modelled ISM is classified by inspection of the
joint probability density of the gas number density and temperature. We confirm
that most of the complexity can be captured in terms of just three phases,
separated by temperature borderlines at about 10^3 K and 5x10^5 K. The
probability distribution of gas density within each phase is approximately
lognormal. We clarify the connection between the fractional volume of a phase
and its various proxies, and derive an exact relation between the fractional
volume and the filling factors defined in terms of the volume and probabilistic
averages. These results are discussed in both observational and computational
contexts. The correlation scale of the random flows is calculated from the
velocity autocorrelation function; it is of order 100 pc and tends to grow with
distance from the mid-plane. We use two distinct parameterizations of radiative
cooling to show that the multi-phase structure of the gas is robust, as it does

sequence that supports random access, searching, range counting and analytics
operations, both for exact matches and prefix search. String sequences lie at
the core of column-oriented databases, log processing, and other storage and
query tasks. In these applications each string can appear several times and the
order of the strings in the sequence is relevant. The prefix structure of the
strings is relevant as well: common prefixes are sought in strings to extract
interesting features from the sequence. Moreover, space-efficiency is highly
desirable as it translates directly into higher performance, since more data
can fit in fast memory.
  We introduce and study the problem of compressed indexed sequence of strings,
representing indexed sequences of strings in nearly-optimal compressed space,
both in the static and dynamic settings, while preserving provably good
performance for the supported operations.
  We present a new data structure for this problem, the Wavelet Trie, which
combines the classical Patricia Trie with the Wavelet Tree, a succinct data
structure for storing a compressed sequence. The resulting Wavelet Trie
smoothly adapts to a sequence of strings that changes over time. It improves on
the state-of-the-art compressed data structures by supporting a dynamic
alphabet (i.e. the set of distinct strings) and prefix queries, both crucial
requirements in the aforementioned applications, and on traditional indexes by
reducing space occupancy to close to the entropy of the sequence.

cannot affect the resistivity of a Galilean-invariant Fermi liquid (FL), the
reverse statement is not necessarily true: the resistivity of a
non-Galilean-invariant FL does not necessarily follow a T^2 behavior. The T^2
behavior is guaranteed only if Umklapp processes are allowed; however, if the
Fermi surface (FS) is small or the electron-electron interaction is of a very
long range, Umklapps are suppressed. In this case, a T^2 term can result only
from a combined--but distinct from quantum-interference corrections-- effect of
the electron-impurity and \emph{ee} interactions. Whether the T^2 term is
present depends on 1) dimensionality (two dimensions (2D) vs three dimensions
(3D)), 2) topology (simply- vs multiply-connected), and 3) shape (convex vs
concave) of the FS. In particular, the T^2 term is absent for any quadratic
(but not necessarily isotropic) spectrum both in 2D and 3D. The T^2 term is
also absent for a convex and simply-connected but otherwise arbitrarily
anisotropic FS in 2D. The origin of this nullification is approximate
integrability of the electron motion on a 2D FS, where the energy and momentum
conservation laws do not allow for current relaxation to leading
--second--order in T/E_F (E_F is the Fermi energy). If the T^2 term is
nullified by the conservation law, the first non-zero term behaves as T^4. The
same applies to a quantum-critical metal in the vicinity of a Pomeranchuk
instability, with a proviso that the leading (first non-zero) term in the
resistivity scales as T^{\frac{D+2}{3}} (T^{\frac{D+8}{3}}). We discuss a
number of situations when integrability is weakly broken, e.g., by inter-plane
hopping in a quasi-2D metal or by warping of the FS as in the surface states of
Bi_2Te_3 family of topological insulators.

phase-resolved CBCT images. In many clinical applications, it is more
preferable to reconstruct true 4DCBCT with the 4th dimension being time, i.e.,
each CBCT image is reconstructed based on the corresponding instantaneous
projection. We propose in this work a novel algorithm for the reconstruction of
this truly time-resolved CBCT, called cine-CBCT, by effectively utilizing the
underlying temporal coherence, such as periodicity or repetition, in those
cine-CBCT images. Assuming each column of the matrix $\bm{U}$ represents a CBCT
image to be reconstructed and the total number of columns is the same as the
number of projections, the central idea of our algorithm is that the rank of
$\bm{U}$ is much smaller than the number of projections and we can use a matrix
factorization form $\bm{U}=\bm{L}\bm{R}$ for $\bm{U}$. The number of columns
for the matrix $\bm{L}$ constraints the rank of $\bm{U}$ and hence implicitly
imposing a temporal coherence condition among all the images in cine-CBCT. The
desired image properties in $\bm{L}$ and the periodicity of the breathing
pattern are achieved by penalizing the sparsity of the tight wavelet frame
transform of $\bm{L}$ and that of the Fourier transform of $\bm{R}$,
respectively. A split Bregman method is used to solve the problem. In this
paper we focus on presenting this new algorithm and showing the proof of
principle using simulation studies on an NCAT phantom.

characterized by the ratio f_cyl of their mass line density to the maximum
possible value for a cylinder in a vacuum. Equilibrium solutions exist only for
f_cyl < 1. This ratio is used in providing analytical expressions for the
central density, the radius, the profile of the column density, the column
density through the cloud centre, and the fwhm. The dependence of the physical
properties on external pressure and temperature is discussed and directly
compared to the case of pressure-confined isothermal self-gravitating spheres.
  Comparison with recent observations of the fwhm and the central column
density N_H(0) show good agreement and suggest a filament temperature of ~10 K
and an external pressure p_ext/k in the range 1.5x10^4 K/cm^3 to 5x10^4 K/cm^3.
  Stability considerations indicate that interstellar filaments become
increasingly gravitationally unstable with mass line ratio f_cyl approaching
unity. For intermediate f_cyl>0.5 the instabilities should promote core
formation through compression, with a separation of about five times the fwhm.

n_g~3.2 +/-0.16 x10^-4 h^3 Mpc^-3. For theta<10', w(theta) significantly

models and estimate an effective halo mass of M_eff=3.3 +/-0.6x10^13 h^-1

power excess in the clustering signal. We then compare the w(theta) results to
those of Sawangwit et al. (2011) from 3 samples of LRGs at lower redshifts to
measure clustering evolution. We find that a long-lived model may be a poorer
fit than at lower redshifts, although this assumes that the Stripe 82 LRGs are
luminosity-matched to the AAOmega LRGs. We find stronger evidence for evolution
in the form of the z~1 LRG correlation function, with the above flat 2-halo
slope maintaining to r>50 h^-1 Mpc. Applying the cross-correlation test of Ross

thermal relic of the early Universe, then its total self-annihilation cross
section is revealed by its present-day mass density. The canonical thermally
averaged cross section for a generic WIMP is usually stated as 3*10^-26
cm^3s^-1, with unspecified uncertainty, and taken to be independent of WIMP
mass. Recent searches for annihilation products of DM annihilation have just
reached the sensitivity to exclude this canonical cross section for 100%
branching ratio to certain final states and small WIMP masses. The ultimate
goal is to probe all kinematically allowed final states as a function of mass
and, if all states are adequately excluded, set a lower limit to the WIMP mass.
Probing the low-mass region is further motivated due to recent hints for a
light WIMP in direct and indirect searches. We revisit the thermal relic
abundance calculation for a generic WIMP and show that the required cross
section can be calculated precisely. It varies significantly with mass at
masses below 10 GeV, reaching a maximum of 5.2*10^-26 cm^3s^-1 at masses around
0.3 GeV, and is 2.2*10^-26 cm^3s^-1 with feeble mass-dependence for masses
above 10 GeV. These results, which differ significantly from the canonical
value and have not been taken into account in searches for annihilation
products from generic WIMPs, have a noticeable impact on the interpretation of
present limits from Fermi-LAT and WMAP+ACT.

from well-established z~4-7 UV LFs, UV-continuum slope trends with redshift and
luminosity, and IRX-beta relations. They are well-described by Schechter
relations. We extend the comparison baseline for SFR functions to z~2 by
considering recent determinations of the H{\alpha} and mid-IR luminosity
functions. The low-end slopes of the SFR functions are flatter than for the UV
LFs, \Delta\alpha\sim+0.13, and show no clear evolution with cosmic time
(z~0-7). In addition, we find that the characteristic value SFR* from the
Schechter fit to SFR function exhibits consistent, and substantial, linear
growth as a function of redshift from ~5 M_sun/yr at z~8, 650 Myr after the Big
Bang, to ~100 M_sun/yr at z~2, ~2.5 Gyr later. Recent results at z~10, close to
the onset of galaxy formation, are consistent with this trend. The uniformity
of this evolution is even greater than seen in the UV LF over the redshift
range z~2-8, providing validation for our dust corrections. These results
provide strong evidence that galaxies build up uniformly over the first 3 Gyr

require a large cluster of lower-mass stars around them is a key test in the
differentiation of star formation theories as well as how the initial mass
function of stars is sampled. Previous attempts to find O-type stars that
formed in isolation were hindered by the possibility that such stars are merely
runaways from clusters, i.e., their current isolation does not reflect their
birth conditions. We introduce a new method to find O-type stars that are not
affected by such a degeneracy. Using the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey and
additional high resolution imaging we have identified stars that satisfy the
following constraints: 1) they are O-type stars that are not detected to be
part of a binary system based on RV time series analysis; 2) they are
designated spectral type O7 or earlier ; 3) their velocities are within 1\sigma
of the mean of OB-type stars in the 30 Doradus region, i.e. they are not
runaways along our line-of-sight; 4) the projected surface density of stars
does not increase within 3 pc towards the O-star (no evidence for clusters); 5)
their sight lines are associated with gaseous and/or dusty filaments in the
ISM, and 6) if a second candidate is found in the direction of the same
filament with which the target is associated, both are required to have similar
velocities. With these criteria, we have identified 15 stars in the 30 Doradus
region, which are strong candidates for being high-mass stars that have formed
in isolation. Additionally, we employed extensive MC stellar cluster
simulations to confirm that our results rule out the presence of clusters
around the candidates. Eleven of these are classified as Vz stars, possibly
associated with the zero-age main sequence. We include a newly discovered W-R
star as a candidate, although it does not meet all of the above criteria.

16-band Hubble Space Telescope observations taken as part of the Cluster
Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) program. We find good
agreement in the regions of overlap between several weak and strong lensing
mass reconstructions using a wide variety of modeling methods, ensuring
consistency. The Subaru data reveal the presence of a surrounding large scale
structure with the major axis running approximately north-west south-east
(NW-SE), aligned with the cluster and its brightest galaxy shapes, showing
elongation with a \sim 2:1 axis ratio in the plane of the sky. Our full-lensing
mass profile exhibits a shallow profile slope dln\Sigma/dlnR\sim -1 at cluster
outskirts (R>1Mpc/h), whereas the mass distribution excluding the NW-SE excess
regions steepens further out, well described by the Navarro-Frenk-White form.
Assuming a spherical halo, we obtain a virial mass M_{vir}=(1.1\pm 0.2\pm
0.1)\times 10^{15} M_{sun}/h and a halo concentration c_{vir} = 6.9\pm 1.0\pm
1.2 (\sim 5.7 when the central 50kpc/h is excluded), which falls in the range
4< <c> <7 of average c(M,z) predictions for relaxed clusters from recent Lambda
cold dark matter simulations. Our full lensing results are found to be in
agreement with X-ray mass measurements where the data overlap, and when
combined with Chandra gas mass measurements, yield a cumulative gas mass

scalar fields in potentials that can become negative, and their features as
(Early) Dark Energy models. Our point of departure is the ""String Axiverse"", a
scenario that motivates the existence of cosmologically light axion fields as a
generic consequence of string theory. We couple such an axion to its
corresponding modulus. We give a detailed presentation of the rich cosmology of
such a model, ranging from the setting of initial conditions on the fields
during inflation, to the asymptotic future. We present some simplifying
assumptions based on the fixing of the axion decay constant $f_a$, and on the
effective field theory when the modulus trajectory is adiabatic, and find the
conditions under which these assumptions break down. As a by-product of our
analysis, we find that relaxing the assumption of fixed $f_a$ leads to the
appearance of a new meta-stable de-Sitter region for the modulus without the
need for uplifting by an additional constant. A dynamical systems analysis
reveals the existence of many fixed point attractors, repellers and saddle
points, which we analyse in detail. We also provide geometric interpretations
of the phase space. The fixed points can be used to bound the couplings in the
model. A systematic scan of certain regions of parameter space reveals that the
future evolution of the universe in this model can be rich, containing multiple
epochs of accelerated expansion.

supernova types form a sequence of increasing association to star formation.
The most logical interpretation is that this implies an increasing progenitor
mass sequence going from the supernova type Ia arising from the lowest mass,
through the type II, type Ib, and the supernova type Ic arising from the
highest mass progenitors. We find the surprising result that the supernova type
IIn show a lower association to star formation than type IIPs, implying lower
mass progenitors. Secondly, we use host HII region spectroscopy to investigate
differences in environment metallicity between different core-collapse types.
We find that supernovae of types Ibc arise in slightly higher metallicity
environments than type II events. However, this difference is not significant,
implying that progenitor metallicity does not play a dominant role in deciding

on background quasi-stellar objects. We have used deep optical imaging to
select galaxies via the Lyman-break technique. Spectroscopy of the Lyman-break
galaxies (LBGs) was then made using the Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph
(VIMOS), giving a mean redshift of z=2.79. We analyse the clustering properties
of the VLRS sample and also of the VLRS sample combined with the smaller area
Keck-based survey of Steidel et al. From the semiprojected correlation
function, wp({\sigma}) we find that the results are well fit with a single
power-law model, with clustering scale lengths of r0=3.46+-0.41 and 3.83+-0.24
Mpc/h, respectively. We note that the corresponding combined {\xi}(r) slope is
flatter than for local galaxies at {\gamma} = 1.5-1.6 rather than {\gamma}=1.8.
This flat slope is confirmed by the z-space correlation function, {\xi}(s), and
in the range 10<s<100 Mpc/h the VLRS shows ~2.5{\sigma} excess over the
{\Lambda} cold dark matter. This excess may be consistent with recent evidence
for non-Gaussianity in clustering results at z~1. We then analyse the LBG
z-space distortions using the 2D correlation function, {\xi}({\sigma}, {\pi}),
finding for the combined sample a large-scale infall parameter of $\beta$ =
0.38+-0.19 and a velocity dispersion of 420km/s. Based on our measured {\beta},
we are able to determine the gravitational growth rate, finding a value of f(z
= 3)=0.99+-0.50 (or f{\sigma}8 = 0.26+-0.13), which is the highest redshift
measurement of the growth rate via galaxy clustering and is consistent with
{\Lambda}CDM. Finally, we constrain the mean halo mass for the LBG population,
finding that the VLRS and combined sample suggest mean halo masses of
log(MDM/Msun) = 11.57+-0.15 and 11.73+-0.07, respectively.

luminous (>10^{14} L_sun; M_1450 ~ -30) QSOs in the sky with z~2.7. Our data
are drawn from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS). In this work, we use
the positions and spectroscopic redshifts of 1558 galaxies that lie within ~3',
(4.2 h^{-1} comoving Mpc; cMpc) of the hyperluminous QSO (HLQSO) sightline in
one of 15 independent survey fields, together with new measurements of the
HLQSO systemic redshifts. We measure the galaxy-HLQSO cross-correlation
function, the galaxy-galaxy autocorrelation function, and the characteristic
scale of galaxy overdensities surrounding the sites of exceedingly rare,
extremely rapid, black hole accretion. On average, the HLQSOs lie within
significant galaxy overdensities, characterized by a velocity dispersion
sigma_v ~ 200 km s^{-1} and a transverse angular scale of ~25"", (~200 physical
kpc). We argue that such scales are expected for small groups with
log(M_h/M_sun)~13. The galaxy-HLQSO cross-correlation function has a best-fit
correlation length r_0_GQ = (7.3 \pm 1.3) h^{-1} cMpc, while the galaxy
autocorrelation measured from the spectroscopic galaxy sample in the same
fields has r_0_GG = (6.0 \pm 0.5) h^{-1} cMpc. Based on a comparison with
simulations evaluated at z ~ 2.6, these values imply that a typical galaxy
lives in a host halo with log(M_h/M_sun) = 11.9\pm0.1, while HLQSOs inhabit
host halos of log(M_h/M_sun) = 12.3\pm0.5. In spite of the extremely large
black hole masses implied by their observed luminosities [log(M_BH/M_sun) >
9.7], it appears that HLQSOs do not require environments very different from
their much less luminous QSO counterparts. Evidently, the exceedingly low space
density of HLQSOs (< 10^{-9} cMpc^{-3}) results from a one-in-a-million event
on scales << 1 Mpc, and not from being hosted by rare dark matter halos.

experimental detection of the pristine TS state and MFs at experimentally
accessible temperatures T << E_{qp}. Here we show that the linear scaling of
minigap with E_{qp} can fail in quasi-1D wires with multiple confinement bands
when the applied Zeeman field is greater than or equal to about half of the
confinement-induced bandgap. TS states in such wires have an approximate chiral
symmetry supporting multiple near zero energy modes at each end leading to a
minigap which can effectively vanish. We show that the problem of small minigap
in such wires can be resolved by forcing the system to break the approximate
chirality symmetry externally with a second Zeeman field. Although experimental
signatures such as zero bias peak from the wire ends is suppressed by the
second Zeeman field above a critical value, such a field is required in some
important parameter regimes of quasi-1D wires to isolate the topological
physics of end state MFs. We also discuss the crucial difference of our minigap
calculations from the previously reported minigap results appropriate for
idealized spinless p-wave superconductors and explain why the clustering of
fermionic subgap states around the zero energy Majorana end state with
increasing chemical potential seen in the latter system does not apply to the
experimental TS states in spin-orbit coupled nanowires.

show surfaces of nearly pure water ice, presumably a consequence of the
fragmentation of the icy mantle of a larger differentiated proto-Haumea; (2)
large objects with absolute magnitudes of $H<3$ (and a limited number to H=4.5)
have surface coverings of water ice - perhaps mixed with ammonia - that appears
to be related to possibly ancient cryovolcanism on these large objects; and (3)
smaller KBOs and centaurs which are neither Haumea family members nor
cold-classical KBOs appear to divide into two families (which we refer to as
""neutral"" and ""red""), each of which is a mixture of a common nearly-neutral
component and either a slightly red or very red component that also includes
water ice. A model suggesting that the difference between neutral and red
objects is due to formation in an early compact solar system either inside or
outside, respectively, of the ~20 AU methanol evaporation line is supported by
the observation that methanol is only detected on the reddest objects, which
are those which would be expected to have the most of the methanol containing

applies even when the extra sector is strongly coupled, and moreover does not
require a microscopic Lagrangian description. Using constraints from holomorphy
we fix the leading parametric form of the contributions to these Higgs
processes, including the Higgs mixing angle dependence, up to an overall
coefficient. Moreover, when the Higgs is the sole source of mass for a
superconformal sector, we show that even this coefficient is often calculable.
For appropriate mixing angles, the contribution of the extra states to h -> gg

limits already lead to non-trivial constraints on such models. Finally, we

galaxy luminosity function at z~8 over the widest dynamic range currently

\phi(L) = \phi_* (L/L_*)^{\alpha}\ e^{-(L/L_*)}, without evidence for an excess
of sources at the bright end. At 68% confidence, we derive \phi_* =
(4.3^{+3.5}_{-2.1}) \times 10^{-4} Mpc^{-3}, M_* = -20.26^{+0.29}_{-0.34}, and
a very steep faint-end slope \alpha = -1.98^{+0.23}_{-0.22}. While the best-fit
parameters still have a strong degeneracy, especially between \phi_* and M_*,
our improved coverage at the bright end has reduced the uncertainty of the
faint-end power-law slope at z~8 compared to the best previous determination at
+/-0.4. With a future expansion of the BoRG survey, combined with planned
ultradeep WFC3/IR observations, it will be possible to further reduce this
uncertainty and clearly demonstrate the steepening of the faint-end slope
compared to measurements at lower redshift, thereby confirming the key role
played by small galaxies in the reionization of the universe.

disorder in the community structure of arbitrary large graphs. Dimensional
reduction bounds lead to results similar to those suggested by mean-field type
approaches. Large systems tend toward global insolvability in the limit of
large q above a crossover temperature $T_\times\approx L|J_e|/[N\ln{} q]$ where
|J_e| is a typical interaction strength, L is the number of edges, and N is the

preclude solutions by local CD algorithms (even those that employ global cost

verified against results using ray tracing techniques. Disk models are
presented for T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars. Particular attention is given to the

the survival of the molecules by vertical mixing within the disk. By applying
typical X-ray luminosities the model accounts for the low PAH detection
probability observed in T Tauri and the high PAH detection statistics found in
Herbig Ae disks. Spherical halos above the disks are considered. We show that

that eventually geometry and field evolve to a new configuration to bring the

decoding, a non-asymptotic achievable tradeoff between the coding rate and word
error probability was also established for any discrete input memoryless
channel with discrete or continuous output (DIMC). Along the path of
non-asymptotic analysis, in this paper, it is further shown that jar decoding
is actually optimal up to the second order coding performance by establishing
new non-asymptotic converse coding theorems, and determining the Taylor
expansion of the (best) coding rate $R_n (\epsilon)$ of finite block length for
any block length $n$ and word error probability $\epsilon$ up to the second
order. Finally, based on the Taylor-type expansion and the new converses, two
approximation formulas for $R_n (\epsilon)$ (dubbed ""SO"" and ""NEP"") are
provided; they are further evaluated and compared against some of the best
bounds known so far, as well as the normal approximation of $R_n (\epsilon)$
revisited recently in the literature. It turns out that while the normal
approximation is all over the map, i.e. sometime below achievable bounds and
sometime above converse bounds, the SO approximation is much more reliable as
it is always below converses; in the meantime, the NEP approximation is the
best among the three and always provides an accurate estimation for $R_n
(\epsilon)$. An important implication arising from the Taylor-type expansion of
$R_n (\epsilon)$ is that in the practical non-asymptotic regime, the optimal
marginal codeword symbol distribution is not necessarily a capacity achieving
distribution.

the maps of the Ka, Q, V and W bands of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy

the pitch angle of the regular magnetic field, the relative amplitude of the

the different frequency bands are very similar and globally the data seem to
favor a negligible isotropic turbulent magnetic field component at large

propose a consistent model of the polarized diffuse Galac- tic synchrotron and

for massless QED in a strong magnetic field $H$, where the breaking of the
chiral symmetry is dynamically catalyzed by the external magnetic field via the
formation of an electro-positron condensate. This chiral condensate leads to
the generation of dynamical parameters that have to be found as solutions of
non-perturbative Schwinger-Dyson equations. Since the electron-positron pairing
mechanism leading to the breaking of the chiral symmetry is mainly dominated by
the contributions from the infrared region of momenta much smaller than
$\sqrt{eH}$, the magnetic field introduces a dynamical ultraviolet cutoff in
the theory that also enters in the non-perturbative Euler-Heisenberg action.
Using this action, we show that the system exhibits a significant
paraelectricity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. The
nonperturbative nature of this effect is reflected in the non-analytic
dependence of the obtained electric susceptibility on the fine-structure
constant. The strong paraelectricity in the field direction is linked to the
orientation of the electric dipole moments of the pairs that form the chiral
condensate. The large electric susceptibility can be used to detect the
realization of the magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking in physical
systems.

determining the information spectrum of $X_1 X_2...X_n $, i.e., the

equipartition properties (with respect to conditional entropy, mutual

These non-asymptotic equipartition properties are instrumental to the
development of non-asymptotic coding (including both source and channel coding)
results in information theory in the same way as the asymptotic equipartition
property to all asymptotic coding theorems established so far in information
theory. As an example, the NEP with respect to $H(X)$ is used to establish a

the mass of uncurated web data. State of the art approaches for handling
inconsistent data are systems that learn and use conditional functional
dependencies (CFDs) to rectify data. These methods learn data
patterns--CFDs--from a clean sample of the data and use them to rectify the
dirty/inconsistent data. While getting a clean training sample is feasible in
enterprise data scenarios, it is infeasible in web databases where there is no
separate curated data. CFD based methods are unfortunately particularly
sensitive to noise; we will empirically demonstrate that the number of CFDs
learned falls quite drastically with even a small amount of noise. In order to
overcome this limitation, we propose a fully probabilistic framework for
cleaning data. Our approach involves learning both the generative and error
(corruption) models of the data and using them to clean the data. For
generative models, we learn Bayes networks from the data. For error models, we
consider a maximum entropy framework for combing multiple error processes. The
generative and error models are learned directly from the noisy data. We
present the details of the framework and demonstrate its effectiveness in

subsheaf. For suitable stable curve families, the direct image sheaf on the

serve important functions such as enhancing edge detection and increasing
sparseness. The relative strength of the center and surround determine the
specific computation achieved. For example, weak surrounds achieve low-pass
spatial frequency filtering and are optimal for denoising when signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) is low. Balanced surrounds achieve band-pass spatial frequency
filtering and are optimal for decorrelation of responses when SNR is high.
Surround strength has been measured in the retina and dorsal Lateral Geniculate
Nucleus (dLGN), primarily in anesthetized or ex vivo preparations. Here we
revisit the center-surround architecture of dLGN neurons in the un-anesthetized
rat. We report the spatial frequency tuning responses of N=47 neurons. We fit
these tuning curves to a difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) model of the spatial
receptive field. We find that some dLGN neurons in the awake rat (N=8/47) have
weak surrounds. The majority of cells in our sample (N=29/47), however, have
well-balanced center and surround strengths and band-pass tuning curves. We
also observed several neurons (N=10/47) with notched or dual-band-pass tuning
curves, a response class that has not been described previously. Within the
space of circularly concentric DOG models, strong surrounds were necessary and
sufficient to explain the dual-band-pass spatial frequency tuning of these
cells. It remains to be determined what advantage if any is conferred by this
novel response class, or by the heterogeneity of surround strength as such. We
conclude that surround antagonism can be strong in the dLGN of the awake rat.

involves using technology to organize, automate, and coordinate business
processes, in managing interactions with their patients. CRM with the Web
technology provides healthcare providers the ability to broaden their services
beyond usual practices, and thus offers suitable environment using latest
technology to achieve superb patient care. This paper discusses and
demonstrates how a new approach in CRM based on Web 2.0 will help the
healthcare providers improving their customer support, avoiding conflict, and
promoting better health to patient. With this new approach patients will
benefit from the customized personal service with full information access to
perform self managed their own health. It also helps healthcare providers
retaining the right customer. A conceptual framework of the new approach will
be discussed.

black hole system GRS 1915+105, a strongly variable microquasar commonly used
for studying relativistic jets and the physics of black hole accretion. The
analysis of sample observations for 13 different states in both soft (low) and
hard (high) energy bands is performed by flicker-noise spectroscopy (FNS), a
phenomenological time series analysis method operating on structure functions
and power spectrum estimates. We find the values of FNS parameters, including
the Hurst exponent, flicker-noise parameter, and characteristic time scales,
for each observation based on multiple 2,500-second continuous data segments.
We identify four modes of stochastic variability driven by dissipative
processes that may be related to viscosity fluctuations in the accretion disk
around the black hole: random (RN), power-law (1F), one-scale (1S), and
two-scale (2S). The variability modes are generally the same in soft and hard
energy bands of the same observation. We discuss the potential for future FNS
studies of accreting black holes.

Darussalam (Brunei) from customers' perspective. It is to identify, understand,
analyze and evaluate public's expectation on e-health in Brunei. A
questionnaire was designed to gather quantitative and qualitative data to
survey patients, patient's family, and health practitioners at hospitals,
clinics, or home care centers in Brunei starting from February to March, 2011.
A 25-item Likert-type survey instrument was specifically developed for this
study and administered to a sample of 366 patients. The data were analyzed to
provide initial ideas and recommendation to policy makers on how to move
forward with the e-health initiative as a mean to improve healthcare services.
The survey revealed that there exists a high demand and expectation from people
in Brunei to have better healthcare services accessible through an e-health
system in order to improve health literacy as well as quality and efficiency of
healthcare. Regardless of the limitations of the survey, the general public has
responded with a great support for the capabilities of an e-health system
listed from the questionnaires. The results of the survey provide a solid
foundation for our on going research project to proceed further to develop a
model of e-health and subsequently develop a system prototype that incorporate
expectations from the people.

several macroscopic properties of both the normal and superconducting states of
the iron pnictides. Due to its magnetic origin, long-range nematic order
enhances magnetic fluctuations, leaving distinctive signatures in the
spin-lattice relaxation rate, the spin-spin correlation function, and the
uniform magnetic susceptibility. This enhancement of magnetic excitations is
also manifested in the electronic spectral function, where a pseudogap can open
at the hot spots of the Fermi surface. In the nematic phase, electrons are
scattered by magnetic fluctuations that are anisotropic in momentum space,
giving rise to a non-zero resistivity anisotropy whose sign changes between
electron-doped and hole-doped compounds. We also show that due to the
magneto-elastic coupling, nematic fluctuations soften the shear modulus in the
normal state, but harden it in the superconducting state. The latter effect is
an indirect consequence of the competition between magnetism and
superconductivity, and also causes a suppression of the orthorhombic distortion
below T_{c}. We also demonstrate that ferro-orbital fluctuations enhance the
nematic susceptibility, cooperatively promoting an electronic tetragonal
symmetry-breaking. Finally, we argue that T_{c} in the iron pnictides might be
enhanced due to nematic fluctuations of magnetic origin.

integral operators whose composition gives rise to a generalized Calder\'on
formula of the form $\tilde{N} \tilde{S} = \tilde{J}_0^\tau + \tilde{K}$ in a
{\em weighted, periodized} Sobolev space. The $\tilde{N} \tilde{S}$ formulation
provides, for the first time, a second-kind integral equation for the open-arc
scattering problem with Neumann boundary conditions. Numerical experiments show
that, for both the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, our second-kind
integral equations have spectra that are bounded away from zero and infinity as
$k\to \infty$; to the authors' knowledge these are the first integral equations
for these problems that possess this desirable property. Our proofs rely on
three main elements: 1) Algebraic manipulations enabled by the presence of
integral weights; 2) Use of the classical result of continuity of the Ces\`aro
operator; and 3) Explicit characterization of the point spectrum of
$\tilde{J}^\tau_0$, which, interestingly, can be decomposed into the union of a
countable set and an open set, both tightly clustered around -1/4. As shown in
a separate contribution, the new approach can be used to construct simple

environmental dependence of the upper mass stellar initial mass function (IMF).
Our spectroscopic sample consists of IR-excess objects selected from the

have spectral confirmation of 864 members, with another 98 probable members; of
the confirmed members, 406 have infrared excesses and 458 do not. Assuming the
same ratio of stars with and without IR excesses in the highly-extincted
regions, L1641 may contain as many as ~1600 stars down to ~0.1 solar mass,
comparable within a factor of two to the the ONC. Compared to the standard
models of the IMF, L1641 is deficient in O and early B stars to a 3-4 sigma
significance level, assuming that we know of all the massive stars in L1641.
  With a forthcoming survey of the intermediate-mass stars, we will be in a
better position to make a direct comparison with the neighboring, dense ONC,

properties of chaotic eigenstates is developed. The level density of many-body
states increases exponentially with the number of excited electrons. When the
residual electron-electron interaction exceeds the interval between these
levels, the eigenstates (called compound states or compound resonances if these
states are in the continuum) become ""chaotic"" superpositions of large numbers
of Hartree-Fock configurational basis states. This situation takes place in
some rare-earth atoms and many open-shell multiply charged ions excited in the
process of electron recombination. Our theory describes resonant multielectron
recombination via dielectronic doorway states leading to such compound
resonances. The result is a radiative capture cross section averaged over a
small energy interval containing several compound resonances. In many cases
individual resonances are not resolved experimentally (since the interval
between them is small, e.g., $\le 1$ meV, possibly even smaller than their
radiative widths), therefore, our statistical theory should correctly describe
the experimental data. We perform numerical calculations of the recombination
cross sections for tungsten ions W$^{q+}$, $q=18$--25. The recombination rate
for W$^{20+}$ measured recently [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 83}, 012711 (2011)] is
$10^3$ greater than the direct radiative recombination rate at low energies,

  Multiuser MIMO Downlink",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Joint user selection (US) and vector precoding (US-VP) is proposed for
multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) downlink. The main
difference between joint US-VP and conventional US is that US depends on data
symbols for joint US-VP, whereas conventional US is independent of data
symbols. The replica method is used to analyze the performance of joint US-VP
in the large-system limit, where the numbers of transmit antennas, users, and
selected users tend to infinity while their ratios are kept constant. The
analysis under the assumptions of replica symmetry (RS) and 1-step replica
symmetry breaking (1RSB) implies that optimal data-independent US provides
nothing but the same performance as random US in the large-system limit,
whereas data-independent US is capacity-achieving as only the number of users
tends to infinity. It is shown that joint US-VP can provide a substantial
reduction of the energy penalty in the large-system limit. Consequently, joint
US-VP outperforms separate US-VP in terms of the achievable sum rate, which
consists of a combination of vector precoding (VP) and data-independent US. In
particular, data-dependent US can be applied to general modulation, and
implemented with a greedy algorithm.

special fading structure naturally arises from heterogeneous block fading
setting, in which different users experience independent block fading with
different coherent times. Jafar et al. prove that BIA can be applied in some
special heterogeneous block fading channels, which are formed naturally or
constructed artificially. In this paper, we show that in the context of a
2-user 2x1 broadcasting (BC) channel, staggered fading pattern can also be
found in homogeneous block fading setting, in which both users experience
independent fading with the same coherent time; and we propose a scheme to
achieve the optimal 4/3 DoF for the homogenous setting by using BIA. Applying
the proposed scheme, we further study a 2x1 BC network with K users undergoing
homogeneous block fading. When K>=4, we show it is almost guaranteed that the

the concept of publishing data explicitly as Open Data has meanwhile developed
many variants and facets that go beyond publishing large and highly structured
RDF/S repositories. Open Data comprises text and semi-structured data, but also
open multi-modal contents, including music, images, and videos. With the
increasing amount of data that is published by governments (see, e.g.,
data.gov, data.gov.uk or data.gouv.fr), by international organizations
(data.worldbank.org or data.undp.org) and by scientific communities (tdar.org,
cds.u-strasbg.fr, GenBank, IRIS or KNB) explicitly under an Open Data policy,
new challenges arise not only due to the scale at which this data becomes
available.
  A number of community-based conferences accommodate tracks or workshops which
are dedicated to Open Data. However, WOD aims to be a premier venue to gather
researchers and practitioners who are contributing to and interested in the
emerging field of managing Open Data from a computer science perspective.
Hence, it is a unique opportunity to find in a single place up-to-date

molecular clouds. These masers are pumped by collisions in warm, shocked
molecular gas with OH column densities in the range 10^{16}--10^{17} cm^{-2}.
Excitation calculations suggest that inversion of the 6049 MHz OH line may
occur at the higher column densities that have been inferred from main-line
absorption studies of supernova remnants with the Green Bank Telescope. OH(6049
MHz) masers have therefore been proposed as a complementary indicator of
remnant-cloud interaction.
  This motivated searches for 6049 MHz maser emission from supernova remnants
using the Parkes 63 m and Effelsberg 100 m telescopes, and the Australia
Telescope Compact Array. A total of forty-one remnants have been examined by
one or more of these surveys, but without success. To check the accuracy of the
OH column densities inferred from the single-dish observations we modelled OH
absorption at 1667 MHz observed with the Very Large Array towards three
supernova remnants, IC 443, W44 and 3C 391. The results are mixed -- the OH
column is revised upwards in IC443, downwards in 3C391, and is somewhat reduced
in W44. We conclude that OH columns exceeding 10^{17} cm^{-2} are indeed
present in some supernova remnants and so the lack of any detections is not
explained by low OH column density. We discuss the possibility that non-local
line overlap is responsible for suppressing the inversion of the 6049 MHz line.

associated with cooperation. Simulation results illustrate the high performance

chromosphere have to pass through the relatively cool, and therefore non-ideal
(i.e. resistive) photospheric region enclosed between the highly ideal
sub-photospheric and chromospheric plasma. It is shown that stationary MHD
equilibria of magnetic flux tubes which pass through this region require an
inflow of photospheric material into the flux tube and a deviation from
iso-rotation along the tube axis. This means that there is a difference in
angular velocity of the plasma flow inside the tube below and above the
non-ideal region. Both effects increase with decreasing cross section of the
tube. Although for characteristic parameters of thick flux tubes the effect is
negligible, a scaling law indicates its importance for small-scale structures.
The relevance of this ""inflow effect"" for the expansion of flux tubes above the

equilibrium cluster configurations and thermal ensembles of configurations, we
find DMC to be uniformly much more accurate than DFT, partly because some of

these are corrected, DFT remains considerably less accurate than DMC. When both
1- and 2-body errors of DFT are corrected, some functionals compete in accuracy
with DMC; however, other functionals remain worse, showing that they suffer
from significant beyond-2-body errors. Combining the evidence presented here
with the recently demonstrated high accuracy of DMC for ice structures, we

using X-ray, and simultaneous UV and optical data collected by XMM-Newton,
complemented with hard X-ray data provided by INTEGRAL and Swift. The pulse
arrival time were used to estimate the orbital periods. The X-ray spectra were
fitted using composite models consisting of different absorbing columns and
emission components. Strong X-ray pulses at the White Dwarf (WD) spin period
are detected and found to decrease with energy. Most sources are spin-dominated
systems in the X-rays, though four are beat dominated at optical wavelengths.
We estimated the orbital period in all system (except for IGR J16500-3307),
providing the first estimate for IGR J08390-4833, IGR J18308-1232, and IGR

J0636+3535 posses a soft X-ray optically thick component at kT 80 eV. An
intense K_alpha Fe line at 6.4 keV is detected in all sources. An absorption
edge at 0.76 keV from OVII is detected in IGR J08390-4833. The WD masses and
lower limits to the accretion rates are estimated. We found all sources to be

in the post-shock regions and a highly absorbed emission from material located
in the pre-shock flow which is also responsible for the X-ray pulsations.
Reflection at the WD surface is likely the origin of the fluorescent iron line.
There is an increasing evidence for the presence of a warm absorber in IPs. The

number of photons $E$ in the probe state. For phase estimation, the bounds
pertain to a cyclic mean squared error criterion incorporating the cyclic
nature of the phase. In the absence of optical loss, our bounds are applicable
to multimode linear phase modulation schemes (including ancilla-assisted ones),
and to nonlinear modulations on a single mode. The bounds display
inverse-quadratic Heisenberg-limit scaling of the cyclic mean square error with
respect to $E$. In the presence of any finite amount of loss, a lower bound on
ancilla-assisted phase estimation with standard-quantum-limit (SQL) scaling is
derived, which is shown to be little different from a similar bound for
coherent-state probes. For systems involving a single optical mode, we also
obtain lower bounds on the mean squared error of estimating any classical
parameter, and on the average error probability of any $M$-ary communication
system under an average energy constraint. The bounds are valid for arbitrary
quantum measurements, for any prior probability distribution, and do not rely
on unbiasedness assumptions.

studying the scaling behavior of the generalized inverse participation numbers

investigate $d$-dimensional quasiperiodic models based on different

$D_q^{d\mathrm{d}} = d D_q^\mathrm{1d}$ holds for these models. Using the
product structure of the labyrinth tiling we prove that this relation is always
satisfied for the silver-mean model and that the scaling exponents approach
this relation for large system sizes also for the other metallic-mean systems.

nanostructures can strongly affect macroscopic transport quantities and can
significantly change their dependence on external parameters compared to the
ideal ballistic case even when the system size is much smaller than the mean
free path. In a corner-shaped ballistic device based on a GaAs/AlGaAs
two-dimensional electron gas we observe a splitting of the commensurability
peaks in the magnetoresistance curve. We show that a model which includes a
random disorder potential of the two-dimensional electron gas can account for
the random splitting of the peaks that result from the collimation of the
electron beam. The shape of the splitting depends on the particular realization
of the disorder potential. At the same time magnetic focusing peaks are largely
unaffected by the disorder potential.

related to the field-driven evolution of a long-period helical phase, which is
stabilized by the chiral Dzyalozinskii-Moriya term $D \vec{M}
\cdot(\bs{\nabla}\times\vec{M})$ that is present in this non-centrosymmetric

well as a long-wavelength spatial component that is given by the pitch of the
magnetic helices, (ii) the uniform component of $\vec{P}$ points along the
vector $(H^yH^z, H^zH^x, H^xH^y)$, and (iii) its strength is proportional to
$\eta_\parallel^2-\eta_\perp^2/2$, where $\eta_\parallel$ is the longitudinal

above the western limb on 2007 February 8. Besides, we perform a
one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the longitudinal oscillations. The
high-resolution observations by Hinode/SOT indicate that the prominence, seen
as a concave-inward shape in lower-resolution Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) images,
actually consists of many concave-outward threads, which is indicative of the
existence of magnetic dips. After being injected into the dip region, a bulk of
prominence material started to oscillate for more than 3.5 hours, with the
period being 52 min. The oscillation decayed with time, with the decay
timescale being 133 min. Our hydrodynamic simulation can well reproduce the
oscillation period, but the damping timescale in the simulation is 1.5 times as
long as the observations. The results clearly show the prominence longitudinal
oscillations around the dip of the prominence and our study suggests that the
restoring force of the longitudinal oscillations might be the gravity.
Radiation and heat conduction are insufficient to explain the decay of the
oscillations. Other mechanisms, such as wave leakage and mass accretion, have
to be considered. The possible relation between the longitudinal oscillations
and the later eruption of a prominence thread, as well as a coronal mass
ejection (CME), is also discussed.

the linear regime dominates. The expected signal-to-noise ratio for an
experiment dominated by the cosmic variance up to $l_{\rm max}=1500$ is about
5, which is much smaller than the previous estimates including non-linearity,

Bloch-Gr\""uneisen formalism at each pressure. This fact suggests that
electron-phonon scattering is dominant in these compounds. The superconducting
critical temperature Tc decreases by pressure as \sim 0.2 K/GPa above 0.41 GPa
to 2 GPa for both compounds. This behavior of Tc can be explained with a modest
decrease of the density of states based on the conventional BCS theory.

similar sounding words of the lingua franca of the artisans was used in Indus

hundreds of Indian hieroglyphs continued to be used in metallurgy is evidenced

summarize the early NMR experiments done in the high Tc cuprates which have
given evidence for the existence of strong electronic correlations and
established the occurrence of the ""pseudogap"", on which I have initially had
some exchanges with J. Friedel. The pseudogap, occurring below a temperature
T*, has during the last twenty years raised endless discussions about the
incidence of correlations on superconductivity. Many researchers are still
advocating today that the pseudogap is due to the existence of preformed pairs
above Tc. Its robustness to impurities and disorder that we evidenced from the
early days rather suggested that it results from a competing order of the
correlated state. This is apparently better accepted nowadays, although various
distinct ordered states detected below T* are not yet understood. I also
underline the large contrast between the scientific behaviours which prevailed

wireless multi-access interference distribution in large spatial wireless
networks. First, a principled methodology is presented to establish rates of
convergence of the multi-access interference distribution to a Gaussian
distribution for general bounded and power-law decaying path-loss functions.
The model is general enough to also include various random wireless channel
dynamics such as fading and shadowing arising from multipath propagation and
obstacles existing in the communication environment. It is shown that the
wireless multi-access interference distribution converges to the Gaussian
distribution with the same mean and variance at a rate
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}}$, where $\lambda>0$ is a parameter controlling the
intensity of the planar (possibly non-stationary) Poisson point process
generating node locations. An explicit expression for the scaling coefficient
is obtained as a function of fading statistics and the path-loss function.
Second, an extensive numerical and simulation study is performed to illustrate
the accuracy of the derived Gaussian approximation bounds. A good statistical
fit between the interference distribution and its Gaussian approximation is
observed for moderate to high values of $\lambda$. Finally, applications of
these approximation results to upper and lower bound the outage capacity and
ergodic sum capacity for spatial wireless networks are illustrated. The derived
performance bounds on these capacity metrics track the network performance
within one nats per second per hertz.

to determine the average direction and velocity of coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) from time-elongation tracks produced by Heliospheric Imagers (HIs), such
as the HIs onboard the STEREO spacecraft. Both methods assume a constant
velocity in their descriptions of the time-elongation profiles of CMEs, which
are used to fit the observed time-elongation data. Here, we analyze the effect
of aerodynamic drag on CMEs propagating through interplanetary space, and how
this drag affects the result of the F\Phi and HM fitting methods. A simple drag
model is used to analytically construct time-elongation profiles which are then
fitted with the two methods. It is found that higher angles and velocities give
rise to greater error in both methods, reaching errors in the direction of
propagation of up to 15 deg and 30 deg for the F\Phi and HM fitting methods,
respectively. This is due to the physical accelerations of the CMEs being
interpreted as geometrical accelerations by the fitting methods. Because of the
geometrical definition of the HM fitting method, it is affected by the
acceleration more greatly than the F\Phi fitting method. Overall, we find that
both techniques overestimate the initial (and final) velocity and direction for
fast CMEs propagating beyond 90 deg from the Sun-spacecraft line, meaning that
arrival times at 1 AU would be predicted early (by up to 12 hours). We also
find that the direction and arrival time of a wide and decelerating CME can be
better reproduced by the F\Phi due to the cancellation of two errors:
neglecting the CME width and neglecting the CME deceleration. Overall, the
inaccuracies of the two fitting methods are expected to play an important role
in the prediction of CME hit and arrival times as we head towards solar maximum
and the STEREO spacecraft further move behind the Sun.

The corresponding local density of states across a quantum Hall transition is
mapped showing the development from localized states to extended states and
back to localized states in real space. Decoupling the 2DES from screening
electrons of the bulk of the III-V semiconductor leads to a measurable exchange
enhancement of up to 0.7 meV which depends on the local spin polarization of
the 2DES. At stronger confinement potential, i.e. larger doping, the Rashba
spin splitting with $\alpha$ as large as $7\cdot 10^{-11}$eVm is observed as a
beating in the density of states in magnetic field. The Rashba spin splitting
varies with position by about $\pm 50$% being largest at potential hills.

beta-Ag2Te is a topological insulator with a gapless Dirac cone with strong
anisotropy. To experimentally probe the topological surface state, we
synthesized high quality beta-Ag2Te nanoribbons and performed electron
transport measurements. The coexistence of pronounced Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations and weak Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations clearly demonstrates
coherent electron transport around the perimeter of beta-Ag2Te nanoribbon and
therefore the existence of metallic surface states, which is further supported
by the temperature dependence of resistivity for beta-Ag2Te nanoribbons with
different cross section areas. Highly anisotropic topological surface state of
beta-Ag2Te suggests that the material is a promising material for fundamental
study and future spintronic devices.

can be probed by the well developed surface-science techniques as, e.g.,
scanning tunneling microscopy. This method bridges the gap between the surface
science community and the electronic device community and might lead to novel
combined approaches. Here, I review some of the scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) and spectroscopy (STS) experiments on monolayer graphene samples. I will
concentrate on graphene samples deposited on insulating substrates, since these
are related to graphene device concepts. In particular, I will discuss the
morphology of graphene on SiO$_2$ and other emerging substrates, some
nanomechanical manipulation experiments using STM, and spectroscopic results.
The latter can map the disorder potentials as well as the interaction of the
electrons with the disorder which is most pronounced in the quantum Hall
regime.

  with Non-Ideal Circuit Power","This is the longer version of a paper to appear in IEEE Journal on
  Selected Areas in Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Characterizing the fundamental tradeoffs for maximizing energy efficiency
(EE) versus spectrum efficiency (SE) is a key problem in wireless
communication. In this paper, we address this problem for a point-to-point
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with the transmitter powered
solely via energy harvesting from the environment. In addition, we assume a
practical on-off transmitter model with non-ideal circuit power, i.e., when the
transmitter is on, its consumed power is the sum of the transmit power and a
constant circuit power. Under this setup, we study the optimal transmit power
allocation to maximize the average throughput over a finite horizon, subject to
the time-varying energy constraint and the non-ideal circuit power consumption.
First, we consider the off-line optimization under the assumption that the
energy arrival time and amount are a priori known at the transmitter. Although
this problem is non-convex due to the non-ideal circuit power, we show an
efficient optimal solution that in general corresponds to a two-phase
transmission: the first phase with an EE-maximizing on-off power allocation,
and the second phase with a SE-maximizing power allocation that is
non-decreasing over time, thus revealing an interesting result that both the EE
and SE optimizations are unified in an energy harvesting communication system.
We then extend the optimal off-line algorithm to the case with multiple
parallel AWGN channels, based on the principle of nested optimization. Finally,
inspired by the off-line optimal solution, we propose a new online algorithm
under the practical setup with only the past and present energy state
information (ESI) known at the transmitter.

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and further, we concluded that Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle and EPR-paradox are not contradictory. This is true,
however we now think that we should have argued about it under a certain firm
interpretation of quantum mechanics. Recently we proposed the linguistic
quantum interpretation (called quantum and classical measurement theory), which
was characterized as a kind of metaphysical and linguistic turn of the
Copenhagen interpretation. This turn from physics to language does not only
extend quantum theory to classical systems but also yield the quantum
mechanical world view (i.e., the philosophy of quantum mechanics, in other
words, quantum philosophy). In fact, we can consider that traditional
philosophies have progressed toward quantum philosophy. In this paper, we first
review the linguistic quantum interpretation, and further, clarify the relation
between EPR-paradox and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. That is, the
linguistic interpretation says that EPR-paradox is closely related to the fact
that syllogism does not generally hold in quantum physics. This fact should be
compared to the non-locality of Bell's inequality.

relatively moving particles. The new force which we named Mirinae Force is a
counterpart of the magnetic force operating between electrically charged moving
particles. Instead of using the conventional dark matter, we applied the
mirinae force to a particular model system of the spiral galaxy in which most
of the galaxy's mass is located within the central region where some portion of
the inner mass is in revolving motion at a relativistic speed. The calculation
yielded three important results that illustrate the existence of mirinae force
and validate the proposed model: First, the mirinae force in this model
explains why most of the matters in the galactic disk are in the circular
motion which is similar to cycloid. Second, the mirinae force well explains not
only the flat rotation curve but also the varied slope of the rotation curve
observed in the spiral galaxies. Third, at the flat velocity of 220 Km/s, the
inner mass of the Milky Way calculated by using the proposed model is
6.0\times10^11 M\odot, which is very close to 5.5\times10^11 M\odot (r <50 Kpc,
including Leo I) estimated by using the latest kinematic information. This
means that the mirinae force well takes the place of the dark matter of the
Milky Way.
