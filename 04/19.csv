  The problem of eigenvalue estimation is solved in two steps. First, we
construct computable a priori error estimation for FEM solution of Poisson's
problem even for non-convex domain with re-entrant corner. Second, a new
computable lower and upper bounds is developed for eigenvalues. As the interval
arithmetic is implemented in the FEM computation, the desired eigenvalue bounds
can be expected to be mathematically correct. The Lehmann's theorem is also
adopted to sharpen the eigenvalue bounds with high precision. At the end of
this paper, we illustrate several computation examples, such as the case of
L-shaped domain and crack domain, to demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility

structure formation, its microscopic nature remains elusive. Indirect detection
may provide a powerful test for some strongly motivated DM particle models.
Nevertheless, astrophysical backgrounds are usually expected with amplitudes
and spectral features similar to the chased signals. On galactic scales, these
backgrounds arise from interactions of cosmic rays (CRs) with the interstellar
gas, both being difficult to infer and model in detail from observations.
Moreover, the associated predictions unavoidably come with theoretical errors,
which are known to be significant. We show that a trustworthy guide for such
challenging searches can be obtained by exploiting the full information
contained in cosmological simulations of galaxies, which now include baryonic
gas dynamics and star formation. We further insert CR production and transport
from the identified supernova events and fully calculate the CR distribution in
a simulated galaxy. We focus on diffuse gamma-rays, and self-consistently
calculate both the astrophysical galactic emission and the dark matter signal.
We notably show that adiabatic contraction does not necessarily induce large
signal-to-noise ratios in galactic centers, and could anyway be traced from the
astrophysical background itself. We finally discuss how all this may be used as
a generic diagnostic tool for galaxy formation.

routinely rely on density functional theory (DFT) for describing the electronic

described in semilocal approximations to DFT, band-gap correction schemes or
advanced theoretical models which properly describe band gaps need to be
employed. However, it has become apparent that different methods that reproduce
the experimental band gap can yield substantially different results regarding
charge transition levels of point defects. We investigate this problem in the
case of the (+2/0) charge transition level of the O vacancy in ZnO, which has
attracted considerable attention as a benchmark case. For this purpose, we
first perform calculations based on non-screened hybrid density functionals,
and then compare our results with those of other methods. While our results
agree very well with those obtained with screened hybrid functionals, they are
strikingly different compared to those obtained with other band-gap corrected
schemes. Nevertheless, we show that all the different methods agree well with
each other and with our calculations when a suitable alignment procedure is
adopted. The proposed procedure consists in aligning the electron band
structure through an external potential, such as the vacuum level. When the
electron densities are well reproduced, this procedure is equivalent to an
alignment through the average electrostatic potential in a calculation subject
to periodic boundary conditions. We stress that, in order to give accurate
defect levels, a theoretical scheme is required to yield not only band gaps in
agreement with experiment, but also band edges correctly positioned with
respect to such a reference potential.

of strong couplings to the contacts. Due to the proximity effect, the InSb
nanowire segments covered by superconductor Nb contacts turn to superconductors
with a superconducting energy gap $\Delta^*$. Under an applied magnetic field
larger than a critical value for which the Zeeman energy in the InSb nanowire
is $E_z\sim \Delta^*$, the entire InSb nanowire is found to be in a nontrivial
topological superconductor phase, supporting a pair of Majorana fermions, and
Cooper pairs can transport between the superconductor Nb contacts via the
Majorana fermion states. This transport process will be suppressed when the
applied magnetic field becomes larger than a second critical value at which the
transition to a trivial topological superconductor phase occurs in the system.
This physical scenario has been observed in our experiment. We have found that

However, there are physical systems coupled with an environment whose

important tool for collecting uniform node samples so as to consistently

However, an unavoidable downside of their core random walks -- slow diffusion
over the space, can cause poor estimation accuracy. In this paper, we propose
non-backtracking random walk with re-weighting (NBRW-rw) and MH algorithm with
delayed acceptance (MHDA) which are theoretically guaranteed to achieve, at
almost no additional cost, not only unbiased graph sampling but also higher
efficiency (smaller asymptotic variance of the resulting unbiased estimators)

feature of the MHDA is its applicability for any non-uniform node sampling like
the MH algorithm, but ensuring better sampling efficiency than the MH
algorithm. We also provide simulation results to confirm our theoretical
findings.

an optimization viewpoint.The dissertation is divided into two parts :
  I. We first consider the question of learnability for statistical learning
problems in the general learning setting. The question of learnability is well
studied and fully characterized for binary classification and for real valued
supervised learning problems using the theory of uniform convergence. However
we show that for the general learning setting uniform convergence theory fails
to characterize learnability. To fill this void we use stability of learning
algorithms to fully characterize statistical learnability in the general
setting. Next we consider the problem of online learning. Unlike the
statistical learning framework there is a dearth of generic tools that can be
used to establish learnability and rates for online learning problems in
general. We provide online analogs to classical tools from statistical learning
theory like Rademacher complexity, covering numbers, etc. We further use these
tools to fully characterize learnability for online supervised learning
problems.
  II. In the second part, for general classes of convex learning problems, we
provide appropriate mirror descent (MD) updates for online and statistical
learning of these problems. Further, we show that the the MD is near optimal
for online convex learning and for most cases, is also near optimal for
statistical convex learning. We next consider the problem of convex
optimization and show that oracle complexity can be lower bounded by the so
called fat-shattering dimension of the associated linear class. Thus we
establish a strong connection between offline convex optimization problems and
statistical learning problems. We also show that for a large class of high
dimensional optimization problems, MD is in fact near optimal even for convex
optimization.

loops do not modify this behavior in phi^4, nor in QCD if the gauge-fields are
smeared over a comparable spatial region. Consequently, the use of this type of

many degrees of freedom required to construct anharmonic potential wells,

capacitors on DC electrodes suppress radio-frequency pickup and excess
micromotion, while a top-level ground layer simplifies modeling of electric
fields and protects trap structures underneath. A localized aperture in the
substrate provides access to the trapping region from an oven below, permitting
deterministic loading of particular isotopic/elemental sequences via
species-selective photoionization. The shapes of the aperture and
radio-frequency electrodes are optimized to minimize perturbation of the
trapping pseudopotential. Laboratory experiments verify simulated potentials
and characterize trapping lifetimes, stray electric fields, and ion heating
rates, while measurement and cancellation of spatially-varying stray electric
fields permits the formation of nearly-equally spaced ion chains.

characterized by a one-sided curved morphology at all epochs and all
frequencies. The VLBI core, located at the southern end of the jet, was
identified based on its spectral properties. The equipartition magnetic field
of the core was investigated, through which we derived a Doppler factor of 5,
largely consistent with that derived from kinematics (component C5). The study
of the detailed jet kinematics at 22 and 15 GHz, spanning a period of more than
10 years, indicates the possible existence of a bimodal distribution of the jet
apparent speed. Ballistic and non-ballistic components are found to coexist in
the jet. Superluminal motions in the range of 5-21 c were measured in 11
distinct components. We estimated the physical jet parameters with the minimum
Lorentz factor of 10.2 and Doppler factors in the range of 10.2-20.4 (component

the idea that, at least in PKS 1749+096, ejection of new jet components is
connected with major outbursts in flux density. For the best-traced component

high-dimensional function interpolation problems, is proposed. The method,
termed multilevel sparse kernel-based interpolation (MLSKI, for short), uses
both level-wise and direction-wise multilevel decomposition of structured (or
mildly unstructured) interpolation data sites in conjunction with the
application of kernel-based interpolants with different scaling in each
direction. The multilevel interpolation algorithm is based on a hierarchical
decomposition of the data sites, whereby at each level the detail is added to
the interpolant by interpolating the resulting residual of the previous level.
On each level, anisotropic radial basis functions are used for solving a number
of small interpolation problems, which are subsequently linearly combined to
produce the interpolant. MLSKI can be viewed as an extension of $d$-boolean
interpolation (which is closely related to ideas in sparse grid and hyperbolic
crosses literature) to kernel-based functions, within the hierarchical
multilevel framework to achieve accelerated convergence. Numerical experiments
suggest that the new algorithm is numerically stable and efficient for the
reconstruction of large data in $\mathbb{R}^{d}\times \mathbb{R}$, for $d = 2,
3, 4$, with tens or even hundreds of thousands data points. Also, MLSKI appears
to be generally superior over classical radial basis function methods in terms
of complexity, run time and convergence at least for large data sets.

minimum of the Higgs potential at field values of about $10^{15}-10^{17}$ GeV,
which exists for a narrow band of values of the top quark and Higgs masses and
thus gives rise to a prediction on the Higgs mass to be in the range 123-129
GeV, together with a prediction on the the top mass and the cosmological
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Inflation can be achieved provided there is an
additional degree of freedom which allows the transition to a radiation era. In
[1] we had proposed such field to be a Brans-Dicke scalar. Here we present an
alternative possibility with an additional subdominant scalar very weakly
coupled to the Higgs, realizing an (inverted) hybrid Inflation scenario.
Interestingly, we show that such model has an additional constraint $m_H<125.3
\pm 3_{th}$, where $3_{th}$ is the present theoretical uncertainty on the
Standard Model RGEs. The tensor-to-scalar ratio has to be within the narrow
range $10^{-4}\lesssim r<0.007$, and values of the scalar spectral index
compatible with the observed range can be obtained. Moreover, if we impose the
model to have subplanckian field excursion, this selects a narrower range

one in which there are $d$ edge/vertex failures that precede all connectivity

  We present a $d$-failure connectivity oracle for planar graphs that processes
any $d$ edge/vertex failures in $sort(d,n)$ time so that connectivity queries
can be answered in $pred(d,n)$ time. (Here $sort$ and $pred$ are the time for
integer sorting and integer predecessor search over a subset of $[n]$ of size
$d$.) Our algorithm has two discrete parts. The first is an algorithm tailored
to triconnected planar graphs. It makes use of Barnette's theorem, which states
that every triconnected planar graph contains a degree-3 spanning tree. The
second part is a generic reduction from general (planar) graphs to triconnected
(planar) graphs. Our algorithm is, moreover, provably optimal. An implication
of Patrascu and Thorup's lower bound on predecessor search is that no

comparing r duality with the generalized Seiberg duality in the r vacua of N=2

interval 2N_f/3 < r \le N. To pass to N=1 we introduce an N=2-breaking
deformation, a mass term \mu for the adjoint matter, eventually decoupling the
adjoint matter in the limit of large \mu. If one starts from a large value of
the parameter \xi\sim\mu m, where the original theory is at weak coupling, and
decreases \xi one hits a a crossover transition from weak to strong coupling
(here m is a typical value of the quark masses). Below this transition the
original theory is described in terms of a weakly coupled infrared-free r dual
theory with the U(N_f-r) gauge group and N_f light quark-like dyon flavors.
Dyon condensation leads to confinement of monopoles, defying a naive
expectation of quark confinement. The quarks and gauge bosons of the original
theory are in an ""instead-of-confinement"" phase. The r and Seiberg dualities
are demonstrated to coincide in the r=N vacua. In the (2/3) N_f <r<N vacua two
dualities do not match. In this window Seiberg's dual is at strong coupling
while our r-dual model is at weak coupling. Thus, we can speak of triality.
Seiberg's dual solution at weak coupling reappears again at r<N_f-N< (1/3)

dyons condense triggering formation of non-Abelian strings which still confine
monopoles, rather than quarks, contrary to naive duality arguments.
""Instead-of-confinement"" mechanism for quarks and gauge bosons of the original

decay, on curves of the marginal stability (CMS), into confined
monopole-antimonopole pairs that form stringy mesons.

powerful generalization of popular belief propagation, expectation propagation
(EP) efficiently approximates the exact Bayesian computation. Nevertheless, EP
can be sensitive to outliers and suffer from divergence for difficult cases. To
address this issue, we propose a new approximate inference approach, relaxed
expectation propagation (REP). It relaxes the moment matching requirement of
expectation propagation by adding a relaxation factor into the KL minimization.
We penalize this relaxation with a $l_1$ penalty. As a result, when two
distributions in the relaxed KL divergence are similar, the relaxation factor
will be penalized to zero and, therefore, we obtain the original moment
matching; In the presence of outliers, these two distributions are
significantly different and the relaxation factor will be used to reduce the
contribution of the outlier. Based on this penalized KL minimization, REP is
robust to outliers and can greatly improve the posterior approximation quality
over EP. To examine the effectiveness of REP, we apply it to Gaussian process
classification, a task known to be suitable to EP. Our classification results
on synthetic and UCI benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvement of
REP over EP and Power EP--in terms of algorithmic stability, estimation

to entropy driven (or ""order by disorder"") annealing effects wherein stability
may initially increase as temperature or noise is increased before becoming
unsolvable at sufficiently high temperature or noise. Additional transitions
between contending viable solutions (such as those at different natural scales)
are also possible. When analyzing community structure via a dynamical approach,
""chaotic-type"" transitions were previously identified [Phil. Mag. {\bf 92} 406

and transitions into chaos in dynamical analogs might extend to other hard

large number of communities. We infer that large systems at a constant ratio of
$q$ to the number of nodes $N$ asymptotically tend toward insolvability in the
limit of large $N$ for any positive $T$. The asymptotic behavior of
temperatures below which structure identification might be possible, $T_\times

an accessible, and generally easy, global solvable phase at low temperature. We
further employ multivariate Tutte polynomials to show that increasing $q$
emulates increasing $T$ for a general Potts model, leading to a similar
stability region at low $T$. Given the relation between Tutte and Jones

which the dark sector comprises an ensemble of individual component fields
which collectively conspire to act in ways that transcend those normally
associated with dark matter. Because of its non-trivial structure, this DDM
ensemble --- unlike most traditional dark-matter candidates --- cannot be
characterized in terms of a single mass, decay width, or set of scattering
cross-sections, but must instead be described by parameters which describe the
collective behavior of its constituents. Likewise, the components of such an
ensemble need not be stable so long as lifetimes are balanced against
cosmological abundances across the ensemble as a whole. In this paper, we
investigate the prospects for identifying a DDM ensemble at the LHC and for
distinguishing such a dark-matter candidate from the candidates characteristic
of traditional dark-matter models. In particular, we focus on DDM scenarios in
which the component fields of the ensemble are produced at colliders alongside
some number of Standard-Model particles via the decays of additional heavy
fields. The invariant-mass distributions of these Standard-Model particles turn
out to possess several unique features that cannot be replicated in most
traditional dark-matter models. We demonstrate that in many situations it is
possible to differentiate between a DDM ensemble and a traditional dark-matter
candidate on the basis of such distributions. Moreover, many of our results
also apply more generally to a variety of other extensions of the Standard
Model which involve multiple stable or metastable neutral particles.

density evolution of low mass galaxies and that predicted by semi-analytic
models. While models accurately reproduce the z=0 number density, they require
that the evolution occurs rapidly at early times, which is incompatible with
the strong late evolution found observationally. We report here the same
discrepancy in two state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations,
which is evidence that the problem is fundamental. We search for the underlying
cause of this problem using two complementary methods. Firstly, we look for
evidence of a different history of today's low mass galaxies in models and
observations and we find that the models yield too few young, strongly
star-forming galaxies. Secondly, we construct a toy model to link the observed
evolution of specific star formation rates (sSFR) with the evolution of the
galaxy stellar mass function. We infer from this model that a key problem in
both semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models is the presence of a positive
instead of a negative correlation between sSFR and stellar mass. A similar
positive correlation is found between the specific dark matter halo accretion
rate and the halo mass, indicating that model galaxies are growing in a way
that follows the growth of their host haloes too closely. It therefore appears
necessary to find a mechanism that decouples the growth of low mass galaxies,
which occurs primarily at late times, from the growth of their host haloes,
which occurs primarily at early times. We argue that the current form of
star-formation driven feedback implemented in most galaxy formation models is
unlikely to achieve this goal, owing to its fundamental dependence on host halo
mass and time. [Abridged]

likely to have no prior knowledge of the binary angular momentum. Therefore a
circumbinary disc forms with a random inclination angle, theta, to the binary.
It is known that for theta < 90 degrees the disc will coalign wrt the binary.
If theta > 90 degrees the disc wholly counteraligns if it satisfies cos(theta)
< -J_d/2J_b, where J_d and J_b are the magnitudes of the disc and binary
angular momentum vectors respectively. If however theta > 90 degrees and this
criterion is not satisfied the same disc may counteralign its inner regions
and, on longer timescales, coalign its outer regions. I show that for typical
disc parameters, describing an accretion event on to a supermassive black hole
binary, a misaligned circumbinary disc is likely to wholly co-- or
counter--align with the binary plane. This is because the binary angular
momentum dominates the disc angular momentum. However with extreme parameters
(binary mass ratio M_2/M_1 << 1 or binary eccentricity e ~ 1) the same disc may
simultaneously co- and counter-align. It is known that coplanar prograde
circumbinary discs are stable. I show that coplanar retrograde circumbinary
discs are also stable. A chaotic accretion event on to an SMBH binary will
therefore result in a coplanar circumbinary disc that is either prograde or
retrograde with respect to the binary plane.

formation for an IRAC-selected extremely red object sample in the GOODS Chandra

the CANDELS survey as well as the deepest available X-ray data from Chandra 4
Ms observations. This sample consists of 133 objects with the 3.6um limiting
magnitude of [3.6] = 21.5, and is approximately complete for galaxies with M
>10^{11}M_sun at 1.5 < z < 2.5. We classify this sample into two types,
quiescent and star-forming galaxies, in the observed infrared color-color
([3.6]-[24] vs K-[3.6]) diagram. The further morphological study of this sample
show a consistent result with the observed color classification. The classified
quiescent galaxies are bulge dominated and star-forming galaxies in the sample
have disk or irregular morphologies. Our observed infrared color classification
is also consistent with the rest-frame color (U-V vs V-J) classification. We
also found that quiescent and star-forming galaxies are well separated in the
nonparametric morphology parameter (Gini vs M_{20}) diagram measuring their
concentration and clumpiness: quiescent galaxies have Gini coefficient higher
than 0.58 and star forming galaxies have Gini coefficient lower that 0.58. We
argue that the star formation quenching process must lead to or be accompanied
by the increasing galaxy concentration. One prominent morphological feature of
this sample is that disks are commonly seen in this massive galaxy sample at
1.5 < z < 2.5: 30% of quiescent galaxies and 70% of star forming galaxies with
M >10^{11}M_sun have disks in their rest-frame optical morphologies. The
prevalence of these extended, relatively undisturbed disks challenges the
merging scenario as the main mode of massive galaxy formation.

reprocessor models to obscured AGNs and for interpreting the results. We focus
on the MYTORUS model but also utilize other models. We apply the techniques to
Suzaku, BeppoSAX, and Swift BAT spectra of the Sy 2 galaxy NGC 4945, but the
methods are applicable to other AGNs including Compton-thin sources. The models
overcome a major restriction of disk-reflection models, namely the assumption
of an infinite column density. Finite column-density models produce a richer
variety of spectral shapes and characteristics, even for Compton-thin AGNs.
Although NGC 4945 is one of the brightest AGNs above 10 keV, the models span
nearly a factor of 3 in column density (~2 to 6 x 10^{24} cm^{-2}) and 2 orders
of magnitude in the intrinsic 2-195 keV luminosity. Models in which the
continuum above 10 keV is dominated by the direct (unscattered) continuum or
Compton-scattered continuum give the highest and lowest intrinsic luminosities
respectively. Variability properties favor solutions in which the unscattered
continuum dominates above 10 keV. The data require that the Compton-scattered
continuum and Fe Kalpha line emission come predominantly from the illuminated
surfaces of the X-ray reprocessor, implying a clumpy medium with a global
covering factor that is small enough that the Compton-scattered continuum does
not dominate the spectrum above 10 keV. This can be identified with the ~30 pc
region spatially resolved by Chandra. The implied intrinsic bolometric
luminosity is close to, or greater than, the Eddington luminosity. However, a
strongly beamed AGN embedded in a shell of Compton-thick (but clumpy) matter
requires less fine-tuning of the covering factor. Beaming is consistent with
recent radio and Fermi results. Such beamed Compton-thick AGNs would be
preferentially selected in surveys over unbeamed Compton-thick AGNs.

happens to these MHD waves generated in flux tubes with non-constant (e.g.,

governing equation of the longitudinal mode is derived and solved analytically
and numerically. In particular, the limit of the thin flux tube approximation
is examined. The general solution describing the slow longitudinal MHD waves in
an expanding magnetic flux tube with constant density is found. Longitudinal
MHD waves in density stratified loops with constant magnetic field are also
analyzed. From analytical solutions, the frequency ratio of the first overtone
and fundamental mode is investigated in stratified waveguides. For small
expansion, a linear dependence between the frequency ratio and the expansion
factor is found. From numerical calculations it was found that the frequency
ratio strongly depends on the density profile chosen and, in general, the
numerical results are in agreement with the analytical results. The relevance

size output by the algorithm is $O(1/\eps)$, matching the existential bound for
random codes up to constant factors. Further, the alphabet size of the codes is
a constant depending only on $\eps$ - it can be made
$\exp(\tilde{O}(1/\eps^2))$ which is not much worse than the lower bound of
$\exp(\Omega(1/\eps))$. The parameters we achieve are thus quite close to the
existential bounds in all three aspects - error-correction radius, alphabet
size, and list-size - simultaneously. Our code construction is Monte Carlo and
has the claimed list decoding property with high probability. Once the code is
(efficiently) sampled, the encoding/decoding algorithms are deterministic with
a running time $O_\eps(N^c)$ for an absolute constant $c$, where $N$ is the

folded codes from towers of function fields, and combining it with a special
form of subspace-evasive sets. Instantiating this with the explicit

above parameters. To illustrate the method in a simpler setting, we also
present a construction based on Hermitian function fields, which offers similar
guarantees with a list and alphabet size polylogarithmic in the block length

secular evolution of a galaxy. The discovery of SMBHs in late-type galaxies
with little or no bulge suggests that an underlying correlation between the
dark matter halo concentration and SMBH mass (MBH) exists, rather than between
the bulge mass and MBH. In this paper we measure P using a two-dimensional fast
fourier transform and estimate the bar pattern speeds of 40 barred spiral
galaxies from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey. The pattern speeds were
derived by estimating the gravitational potentials of our galaxies from Ks-band
images and using them to produce dynamical simulation models. The pattern
speeds allow us to identify those galaxies with low central dark halo
densities, or fast rotating bars, while P provides an estimate of MBH. We find
that a wide range of MBH exists in galaxies with low central dark matter halo
densities, which appears to support other theoretical results. We also find
that galaxies with low central dark halo densities appear to follow more
predictable trends in P versus de Vaucouleurs morphological type (T) and bar
strength versus T than barred galaxies in general. The empirical relationship
between MBH and total gravitational mass of a galaxy (Mtot) allows us to
predict the minimum Mtot that will be observationally measured of our fast bar
galaxies. These predictions will be investigated in a subsequent paper.

of the wave packet with time. Applying again the RG approach we show that in
the regime of strong quasiperiodic modulation the return probability is
governed by the underlying quasiperiodic structure. Further, we also discuss
lower bounds for the scaling exponent of the width of the wave packet and
propose a modified lower bound for the absolute continuous regime.

hallmark of topological matter. When the junction is irradiated with a
radio-frequency f in the absence of an external magnetic field, quantized
voltage steps (Shapiro steps) with a height hf/2e are observed, as is expected
for conventional superconductor junctions, where the supercurrent is carried by
charge-2e Cooper pairs. At high magnetic fields the height of the first Shapiro

gravitational waves in the pulsar timing array (PTA) frequency band
($10^{-9}$--$10^{-7}$ Hz). The development of data analysis techniques aimed at
efficient detection and characterization of these signals is critical to the
gravitational wave detection effort. In this paper we leverage methods
developed for LIGO continuous wave gravitational searches, and explore the use
of the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic for such searches in pulsar timing data. Babak &
Sesana 2012 have already used this approach in the context of PTAs to show that
one can resolve multiple SMBHB sources in the sky. Our work improves on several
aspects of prior continuous wave search methods developed for PTA data
analysis. The algorithm is implemented fully in the time domain, which
naturally deals with the irregular sampling typical of PTA data and avoids
spectral leakage problems associated with frequency domain methods. We take
into account the fitting of the timing model, and have generalized our approach
to deal with both correlated and uncorrelated colored noise sources. We also
develop an incoherent detection statistic that maximizes over all pulsar
dependent contributions to the likelihood. To test the effectiveness and
sensitivity of our detection statistics, we perform a number of monte-carlo
simulations. We produce sensitivity curves for PTAs of various configurations,
and outline an implementation of a fully functional data analysis pipeline.
Finally, we present a derivation of the likelihood maximized over the
gravitational wave phases at the pulsar locations, which results in a vast
reduction of the search parameter space.

be pivotal in such a role. However, recently the importance of the channel

been pointed out. In this work we help remedy this situation by proposing new
quantum LDPC decoding strategies that can significantly reduce performance
degradation by as much as $50\%$. Our new strategies for the quantum LDPC
decoder are based on previous insights from classical LDPC decoders in
mismatched channels, where an asymmetry in performance is known as a function
of the estimated channel noise. We show how similar asymmetries carry over to
the quantum depolarizing channel, and how an estimate of the depolarization
flip parameter weighted to larger values leads to significant performance
improvement.

enablers of evolvability in biology. We apply these concepts to software,
defining mutational robustness to be the fraction of random mutations that
leave a program's behavior unchanged. Test cases are used to measure program
behavior and mutation operators are taken from genetic programming. Although
software is often viewed as brittle, with small changes leading to catastrophic
changes in behavior, our results show surprising robustness in the face of
random software mutations.
  The paper describes empirical studies of the mutational robustness of 22
programs, including 14 production software projects, the Siemens benchmarks,
and 4 specially constructed programs. We find that over 30% of random mutations
are neutral with respect to their test suite. The results hold across all
classes of programs, for mutations at both the source code and assembly
instruction levels, across various programming languages, and are only weakly
related to test suite coverage. We conclude that mutational robustness is an
inherent property of software, and that neutral variants (i.e., those that pass
the test suite) often fulfill the program's original purpose or specification.
  Based on these results, we conjecture that neutral mutations can be leveraged
as a mechanism for generating software diversity. We demonstrate this idea by
generating a population of neutral program variants and showing that the
variants automatically repair unknown bugs with high probability. Neutral
landscapes also provide a partial explanation for recent results that use
evolutionary computation to automatically repair software bugs.

signal x\in\R^p is commonly assumed to be a known parameter. However, it is
typically unknown in practice. Due to the fact that many aspects of CS depend
on knowing ||x||_0, it is important to estimate this parameter in a data-driven
way. A second practical concern is that ||x||_0 is a highly unstable function
of x. In particular, for real signals with entries not exactly equal to 0, the
value ||x||_0=p is not a useful description of the effective number of
coordinates. In this paper, we propose to estimate a stable measure of sparsity
s(x):=||x||_1^2/||x||_2^2, which is a sharp lower bound on ||x||_0. Our
estimation procedure uses only a small number of linear measurements, does not
rely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very little computation. A
confidence interval for s(x) is provided, and its width is shown to have no
dependence on the signal dimension p. Moreover, this result extends naturally
to the matrix recovery setting, where a soft version of matrix rank can be
estimated with analogous guarantees. Finally, we show that the use of
randomized measurements is essential to estimating s(x). This is accomplished

  In this paper we obtain a number of generic algorithmic results about Planar
F-Deletion, when F contains at least one planar graph. The highlights of our
work are - A constant factor approximation algorithm for the optimization
version of Planar F-Deletion. - A randomized linear time and single exponential
parameterized algorithm, that is, an algorithm running in time O(2^{O(k)} n),
for the parameterized version of Planar F-deletion where all graphs in F are
connected. The algorithm can be made deterministic at the cost of making the
polynomial factor in the running time n*log^2 n rather than linear. - A
polynomial kernel for parameterized Planar F-deletion

for the disc component of the galaxies ($\lambda_{d}$), we do not find signs of
evolution in the redshift range $0.4 \leq z \leq 1.2$. We find that the mass

similar to that of low-$z$ galaxies; showing a strong dependence on mass, in
the sense that low-mass systems present higher $\lambda_{d}$ values than
high-mass galaxies, with no significant dependence on the environmental

superconductors also lie in close proximity to a magnetically ordered phase. A
central debate concerning the superconducting mechanism is whether the local
magnetic moments play an indispensable role or the itinerant electron
description is sufficient. A key step for resolving this issue is to acquire a
comprehensive picture regarding the nature of various phases and interactions
in the iron compounds. Here we report the doping, temperature, and spatial
evolutions of the electronic structure of NaFe1-xCoxAs studied by scanning
tunneling microscopy. The spin density wave gap in the parent state is observed
for the first time, which shows a strongly asymmetric lineshape that is
incompatible with the conventional Fermi surface nesting scenario. The
optimally doped sample exhibits a single, symmetric energy gap, but in the
overdoped regime another asymmetric gap-like feature emerges near the Fermi
level. This novel gap-like phase coexists with superconductivity in the ground
state, persists deep into the normal state, and shows strong spatial
variations. The characteristics of the three distinct low energy states, in
conjunction with the peculiar high energy spectra, suggest that the coupling
between the local moments and itinerant electrons is the fundamental driving
force for the phases and phase transitions in the iron pnictides.

due to (a) decrease of the diffusion coefficient and dominance of convective

with a power-law spectrum in momentum $p^{-2.45\pm0.4}$, which we identify as

initial state of a single inflationary field. While single-field inflation with
the standard Bunch-Davies initial vacuum state does not generally produce a
measurable three-point function (bispectrum) in the squeezed configuration,
allowing for a non-standard initial state produces an exception. Here, we
calculate the signature of an initial state modification in single-field
slow-roll inflation in both the scale-dependent bias of the large-scale
structure (LSS) and mu-type distortion in the black-body spectrum of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB). We parametrize the initial state modifications and
identify certain choices of parameters as natural, though we also note some
fine-tuned choices that can yield a larger bispectrum. In both cases, we
observe a distinctive k^-3 signature in LSS (as opposed to k^-2 for the
local-form). As a non-zero bispectrum in the squeezed configuration correlates
a long-wavelength mode with two short-wavelength modes, it induces a
correlation between the CMB temperature anisotropy on large scales with the
temperature-anisotropy-squared on very small scales; this correlation persists
as the small-scale anisotropy-squared is processed into mu-type distortions.
While the local-form mu-distortion turns out to be too small to detect in the
near future, a modified initial vacuum state enhances the signal by a large
factor owing to an extra factor of k_1/k. For example, a proposed
absolutely-calibrated experiment, PIXIE, is expected to detect this correlation
with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10, for an occupation number of about
0.5 in the observable modes. Relatively calibrated experiments such as Planck
and LiteBIRD should also be able to measure this effect, provided that the
relative calibration between different frequencies meets the required
precision. (Abridged)

follows a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. These properties lead us

rendered unstable by cosmic ray streaming, can create new net flux over any
finite region, in the direction of the original large-scale field. We perform
direct numerical simulations (DNS) of an MHD fluid with a forced cosmic ray
current and use the test-field method to determine the alpha effect and the
turbulent magnetic diffusivity. As follows from DNS, the dynamics of the
instability has the following stages: (i) in the early stage, the small-scale
Bell instability that results in a production of small-scale turbulence is
excited; (ii) in the intermediate stage, there is formation of larger-scale
magnetic structures; (iii) finally, quasi-stationary large-scale turbulence is
formed at a growth rate that is comparable to that expected from the dynamo
instability, but its amplitude over much longer timescales remains unclear. The
results of DNS are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates.
  It is suggested that this dynamo is what gives weakly magnetized relativistic
shocks such as those from gamma ray bursts a macroscopic correlation length. It
may also be important for large-scale magnetic field amplification associated
with cosmic ray production and diffusive shock acceleration in supernova
remnants (SNR) and blast waves from gamma ray bursts. Magnetic field
amplification by Bell turbulence in SNR is found to be significant, but it is
limited owing to the finite time available to the super-Alfvenicly expanding
remnant. The effectiveness of the mechanisms is shown to be dependent on the

design capacity achieving coding schemes for general point-to-point memoryless
channels with feedback. In this paper, we present a way to extend posterior
matching based encoding and variable rate decoding ideas for the Gaussian MAC
with feedback, referred to as time-varying posterior matching scheme, analyze
the achievable rate region and error probabilities of the extended
encoding-decoding scheme. The time-varying posterior matching scheme is a
generalization of the Shayevitz and Feder's posterior matching scheme when the
posterior distributions of the input messages given output are not fixed over
transmission time slots. It turns out that the well-known Ozarow's encoding
scheme, which obtains the capacity of two-user Gaussian channel, is a special
case of our extended posterior matching framework as the Schalkwijk-Kailath's
scheme is a special case of the point-to-point posterior matching mentioned
above. Furthermore, our designed posterior matching also obtains the
linear-feedback sum-capacity for the symmetric multiuser Gaussian MAC. Besides,
the encoding scheme in this paper is designed for the real Gaussian MAC to
obtain that performance, which is different from previous approaches where
encoding schemes are designed for the complex Gaussian MAC. More importantly,
this paper shows potential of posterior matching in designing optimal coding
schemes for multiuser channels with feedback.

receivers distributed in a fluidic medium. In such networks, a transmitter
sends one or more signalling molecules, which are diffused over the medium, to
the receiver to realise the communication. In order to be able to engineer
synthetic molecular communication networks, mathematical models for these
networks are required. This paper proposes a new stochastic model for molecular
communication networks called reaction-diffusion master equation with exogenous
input (RDMEX). The key idea behind RDMEX is to model the transmitters as time
series of signalling molecule counts, while diffusion in the medium and
chemical reactions at the receivers are modelled as Markov processes using
master equation. An advantage of RDMEX is that it can readily be used to model
molecular communication networks with multiple transmitters and receivers. For
the case where the reaction kinetics at the receivers is linear, we show how
RDMEX can be used to determine the mean and covariance of the receiver output
signals, and derive closed-form expressions for the mean receiver output signal
of the RDMEX model. These closed-form expressions reveal that the output signal
of a receiver can be affected by the presence of other receivers. Numerical
examples are provided to demonstrate the properties of the model.

both electron diffraction patterns and local characterizations, we show that
the healing proceeds first along the tube axis, before spreading laterally, and
observe the competition between two or more chiralities. The resulting picture

showing promise as a robust `next step' fifth-rung functional by using dynamic
correlation to go beyond the limitations of the direct random-phase

this work we test the functional on fourteen spherically symmetric, neutral and

and good results for the ions (within 4mHa/$e^-$). In all cases it performs
better than the dRPA. When combined with the previous successes, these new
results point to the ISTLS functional being a prime contender for
high-accuracy, benchmark DFT correlation energy calculations.

galaxies, perhaps in all of them. The tight observed scaling relations between
SMBH masses and structural properties of their host spheroids likely indicate
that the processes fostering the growth of both components are physically
linked, despite the many orders of magnitude difference in their physical size.
This chapter discusses how we constrain the evolution of SMBH, probed by their
actively growing phases, when they shine as active galactic nuclei (AGN) with
luminosities often in excess of that of the entire stellar population of their
host galaxies. Following loosely the chronological developments of the field,
we begin by discussing early evolutionary studies, when AGN represented beacons
of light probing the most distant reaches of the universe and were used as
tracers of the large scale structure. This early study turned into AGN
""Demography"", once it was realized that the strong evolution (in luminosity,
number density) of the AGN population hindered any attempt to derive
cosmological parameters from AGN observations directly. Following a discussion
of the state of the art in the study of AGN luminosity functions, we move on to
discuss the ""modern"" view of AGN evolution, one in which a bigger emphasis is
given to the physical relationships between the population of growing black
holes and their environment. This includes observational and theoretical
efforts aimed at constraining and understanding the evolution of scaling
relations, as well as the resulting limits on the evolution of the SMBH mass
function. Physical models of AGN feedback and the ongoing efforts to isolate
them observationally are discussed next. Finally, we touch upon the problem of
when and how the first black holes formed and the role of black holes in the
high-redshift universe.

spectropolarimetric survey using the FORS instrument. The multi-object mode was
used, so that a total of 21 OB stars could be investigated during a
one-night-long run. A magnetic field was detected in two objects of the sample,
with a 6 sigma significance; Tr16-22 and 13. Such a detection was expected for
Tr16-22, as its X-ray emission is too bright, variable and hard, compared to
other late-type O or O+OB systems. It is more surprising for Tr16-13, a poorly
known star which so far has never shown any peculiar characteristics.
Subsequent monitoring is now needed to ascertain the physical properties of
these objects and enable a full modelling of their magnetic atmospheres and
winds.

scattering. The phonons have been measured and the results are similar to those
of other materials with the perovskite structure such as PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3 (PMN).
The acoustic and lowest energy optic branches were measured but it was not
possible to measure the branches of higher energy, possibly this is because
they largely consist of oxygen motions. High-resolution inelastic measurements
also showed that the diffuse scattering was strictly elastic and not directly
related to the phonon spectra. A diffuse scattering was observed in BMT near
the (H\pm1/2, K\pm1/2, L\pm1/2) points in the Brillouin zone and this had a
characteristic cube shape. This arises from ordering of the B-site ions in BMT.
Additional experiments revealed a diffuse scattering in BMT similar in shape to
Bragg reflections at wave-vectors of the form (H\pm1/3, K\pm1/3, L\pm1/3). Such
reflections were also observed by Lufaso [Chem. Matt. 16 (2004) 2148] from
powders and suggest that this structure of BMT consists of 4 differently
oriented domains of a trigonal structure and results from a different ordering
of the B-site ions from that responsible for the scattering at the (H\pm1/2,
K\pm1/2, L\pm1/2) points. The results lead us to suggest that for BMT single
crystals the bulk has the properties of a cubic perovskite, whereas the surface
may have quite different structure from that of the bulk. This difference
resembles the behaviour of cubic relaxors like PMN and PMN doped by PbTiO3,
where significant surface effects have been reported.

China, a new sky brightness monitor (SBM) has been produced for the site survey
for CGST. To critically examine the performance and sensitivity of SBM, we used
it in the observation of the annular solar eclipse in Dali City, Yunnan, on 15
January 2010. The observation met good weather condition with almost clear sky
during the eclipse. The SBM measurement translates into the solar illuminance
changes at a level of 2.4 \times 10-4I s-1 during the eclipse. The time of the
minimal sky brightness in the field of view (FOV) is found consistent with the
time of maximum eclipse. Two local sky regions in the FOV are chosen to make
time series of calibrated skylight profiles. The evolution of the sky
brightness thus calibrated also shows good consistency with the eclipse,
particularly between the second and the third contacts. The minimal sky
brightness in each local sky region took place within half a minute from the
corresponding predicted contact time. Such small time delays were mainly caused
by occasional cirri. The minimal sky brightness measured during the eclipse is
a few millionths of I\odot with standard deviation of 0.11 millionths of
I\odot. The observation supports that the singlescattering process (optically
thin conditions) is the main contributor to the atmospheric scattering. We have
demonstrated that many important aerosol optical parameters can be deduced from
our data.We conclude that the new SBM is a sensitive sky photometer that can be
used for our CGST and coronagraph site surveys.

By
convolving lensing maps with a filter function of a specific scale, chosen to
be larger than the scale on which the noise is dominant, the lensing signal may
be boosted with respect to the noise. This allows for detection of structures
at increased fidelity. Furthermore, higher-order statistics of the aperture
mass (such as its skewness or kurtosis), or counting of the peaks seen in the
resulting aperture mass maps, provide a convenient and effective method to
constrain the cosmological parameters. In this paper, we more fully explore the
formalism underlying the aperture mass statistic. We demonstrate that the
aperture mass statistic is formally identical to a wavelet transform at a
specific scale. Further, we show that the filter functions most frequently used
in aperture mass studies are not ideal, being non-local in both real and
Fourier space. In contrast, the wavelet formalism offers a number of wavelet
functions that are localized both in real and Fourier space, yet similar to the
'optimal' aperture mass filters commonly adopted. Additionally, for a number of
wavelet functions, such as the starlet wavelet, very fast algorithms exist to
compute the wavelet transform. This offers significant advantages over the
usual aperture mass algorithm when it comes to image processing time,
demonstrating speed-up factors of ~ 5 - 1200 for aperture radii in the range 2
to 64 pixels on an image of 1024 x 1024 pixels.

energy flow are recognized. In particular, the transverse orbital flow exerts
the transverse force that grows as a^3 for conducting and as a^6 for dielectric
subwavelength particle with radius a, in compliance with the dipole mechanism
of the field-particle interaction; the force associated with the spin flow
behaves as a^8 in both cases, which testifies for the non-dipole mechanism. The

0.1 Hz band. LISA Pathfinder is the down-scaled version of a single LISA arm.
The arm -- named Doppler link -- can be treated as a differential
accelerometer, measuring the relative acceleration between test masses. LISA
Pathfinder -- the in-flight test of the LISA instrumentation -- is currently in
the final implementation and planned to be launched in 2014. It will set
stringent constraints on the ability to put test masses in geodesic motion to
within the required differential acceleration of 3\times10^{-14} m s^{-2}
Hz^{-1/2} and track their relative motion to within the required differential
displacement measurement noise of 9\times10^{-12} m Hz^{-1/2}, around 1 mHz.
Given the scientific objectives, it will carry out -- for the first time with
such high accuracy required for gravitational wave detection -- the science of
spacetime metrology, in which the Doppler link between two free-falling test
masses measures the curvature. This thesis contains a novel approach to the
calculation of the Doppler response to gravitational waves. It shows that the
parallel transport of 4-vectors records the history of gravitational wave
signals. In practice, the Doppler link is implemented with 4 bodies in LISA and
3 bodies in LISA Pathfinder. To compensate for noise sources a control logic is
implemented during the measurement. The closed-loop dynamics of LISA Pathfinder
can be condensed into operators acting on the motion coordinates, handling the
couplings, as well as the cross-talks. The scope of system identification is
the optimal calibration of the instrument. This thesis describes some data
analysis procedures applied to synthetic experiments and shows the relevance of
system identification for the success of LISA Pathfinder in demonstrating the
principles of spacetime metrology for all future space-based missions.

two spatial dimensions with passive and active fluctuations. Hereby, active
fluctuations refers to purely non-equilibrium stochastic forces correlated with
the heading of an individual active particle. In the simplest case studied
here, they are assumed as independent stochastic forces parallel (speed noise)
and perpendicular (angular noise) to the velocity of the particle. On the other
hand, passive fluctuations are defined by a noise vector independent of the
direction of motion of a particle, and may account for example for thermal
fluctuations.
  We derive a macroscopic description of the active Brownian particle gas with
velocity-alignment interaction. Hereby, we start from the individual based
description in terms of stochastic differential equations (Langevin equations)
and derive equations of motion for the coarse grained kinetic variables
(density, velocity and temperature) via a moment expansion of the corresponding
probability density function.
  We focus here in particular on the different impact of active and passive
fluctuations on the onset of collective motion and show how active fluctuations
in the active Brownian dynamics can change the phase-transition behaviour of
the system. In particular, we show that active angular fluctuation lead to an
earlier breakdown of collective motion and to emergence of a new bistable
regime in the mean-field case.

every finite lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of a finite
algebra. Until this problem is resolved, our understanding of finite algebras
is incomplete, since, given an arbitrary finite algebra, we cannot say whether
there are any restrictions on the shape of its congruence lattice. By a well
known result of Palfy and Pudlak, the problem would be solved if we could prove
the existence of a finite lattice that is not an interval in the lattice of
subgroups of a finite group. Thus the problem of characterizing congruence
lattices of finite algebras is closely related to the problem of characterizing
intervals in subgroup lattices.
  In this work, we review a number of methods for finding a finite algebra with
a given congruence lattice, including searching for intervals in subgroup
lattices. We also consider methods for proving that algebras with a given
congruence lattice exist without actually constructing them. By combining these
well known methods with a new method we have developed, and with much help from
computer software like the UACalc and GAP, we prove that with one possible
exception every lattice with at most seven elements is isomorphic to the
congruence lattice of a finite algebra. As such, we have identified the unique
smallest lattice for which there is no known representation. We examine this
exceptional lattice in detail, and prove results that characterize the class of
algebras that could possibly represent this lattice.
  We conclude with what we feel are the most interesting open questions
surrounding this problem and discuss possibilities for future work.

experiment. However, the principle of linear superposition, a central tenet of
the theory, apparently contradicts a commonplace observation: macroscopic
objects are never found in a linear superposition of position states. Moreover,
the theory does not really explain as to why during a quantum measurement,
deterministic evolution is replaced by probabilistic evolution, whose random
outcomes obey the Born probability rule. In this article we review an
experimentally falsifiable phenomenological proposal, known as Continuous
Spontaneous Collapse: a stochastic non-linear modification of the
Schr\""{o}dinger equation, which resolves these problems, while giving the same
experimental results as quantum theory in the microscopic regime. Two
underlying theories for this phenomenology are reviewed: Trace Dynamics, and
gravity induced collapse. As one approaches the macroscopic scale, the
predictions of this proposal begin to differ appreciably from those of quantum
theory, and are being confronted by ongoing laboratory experiments that include
molecular interferometry and optomechanics. These experiments, which
essentially test the validity of linear superposition for large systems, are
reviewed here, and their technical challenges, current results, and future
prospects summarized. We conclude that it is likely that over the next two
decades or so, these experiments can verify or rule out the proposed stochastic
modification of quantum theory.

general arguments based upon the vectorial nature of electromagnetic fields, is
of particular significance in the situation of an extreme focusing, when the

with a ""complicated"" spatial structure are extensively analyzed in the general
case and for a Laguerre-Gauss beam 2 as well, notably for beams bearing a |l| =
2 orbital angular momentum for which a magnetic field and a gradient of the
electric field are present on-axis. We thus analyze the behavior of a atomic
size light-detector, sensitive as well to quadrupole electric transitions and
to magnetic dipole transitions, and apply it to the case of Laguerre-Gauss
beam. We detail how the mapping of such a beam depends on the nature and on the
specific orientation of the detector. We show also that the interplay of mixing
of polarization and topological charge, respectively associated to spin and
orbital momentum when the paraxial approximation holds, modifies the apparent
size of the beam in the focal plane. This even leads to a breaking of the
cylindrical symmetry in the case of a linearly polarized transverse electric
field.

  The SDSS DR7 vs UKIDSS LAS DR5 search returned a total of 32 ultracool
subdwarf candidates, only two being recognised as a subdwarf in the literature.
Twenty-seven candidates were followed-up spectroscopically in the optical
between 600 and 1000 nm. We confirmed 20 candidates as subdwarfs, extreme
subdwarfs or ultra-subdwarfs with spectral types later than M5; this represents
a success rate of ~60%. Among those 20 new subdwarfs, we identified 2 early-L
subdwarfs very likely located within 100 pc that we propose as templates for
future searches because they are the first examples of their subclass. Another
7 sources are solar-metallicity M dwarfs with spectral types between M4 and M7
without Halpha emission, suggesting that they are old M dwarfs. The remaining 5
candidates do not have spectroscopic follow-up yet; only 1 remains as a
bona-fide ultracool subdwarf after revision of their proper motions. We
assigned spectral types based on the current classification schemes and, when
possible, we measured their radial velocities. Using the limited number of
subdwarfs with trigonometric parallaxes, we estimated distances between 90 and
600 for the new subdwarfs. We provide mid-infrared photometry from WISE for two
subdwarfs and discuss their colours. Finally, we estimate a lower limit of the
surface density of ultracool subdwarfs of the order of 5000-5700 times lower

are expected to underlie the strong medium-modifications of jet observables in

that such jet-medium interactions alter generically and characteristically the
color correlations in the parton shower. We characterize these effects in a
color-differential calculation of the medium-induced gluon radiation spectrum
to first and second order in opacity. By interfacing simple branching histories
of medium-modified color flow with the Lund hadronization model, we analyze how
the medium modification of color correlations can affect the distribution of
hadronic fragments in jets. Importantly, we observe that jet-medium
interactions give rise to the medium-induced color decoherence of gluons from
the parton shower. Since hadronization respects color flow and since each color
singlet in a parton shower is hadronized separately, this medium-induced color
decoherence leaves characteristic signatures in the jet fragmentation pattern.
In particular, it can contribute to the quenching of leading hadron spectra.
Moreover, it can increase strongly the yield of soft hadronic fragments from a
jet, while the distribution of more energetic hadrons follows naturally the
shape of a vacuum-like fragmentation pattern of lower total energy.

roughly, the duration of a single news story about a person, and the overall
duration of public interest in a person. We watched the distribution evolve
from 1895 to 2010, expecting to find significantly shortening fame durations,
per the much popularly bemoaned shortening of society's attention spans and
quickening of media's news cycles. Instead, we conclusively demonstrate that,
through many decades of rapid technological and societal change, through the
appearance of Twitter, communication satellites, and the Internet, fame
durations did not decrease, neither for the typical case nor for the extremely
famous, with the last statistically significant fame duration decreases coming
in the early 20th century, perhaps from the spread of telegraphy and telephony.
Furthermore, while median fame durations stayed persistently constant, for the
most famous of the famous, as measured by either volume or duration of media
attention, fame durations have actually trended gently upward since the 1940s,
with statistically significant increases on 40-year timescales. Similar studies
have been done with much shorter timescales specifically in the context of
information spreading on Twitter and similar social networking sites. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first massive scale study of this nature

can be used to infer invariants for the original system. The abstraction
techniques rely on a change-of-basis transformation that associates each state

of the original system. We present conditions under which a given change of
basis transformation for a non-linear system can define an abstraction.
Furthermore, the techniques developed here apply to continuous systems defined
by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), discrete systems defined by
transition systems and hybrid systems that combine continuous as well as
discrete subsystems. The techniques presented here allow us to discover, given
a non-linear system, if a change of bases transformation involving
degree-bounded polynomials yielding an algebraic abstraction exists. If so, our
technique yields the resulting abstract system, as well. This approach is
further extended to search for a change of bases transformation that abstracts
a given non-linear system into a system of linear differential inclusions. Our
techniques enable the use of analysis techniques for linear systems to infer
invariants for non-linear systems. We present preliminary evidence of the

calculate the distribution of the number of type Ia supernovae as a function of

degenerate and double degenerate), but also with various evolutionary
assumptions (such as mass transfer efficiency, angular momentum loss, and
common envelope description). The comparison of these theoretically predicted
delay time distributions with observations in elliptical galaxies then allows
to constrain the evolutionary scenarios and parameters. From the morphological
shape of the distributions, we conclude that all supernovae Ia cannot be
produced through the single degenerate scenario alone, with the best match
being obtained when both scenarios contribute. Within the double degenerate
scenario, most systems go through a phase of quasi-conservative, stable Roche
lobe overflow. We propose stellar rotation as a possible solution for the
underestimation of the observed absolute number of events, as is the case in
many theoretical population synthesis studies. A brief comparison with these
other studies is made, showing good correspondence under the nontrivial
condition of equivalent assumptions. We also investigate the influence of
different supernova Ia progenitors and evolutionary parameters on the
theoretical distribution of the iron abundance of G-type dwarfs in the Galactic
disk. These stars are good indicators of the entire chemical history of the
Galaxy, and their predicted metallicity distribution can also be compared to
the observational ones. This again limits the number of acceptable combinations
of assumptions. Supporting previous results, the best correspondence is found
in the case where both the single and double degenerate scenario contribute.

their surface and space density. We define a region in the X-ray/IR vs. HR
plane associated to CT AGN, i.e. F(2-12keV)/F25nu25<0.02 and HR>-0.2. We build
up a sample of 43 CT AGN candidates using data from IRAS-PSC and 2XMM
catalogue. In order to test the efficiency of the proposed method in selecting
CT AGN we use the results of the X-ray spectral analysis performed on all the
sources of our sample. After taking into account the different selection
effects, we have estimated the number of CT in the local Universe and their
density down to the IRAS flux limit of F25=0.5Jy. We find that the diagnostic
plot proposed here is an efficient method to select Compton-thick AGN in the
nearby Universe since ~84% of the sources populating the proposed CT region are
actually CT AGN. Twenty percent are newly-discovered CT AGN. We then estimate
the surface density of CT AGN down to the IRAS PSC catalogue flux limit
(F25=0.5Jy) that turns out to be ~3e-3 src deg-2. After estimating an
equivalent IR-hard X-ray limiting flux, we compare our result with those found
with SWIFT-BAT. We find that the surface density derived here is a factor 4
above the density computed in the hard X-ray surveys. This difference is
ascribed, at least in part, to a significant contribution (~60-90%) of the
star-forming activity to the total 25 mic emission for the sources in our
sample. By considering only the 25 mic AGN emission, we estimate a surface
density of CT AGN which is consistent with the results found by hard X-ray
surveys. Finally, we estimated the co-moving space density of CT AGN with
intrinsic LX>1e43 erg s-1 (0.004<z<0.06): ~3.5e-6 Mpc-3. The prediction for CT
AGN based on the synthesis model of XRB in Gilli et al.(2007) is consistent

understanding supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. The interactions of the

emblematic excerpts of the impressive corpus accumulated in the field of
optical interferometry image reconstruction; 2) discuss future prospects for
this technique by selecting four representative astrophysical science cases in
order to review the potential benefits of using optical long baseline

from those selected astrophysical environments and used state-of-the-art codes
to provide the reconstructed images that are reachable with current or
soon-to-be facilities. The image reconstruction process was ""blind"" in the
sense that reconstructors had no knowledge of the input brightness
distributions. We discuss the impact of optical interferometry in those four
astrophysical fields. We show that image reconstruction software successfully
provides accurate morphological information on a variety of astrophysical
topics and review the current strengths and weaknesses of such reconstructions.
We investigate how to improve image reconstruction and the quality of the image
possibly by upgrading the current facilities. We finally argue that optical

  algebras",,,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The first system of many-valued logic was introduced by J. Lukasiewicz, his
motivation was of philosophical nature as he was looking for an interpretation
of the concepts of possibility and necessity. Since then, plenty of research
has been developed in this area. In 1968, when Gr.C. Moisil came across Zadeh's
fuzzy set theory he found the motivation he had been looking for in order to
legitimate the introduction and study of infinitely-valued Lukasiewicz
algebras, so he defined \theta-valued Lukasiewicz algebras (or
LM\theta-algebras, for short) (without negation), where \theta is the order
type of a chain. In this article, our main interest is to investigate the
principal and Boolean congruences and \theta-congruences on LM\theta-algebras.
In order to do this we take into account a topological duality for these
algebras obtained in (A.V. Figallo, I. Pascual, A. Ziliani, A Duality for
\theta-Valued Lukasiewicz-Moisil Algebras and Aplicattions. J. LMult- Valued
Logic & Soft Computing. Vol. 16, pp 303-322. (2010). Furthermore, we prove that
the intersection of two principal ?-congruences is a principal one. On the
other hand, we show that Boolean congruences are both principal congruences and
\theta-congruences. This allowed us to establish necessary and sufficient
conditions so that a principal congruence is a Boolean one. Finally, bearing in
mind the above results, we characterize the principal and Boolean congruences
on n-valued Lukasiewicz algebras without negation when we consider them as
LM\theta-algebras in the case that \theta is an integer n, $n\geq 2$.

idea of massive star formation through accretion rather than coalescence, but
the detailed kinematics in the equatorial region of the disk candidates is not
well known, which limits our understanding of the accretion process. [Aims]
This paper explores the kinematics of the gas around a young massive star with
millimeter-wave interferometry to improve our understanding of the formation of
massive stars though accretion. [Methods] We use Plateau de Bure
interferometric images to probe the environment of the nearby (~1 kpc) and
luminous (~20000 Lsun) high-mass (10-16 Msun) young star AFGL 2591-VLA3 in
continuum and in lines of HDO, H218O and SO2 in the 115 and 230 GHz bands.
Radiative transfer calculations are employed to investigate the kinematics of
the source. [Results] At ~0.5"" (500 AU) resolution, the line images clearly
resolve the velocity field of the central compact source (diameter of ~ 800 AU)
and show linear velocity gradients in the northeast-southwest direction.
Judging from the disk-outflow geometry, the observed velocity gradient results
from rotation and radial expansion in the equatorial region of VLA3. Radiative
transfer calculations suggest that the velocity field is consistent with
sub-Keplerian rotation plus Hubble-law like expansion. The line profiles of the
observed molecules suggest a layered structure, with HDO emission arising from
the disk mid-plane, H218O from the warm mid-layer, and SO2 from the upper disk.
[Conclusions] We propose AFGL 2591-VLA3 as a new massive disk candidate, with
peculiar kinematics. The rotation of this disk is sub-Keplerian, probably due
to magnetic braking, while the stellar wind may be responsible for the
expansion of the disk. The expansion motion [...]

based on the nonlinear hyperbolic system of heat flux relaxation and energy
conservation equations. The Fourier-Cattaneo phenomenological law is
generalized where the relaxation time and heat propagation coefficient have a
general power law temperature dependence. From such laws one cannot form a
second order parabolic or telegraph-type equation. We consider the original
non-linear hyperbolic system itself with the self-similar Ansatz for the
temperature distribution and for the heat flux. As results continuous and
shock-wave solutions are presented. For physical establishment numerous
materials with various temperature dependent heat conduction coefficients are
mentioned.

  evolving onto the extended horizontal branch","accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21012.x",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Subluminous B stars come in a variety of flavours including single stars,
close and wide binaries, and pulsating and non-pulsating variables. A majority
have helium-poor surfaces (helium by number nHe<1%), whilst a minority have
extremely helium-rich surfaces (nHe>90%). A small number have an intermediate
surface helium abundance (~ 10 - 30%), accompanied by peculiar abundances of
other elements. The questions posed are i) whether these abundance
peculiarities are associated with radiatively-driven and time-dependent
stratification of elements within the photosphere as the star evolves from an
helium-enriched progenitor to become a normal helium-poor sdB star, and ii)
whether these phenomena occur only in single sdB stars or are also associated
with sdB stars in binaries.
  We present a fine analysis of the bright intermediate-helium sdB star CPD-20
1123 (Albus 1) which shows it to be cool, for a hot subdwarf, with Teff~23 000
K and with a surface helium abundance ~17% by number. Other elements do not
show extraordinary anomalies; in common with majority sdB stars, carbon and
oxygen are substantially depleted, whilst nitrogen is enriched. Magnesium
through sulphur appear to be depleted by ~0.5 dex, but chlorine and argon are
substantially enhanced.
  We also present a series of radial-velocity measurements which show the star
to be a close binary with an orbital period of 2.3 d, suggesting it to be a
post-common-envelope system.
  The discovery of an intermediate helium-rich sdB star in a close binary in
addition to known and apparently single exemplars supports the view that these
are very young sdB stars in which radiatively-driven stratification of the
photosphere is incomplete.

received lots of attention for the role they can play in planetesimals
formation. Radial migration of intermediate size solids toward the central star
may prevent their growth to larger solid grains. On the other hand, vortices
can trap the dust and accelerate this growth, counteracting fast radial
transport. Multiple effects have been shown to affect this scenario, such as
vortex migration or decay. The aim of this paper is to study the formation of
vortices by the Rossby wave instability and their long term evolution in a full
three dimensional protoplanetary disc. We use a robust numerical scheme
combined with adaptive mesh refinement in cylindrical coordinates, allowing to
affordably compute long term 3D evolutions. We consider a full disc stratified
both radially and vertically that is prone to formation of vortices by the
Rossby wave instability. We show that the 3D Rossby vortices grow and survive
over hundreds of years without migration. The localized overdensity which
initiated the instability and vortex formation survives the growth of the
Rossby wave instability for very long times. When the vortices are no longer
sustained by the Rossby wave instability, their shape changes toward more
elliptical vortices. This allows them to survive shear-driven destruction, but
they may be prone to elliptical instability and slow decay. When the conditions
for growing Rossby wave-related instabilities are maintained in the disc,
large-scale vortices can survive over very long timescales and may be able to
concentrate solids.

redshift, if physical, could be due to the presence of dilatonic domains, and
one or more domain walls inside our horizon. An absorption spectrum of an
object in a different domain from our own would be characterized by a different
value of alpha. We show that while a single wall solution is statically
comparable to a dipole fit, and is a big improvement over a weighted mean
(despite adding 3 parameters), a two-wall solution is a far better fit (despite
adding 3 parameters over the single wall solution). We derive a simple model
accounting for the two-domain wall solution. The goodness of these fits is
however dependent on the extra random error which was argued to account for the
large scatter in most of the data. When this error is omitted, all the above
solutions are poor fits to the data. When included, the solutions that exhibit
a spatial dependence agree with the data much more significantly than the
Standard Model; however, the Standard Model itself is not a terrible fit to the
data, having a p-value of ~ 20 %.

opportunities for observing the solar atmosphere with unprecedented spatial
resolution and cadence. In order to benefit from the high quality of
observational data from this instrument, we have developed methods for
calibrating and restoring polarized Stokes images, obtained at optical and near
infrared wavelengths, taking into account field-of-view variations of the
filter properties.
  In order to facilitate velocity measurements, a time series from a 3D
hydrodynamical granulation simulation is used to compute quiet Sun spectral
line profiles at different heliocentric angles. The synthetic line profiles,
with their convective blueshifts, can be used as absolute references for
line-of-sight velocities.
  Observations of the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line are used to study magnetic fields
in chromospheric fibrils. The line wings show the granulation pattern at
mid-photospheric heights whereas the overlying chromosphere is seen in the core
of the line. Using full Stokes data, we have attempted to observationally
verify the alignment of chromospheric fibrils with the magnetic field. Our
results suggest that in most cases fibrils are aligned along the magnetic field
direction, but we also find examples where this is not the case.
  Detailed interpretation of Stokes data from spectral lines formed in the
chromospheric data can be made using non-LTE inversion codes. For the first
time, we use a realistic 3D MHD chromospheric simulation of the quiet Sun to
assess how well NLTE inversions recover physical quantities from
spectropolarimetric observations of Ca II 8542 {\AA}. We demonstrate that
inversions provide realistic estimates of depth-averaged quantities in the
chromosphere, although high spectral resolution and high sensitivity are needed
to measure quiet Sun chromospheric magnetic fields.

in astrophysical scenarios has become an increasingly important field. In the
crystallized crust of neutron stars the evolution of the magnetic field is
governed by the Hall induction equation. In this equation the relative
contribution of the two terms (Hall term and Ohmic dissipation) varies
depending on the local conditions of temperature and magnetic field strength.
This results in the transition from the purely parabolic character of the
equations to the hyperbolic regime as the magnetic Reynolds number increases,
which presents severe numerical problems. Up to now, most attempts to study
this problem were based on spectral methods, but they failed in representing
the transition to large magnetic Reynolds numbers. We present a new code based
on upwind finite differences techniques that can handle situations with
arbitrary low magnetic diffusivity and it is suitable for studying the
formation of sharp current sheets during the evolution. The code is thoroughly
tested in different limits and used to illustrate the evolution of the crustal
magnetic field in a neutron star in some representative cases. Our code,
coupled to cooling codes, can be used to perform long-term simulations of the
magneto-thermal evolution of neutron stars.
