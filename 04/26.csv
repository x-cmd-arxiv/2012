(RM) Synthesis can help us to identify structures of regular and turbulent
magnetic fields in extended magnetized objects, such as galaxies and galaxy
clusters. Wavelets allow us to reformulate the RM synthesis method in a
scale-dependent way and to visualize the data as a function of Faraday depth
and scale. We present observational tests to recognize magnetic field
structures. A region with a regular magnetic field generates a broad ""disk"" in
Faraday space (""Faraday spectrum""), with two ""horns"" when the distribution of
cosmic-ray electrons is broader than that of the thermal electrons. Each
magnetic field reversal generates one asymmetric ""horn"" on top of the ""disk"". A
region with a turbulent field can be recognized as a ""Faraday forest"" of many
components. These tests are applied to the spectral ranges of various synthesis
radio telescopes. We argue that the ratio of maximum to minimum wavelengths
determines the range of scales that can be identified in Faraday space. A
reliable recognition of magnetic field structures requires the analysis of data
cubes in position-position-Faraday depth space (""PPF cubes""), observed over a
wide and continuous wavelength range, allowing the recognition of a wide range
of scales as well as high resolution in Faraday space. The planned Square
Kilometre Array (SKA) will fulfill this condition and will be close to
representing a perfect ""Faraday telescope"". The combination of data from the
Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) appears to
be a promising approach for the recognition of magnetic structures on all
scales. The addition of data at intermediate frequencies from the Westerbork

structure of relativistically hot jets is studied through relativistic
hydrodynamic simulations. We emphasize the nonlinear interaction of rarefaction
waves excited at the interface between a cylindrical jet and the surrounding
medium. From simplified one-dimensional models with radial jet structure, we
find that a decrease in the relativistic pressure due to the interacting
rarefaction waves in the central zone of the jet transiently yields a more
powerful boost of the bulk jet than that expected from single rarefaction
acceleration. This leads to a cyclic in-situ energy conversion between thermal
and bulk kinetic energies which induces radial oscillating motion of the jet.
The oscillation timescale is characterized by the initial pressure ratio of the
jet to the ambient medium, and follows a simple scaling relation $\tau_{\rm
oscillation} \propto (P_{\rm jet,0}/P_{\rm amb,0})^{1/2}$. It is confirmed from
extended two-dimensional simulations that this radial oscillating motion in the
one-dimensional system manifests as modulation of the structure of the jet in a
more realistic situation where a relativistically hot jet propagates through an
ambient medium. It is found that when the ambient medium has a power law
pressure distribution, the size of the reconfinement region along the
propagation direction of the jet in the modulation structure $\lambda$ evolves
according to a self-similar relation $\lambda \propto t^{\alpha/2}$ where
$\alpha$ is the power-law index of the pressure distribution.

nearly edge-on relative to our line of sight, the observed column density is
enhanced by a factor estimated to be between 4 and 20 relative to the face-on

vortices via Rossby wave instability (RWI). However, the only numerical
evidence for this has come from alpha disk models, where the magnetic field
evolution is not followed, and the effect of turbulence is parametrized by
Laplacian viscosity. We aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in the
transition in 3D resistive-magnetohydrodynamical models. We model the
transition by a sharp jump in resistivity, as expected in the inner dead zone
boundary, using the Pencil Code to simulate the flow. We find that vortices are
readily excited in the dead side of the transition. We measure the mass
accretion rate finding similar levels of Reynolds stress at the dead and active
zones, at the $\alpha\approx 10^{-2}$ level. The vortex sits in a pressure
maximum and does not migrate, surviving until the end of the simulation. A
pressure maximum in the active zone also triggers the RWI. The magnetized
vortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto-elliptic
instabilities, yet it subsists in high resolution. This suggests that either
the parasitic modes are still numerically damped, or that the RWI supplies
vorticity faster than they can destroy it. We conclude that the resistive
transition between the active and dead zones in the inner regions of
protoplanetary disks, if sharp enough, can indeed excite vortices via RWI. Our
results lend credence to previous works that relied on the alpha-disk
approximation, and caution against the use of overly reduced azimuthal coverage
on modeling this transition.

the form of the reddening law defined by the type of dust. Here, we determine
the ratio of absolute to selective extinction (R_V) in the line of sight
towards M4, which is known to be a useful indicator for the type of dust and
therefore characterizes the applicable reddening law. Our method is independent

the dust in the line of sight to M4 for our set of filters. With this value,
the distance to M4 is found to be 1.80\pm0.05 kpc (random error). A reddening
map for M4 has been created, which reveals a spatial differential reddening of
delta E(B-V)>0.2 mag across a field within 10' around the cluster centre and a
total mean reddening of E(B-V)=0.37\pm0.01. In order to provide accurate zero
points for the extinction coefficients of our photometric filters, we
investigated the impact of stellar parameters such as temperature, surface
gravity and metallicity on the extinction properties in different bandpasses.
Using both synthetic ATLAS9 spectra and observed spectral energy distributions,
we found similar sized effects for the range of temperature, surface gravity,
and metallicity typical of globular cluster stars: each causes a change of
about 3% in the necessary correction factor for each filter combination. From
our calculations, we provide extinction zero points for Johnson-Cousins and
2MASS filters, spanning a wide range of stellar parameters and dust types,

of the transition disk object RX J1633.9-2442, which is located in the

ongoing giant planet formation. The observations were taken at 340 GHz (880
micron) with the SMA in its most extended configuration, resulting in an
angular resolution of 0.3"" (35 AU at the distance of the target). We find that
the disk is highly inclined (i ~50 deg) and has an inner cavity ~25 AU in
radius, which is clearly resolved by our observations. We simultaneously model
the entire optical to millimeter wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED)
and SMA visibilities of RX J1633.9-2442 in order to constrain the structure of
its disk. We find that an empty cavity ~25 AU in radius is inconsistent with
the excess emission observed at 12, 22, and 24 micron. Instead, the mid-IR
excess can be modeled by either a narrow, optically thick ring at ~10 AU or an
optically thin region extending from ~7 AU to ~25 AU. The inner disk (r < 5 AU)
is mostly depleted of small dust grains as attested by the lack of detectable
near-IR excess. We also present deep Keck aperture masking observations in the
near-IR, which rule out the presence of a companion up to 500 times fainter
than the primary star (in K-band) for projected separations in the 5-20 AU
range. We argue that the complex structure of the RX J1633.9-2442 disk is best
explained by multiple planets embedded within the disk. We also suggest that
the properties and incidence of objects such as RX J1633.9-2442, T Cha, and
LkCa 15 (and those of the companions recently identified to these two latter
objects) are most consistent with the runaway gas accretion phase of the core
accretion model, when giant planets gain their envelopes and suddenly become
massive enough to open wide gaps in the disk.

counter-propagating gapless modes on the edges of fractional quantum Hall
states are gapped by proximity-coupling to superconductors and ferromagnets.
The most transparent example is that of a fractional quantum spin Hall state,
in which electrons of one spin direction occupy a fractional quantum Hall state
of $\nu= 1/m$, while electrons of the opposite spin occupy a similar state with
$\nu = -1/m$. However, we also propose other examples of such systems, which
are easier to realize experimentally. We find that each interface between a
region on the edge coupled to a superconductor and a region coupled to a
ferromagnet corresponds to a non-abelian anyon of quantum dimension
$\sqrt{2m}$. We calculate the unitary transformations that are associated with
braiding of these anyons, and show that they are able to realize a richer set
of non-abelian representations of the braid group than the set realized by
non-abelian anyons based on Majorana fermions. We carry out this calculation
both explicitly and by applying general considerations. Finally, we show that
topological manipulations with these anyons cannot realize universal quantum
computation.

rectangles. Our formula specializes to give a formula counting generic
rectangulations, as analyzed by Reading in [5]. Our computations agree with [5]
as far as was calculated and extend to the non-generic case. An interesting
feature of the number of rectangulations is that it appears to have an 8-fold
periodicity modulo 2. We verify this periodicity for small values of n, but the
general result remains elusive, perhaps hinting at some unseen structure on the
space of rectangulations, analogous to Reading's discovery that generic
rectangulations are in 1-1 correspondence with a certain class of permutations.
Finally, we use discrete Morse theory to show that the space of tilings by less

of (n-1)-dimensional spheres. Combined with formulae for the number of tilings,
the exact homotopy type is computed for $n\leq 28$.

inner accretion disk provides a powerful tool for measuring the spin of
supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, AGN
spectra are often complex and careful analysis employing appropriate and
self-consistent models are required if one is to obtain robust results. In this
paper, we revisit the deep July-2009 Suzaku observation of the Seyfert galaxy
NGC3783 in order to study in a rigorous manner the robustness of the inferred
black hole spin parameter. Using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) techniques, we
identify a (partial) modeling degeneracy between the iron abundance of the disk
and the black hole spin parameter. We show that the data for NGC3783 strongly
require both supersolar iron abundance (Z_Fe=2-4Zsun) and a rapidly spinning
black hole (a>0.88). We discuss various astrophysical considerations that can
affect the measured abundance. We note that, while the abundance enhancement
inferred in NGC3783 is modest, the X-ray analysis of some other objects has
found extreme iron abundances. We introduce the hypothesis that the radiative
levitation of iron ions in the innermost regions of radiation-dominated AGN
disks can enhance the photospheric abundance of iron. We show that radiative
levitation is a plausible mechanism in the very inner regions of high accretion
rate AGN disks.

$L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$ which is anomaly free and can be gauged. The dark matter
candidate arising from this extension is a singlet of the standard model gauge
group but is charged under $L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$. Solutions to the Boltzmann
equations for relics in the presence of asymmetric dark matter are discussed.
It is shown that the ratio of the baryon asymmetry to dark matter consistent
with the current WMAP data, i.e., the cosmic coincidence, can be successfully
explained in this model with the depletion of the symmetric component of dark
matter from resonant annihilation via the Stueckelberg gauge boson. For the
extended MSSM model it is shown that one has a two component dark matter
picture with asymmetric dark matter being the dominant component and the
neutralino being the subdominant component (i.e., with relic density a small
fraction of the WMAP cold dark matter value). Remarkably, the subdominant
component can be detected in direct detection experiments such as SuperCDMS and
XENON-100. Further, it is shown that the class of Stueckelberg models with a
gauged $L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$ will produce a dramatic signature at a muon collider
with the $\sigma(\mu^+\mu^-\to \mu^+\mu^-,\tau^+\tau^-)$ showing a detectable
$Z'$ resonance while $\sigma(\mu^+\mu^-\to e^+e^-)$ is devoid of this
resonance. Asymmetric dark matter arising from a $U(1)_{B-L}$ Stueckelberg
extension is also briefly discussed. Finally, in the models we propose the
asymmetric dark matter does not oscillate and there is no danger of it being

This conclusion is supported by comparison with detailed radiative transfer

rest-frame Equivalent Width (EW0) larger than 240A, the expected limit for
Ly-alpha emission powered by Population II star formation and 12 sources among
these do not have any continuum counterpart in a deep V-band imaging of the
same field. For these, a stacking analysis indicates EW0>800A, effectively
ruling out Ly-alpha powered by internal star formation. These sources are thus
the best candidates so far for proto-galactic clouds or ""dark"" galaxies at
high-redshift, whose existence has recently been suggested by several
theoretical studies. Assuming they are mostly ionized by the quasar radiation,
we estimate that their gas masses would be about 10^9 Msun implying that their
star formation efficiencies (SFE) are less than 1.e-11 yr^-1 several times

and Leo I dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the Infrared Spectrograph on the
Spitzer Space Telescope. The spectra show significant quantities of dust around
the carbon stars in Sculptor, Fornax, and Leo I, but little in Carina. Previous
comparisons of carbon stars with similar pulsation properties in the Galaxy and
the Magellanic Clouds revealed no evidence that metallicity affected the
production of dust by carbon stars. However, the more metal-poor stars in the
current sample appear to be generating less dust. These data extend two known
trends to lower metallicities. In more metal-poor samples, the SiC dust
emission weakens, while the acetylene absorption strengthens. The bolometric
magnitudes and infrared spectral properties of the carbon stars in Fornax are
consistent with metallicities more similar to carbon stars in the Magellanic
Clouds than in the other dwarf spheroidals in our sample. A study of the carbon
budget in these stars reinforces previous considerations that the dredge-up of
sufficient quantities of carbon from the stellar cores may trigger the final
superwind phase, ending a star's lifetime on the asymptotic giant branch.

consists of BCGs that lie at the centres of massive, strong cooling flow
clusters, therefore requiring extreme mechanical feedback from their central
active galactic nucleus (AGN) to offset cooling of the intracluster plasma
(L_mech>10^44-45 erg/s). Based on the BH masses derived from the M_BH-sigma and

The Fermi surface topology extracted from the spectral function of

Since introducing iron vacancies breaks the lattice periodicity of the

changing vacancy concentration the electronic band structure evolves, leading
to a reconstruction of the Fermi surface topology. For intermediate doping
levels, the realized stable electronic structure is a compromise between the
solutions for the perfect lattice with $y=0$ and the vacancy stripe-ordered
lattice with $y=0.4$, which results in a competition between vacancy random
disorder and vacancy stripe order. A multiorbital hopping model is

match with a neighboring player. We consider the existence, computation, and
inefficiency of stable matchings from which no pair of players wants to
deviate. When the benefits from a match are the same for both players, we show
that incorporating the well-being of other players into their matching
decisions significantly decreases the price of stability, while the price of
anarchy remains unaffected. Furthermore, a good stable matching achieving the
price of stability bound always exists and can be reached in polynomial time.
We extend these results to more general matching rewards, when players matched
to each other may receive different utilities from the match. For this more
general case, we show that incorporating social context (i.e., ""caring about
your friends"") can make an even larger difference, and greatly reduce the price

physical phenomena in condensed matter systems, potentially including
high-temperature superconductivity. However, many properties of exotic strongly
correlated spin systems (e.g., spin liquids) have proved difficult to study, in
part because calculations involving N-body entanglement become intractable for
as few as N~30 particles. Feynman divined that a quantum simulator - a
special-purpose ""analog"" processor built using quantum particles (qubits) -
would be inherently adept at such problems. In the context of quantum
magnetism, a number of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this
approach. However, simulations of quantum magnetism allowing controlled,
tunable interactions between spins localized on 2D and 3D lattices of more than
a few 10's of qubits have yet to be demonstrated, owing in part to the
technical challenge of realizing large-scale qubit arrays. Here we demonstrate
a variable-range Ising-type spin-spin interaction J_ij on a naturally occurring
2D triangular crystal lattice of hundreds of spin-1/2 particles (9Be+ ions
stored in a Penning trap), a computationally relevant scale more than an order
of magnitude larger than existing experiments. We show that a spin-dependent
optical dipole force can produce an antiferromagnetic interaction J_ij ~
1/d_ij^a, where a is tunable over 0<a<3; d_ij is the distance between spin
pairs. These power-laws correspond physically to infinite-range (a=0),
Coulomb-like (a=1), monopole-dipole (a=2) and dipole-dipole (a=3) couplings.
Experimentally, we demonstrate excellent agreement with theory for 0.05<a<1.4.
This demonstration coupled with the high spin-count, excellent quantum control
and low technical complexity of the Penning trap brings within reach simulation
of interesting and otherwise computationally intractable problems in quantum
magnetism.

approximating weak solutions to fully nonlinear Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs) such as the elliptic Monge-Amp\`ere equation. The approximation theory
of Barles-Souganidis [Barles and Souganidis, Asymptotic Anal., 4 (1999)
271-283] requires that numerical schemes be monotone (or elliptic in the sense
of [Oberman, SIAM J. Numer. Anal, 44 (2006) 879-895]. But such schemes have
limited accuracy. In this article, we establish a convergence result for nearly
monotone schemes. This allows us to construct finite difference discretizations
of arbitrarily high-order. We demonstrate that the higher accuracy is achieved
when solutions are sufficiently smooth. In addition, the filtered scheme
provides a natural detection principle for singularities. We employ this
framework to construct a formally second-order scheme for the Monge-Amp\`ere
equation and present computational results on smooth and singular solutions.

data from Flames/Giraffe VLT observations of 174 massive globular clusters
(GCs) in NGC4472. No planetary nebulae (PNe) are observed in these clusters,
constraining the number of PNe per bolometric luminosity,
\alpha<0.8*10^{-7}PN/L_{\odot}. This is significantly lower than the rate
predicted from stellar evolution, if all stars produce PNe. Comparing our
results to populations of PNe in galaxies, we find most galaxies have a higher
\alpha than these GCs (more PNe per bolometric luminosity - though some massive
early-type galaxies do have similarly low \alpha). The low \alpha required in
these GCs suggests that the number of PNe per bolometric luminosity does not
increase strongly with decreasing mass or metallicity of the stellar
population. We find no evidence for correlations between the presence of known
GC PNe and either the presence of low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) or the
stellar interaction rates in the GCs. This, and the low \alpha observed,
suggests that the formation of PNe may not be enhanced in tight binary systems.
These data do identify one [OIII] emission feature, this is the (previously
published) broad [OIII] emission from the cluster RZ 2109. This emission is
thought to originate from the LMXB in this cluster, which is accreting at
super-Eddington rates. The absence of any similar [OIII] emission from the
other clusters favors the hypothesis that this source is a black hole LMXB,
rather than a neutron star LMXB with significant geometric beaming of its X-ray
emission.

relation between some objects and some attributes, and derives a lattice of
concepts, where each concept is given as a set of objects and a set of
attributes, such that the first set consists of all objects that satisfy all
attributes in the second, and vice versa. Many applications, though, provide
contexts with quantitative information, telling not just whether an object
satisfies an attribute, but also quantifying this satisfaction. Contexts in
this form arise as rating matrices in recommender systems, as occurrence
matrices in text analysis, as pixel intensity matrices in digital image
processing, etc. Such applications have attracted a lot of attention, and
several numeric extensions of FCA have been proposed. We propose the framework
of proximity sets (proxets), which subsume partially ordered sets (posets) as
well as metric spaces. One feature of this approach is that it extracts from
quantified contexts quantified concepts, and thus allows full use of the
available information. Another feature is that the categorical approach allows
analyzing any universal properties that the classical FCA and the new versions
may have, and thus provides structural guidance for aligning and combining the
approaches.

utter tetragonal-like phase (denoted as MII here) with a large c/a ratio
(~1.23). Specifically, MII phase transition process refers to the structural
evolution from a monoclinic MC structure at room temperature to a monoclinic MA
at higher temperature (150oC) and eventually to a presence of nearly tetragonal
structure above 275oC. This phase transition is further confirmed by the
piezoforce microscopy measurement, which shows the rotation of polarization
axis during the phase transition. A systematic study on structural evolution
with thickness to elucidate the impact of strain state is performed. We note
that the YAO substrate can serve as a felicitous base for growing T-like BFO
because this phase stably exists in very thick film. Thick BFO films grown on
YAO substrate exhibit a typical ""morphotropic-phase-boundary""-like feature with
coexisting multiple phases (MII, MI, and R) and a periodic stripe-like
topography. A discrepancy of arrayed stripe morphology in different direction

normalized to be in the unit interval. The n columns arrive in random order and
the goal is to set the corresponding decision variables irrevocably when they
arrive so as to obtain a feasible solution maximizing the expected reward.
Previous (1 - \epsilon)-competitive algorithms require the right-hand side of
the LP to be Omega((m/\epsilon^2) log (n/\epsilon)), a bound that worsens with
the number of columns and rows. However, the dependence on the number of
columns is not required in the single-row case and known lower bounds for the
general case are also independent of n.
  Our goal is to understand whether the dependence on n is required in the
multi-row case, making it fundamentally harder than the single-row version. We
refute this by exhibiting an algorithm which is (1 - \epsilon)-competitive as
long as the right-hand sides are Omega((m^2/\epsilon^2) log (m/\epsilon)). Our
techniques refine previous PAC-learning based approaches which interpret the
online decisions as linear classifications of the columns based on sampled dual
prices. The key ingredient of our improvement comes from a non-standard
covering argument together with the realization that only when the columns of
the LP belong to few 1-d subspaces we can obtain small such covers; bounding
the size of the cover constructed also relies on the geometry of linear
classifiers. General packing LP's are handled by perturbing the input columns,
which can be seen as making the learning problem more robust.

interface between a ferromagnetic insulator and a non-magnetic metal, in the

calculating the thermal spin transfer torque, which breaks the spin
conservation law for conduction electrons and operates the coherent magnon
state. Inhomogeneous thermal fluctuations between conduction electrons and
magnons induce a net spin current, which is pumped into the adjacent
non-magnetic metal. The pumped spin current is proportional to the temperature
difference. When the effective temperature of magnons is lower than that of
conduction electrons, localized spins lose spin angular momentum by emitting
magnons and conduction electrons flip from down to up by absorbing all the
emitted momentum, and vice versa. Magnons at the zero mode cannot contribute to
thermal spin pumping because they are eliminated by the spin-flip condition.
Consequently thermal spin pumping does not cost any kinds of applied magnetic
fields. We have discussed the distinction from the theory proposed by Xiao et

sequence of requests lying in a metric space. To process a request the server
must move to the corresponding point in the metric. The requests can be
processed slightly out of order; in particular, the server has a buffer of
capacity k which can store up to k requests as it reads in the sequence. The
goal is to reorder the requests in such a manner that the buffer constraint is
satisfied and the total travel cost of the server is minimized. The RBP arises
in many applications that require scheduling with a limited buffer capacity,
such as scheduling a disk arm in storage systems, switching colors in paint
shops of a car manufacturing plant, and rendering 3D images in computer
graphics.
  We study the offline version of RBP and develop bicriteria approximations.
When the underlying metric is a tree, we obtain a solution of cost no more than
9OPT using a buffer of capacity 4k + 1 where OPT is the cost of an optimal
solution with buffer capacity k. Constant factor approximations were known
previously only for the uniform metric (Avigdor-Elgrabli et al., 2012). Via
randomized tree embeddings, this implies an O(log n) approximation to cost and
O(1) approximation to buffer size for general metrics. Previously the best
known algorithm for arbitrary metrics by Englert et al. (2007) provided an
O(log^2 k log n) approximation without violating the buffer constraint.

$\epsilon$-close to $G(n,p)$, in the sense of total variation distance. In
particular, if $p$ is represented with $O(\log n)$-bit accuracy, then, with
high probability, the running time is linear in the expected number of edges of
the output graph (up to poly-logarithmic factors). All our running times
include the complexity of the arithmetic involved in the corresponding
algorithms. Previous standard methods for exact $G(n,p)$ sampling (see e.g.
Batagelj and Brandes, 2005) achieve similar running times, however, under the
assumption that performing real number arithmetic with arbitrary accuracy takes
constant time. We note that the actual accuracy required by these methods is
O(n)-bit per step, which results in quadratic running times.
  The main idea of our $G(n,p)$ generation algorithm is a Metropolis Markov
chain to sample $\epsilon$-close from the binomial distribution. This is a new
method for sampling from the binomial distribution: it is of separate interest
and may find other useful applications. Our analysis accounts for all necessary
bit-accuracy and arithmetic, and our running times are comparable to known
methods for exact binomial sampling.
  We further obtain efficient generation algorithms for random graphs with
given arbitrary degree distributions, Inhomogeneous Random Graphs when the
kernel function is the inner product, and Stochastic Kronecker Graphs. To the
best our knowledge, our work can be viewed as the first effort to simulate
efficient generation of graphs from classical random graph models, while taking
into account implementational considerations as fundamental computational
aspects, and quantifying the tradeoff between accuracy and running time in a
way that can be useful in practice.

properties, the source evolved from the soft-intermediate to the hard state.
Twelve days after the start of the transition towards the hard state, a
rebrightening was observed simultaneously in the optical and the infrared
bands. Spectral energy distributions (SED) were created from observations at
the start, and close to the peak of the rebrightening. The excess OIR emission
above the smooth exponential decay yields flat spectral slopes for these SEDs.
Assuming that the excess is from a compact jet, we discuss the possible

to optically thin synchrotron components. Only during the rising part of the
rebrightening, we detected fluctuations with the binary period of the system.
We discuss a scenario that includes irradiation of the disk in the intermediate

0.15-0.25 M_sun and 0.2-0.25 R_sun, respectively. We derive that the companion
had an initial mass of about 1.5 M_sun, which evolved to its current mass in
about 5-6 billion years. The system is rather compact (orbital separation of
larger than ~1.33 R_sun), and is located at a distance of 8.6+/-3.7 kpc, with a
height above the Galactic plane of 2.4+/-1.0 kpc. The characteristics of short
orbital period and high Galactic scale height are shared with two other
transient black-hole candidate X-ray binaries, i.e., XTE J1118+480 and Swift
J1735.5-0127. We suggest that all three are kicked out of the Galactic plane
into the halo, rather than being formed in a globular cluster.

strongly affected by technical and physiological artifacts. In this work,
subjects were presented seven auditory simuli in the form of English words
(first, second, third, left, right, yes, and no), and the time-locked electric
field was recorded with a 64 channel Neuroscan EEG system. We used the surface
Laplacian operator to eliminate artifacts due to sources located at regions far
from the electrode. Our intent with the Laplacian was to improve the
recognition rates of auditory stimuli from the electric field. To compute the
Laplacian, we used a spline interpolation from spherical harmonics. The EEG
Laplacian of the electric field were average over trials for the same auditory
stimulus, and with those averages we constructed prototypes and test samples.
In addition to the Laplacian, we applied Butterworth bandpass digital filters
to the averaged prototypes and test samples, and compared the filtered test
samples against the prototypes using a least squares metric in the time domain.
We also analyzed the effects of the spline interpolation order and bandpass
filter parameters in the recognition rates. Our results show that the use of
the Laplacian improves the recognition rates and suggests a spatial isomorphism
between both subjects.

pre-existing background magnetic field. We perform 2.5D compressible resistive
MHD simulations of magnetic reconnection with gravity considered. The
background magnetic field is a canopy-type configuration which is rooted at the
boundary of the solar supergranule. By changing the bottom boundary conditions
in the simulation, new magnetic flux emerges up at the center of the
supergranule and reconnects with the canopy-type magnetic field. We
successfully simulate the coronal and chromospheric microflares, whose current
sheets are located at the corona and the chromosphere, respectively. The
microflare of coronal origin has a bigger size and a higher temperature
enhancement than that of chromospheric origin. In the microflares of coronal
origin, we also found a hot jet ($\sim$$1.8 \times 10^6$ K), which is probably
related to the observational EUV/SXR jets, and a cold jet ($\sim$$10^4$ K),
which is similar to the observational H$\alpha$/Ca surges, whereas there is
only an H$\alpha$/Ca bright point in the microflares of chromospheric origin.
The study of parameter dependence shows that the size and strength of the
emerging magnetic flux are the key parameters which determine the height of the
reconnection location, and further determine the different observational
features of the microflares.

providing spelling suggestions for incorrectly spelled words in a text.
Basically, a spell checker is a computer program that uses a dictionary of
words to perform spell checking. The bigger the dictionary is, the higher is
the error detection rate. The fact that spell checkers are based on regular
dictionaries, they suffer from data sparseness problem as they cannot capture
large vocabulary of words including proper names, domain-specific terms,
technical jargons, special acronyms, and terminologies. As a result, they
exhibit low error detection rate and often fail to catch major errors in the
text. This paper proposes a new context-sensitive spelling correction method
for detecting and correcting non-word and real-word errors in digital text
documents. The approach hinges around data statistics from Google Web 1T 5-gram
data set which consists of a big volume of n-gram word sequences, extracted
from the World Wide Web. Fundamentally, the proposed method comprises an error
detector that detects misspellings, a candidate spellings generator based on a
character 2-gram model that generates correction suggestions, and an error
corrector that performs contextual error correction. Experiments conducted on a
set of text documents from different domains and containing misspellings,
showed an outstanding spelling error correction rate and a drastic reduction of
both non-word and real-word errors. In a further study, the proposed algorithm
is to be parallelized so as to lower the computational cost of the error
detection and correction processes.

simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. We analyze the
statistics and the dynamics of the perceived rate of strain tensor and
vorticity for initially regular tetrahedron of size $r_0$ from the dissipative

the perceived vorticity is also preferentially aligned with the intermediate

in time such as to align with the strongest eigendirection at $t=0$. This also
applies to the true velocity gradient. The experimental data at the higher
Reynolds number suggests the existence of a self-similar regime in the inertial

beyond the three active neutrinos and photons, often referred to as 'dark'
radiation. Light sterile neutrinos is one of the prime candidates for such
additional radiation. However, constraints on sterile neutrinos based on the
current cosmological data have been derived using simplified assumptions about
thermalisation of the sterile neutrino at the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)
epoch. These assumptions are not necessarily justified and here we solve the
full quantum kinetic equations in the (1 active + 1 sterile) scenario and
derive the number of thermalised species just before BBN begins (T~1MeV) for
null (L=0) and large (L=0.01) initial lepton asymmetry and for a range of
possible mass-mixing parameters. We find that the full thermalisation
assumption during the BBN epoch is justified for initial small lepton asymmetry
only. Partial or null thermalisation occurs when the initial lepton asymmetry
is large.

level. We identify three different categories of neutrino mass generation: (1)
finite irreducible diagrams; (2) finite extensions of the usual seesaw
mechanisms at one-loop and (3) divergent loop realizations of the seesaws. All
radiative one-loop neutrino mass models must fall into one of these classes.
Case (1) gives the leading contribution to neutrino mass naturally and a
classic example of this class is the Zee model. We demonstrate that in order to
prevent that a tree level contribution dominates in case (2), Majorana fermions
running in the loop and an additional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry are needed for a
genuinely leading one-loop contribution. In the type-II loop extensions, the
lepton number violating coupling will be generated at one loop, whereas the
type-I/III extensions can be interpreted as loop-induced inverse or linear
seesaw mechanisms. For the divergent diagrams in category (3), the tree level
contribution cannot be avoided and is in fact needed as counter term to absorb
the divergence.

behavior of PDE models described by nonlinear evolutions of hyperbolic type.
Specific examples of the models under consideration include: (i) nonlinear
systems of dynamic elasticity: von Karman systems, Berger's equations,
Kirchhoff - Boussinesq equations, nonlinear waves (ii) nonlinear flow -
structure and fluid - structure interactions, (iii) and nonlinear
thermo-elasticity. A characteristic feature of the models under consideration
is criticality or super-criticality of sources (with respect to Sobolev's
embeddings) along with super-criticality of damping mechanisms which, in
addition, may be also geometrically constrained.
  Our aim is to present several methods relying on cancelations, harmonic
analysis and geometric analysis, which enable to handle criticality and also
super-criticality in both sources and the damping of the underlined nonlinear
PDE. It turns out that if carefully analyzed the nonlinearity can be taken
""advantage of"" in order to produce implementable damping mechanism.
  Another goal of these lectures is the understanding of control mechanisms
which are geometrically constrained. The final task boils down to showing that
appropriately damped system is ""quasi-stable"" in the sense that any two
trajectories approach each other exponentially fast up to a compact term which
can grow in time. Showing this property- formulated as quasi-stability estimate
-is the key and technically demanding issue that requires suitable tools. These
include: weighted energy inequalities, compensated compactness, Carleman's
estimates and some elements of microlocal analysis.

of the northern hemisphere and east Asia. Only weak biases are found for the

outflows have recently been revealed in some AGN hosts. However, the physical
properties and structure of these AGN-driven molecular outflows are still
poorly constrained. Here we present new IRAM PdBI observations of Mrk231, the
closest quasar known, targeting both the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) transitions. We
detect broad wings in both transitions, tracing a massive molecular outflow
with velocities up to 800 km/s. The wings are spatially resolved at high
significance level (5-11 sigma), indicating that the molecular outflow extends
on the kpc scale. The CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio of the red broad wings is
consistent with the ratio observed in the narrow core, while the blue broad
wing is less excited than the core. The latter result suggests that quasar
driven outflow models invoking shocks (which would predict higher gas
excitation) are not appropriate to describe the bulk of the outflow in Mrk231.
However, we note that within the central 700 pc the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio of
the red wing is slightly, but significantly, higher than in the line core,
suggesting that shocks may play a role in the central region. We also find that
the average size of the outflow anticorrelates with the critical density of the
transition used as a wind tracer. This indicates that, although diffuse and
dense clumps coexist in the outflowing gas, dense outflowing clouds have
shorter lifetime and that they evaporate into the diffuse component along the
outflow or, more simply, that diffuse clouds are more efficiently accelerated
to larger distances by radiation pressure.

the role of the exchange symmetry for the dynamics with a mixture of two

governed by an isospecific interaction and external potential. In the
mean-field limit, the spatial population imbalance of the mixture can be
described by the dynamics of a single species in an effective potential with
modified properties or, equivalently, with an effective total particle number.
The oscillation behavior can be tuned by populating the second species while
maintaining the spatial population imbalance and all other parameters constant.
In the corresponding many-body approach, the single-species description
approximates the full counting statistics well also outside the realm of
spin-coherent states. The method is extended to general Bose-Hubbard systems
and to their classical mean-field limits, which suggests an effective
single-species description of multicomponent Bose gases with weakly
an-isospecific interactions.

EPIC and RGS spectra obtained from the ""least-variable"" intervals with a model
consisting of disc-blackbody and blackbody components together with a Gaussian
emission feature at ~6.55-6.7 keV modified by absorption due to cold and
photo-ionised material. We found a significant correlation between the hard,
~6-10 keV, flux, the ionisation and column density of the absorber and the
equivalent width of the broad iron line. We interpret the correlation in a
scenario in which a disc wind is thermally driven at large, ~10^{10} cm, radii
and the broad line results from reprocessed emission in the wind and/or hot
atmosphere. The breadth of the emission line is naturally explained by a
combination of scattering, recombination and fluorescence processes. We
attribute the variations in the absorption and emission along the orbital
period to the view of different parts of the wind, possibly located at slightly
different inclination angles. We constrain the inclination of GX 13+1 to be
between 60 and 80 degrees from the presence of strong absorption in the line of
sight, that obscures up to 80% of the total emission in one observation, and
the absence of eclipses. We conclude that the presence of a disc wind and/or a

broad iron emission features in neutron star low mass X-ray binaries as a
class.

skutterudite structure compound CoSb$_3$ displays a unique band structure with
a topological transition versus a symmetry-preserving sublattice (Sb)
displacement very near the structural ground state. The transition is through a
massless Dirac-Weyl semimetal, point Fermi surface phase which is unique in
that (1) it appears in a three dimensional crystal, (2) the band critical point
occurs at $k$=0, and (3) linear bands are degenerate with conventional
(massive) bands at the critical point (before inclusion of spin-orbit
coupling). Further interest arises because the critical point separates a
conventional (trivial) phase from a topological phase. In the native cubic
structure this is a zero-gap topological semimetal; we show how spin-orbit
coupling and uniaxial strain converts the system to a topological insulator
(TI). We also analyze the origin of the linear band in this class of materials,
which is the characteristic that makes them potentially useful in
thermoelectric applications or possibly as transparent conductors. We
characterize the formal charge as Co$^{+}$ $d^8$, consistent with the gap, with
its $\bar{3}$ site symmetry, and with its lack of moment. The Sb states are
characterized as $p_x$ (separately, $p_y$) $\sigma$-bonded $Sb_4$ ring states
occupied and the corresponding antibonding states empty. The remaining
(locally) $p_z$ orbitals form molecular orbitals with definite parity centered
on the empty $2a$ site in the skutterudite structure. Eight such orbitals must
be occupied; the one giving the linear band is an odd orbital singlet $A_{2u}$
at the zone center. We observe that the provocative linearity of the band
within the gap is a consequence of the aforementioned near-degeneracy, which is
also responsible for the small band gap.

Most straightforward is the method of complex amplitudes, which is often used
in the planetary science. Another method, employed both in planetary science
and astrophysics, is based on decomposition of each harmonic of the tide into
two bulges oriented orthogonally to one another.
  We prove that the two methods are equivalent. Specifically, we demonstrate
that the two-bulge method is not a separate approximation, but ensues directly
from the Fourier expansion of a linear tidal theory equipped with an arbitrary
rheological model involving a departure from elasticity. To this end, we use
the most general mathematical formalism applicable to linear bodily tides. To
express the tidal amendment to the potential of the perturbed primary, we act
on the tide-raising potential of the perturbing secondary with a convolution
operator. This enables us to interconnect a complex Fourier component of the
tidally generated potential of the perturbed primary with the appropriate
complex Fourier component of the tide-raising potential of the secondary. Then
we demonstrate how this interrelation entails the two-bulge description.
  While less economical mathematically, the two-bulge approach has a good
illustrative power, and may be employed on a par with a more concise method of
complex amplitudes. At the same time, there exist situations where the
two-bulge method becomes more practical for technical calculations.

This correction is done in parallel over many subintervals, thereby reducing

to the full microscopic solution (when the parareal iterations proceed) only if
special care is taken during the coupling of the microscopic and macroscopic

power spectrum is of order -2 \mu K^2 at ell=3000, however, this value is

modelling uncertainties. We expect the large uncertainty in this component to
degrade upper limits on the kinematic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect (kSZ), due to
similarity in the frequency dependence of the tSZ x CIB and kSZ across the
frequency range probed by current Cosmic Microwave Background missions. We also
find that the degree of tSZ x CIB correlation is higher for mm x sub-mm spectra

lattices. When the asymmetry degree is appropriate, even exponential decay may
arise. This fact suggests that the power-law decay predicted by the
hydrodynamics may not be applied to the lattices with asymmetric inter-particle
interactions, and as a result, the Green-Kubo formula may instead lead to a
convergent heat conductivity in the thermodynamic limit. The mechanism of the
rapid decay is traced back to the fact that the heat current has to drive a
mass current additionally in the presence of the asymmetric inter-particle
interactions.

collective pinning, originating from spatial variations of the charge carrier
mean free path ($\delta l$ pinning), rules in this superconductor. Our results
are compatible with the nanoscale phase separation observed on this compound
and indicate that in spite of the chemical inhomogeneity spatial fluctuations
of the critical temperature are not important for pinning. A power law
dependence of the magnetization vs time, generally interpreted as signature of
single vortex creep regime, is observed in magnetic fields up to $8 ~ T$. For
magnetic fields applied along the c axis of the crystal the magnetization
curves exhibit a clear peak effect whose position shifts when varying the
temperature, following the same dependence as observed in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. The time and temperature dependence of the peak
position has been investigated. We observe that the occurrence of the peak at a
given magnetic field determines a specific vortex configuration that is
independent on the temperature. This result indicates that the influence of the
temperature on the vortex-vortex and vortex-defect interactions leading to the
peak effect in FeTe$_{0.7}$Se$_{0.3}$ is negligible in the explored range of
temperatures.

consumes a significant amount of cellular resources. Despite existence of
multiple mathematical models of translation, varying in the level of
mechanistical details, surprisingly, there is no basic and simple chemical
kinetic model of this process, derived directly from the detailed kinetic
model. One of the reasons for this is that the translation process is
characterized by indefinite number of states, thanks to existence of polysomes.
We bypass this difficulty by applying a trick consisting in lumping multiple
states of translated mRNA into few dynamical variables and by introducing a
variable describing the pool of translating ribosomes. The simplest model can
be solved analytically under some assumptions. The basic and simple model can
be extended, if necessary, to take into account various phenomena such as the
interaction between translating ribosomes, limited amount of ribosomal units or
regulation of translation by microRNA. The model can be used as a building
block (translation module) for more complex models of cellular processes. We
demonstrate the utility of the model in two examples. First, we determine the
critical parameters of the single protein synthesis for the case when the
ribosomal units are abundant. Second, we demonstrate intrinsic bi-stability in
the dynamics of the ribosomal protein turnover and predict that a minimal
number of ribosomes should pre-exists in a living cell to sustain its protein
synthesis machinery, even in the absence of proliferation.

confront them with present LHC data. We show that the current signals observed

mixed states (the $\phi$ and the $h$), although with a severely restricted
parameter space. In particular, the radion interaction scale must be quite low,
Lambda_\phi ~ 1-1.3 TeV. If m_\phi ~ 125 GeV, the $h$ state must be heavier
(m_h>320 GeV). If m_h ~ 125 GeV, the $\phi$ state must be quite light or close

body in flat space on large scales, excluding all standard quantum and
gravitational degrees of freedom. The model is based on standard quantum spin
commutators, with operators interpreted as positions instead of spin, and a
Planck-scale length $\ell_P$ in place of Planck's constant $\hbar$. The algebra
is used to derive a new quantum geometrical uncertainty in direction, with
variance given by $\langle \Delta \theta^2\rangle = \ell_P/L$ at separation
$L$, that dominates over standard quantum position uncertainty for bodies
greater than the Planck mass. The system is discrete and holographic, and
agrees with gravitational entropy if the commutator coefficient takes the exact
value $\ell_P= l_P/\sqrt{4\pi}$, where $l_P\equiv \sqrt{\hbar G/c^3}$ denotes
the standard Planck length. A physical interpretation is proposed that connects
the operators with properties of classical position in the macroscopic limit:
Approximate locality and causality emerge in macroscopic systems if position
states of multiple bodies are entangled by proximity. This interpretation
predicts coherent directional fluctuations with variance $\langle \Delta
\theta^2\rangle $ on timescale $\tau \approx L/c$ that lead to precisely
predictable correlations in signals between adjacent interferometers. It is
argued that such a signal could provide compelling evidence of Planck scale
quantum geometry, even in the absence of a complete dynamical or fundamental
theory.

Of particular interest are matrices with the restricted isometry property

sufficiently sparse signals, but the deterministic construction of such
matrices has proven very difficult. In this thesis, we discuss this matrix
design problem in the context of a growing field of study known as frame

as well as their utility in other aspects of sparse signal processing. In
Chapter 3, we pave the road to deterministic RIP matrices, evaluating various
techniques to demonstrate RIP, and making interesting connections with graph
theory and number theory. We conclude in Chapter 4 with a coherence-based
alternative to RIP, which provides near-optimal probabilistic guarantees for
various aspects of sparse signal processing while at the same time admitting a

response to heating variations, with the key parameter being the ratio of
transition region to coronal radiation. We develop new models for this

quantum theories (BGQT) are generalisations of quantum theory, inspired by
Bell's concept of beables. They modify the quantum probabilities for some
specified set of fundamental events, histories, or other elements of
quasiclassical reality by probability laws that depend on the realised
configuration of beables. For example, they may define an additional
probability weight factor for a beable configuration, independent of the
quantum dynamics.
  BGQT can be fitted to observational data to provide foils against which to
compare explanations based on standard quantum theory. For example, a BGQT
could, in principle, characterise the effects attributed to dark energy or dark
matter, or any other deviation from the predictions of standard quantum
dynamics, without introducing extra fields or a cosmological constant. The
complexity of the beable-guided theory would then parametrise how far we are
from a standard quantum explanation.
  Less conservatively, we give reasons for taking suitably simple beable-guided
quantum theories as serious phenomenological theories in their own right. Among
these are that cosmological models defined by BGQT might in fact fit the
empirical data better than any standard quantum explanation, and that BGQT
suggest potentially interesting non-standard ways of coupling quantum matter to
gravity.

X-ray-luminous point sources at the central stars (CSPNe) of these objects.
Combining these results with those obtained from Chandra archival data for all
(14) other PNe within ~1.5 kpc that have been observed to date, we find an
overall X-ray detection rate of ~70%. Roughly 50% of the PNe observed by
Chandra harbor X-ray-luminous CSPNe, while soft, diffuse X-ray emission tracing
shocks formed by energetic wind collisions is detected in ~30%; five objects
display both diffuse and point-like emission components. The presence of X-ray
sources appears correlated with PN density structure, in that molecule-poor,
elliptical nebulae are more likely to display X-ray emission (either point-like
or diffuse) than molecule-rich, bipolar or Ring-like nebulae. All but one of
the X-ray point sources detected at CSPNe display X-ray spectra that are harder
than expected from hot (~100 kK) central star photospheres, possibly indicating
a high frequency of binary companions to CSPNe. Other potential explanations
include self-shocking winds or PN mass fallback. Most PNe detected as diffuse
X-ray sources are elliptical nebulae that display a nested shell/halo structure
and bright ansae; the diffuse X-ray emission regions are confined within inner,
sharp-rimmed shells. All sample PNe that display diffuse X-ray emission have
inner shell dynamical ages <~5x10^3 yr, placing firm constraints on the
timescale for strong shocks due to wind interactions in PNe.
