unparalleled precision how similar is to the Sun in its physical properties,

  We perform a differential abundance analysis (both in LTE and NLTE) using

HIP 56948. We use precise radial velocity data from the McDonald and Keck

  We achieve a precision of sigma = 0.003 dex for several elements. Including
errors in stellar parameters the total uncertainty is as low as sigma = 0.005
dex (1 %), which is unprecedented in elemental abundance studies.
  The similarities between HIP 56948 and the Sun are astonishing. HIP 56948 is
only 17+/-7 K hotter than the Sun, and log g, [Fe/H] and microturbulence are
only +0.02+/-0.02 dex, +0.02+/-0.01 dex and +0.01+/-0.01 km/s higher than
solar, respectively. HIP 56948 has a mass of 1.02+/-0.02M_Sun and is 1 Gyr
younger than the Sun. Both stars show a chemical abundance pattern that differs
from most solar twins. The trend with T_cond in differential abundances (twins

  We conclude that HIP 56948 is an excellent candidate to host a planetary
system like our own, including the possible presence of inner terrestrial
planets. Its striking similarity to the Sun and its mature age makes HIP 56948
a prime target in the quest for other Earths and SETI endeavors.

adding only one receive antenna, this penalty can be reduced to 1/L and can,
hence, be made to vanish in the large-L limit, even if Q/L remains constant as

the transmit signal induces enough statistical dependence between the

resolve the uncertainty associated with the first receive antenna's channel and

enhancement in abundance over photospheric values of Fe and other elements with
first ionization potential below about 10 eV observed in the solar corona and
slow speed solar wind. In our model, this fractionation is achieved by means of
the ponderomotive force, arising as Alfv\'en waves propagate through or reflect
from steep density gradients in the solar chromosphere. This is also the region
where low FIP elements are ionized, and high FIP elements are largely neutral
leading to the fractionation as ions interact with the waves but neutrals do
not. Helium, the element with the highest FIP and consequently the last to
remain neutral as one moves upwards can be depleted in such models. Here, we
investigate this depletion for varying loop lengths and magnetic field
strengths.
  Variations in this depletion arise as the concentration of the ponderomotive
force at the top of the chromosphere varies in response to Alfv\'en wave
frequency with respect to the resonant frequency of the overlying coronal loop,
the magnetic field, and possibly also the loop length. We find that stronger
depletions of He are obtained for weaker magnetic field, at frequencies close
to or just above the loop resonance. These results may have relevance to
observed variations of the slow wind solar He abundance with wind speed, with
slower slow speed solar wind having a stronger depletion of He.

field. While stationary Aharonov-Bohm modes represent Bessel beams with flux-
and vortex-dependent probability distributions, stationary Landau states
manifest themselves as non-diffracting Laguerre-Gaussian beams. Furthermore,
the Landau-state beams possess field- and vortex-dependent phases: (i) the
Zeeman phase from coupling the quantized angular momentum to the magnetic field
and (ii) the Gouy phase, known from optical Laguerre-Gaussian beams.
Remarkably, together these phases determine the structure of Landau energy
levels. This unified Zeeman-Landau-Gouy phase manifests itself in a nontrivial
evolution of images formed by various superpositions of modes. We demonstrate
that, depending on the chosen superposition, the image can rotate in a magnetic
field with either (i) Larmor, (ii) cyclotron (double-Larmor), or (iii) zero
frequency. At the same time, its centroid always follows the classical
cyclotron trajectory, in agreement with the Ehrenfest theorem. Remarkably, the
non-rotating superpositions reproduce stable multi-vortex configurations that
appear in rotating superfluids. Our results open up an avenue for the direct

is one of a number of possible mechanisms considered that could explain the
change in period, but the mass transfer rate would be significantly lower than
previous estimates. We found evidence that suggests the period was changing in
a cyclical manner, but we do not have sufficient data to make a judgement on
the mechanism causing this variation. The existence of a hotspot suggests mass
transfer with a corresponding increase in the amplitude in the B band as
compared with the R and V bands. The chromospheric activity implied by the
starspots make this binary a very likely X-ray source.

enough, we are not able to offer any alternative to the model. Physical

non-thermal cosmological history before primordial nucleosynthesis, a scale of
supersymmetry breaking which is ""high"" as in gravity mediation, scalar
superpartners too heavy to be produced at the LHC (although gluino production
is expected in many cases), and a significant fraction of dark matter in the

online reviews. Accordingly, there has been growing concern about the potential
for posting ""deceptive opinion spam"" -- fictitious reviews that have been
deliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the reader. But while this
practice has received considerable public attention and concern, relatively
little is known about the actual prevalence, or rate, of deception in online
review communities, and less still about the factors that influence it.
  We propose a generative model of deception which, in conjunction with a
deception classifier, we use to explore the prevalence of deception in six
popular online review communities: Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline,
TripAdvisor, and Yelp. We additionally propose a theoretical model of online
reviews based on economic signaling theory, in which consumer reviews diminish
the inherent information asymmetry between consumers and producers, by acting
as a signal to a product's true, unknown quality. We find that deceptive
opinion spam is a growing problem overall, but with different growth rates
across communities. These rates, we argue, are driven by the different
signaling costs associated with deception for each review community, e.g.,
posting requirements. When measures are taken to increase signaling cost, e.g.,

$q\colon \mathrm{Pic}^{0}_{X/S}\to J$ which extends the biduality isomorphism

construction that recalls Serre's work on local class field theory. Furthermore
we interpret our results in relation to Shafarevich's duality theory for
torsors under abelian varieties.

data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated

  published in JHEP",,"10.1007/JHEP07(2012)015",,"hep-ph astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that the dark matter (DM) could be a light composite scalar $\eta$,
emerging from a TeV-scale strongly-coupled sector as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone
boson (pNGB). Such state arises naturally in scenarios where the Higgs is also
a composite pNGB, as in $O(6)/O(5)$ models, which are particularly predictive,
since the low-energy interactions of $\eta$ are determined by symmetry
considerations. We identify the region of parameters where $\eta$ has the
required DM relic density, satisfying at the same time the constraints from
Higgs searches at the LHC, as well as DM direct searches. Compositeness, in
addition to justify the lightness of the scalars, can enhance the DM scattering
rates and lead to an excellent discovery prospect for the near future. For a
Higgs mass $m_h\simeq 125$ GeV and a pNGB characteristic scale $f \lesssim 1$
TeV, we find that the DM mass is either $m_\eta \simeq 50-70$ GeV, with DM
annihilations driven by the Higgs resonance, or in the range 100-500 GeV, where
the DM derivative interaction with the Higgs becomes dominant. In the former
case the invisible Higgs decay to two DM particles could weaken the LHC Higgs
signal.

Salehi","Performance-Optimum Superscalar Architecture for Embedded Applications",,"http://indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx 2012",,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Embedded applications are widely used in portable devices such as wireless
phones, personal digital assistants, laptops, etc. High throughput and real
time requirements are especially important in such data-intensive tasks.
Therefore, architectures that provide the required performance are the most
desirable. On the other hand, processor performance is severely related to the
average memory access delay, number of processor registers and also size of the
instruction window and superscalar parameters. Therefore, cache, register file
and superscalar parameters are the major architectural concerns in designing a
superscalar architecture for embedded processors. Although increasing cache and
register file size leads to performance improvements in high performance
embedded processors, the increased area, power consumption and memory delay are
the overheads of these techniques. This paper explores the effect of cache,
register file and superscalar parameters on the processor performance to
specify the optimum size of these parameters for embedded applications.
Experimental results show that although having bigger size of these parameters
is one of the performance improvement approaches in embedded processors,
however, by increasing the size of some parameters over a threshold value,
performance improvement is saturated and especially in cache size, increments
over this threshold value decrease the performance.

boundary condition within the framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The
proposed governing equations derived from the fundamental equation of classical
thermodynamics using the local equilibrium hypothesis display more complex
connection between heat and non-convective mass fluxes than what has been
presented in the previous research works. Numerical computations, performed
using an explicit finite difference scheme, indicate that the model is able to
capture the effect of thermal diffusion in polymer solutions. This effect
manifests itself as an increase in local concentration of solvent near warm

a short period during the maximum phase. (iv) The rush-to-the-pole phenomenon

the central engine. The AGN-heated dust distributions turn out to be very
compact with sizes on scales of about a parsec in the mid-infrared. Only
infrared interferometry currently provides the necessary angular resolution to
directly study the physical properties of this dust. Size estimates for the
dust distributions derived from interferometric observations can be used to
construct a size--luminosity relation for the dust distributions. The large
scatter about this relation suggests significant differences between the dust
tori in the individual galaxies, even for nuclei of the same class of objects

dusty doughnut in all AGN. The Circinus galaxy is the closest Seyfert 2 galaxy.
Because its mid-infrared emission is well resolved interferometrically, it is a
prime target for detailed studies of its nuclear dust distribution. An
extensive new interferometric data set was obtained for this galaxy. It shows
that the dust emission comes from a very dense, disk-like structure which is
surrounded by a geometrically thick, similarly warm dust distribution as well
as significant amounts of warm dust within the ionisation cone.

growth rate follows remarkably similar trends with M* and redshift as the
average star-formation rates (SFRs) of their host galaxies (i.e., (i.e.,
dM_BH/dt ~ M*^(0.86+/-0.39) for the z~1 sample and dM_BH/dt ~ M*^(1.05+/-0.36)

(a) flat with respect to M* (b) not evolving with redshift and (c) close to the
ratio required to maintain/establish a SMBH to M* ratio of ~10^{-3} as also
inferred from today's M_BH-M_bulge relationship. We interpret this as evidence
that SMBHs have, on average, grown in-step with their host galaxies since at
least z~2, irrespective of host galaxy mass and AGN triggering mechanism. As
such, we suggest that the same secular processes that drive the bulk of star
formation are also responsible for the majority of SMBH growth. From this, we
speculate that it is the availability of gas reservoirs that regulate both
cosmological SMBH growth and star formation.

150,000 early-type galaxies from SDSS/DR7 to place constraints on the stellar
initial mass function (IMF) and dark halo response to galaxy formation. We
build LCDM based mass models that reproduce, by construction, the relations
between galaxy size, light concentration and stellar mass, and use the
spherical Jeans equations to predict \sigma_ap. Given our model assumptions
(including those in the stellar population synthesis models), we find that
reproducing the median \sigma_ap vs M_sps relation is not possible with {\it
both} a universal IMF and a universal dark halo response. Significant
departures from a universal IMF and/or dark halo response are required, but
there is a degeneracy between these two solutions. We show that this degeneracy
can be broken using the strength of the correlation between residuals of the
velocity-mass (\Delta log \sigma_ap) and size-mass (\Delta log R_e) relations.
The slope of this correlation, d_vr \equiv \Delta log \sigma_ap/\Delta log R_e,
varies systematically with galaxy mass from d_vr \simeq -0.45 at M_sps \sim
10^{10}M_sun, to d_vr \simeq -0.15 at M_sps \sim 10^{11.6} M_sun. The virial
fundamental plane (FP) has d_vr=-1/2, and thus we find the tilt of the observed
FP is mass dependent. Reproducing this tilt requires {\it both} a non-universal

analysis of the RGS data, we detect absorption lines originating from a warm
absorber consisting of two distinct phases of ionisation, with log xi ~ 3.2 and
2.3 respectively. The higher-ionised component has a larger column density and
outflow velocity (N_H ~ 1.6 x 10^22 cm^-2, v ~ -1100 km/s) than the
lower-ionised component (N_H ~ 0.5 x 10^22 cm^-2, v ~ -700 km/s). The shape of
the optical-UV continuum and the large Balmer decrement (H_alpha/H_beta ~ 8)
indicate significant amount of reddening is taking place in our line of sight
in the host galaxy of the AGN; however, the X-ray spectrum is not absorbed by
cold neutral gas intrinsic to the source. We discuss different explanations for
this discrepancy between the reddening and the X-ray absorption, and suggest
that the most likely solution is a dusty warm absorber. We show that dust can
exist in the lower-ionised phase of the warm absorber, which causes the
observed reddening of the optical-UV emission, whereas the X-rays remain
unabsorbed due to lack of cold neutral gas in the ionised warm absorber.
Furthermore, we have investigated the uncertainties in the construction of the
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of this object due to obscuration of the
nuclear source and the effects this has on the photoionisation modelling of the
warm absorber. We show how the assumed SEDs influence the thermal stability of
each phase and whether or not the two absorber phases in ESO 113-G010 can

serve as a probe into the influence of large scale environment on a galaxy's
evolution, while keeping the local density fixed at high values. We find that
the star formation rates (SFRs) of star forming galaxies in compact groups are
significantly different between isolated and embedded systems. Galaxies in
isolated systems show significantly enhanced SFR, relative to a control sample
matched in mass and redshift, a trend not seen in the embedded systems.

small in magnitude relative to the apparent influence of local scale effects

non-zero. We find no significant change in the gas-phase interstellar
metallicity for either the isolated or embedded compact group sample relative
to their controls. However, simulated samples that include artificial offsets

simulating spectra which mimic typical spectral shapes in order to find the
maximum detectability expected at different count levels. We then apply a
correction to the observed percentages found for the Scott et al. (2011) sample

mean temperature kT and blackbody to power-law normalisation ratio consistent
with those of components detected in individual high count spectra. Cold
absorption with nH values broadly consistent with those reported in individual

reconstructing the history of the expansion rate and dark energy using Gaussian
Processes, which is a fully Bayesian approach for smoothing data. We present a
pedagogical introduction to Gaussian Processes, and discuss how it can be used
to robustly differentiate data in a suitable way. Using this method we show
that the Dark Energy Survey - Supernova Survey (DES) can accurately recover a
slowly evolving equation of state to sigma_w = +-0.04 (95% CL) at z=0 and +-0.2
at z=0.7, with a minimum error of +-0.015 at the sweet-spot at z~0.14, provided
the other parameters of the model are known. Errors on the expansion history
are an order of magnitude smaller, yet make no assumptions about dark energy

the context of both nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance.
Until recently, theoretical models have employed phenomenological stochastic
descriptions of the bath-induced noise. During the last few years, cluster
expansion methods have provided a microscopic, quantum theory to study the
spectral diffusion of a central spin. These methods have proven to be very
accurate and efficient for problems of nuclear-induced electron spin
decoherence in which hyperfine interactions with the central electron spin are
much stronger than dipolar interactions among the nuclei. We provide an
in-depth study of central spin decoherence for a canonical scale-invariant
all-dipolar spin system. We show how cluster methods may be adapted to treat
this problem in which central and bath spin interactions are of comparable
strength. Our extensive numerical work shows that a properly modified cluster
theory is convergent for this problem even as simple perturbative arguments
begin to break down. By treating clusters in the presence of energy detunings
due to the long-range (diagonal) dipolar interactions of the surrounding
environment and carefully averaging the effects over different spin states, we
find that the nontrivial flip-flop dynamics among the spins becomes effectively
localized by disorder in the energy splittings of the spins. This localization
effect allows for a robust calculation of the spin echo signal in a dipolarly
coupled bath of spins of the same kind, while considering clusters of no more
than 6 spins. We connect these microscopic calculation results to the existing
stochastic models. We, furthermore, present calculations for a series of
related problems of interest for candidate solid state quantum bits including
donors and quantum dots in silicon as well as nitrogen-vacancy centers in

of GMCs through star-forming cores to explore how the pre-stellar core mass
function (CMF) and, by extrapolation, stellar initial mass function (IMF)
should depend on both local and galactic properties. If the ISM is
supersonically turbulent, the statistical properties of the density field
follow from the turbulent velocity spectrum, and the excursion set formalism
can be applied to analytically calculate the mass function of collapsing cores
on the smallest scales on which they are self-gravitating (non-fragmenting).
Two parameters determine the model: the disk-scale Mach number M_h (which sets
the shape of the CMF), and the absolute velocity (to assign an absolute scale).
For 'normal' variation in disk properties and core gas temperatures in the MW
and local galaxies, there is almost no variation in the predicted high-mass
behavior of the CMF/IMF. The slope is always close to Salpeter down to <1
M_sun. We predict modest variation in the sub-solar regime, mostly from
variation in M_h, but within the observed scatter in sub-solar IMFs in local
regions. For fixed galaxy properties, there is little variation in shape or
'upper mass limit' with parent GMC mass. However, in extreme starbursts (e.g.
ULIRGs) we predict a bottom-heavy CMF. This agrees with the IMF inferred for
the centers of Virgo ellipticals, believed to form in such a nuclear starburst.
The CMF is bottom heavy despite the gas temperature being an order of magnitude
larger, because M_h is also much larger. Larger M_h values make the 'parent'
cloud mass (turbulent Jeans mass) larger, but promote fragmentation to smaller
scales; this steepens the slope of the low-mass CMF and shifts the turnover
mass. The model may predict a top-heavy CMF for the sub-pc disks around Sgr A*,
but the relevant input parameters are uncertain.

weighted graphs. Starting with the flooding adjunction, we introduce the
flooding graphs, for which node and edge weights may be deduced one from the
other. Each node weighted or edge weighted graph may be transformed in a
flooding graph, showing that there is no superiority in using one or the other,
both being equivalent. We then introduce pruning operators extract subgraphs of
increasing steepness. For an increasing steepness, the number of never
ascending paths becomes smaller and smaller. This reduces the watershed zone,
where catchment basins overlap. A last pruning operator called scissor
associates to each node outside the regional minima one and only one edge. The
catchment basins of this new graph do not overlap and form a watershed
partition. Again, with an increasing steepness, the number of distinct
watershed partitions contained in a graph becomes smaller and smaller.
Ultimately, for natural image, an infinite steepness leads to a unique
solution, as it is not likely that two absolutely identical non ascending paths
of infinite steepness connect a node with two distinct minima. It happens that
non ascending paths of a given steepness are the geodesics of lexicographic
distance functions of a given depth. This permits to extract the watershed
partitions as skeletons by zone of influence of the minima for such
lexicographic distances. The waterfall hierarchy is obtained by a sequence of
operations. The first constructs the minimum spanning forest which spans an
initial watershed partition. The contraction of the trees into one node
produces a reduced graph which may be submitted to the same treatment. The
process is iterated until only one region remains. The union of the edges of
all forests produced constitutes a minimum spanning tree of the initial graph.

Gunn-Peterson (GP) damping wing, indicating a substantial mean neutral hydrogen
fraction (x_HI > 0.03) in the z ~ 6 intergalactic medium (IGM). However,
previous analyses assumed that the IGM was uniformly ionized outside of the
quasar's HII region. Here we relax this assumption and model patchy
reionization scenarios for a range of IGM and quasar parameters. We quantify
the impact of these differences on the inferred x_HI, by fitting the spectra of
three quasars: SDSS J1148+5251 (z=6.419), J1030+0524 (z=6.308), and J1623+3112
(z=6.247). We find that the best-fit values of x_HI in the patchy models agree
well with the uniform case. More importantly, we confirm that the observed
spectra favor the presence of a GP damping wing, with peak likelihoods
decreasing by factors of > few - 10 when the spectra are modeled without a
damping wing. We also find that the Ly alpha absorption spectra, by themselves,
cannot distinguish the damping wing in a relatively neutral IGM from a damping
wing in a highly ionized IGM, caused either by an isolated neutral patch, or by
a damped Ly alpha absorber (DLA). However, neutral patches in a highly ionized
universe (x_HI < 0.01), and DLAs with the large required column densities (N_HI
> few x 10^{20} cm^{-2}) are both rare. As a result, when we include reasonable
prior probabilities for the line of sight (LOS) to intercept either a neutral
patch or a DLA at the required distance of ~ 40-60 comoving Mpc away from the
quasar, we find strong lower limits on the neutral fraction in the IGM, x_HI >
0.1 (at 95% confidence). This strengthens earlier claims that a substantial
global fraction of hydrogen in the z~6 IGM is in neutral form.

of many embedded systems. The design of controllers uses the theory of
dynamical systems to construct a mathematical control law that ensures that the
controlled system has certain properties, such as asymptotic convergence to an
equilibrium point, while optimizing some performance criteria. However, owing
to quantization errors arising from the use of fixed-point arithmetic, the
implementation of this control law can only guarantee practical stability:
under the actions of the implementation, the trajectories of the controlled
system converge to a bounded set around the equilibrium point, and the size of
the bounded set is proportional to the error in the implementation. The problem
of verifying whether a controller implementation achieves practical stability
for a given bounded set has been studied before. In this paper, we change the
emphasis from verification to automatic synthesis. Using synthesis, the need
for formal verification can be considerably reduced thereby reducing the design
time as well as design cost of embedded control software.
  We give a methodology and a tool to synthesize embedded control software that
is Pareto optimal w.r.t. both performance criteria and practical stability
regions. Our technique is a combination of static analysis to estimate
quantization errors for specific controller implementations and stochastic
local search over the space of possible controllers using particle swarm
optimization. The effectiveness of our technique is illustrated using examples
of various standard control systems: in most examples, we achieve controllers
with close LQR-LQG performance but with implementation errors, hence regions of
practical stability, several times as small.

$S(\alpha, \Delta)$ is continuous for $ \Delta < \Delta_B = 0.95 \pm 0.01$ on
the degeneracy line $\alpha_1(\Delta)$. The gs has staggered magnetization
between $\Delta_A = 0.72$ and $\Delta_B$, and a BOW for $\Delta < \Delta_A$.
When both inversion and spin parity are reversed at $\gamma_m$, the correlation
functions $C(p)$ for spins separated by $p$ sites are identical. $C(p)$ minima
are shifted by $\pi/2$ from the minima of VC order parameters at separation
$p$, consistent with right and left-handed helices along the z axis and spins

parameters along the line $\alpha_1(\Delta)$.

economical phenomena where adaptive agents compete for a limited resource, and
it finds applications in statistical and nonlinear physics as well. In the
traditional MG model, agents are assumed to have access to global information
about the past history of the underlying system, and they react by choosing one
of the two available options associated with a single resource. Complex systems
arising in a modern society, however, can possess many resources so that the
number of available strategies/resources can be multiple. We propose a class of
models to investigate MG dynamics with multiple strategies. In particular, in
such a system, at any time an agent can either choose a minority strategy (say
with probability p) based on available local information or simply choose a
strategy randomly (with probability 1 - p). The parameter p thus defines the
minority-preference probability, which is key to the dynamics of the underlying
system. A striking finding is the emergence of strategy-grouping states where a
particular number of agents choose a particular subset of strategies. We
develop an analytic theory based on the mean-field framework to understand the
""bifurcation"" to the grouping states and their evolution. The grouping
phenomenon has also been revealed in a real-world example of the subsystem of
27 stocks in the Shanghai Stock Market's Steel Plate. Our work demonstrates
that complex systems following the MG rules can spontaneously self-organize
themselves into certain divided states, and our model represents a basic
mathematical framework to address this kind of phenomena in social, economical,
and even political systems.

using a combined histories, timeless and semiclassical approach. This approach
is along the lines pursued by Halliwell. It involves the timeless probabilities
for dynamical trajectories entering regions of configuration space, which are
computed within the semiclassical regime. Moreover, the objects that Halliwell
uses in this approach commute with the Hamiltonian constraint, H. This approach
has not hitherto been considered for models that also possess nontrivial linear
constraints, Lin. This paper carries this out for some concrete relational
particle models (RPM's). If there is also commutation with Lin - the Kuchar
observables condition - the constructed objects are Dirac observables.
Moreover, this paper shows that the problem of Kuchar observables is explicitly
resolved for 1- and 2-d RPM's. Then as a first route to Halliwell's approach
for nontrivial linear constraints that is also a construction of Dirac
observables, I consider theories for which Kuchar observables are formally
known, giving the relational triangle as an example. As a second route, I apply
an indirect method that generalizes both group-averaging and Barbour's best
matching. For conceptual clarity, my study involves the simpler case of
Halliwell 2003 sharp-edged window function. I leave the elsewise-improved
softened case of Halliwell 2009 for a subsequent Paper II. Finally, I provide
comments on Halliwell's approach and how well it fares as regards the various
facets of the Problem of Time and as an implementation of QM propositions.

limited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and masses
and thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for a
complete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physical
parameters. In this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2
binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events MOA-2011-BLG-090
and OGLE-2011-BLG-0417. Determinations of the binary masses are possible by
simultaneously measuring the Einstein radius and the lens parallax. The
measured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $M_{\odot}$ and 0.39
$M_{\odot}$ for MOA-2011-BLG-090 and 0.57 $M_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $M_{\odot}$ for
OGLE-2011-BLG-0417 and thus both lens components of MOA-2011-BLG-090 and one
component of OGLE-2011-BLG-0417 are M dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness of
microlensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. From
modeling of the light curves considering full Keplerian motion of the lens, we
also measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. The blended light of
OGLE-2011-BLG-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possible
to check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocity
observation. For both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,
which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolved
by high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number of
microlensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in the
future.

minimizing data delivery time is another objective. In addition to this, when

increases and it may lead to congestion. In this paper we have proposed an
adaptive framework in which multiple sources transmit data simultaneously with

ensuring that congestion remains at an optimum low so that minimal number of

radio galaxies and quasars, we found an apparent dearth of cool neutral gas at
high redshift. From a detailed analysis of the photometry, each object is found
to have a 1216 A continuum luminosity in excess of L ~1e23 W/Hz, a critical
value above which 21-cm has never been detected at any redshift. At these
wavelengths, and below, hydrogen is excited above the ground state so that it
cannot absorb in 21-cm. In order to apply the equation of photoionsation
equilibrium, we demonstrate that this critical value also applies to the
ionising (< 912 A) radiation. We use this to show, for a variety of gas density
distributions, that upon placing a quasar within a galaxy of gas there is
always an ultra-violet luminosity above which all of the gas in the galaxy is
ionised. While in this state the hydrogen cannot be detected nor cannot engage
in star formation. Applying the mean ionising photon rate of all of the sources
searched, we find, using canonical values for the gas density and recombination
rate coefficient, that the observed critical luminosity gives a scale-length (3
kpc) similar that of the neutral hydrogen (HI) in the Milky Way, a large spiral
galaxy. Thus, this simple, yet physically motivated, model can explain the
critical luminosity, above which neutral gas is not detected. This indicates
that these galaxies are probably devoid of star-forming material, rather the
non-detection of 21-cm being due to the sensitivity limits of current radio
telescopes.

nodes to be deployed in a WSN for a predetermined lifetime so that total energy
utilization and complete connectivity are ensured under all circumstances. This
scheme also guarantees that during each data gathering cycle, every node
dissipates the requisite amount of energy, which thus minimizes the number of

academic case of a perturbed version of the compact equation, for which
analytical peakons with exponential shape are derived. Finally, by means of an
accurate Fourier-type spectral scheme it is found that smooth solitary waves
appear to collide elastically, suggesting the integrability of the Zakharov

planar graph $G^1 = (V^1, E^1)$ and $G^2 = (V^2, E^2)$ sharing a common
subgraph $G = G^1 \cap G^2$ whether they admit planar drawings such that the
common graph is drawn the same in both. Previous results on this problem
require $G$, $G^1$ and $G^2$ to be connected. This paper is a first step
towards solving instances where these graphs are disconnected.
  First, we show that an instance of the general SEFE-problem can be reduced in
linear time to an equivalent instance where $V^1 = V^2$ and $G^1$ and $G^2$ are
connected. This shows that it can be assumed without loss of generality that
both input graphs are connected. Second, we consider instances where $G$ is
disconnected. We show that SEFE can be solved in linear time if $G$ is a family
of disjoint cycles by introducing the CC-tree, which represents all
simultaneous embeddings. We extend these results (including the CC-tree) to the
case where $G$ consists of arbitrary connected components, each with a fixed
embedding.
  Note that previous results require $G$ to be connected and thus do not need
to care about relative positions of connected components. By contrast, we
assume the embedding of each connected component to be fixed and thus focus on
these relative positions. As SEFE requires to deal with both, embeddings of
connected components and their relative positions, this complements previous
work.

The discovery of massive, old and passive galaxies at z=2, implies that such
quasar feedback onto the host galaxy must have been at work very early on,
close to the reionization epoch. We have observed the [CII]158um transition in
SDSSJ114816.64+525150.3 that, at z=6.4189, is one of the most distant quasars

outflow. This is the most distant massive outflow ever detected and is likely
tracing the long sought quasar feedback, already at work in the early Universe.
The outflow is marginally resolved on scales of about 16 kpc, implying that the
outflow can really affect the whole galaxy, as required by quasar feedback
models. The inferred outflow rate, dM/dt > 3500 Msun/yr, is the highest ever
found. At this rate the outflow can clean the gas in the host galaxy, and
therefore quench star formation, in a few million years.

keV during the peak of the outburst, and further coming back to $\sim 15$ keV
during the decreasing phase. The variations of photon index show the
correlation with the fundamental line energy changes: the source becomes harder
around the peak of the outburst and softer in both rising and decreasing
phases. This correlation and transition processes during the outburst need
further studies in both observations and theoretical work. The known relation
of the fundamental line energy and X-ray luminosity is confirmed by our
results, however, our discoveries suggest that some other factors besides
luminosity play the important role in fundamental line energy variations and
spectral transitions.

also migrate in space. The population size scales according to some parameter
$N$, which can have different interpretations depending on the context. Each
individual is assigned a mass of 1/N and the total mass in the system is called
\emph{population density}. The dynamics has an intrinsic density regulation
mechanism that drives the population density towards an equilibrium. We show
that under a timescale separation between the \emph{slow} migration mechanism
and the \emph{fast} density regulation mechanism, the population dynamics
converges to a Fleming-Viot process as the scaling parameter $N$ approaches
$\infty$. We first prove this result for a basic model in which the birth and
death rates can only depend on the population density. In this case we obtain a
\emph{neutral} Fleming-Viot process. We then extend this model by including
position-dependence in the birth and death rates, as well as, offspring
dispersal and immigration mechanisms. We show how these extensions add
\emph{mutation} and \emph{selection} to the limiting Fleming-Viot process. All
the results are proved in a multi-type setting, where there are $q$ types of
individuals interacting with each other. We illustrate the usefulness of our
convergence result by discussing applications in population genetics and cell
biology.

becomes of order of the distance up to which the wave function of a couple of
He4 atoms extends itself. In this case, the He42 state is quantum and the

All the results are in good agreement with corresponding experiments proving
the validity of our methods. Our theoretical studies can help people more
clearly understand the thermodynamic behaviors of ThO$_2$ at different

diffusion behaviors of helium in ThO$_2$, to discuss its structural stability.
It is found that in intrinsic ThO$_2$ without any Fermi energy shifts, the
interstitial Th$_i^{4+}$ defect other than oxygen or thorium vacancies,
interstitial oxygen, and any kinds of Frenkel pairs, is most probable to form
with an energy release of 1.74 eV. However, after upshifting the Fermi energy,
the formation of the other defects also becomes possible. For helium diffusion,
we find that only through the thorium vacancy can it happen with the small
energy barrier of 0.52 eV. Otherwise, helium atoms can hardly incorporate or
diffuse in ThO$_2$. Our results indicate that people should prevent upshifts of
the Fermi energy of ThO$_2$ to avoid the formation of thorium vacancies and so

suggest a novel algorithm for proving almost-sure termination of probabilistic
programs. Our algorithm exploits the power of state-of-the-art model checkers
and termination provers for nonprobabilistic programs: it calls such tools
within a refinement loop and thereby iteratively constructs a ""terminating
pattern"", which is a set of terminating runs with probability one. We report on
various case studies illustrating the effectiveness of our algorithm. As a
further application, our algorithm can improve lower bounds on reachability
probabilities.

restarts). Each interval or job has an arrival time, a deadline, a length and a
weight. The objective is to maximize the total weight of completed intervals or
jobs. While the deterministic case for intervals was settled a long time ago,
the randomized case remains open. In this paper we first give a 2-competitive
randomized algorithm for the case of equal length intervals. The algorithm is
barely random in the sense that it randomly chooses between two deterministic
algorithms at the beginning and then sticks with it thereafter. Then we extend
the algorithm to cover several other cases of interval scheduling including
monotone instances, C-benevolent instances and D-benevolent instances, giving
the same competitive ratio. These algorithms are surprisingly simple but have
the best competitive ratio against all previous (fully or barely) randomized
algorithms. Next we extend the idea to give a 3-competitive algorithm for equal
length jobs. Finally, we prove a lower bound of 2 on the competitive ratio of
all barely random algorithms that choose between two deterministic algorithms
for scheduling equal length intervals (and hence jobs).

model requires a very high value for the dust scale-length (h(dust) = 2 - 5
h(stars)), higher dust masses than previous models of NGC 4244 (Md = 0.47 -

in agreement with previous disk opacity studies. The vertical scales of stars
and dust are similar. The clumpy model much better mimics the general
morphology in the submm images and the general SED. The inferred gas-to-dust
mass ratio is compatible with those of similar low-mass disks. The relatively
large radial scale-length of the dust disk points to radial mixing of the dusty
ISM within the stellar disk. The large vertical dust scale and the clumpy dust

galaxy is the observational signature of a thin and dense molecular disk, in
which gravitational collapse has overcome turbulence. Using a sample of
galaxies out to z~1 extracted from the COSMOS survey, we identify the fraction
of massive disks that display a dust lane. Our goal is to explore the evolution
in the stability of the molecular ISM disks in spiral galaxies over a cosmic
timescale. We check the reliability of our morphological classifications
against changes in restframe wavelength, resolution, and cosmic dimming with
(artificially redshifted) images of local galaxies from SDSS. We find that the
fraction of L* disks with dust lanes in COSMOS is consistent with the local
fraction (~80%) out to z~0.7. At z=0.8, the dust lane fraction is only slightly
lower. A somewhat lower dust lane fraction in starbursting galaxies tentatively
supports the notion that a high specific star formation rate can efficiently
destroy or inhibit a dense molecular disk. A small subsample of higher redshift
COSMOS galaxies display low internal reddening (E[B-V]), as well as a low
incidence of dust lanes. These may be disks in which the growth of the dusty
ISM disk lags behind that of the stellar disk. We note that at z=0.8, the most
massive galaxies display a lower dust lane fraction than lower mass galaxies. A
small contribution of recent mergers or starbursts to this most massive
population may be responsible. The fact that the fraction of galaxies with dust
lanes in COSMOS is consistent with little or no evolution implies that models
to explain the Spectral Energy Distribution or the host galaxy dust extinction
of supernovae based on local galaxies are still applicable to higher redshift
spirals. It also suggests that dust lanes are long lived phenomena or can be
reformed over very short time-scales.

correcting for the estimated lens magnification, we find that the H2O isotropic

making this source the most luminous ever discovered. Both the main line peak

so-called type II spicules was discovered at the solar limb with Hinode. The
type II spicules have been linked with on-disk observations of Rapid
Blue-shifted Excursions (RBEs) in the Ha and Ca 8542 lines. Here we analyze
observations optimized for the detection of RBEs in both Ha and Ca 8542
simultaneously at a high temporal cadence taken with CRISP at the SST. This
study used a high-quality time sequence for RBEs at different blue-shifts and
employed an automated detection routine to detect a large number of RBEs in
order to expand on the statistics of RBEs. We find that the number of detected
RBEs is dependent on the Doppler velocity of the images on which the search is
performed. Detection of RBEs at lower velocities increases the estimated number
of RBEs to the same order of magnitude expected from limb spicules. This shows
that RBEs and type II spicules are exponents of the same phenomenon. We provide
evidence that Ca 8542 RBEs are connected to Ha RBEs and are located closer to
the network regions with the Ha RBEs being the continuation, and show that RBEs
have an average lifetime of 83.9 s when observed in both spectral lines with
Doppler velocity ranges of 10-25 km/s in Ca 8542 and 30-50 km/s in Ha. In
addition, we determine the transverse motion of a much larger sample of RBEs
than previous studies and find that like type II spicules, RBEs undergo
significant transverse motions, 5-10 km/s. Finally, we find that the
intergranular jets discovered in BBSO are a subset of RBEs.

amplify the input given to the network in two distinct ways. One is induced by
the presence of near-critical eigenvalues in the connectivity matrix W,
producing large but slow activity fluctuations along the corresponding
eigenvectors (dynamical slowing). The other relies on W being nonnormal, which
allows the network activity to make large but fast excursions along specific
directions. Here we investigate the tradeoff between nonnormal amplification
and dynamical slowing in the spontaneous activity of large random neuronal
networks composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We use a Schur
decomposition of W to separate the two amplification mechanisms. Assuming
linear stochastic dynamics, we derive an exact expression for the expected
amount of purely nonnormal amplification. We find that amplification is very
limited if dynamical slowing must be kept weak. We conclude that, to achieve
strong transient amplification with little slowing, the connectivity must be
structured. We show that unidirectional connections between neurons of the same
type together with reciprocal connections between neurons of different types,
allow for amplification already in the fast dynamical regime. Finally, our
results also shed light on the differences between balanced networks in which
inhibition exactly cancels excitation, and those where inhibition dominates.

fabricated in single-crystal diamond with direct ion microbeam writing. Focused
high-energy (~MeV) helium ions are employed to selectively convert diamond with
micrometric spatial accuracy to a stable graphitic phase upon thermal
annealing, due to the induced structural damage occurring at the end-of-range.
A variable-thickness mask allows the accurate modulation of the depth at which
the microchannels are formed, from several {\mu}m deep up to the very surface
of the sample. By means of cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) we demonstrate that the technique allows the direct writing of amorphous
(and graphitic, upon suitable thermal annealing) microstructures extending
within the insulating diamond matrix in the three spatial directions, and in
particular that buried channels embedded in a highly insulating matrix emerge
and electrically connect to the sample surface at specific locations. Moreover,
by means of electrical characterization both at room temperature and variable
temperature, we investigate the conductivity and the charge-transport
mechanisms of microchannels obtained by implantation at different ion fluences
and after subsequent thermal processes, demonstrating that upon
high-temperature annealing, the channels implanted above a critical damage
density convert to a stable graphitic phase. These structures have significant
impact for different applications, such as compact ionizing radiation
detectors, dosimeters, bio-sensors and more generally diamond-based devices
with buried three-dimensional all-carbon electrodes.

  of Computer Science",,,"MengZhang-2012-J-01","cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The graph exploration problem is to visit all the nodes of a connected graph
by a mobile entity, e.g., a robot. The robot has no a priori knowledge of the
topology of the graph or of its size. Cohen et al. \cite{Ilcinkas08} introduced
label guided graph exploration which allows the system designer to add short
labels to the graph nodes in a preprocessing stage; these labels can guide the
robot in the exploration of the graph. In this paper, we address the problem of
adjustable 1-bit label guided graph exploration. We focus on the labeling
schemes that not only enable a robot to explore the graph but also allow the
system designer to adjust the ratio of the number of different labels. This
flexibility is necessary when maintaining different labels may have different
costs or when the ratio is pre-specified. We present 1-bit labeling (two
colors, namely black and white) schemes for this problem along with a labeling
algorithm for generating the required labels. Given an $n$-node graph and a
rational number $\rho$, we can design a 1-bit labeling scheme such that
$n/b\geq \rho$ where $b$ is the number of nodes labeled black. The robot uses
$O(\rho\log\Delta)$ bits of memory for exploring all graphs of maximum degree
$\Delta$. The exploration is completed in time
$O(n\Delta^{\frac{16\rho+7}{3}}/\rho+\Delta^{\frac{40\rho+10}{3}})$. Moreover,
our labeling scheme can work on graphs containing loops and multiple edges,
while that of Cohen et al. focuses on simple graphs.

young stellar object with a dead zone (a region where the magneto-rotational
instability cannot drive turbulence because the material is not sufficiently
ionised). For infall accretion rates on to the disc of around 10^-7 Msun/yr,
dead zones occur if the critical magnetic Reynolds number is larger than about
10^4. We model the collapse of a molecular gas cloud. At early times when the
infall accretion rate is high, the disc is thermally ionised and fully
turbulent. However, as the infall accretion rate drops, a dead zone may form if
the critical magnetic Reynolds number is sufficiently large, otherwise the disc
remains fully turbulent. With a dead zone the disc can become unstable to the
gravo-magneto instability. The mass of the star grows in large accretion
outbursts that may explain FU Orionis events. At late times there is not
sufficient mass in the disc for outbursts to occur but the dead zone becomes
even more prominent as the disc cools. Large inner dead zones in the later
stages of disc evolution may help to explain observations of transition discs
with an inner hole.

is commonly assumed that the percolation threshold of anisotropic objects
scales as their inverse aspect ratio. While this rule has been shown to hold
for rod-like particles, we find that for hard plate-like particles the
percolation threshold is non-monotonic in the aspect ratio. It exhibits a
shallow minimum at intermediate aspect ratios and then saturates to a constant
value. This effect is caused by the isotropic-nematic transition pre-empting
the percolation transition. Hence the common strategy to use highly
anisotropic, conductive particles as fillers in composite materials in order to
produce conduction at low filler concentration is expected to fail for
plate-like fillers such as graphene and graphite nanoplatelets.

the combined ensemble to calculate explicitly expectation values of structural

that stress-based quantities may depend on the compactivity. This calls into
question previous statistical mechanical analyses of static granular systems

existence of an intriguing equipartition principle - the total volume is shared
equally amongst both structural and stress-related degrees of freedom. Third,
we derive an expression for the compactivity that makes it possible to quantify
it from macroscopic measurements.

nuclear region of a galaxy and growth of the central supermassive black hole.
Furthermore, starburst activity in the region around an active galactic nucleus
(AGN) may provide the obscuration required by the unified model of AGN.
Molecular line emission is one of the best observational avenues to detect and
characterize dense, star-forming gas in galactic nuclei over a range of
redshift. This paper presents predictions for the carbon monoxide (CO) line
features from models of nuclear starburst disks around AGN. These small scale
($\la 100$ pc), dense and hot starbursts have CO luminosities similar to
scaled-down ultra-luminous infrared galaxies and quasar host galaxies. Nuclear
starburst disks that exhibit a pc-scale starburst and could potentially act as
the obscuring torus show more efficient CO excitation and higher brightness
temperature ratios than those without such a compact starburst. In addition,
the compact starburst models predict strong absorption when $J_{\mathrm{Upper}}
\ga 10$, a unique observational signature of these objects. These findings
allow for the possibility that CO SLEDs could be used to determine if starburst
disks are responsible for the obscuration in $z \la 1$ AGN. Directly isolating
the nuclear CO line emission of such compact regions around AGN from
galactic-scale emission will require high resolution imaging or selecting AGN
host galaxies with weak galactic-scale star formation. Stacking individual CO
SLEDs will also be useful in detecting the predicted high-$J$ features.

selected for division with a probability that corresponds to the ratio between
its area and the area of the whole window. This selected cell is then divided
by throwing a (uniformly distributed) point into the cell and drawing a line

induced band mixing leads to a change of the conductance upon switching the
magnetization direction from along the chain axis to perpendicular to it. The
main contribution stems from ballistic spin-scattering for the magnetic Co
impurity in the non-magnetic Pt monowire and for the Pt scatterer in the
magnetic Co monowire from the band formed from states with $d_{xy}$ and
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital symmetry. We quantify this effect by calculating the
ballistic anisotropic magnetoresistance which displays values up to as much as
7% for ballistic spin-scattering and gigantic values of around 100% for the Pt
impurity in the Co wire.

associated with single-lined binary stars. To verify the binarity hypothesis on
a larger sample, we started a high-resolution spectral monitoring of about 40
field giants, whose binarity was suspected based on either a light curve, an
infrared excess, or a peculiar chemical composition. Here we report on the
discovery of the periodic RV variations in BD+46 442, a high-latitude F giant
with a disk. We interpret the variations due to the motion around a faint
companion, and deduce the following orbital parameters: Porb = 140.77 d, e =
0.083, asini=0.31 AU. We find it to be a moderately metal-poor star
([M/H]=-0.7) without a strong depletion pattern in the photospheric abundances.
Interestingly, many lines show periodic changes with the orbital phase: Halpha
switches between a double-peak emission and a PCyg-like profiles, while strong
metal lines appear split during the maximum redshift. Similar effects are
likely visible in the spectra of other post-AGB binaries, but their regularity
is not always realized due to sporadic observations. We propose that these
features result from an ongoing mass transfer from the evolved giant to the
companion. In particular, the blue-shifted absorption in Halpha, which occurs
only at superior conjunction, may result from a jet originating in the
accretion disk around the companion and seen in absorption towards the luminous
primary.

willing to exploit communication opportunities left vacant by a licensed
primary network. Since secondary users (SU) usually have no prior knowledge on
the environment, they need to learn the availability of each channel through
sensing techniques, which however can be prone to detection errors. We argue
that cooperation among secondary users can enable efficient learning and
coordination mechanisms in order to maximize the spectrum exploitation by SUs,
while minimizing the impact on the primary network. To this goal, we provide
three novel contributions in this paper. First, we formulate the spectrum
selection in secondary networks as an instance of the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
problem, and we extend the analysis to the collaboration learning case, in
which each SU learns the spectrum occupation, and shares this information with
other SUs. We show that collaboration among SUs can mitigate the impact of
sensing errors on system performance, and improve the convergence of the
learning process to the optimal solution. Second, we integrate the learning
algorithms with two collaboration techniques based on modified versions of the
Hungarian algorithm and of the Round Robin algorithm that allows reducing the
interference among SUs. Third, we derive fundamental limits to the performance
of cooperative learning algorithms based on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
policies in a symmetric scenario where all SU have the same perception of the
quality of the resources. Extensive simulation results confirm the
effectiveness of our joint learning-collaboration algorithm in protecting the
operations of Primary Users (PUs), while maximizing the performance of SUs.

In the standard Q-control, the effective Q-factor of the scanning probe is
adjusted prior to the scanning depending on the application. However, there is
a trade-off in setting the effective Q-factor of an AFM probe. The Q-factor is
either increased to reduce the tapping forces or decreased to increase the
maximum achievable scan speed. Realizing these two benefits simultaneously
using the standard Q-control is not possible. In adaptive Q-control, the
Q-factor of the probe is set to an initial value as in standard Q-control, but
then modified on the fly during scanning when necessary to achieve this goal.

electronics enabling the on-line modification of the probe's effective

scanning a) without Q-control, b) with the standard Q-control, and c) with the

functions and graded Betti numbers for fat point subschemes supported at
$n\le8$ essentially distinct points of the projective plane. Each type gives
rise to a surface $X$ obtained by blowing up the points. We classify those
types such that $n=6$ and $-K_X$ is nef. The surfaces obtained are precisely
the desingularizations of the normal cubic surfaces. By classifying
configuration types we recover in all characteristics the classification of
normal cubic surfaces, which is well-known in characteristic 0 \cite{refBW}. As
an application of our classification of configuration types, we obtain a
numerical procedure for determining the Hilbert function and graded Betti
numbers for the ideal of any fat point subscheme $Z=m_1p_1+...+m_6p_6$ such

focus on the simulation of whole scan process rather than the simulation of

quantify the scan performance under Q control for different scan settings.
Using the numerical simulations, we first investigate the effect of elastic
modulus of sample (relative to the substrate surface) and probe stiffness on
the scan results. Our numerical simulations show that scanning in attractive
regime using soft cantilevers with high Qeff results in a better image quality.
We, then demonstrate the trade-off in setting the effective Q factor (Qeff) of
the probe in Q control: low values of Qeff cause an increase in tapping forces
while higher ones limit the maximum achievable scan speed due to the slow
response of the cantilever to the rapid changes in surface profile. Finally, we
show that it is possible to achieve higher scan speeds without causing an
increase in the tapping forces using adaptive Q control (AQC), in which the Q
factor of the probe is changed instantaneously depending on the magnitude of
the error signal in oscillation amplitude. The scan performance of AQC is
quantitatively compared to that of standard Q control using iso-error curves

full depth of the potential wells of the B 1{\Sigma}+u, B' 1{\Sigma}+u, and C
1{\Pi}u electronic states up to the D(1s) + D(2\ell) dissociation limit.
Improved level energies of rovibrational levels have been determined up to
respectively v = 51, v = 13, and v = 20. Highest resolution is achieved by
probing absorption in a molecular gas jet with slit geometry, as well as in a
liquid helium cooled static gas cell, resulting in line widths of ~0.35 cm-1.
Extended calibration methods are employed to extract line positions of D2 lines
at absolute accuracies of 0.03 cm-1. The D1{\Pi}u and B"" 1{\Sigma}+u electronic
states correlate with the D(1s) + D(3\ell) dissociation limit, but support a
few vibrational levels below the second dissociation limit, respectively v =
0-3 and v = 0-1, and are also included in the presented study. The complete set
of resulting level energies is the most comprehensive and accurate data set for
D2. The observations are compared with previous studies, both experimental and
theoretical.

account for the movement of the comet to allow the combination of all available
data to produce an exposure-corrected image. We fit a simple model to the
extracted spectrum and measured an X-ray flux of 4.3+/-1.3 * 10^-13 ergs cm-2
s-1 in the 0.3 to 1.0 keV band. In the UV, we acquired large-aperture
photometry and used a coma model to derive water production rates given
assumptions regarding the distribution of water and its dissociation into OH
molecules about the comet's nucleus.
  We compare and discuss the X-ray and UV morphology of the comet. We show that
the peak of the cometary X-ray emission is offset sunward of the UV peak
emission, assumed to be the nucleus, by approximately 35,000 km. The offset
observed, the shape of X-ray emission and the decrease of the X-ray emission
comet-side of the peak, suggested that the comet was indeed collisionally thick
to charge exchange, as expected from our measurements of the comet's water
production rate (6--8 10^28 mol. s-1). The X-ray spectrum is consistent with
solar wind charge exchange emission, and the comet most likely interacted with
a solar wind depleted of very highly ionised oxygen. We show that the measured
X-ray lightcurve can be very well explained by variations in the comet's gas
production rates, the observing geometry and variations in the solar wind flux.

performance of Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs). A general ADC is modeled as
a causal, discrete-time dynamical system with outputs taking values in a finite
set. We define the performance of an ADC as the worst-case average intensity of
the filtered input matching error, defined as the difference between the input
and output of the ADC. The passband of the shaping filter used to filter the
error signal determines the frequency region of interest for minimizing the
error. The problem of finding a lower bound for the performance of an ADC is
formulated as a dynamic game problem in which the input signal to the ADC plays
against the output of the ADC. Furthermore, the performance measure must be
optimized in the presence of quantized disturbances (output of the ADC) that
can exceed the control variable (input of the ADC) in magnitude. We
characterize the optimal solution in terms of a Bellman-type inequality. A
numerical approach is presented to compute the value function in parallel with
the feedback law for generating the worst case input signal. The specific
structure of the problem is used to prove certain properties of the value
function that simplifies the iterative computation of a certified solution to
the Bellman inequality. The solution provides a certified lower bound on the
performance of any ADC with respect to the selected performance criteria.
