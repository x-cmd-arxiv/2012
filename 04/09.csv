about 2540 Km is known to be suitable for getting good discovery limits of

found to be suitable for getting these discovery limits. This is because even
in presence of NSIs one could get the $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_\mu $ oscillation
probability to be almost independent of CP violating phase $\delta$ and
$\theta_{13}$ for one hierarchy and highly dependent on these two for the other
hierarchy over certain parts of neutrino energy range. For another certain part
of the energy range the reverse of this happens with respect to the
hierarchies. We present the discovery limits of NSIs also in the same neutrino
energy range. However, as with the increase of neutrino energy the NSI effect
in the above oscillation probability gets relatively more pronounced in
comparison to the vacuum oscillation parameters, so we consider higher neutrino
energy range also for getting better discovery limits of NSIs. Analysis
presented here for 2540 Km could also be implemented for longer bimagic
baseline $> 6000$ Km.

`circuits' by which nutrients are distributed to all parts of the organism. We
investigate whether this `bottom-up' circuit routing method may be harnessed in
a controllable manner as a possible alternative to conventional template-based
circuit design. We interfaced the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum to the
planar surface of the spatially represented computing device, (Mills' Extended
Analog Computer, or EAC), implemented as a sheet of analog computing material
whose behaviour is input and read by a regular 5x5 array of electrodes. We
presented a pattern of current distribution to the array and found that we were
able to select the directional migration of the plasmodium growth front by
exploiting plasmodium electro-taxis towards current sinks. We utilised this
directional guidance phenomenon to route the plasmodium across its habitat and
were able to guide the migration around obstacles represented by repellent
current sources. We replicated these findings in a collective particle model of
Physarum polycephalum which suggests further methods to orient, route, confine
and release the plasmodium using spatial patterns of current sources and sinks.

challenges in map-reduce computations involve balancing a multitude of factors
such as the number of machines available for mappers/reducers, their memory
requirements, and communication cost (total amount of data sent from mappers to
reducers). Most past work provides custom solutions to specific problems, e.g.,
performing fuzzy joins in map-reduce, clustering, graph analyses, and so on.
While some problems are amenable to very efficient map-reduce algorithms, some
other problems do not lend themselves to a natural distribution, and have
provable lower bounds. Clearly, the ease of ""map-reducability"" is closely
related to whether the problem can be partitioned into independent pieces,
which are distributed across mappers/reducers. What makes a problem
distributable? Can we characterize general properties of problems that
determine how easy or hard it is to find efficient map-reduce algorithms?

viscosity (eta) to entropy density (s) for any matter to be ~ mu hbar/4pi k_B,
when hbar and k_B are reduced Planck and Boltzmann constants respectively and
mu <= 1. Motivated by this, we explore eta/s in black hole accretion flows, in
order to understand if such exotic flows could be a natural site for the lowest
eta/s. Accretion flow plays an important role in black hole physics in
identifying the existence of the underlying black hole. This is a rotating
shear flow with insignificant molecular viscosity, which could however have a
significant turbulent viscosity, generating transport, heat and hence entropy
in the flow. However, in presence of strong magnetic field, magnetic stresses
can help in transporting matter independent of viscosity, via celebrated
Blandford-Payne mechanism. In such cases, energy and then entropy produces via
Ohmic dissipation. In addition, certain optically thin, hot, accretion flows,
of temperature >~ 10^9K, may be favourable for nuclear burning which could
generate/absorb huge energy, much higher than that in a star. We find that
eta/s in accretion flows appears to be close to the lower bound suggested by
theory, if they are embedded by strong magnetic field or producing nuclear
energy, when the source of energy is not viscous effects. A lower bound on
eta/s also leads to an upper bound on the Reynolds number of the flow.

equations as a quasilinear $so(3,1)$-valued Yang-Mills theory and introduce a
Coulomb type gauge condition in which the equations exhibit a specific new type
of \textit{null structure} compatible with the quasilinear, covariant nature of
the equations. To prove the conjecture we formulate and establish bilinear and
trilinear estimates on rough backgrounds which allow us to make use of that
crucial structure. These require a careful construction and control of
parametrices including $L^2$ error bounds which is carried out in [Sz1]-[Sz4],

increased sharply recently. Nevertheless, the bound for these algorithms has
not been fully discussed. Treating the measurement as set, this bound can be
applied when the probability of detection is less than unity. Moreover, the
state is treated as set, which is singleton or empty with certain probability
and accounts for the appearance and the disappearance of the targets. When the
existence of the target state is certain, our bound is as same as the most
accurate results of the bound with probability of detection is less than unity

the theory and reveal this bound is more general than previous bounds in the

Reviewing the concept of entanglement potential from a different perspective,
it is shown that in some contexts an arbitrary single-system nonclassical state

controlled-displacement (e.g., beam-splitter, CNOT gate) is available. Also,
this entanglement can be detected in a simple way using the nonclassicality

We prove that, if $G$ is a Frobenius group with abelian Frobenius kernel, then

direct probe of neutral hydrogen distributed in galaxies. Different from galaxy
redshift surveys, observation of baryon acoustic oscillations in the cumulative
21 cm emission may offer an attractive method for constraining dark energy
properties at moderate redshifts. Keys to this program are techniques to
extract the faint cosmological signal from various contaminants, such as
detector noise and continuum foregrounds. In this paper, we investigate the
possible systematic and statistical errors in the acoustic scale estimates
using ground-based radio interferometers. Based on the simulated 21 cm
interferometric measurements, we analyze the performance of a Fourier-space,
light-of-sight algorithm in subtracting foregrounds, and further study the
observing strategy as a function of instrumental configurations. Measurement
uncertainties are presented from a suite of simulations with a variety of
parameters, in order to have an estimate of what behaviors will be accessible
in the future generation of hydrogen surveys. We find that 10 separate
interferometers, each of which contains $\sim 300$ dishes, observes an
independent patch of the sky and produces an instantaneous field-of-view of
$\sim 100$ $\rm deg^2$, can be used to make a significant detection of acoustic
features over a period of a few years. Compared to optical surveys, the broad
bandwidth, wide field-of-view and multi-beam observation are all unprecedented
capabilities of low-frequency radio experiments.

short-loop-induced local correlations. For graphical models represented by
non-redundant or redundant region graphs, approximate free energy landscapes
are constructed in this paper through the mathematical framework of region
graph partition function expansion. Several free energy functionals are
obtained, each of which use a set of probability distribution functions or
functionals as order parameters. These probability distribution
function/functionals are required to satisfy the region graph
belief-propagation equation or the region graph survey-propagation equation to
ensure vanishing correction contributions of region subgraphs with dangling
edges. As a simple application of the general theory, we perform region graph
belief-propagation simulations on the square-lattice ferromagnetic Ising model

Bethe-Peierls approximation are achieved. Collective domains of different sizes
in the disordered and frustrated square lattice are identified by the
message-passing procedure. Such collective domains and the frustrations among

canonical system associated with $\Theta_\omega$ is constructed explicitly and
unconditionally under the restriction of the parameter $\omega >1$ by applying
a method of J.-F. Burnol in his recent work on the gamma function to the
Riemann xi-function. If such construction is extended to all $\omega > 0$

which an energy gap opens in the surface state and the Dirac fermions become
massive. At the same time, the weak antilocalization behavior is found to
weaken in the gapped phase due to the loss of \pi Berry phase.

We apply this model to peer review systems, i.e., conference or research grants
review, which is an essential component in our scientific community. We explore
number of important questions, i.e., how will the number of reviews per paper
affect the accuracy of the overall recommendation? Will the score aggregation
policy influence the final recommendation? How reviewers' preference may affect
the accuracy of the final recommendation? To answer these important questions,
we formally analyze our model. Through this analysis, we obtain the insight on
how to design a randomized algorithm which is both computationally efficient
and asymptotically accurate in evaluating the accuracy of a competitive group
recommendation system. We obtain number of interesting observations: i.e., for
a medium tier conference, three reviews per paper is sufficient for a high
accuracy recommendation. For prestigious conferences, one may need at least
seven reviews per paper to achieve high accuracy. We also propose a
heterogeneous review strategy which requires equal or less reviewing workload,
but can improve over a homogeneous review strategy in recommendation accuracy
by as much as 30% . We believe our models and methodology are important
building blocks to study competitive group recommendation systems.

have reported that under specific conditions, i.e. when a random train of

Here, the applied STDP rule can be either classical pair-based STDP rule, or
the more powerful triplet-based STDP rule. In this paper, we demonstrate the
use of two distinct VLSI circuit implementations of STDP to examine whether BCM
learning is an emergent property of STDP. These circuits are stimulated with
random Poissonian spike trains. The first circuit implements the classical
pair-based STDP, while the second circuit realizes a previously described
triplet-based STDP rule. These two circuits are simulated using 0.35 um CMOS
standard model in HSpice simulator. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed triplet-based STDP circuit significantly produces the threshold-based
behaviour of the BCM. Also, the results testify to similar behaviour for the
VLSI circuit for pair-based STDP in generating the BCM.

velocity structure for two samples demonstrate that A119 is a dynamically

indicates a merging along the line of sight. No significant evidences for

the program objects with the 6-m BTA telescope (Special Astrophysical
Observatory, Russian Academy of Sciences, Nizhnii Arkhyz), which allowed their
nature to be established. Two sources (SWIFT J2237.2+6324} and SWIFT
J2341.0+7645) are shown to belong to the class of cataclysmic variables
(suspected polars or intermediate polars). The measured emission line width
turns out to be fairly large (FWHM ~ 15-25 A), suggesting the presence of
extended, rapidly rotating (v~400-600 km/s) accretion disks in the systems.
Apart from line broadening, we have detected a change in the positions of the
line centroids for SWIFT J2341.0+7645, which is most likely attributable to the
orbital motion of the white dwarf in the binary system. The other two program
objects (SWIFT J0003.3+2737 and SWIFT J0113.8+2515) are extragalactic in
origin: the first is a Seyfert 2 galaxy and the second is a blazar at redshift
z=1.594. Apart from the optical spectra, we provide the X-ray spectra for all
sources in the 0.6-10 keV energy band obtained from XRT/Swift data.

background for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope Systems with very low

their contribution to the background trigger rate dominates over protons, at
least in terms of differential rates against actual energies. After event
reconstruction, this contribution might become comparable to the proton
background at energies of the order of few GeV. It is well known that the flux
of low energy charged particles is suppressed by the Earth's magnetic field.
This effect strongly depends on the geographical location, the direction of
incidence of the charged particle and its mass. Therefore, the geomagnetic
field can contribute to diminish the rate of the electrons and positrons
detected by a given array of Cherenkov Telescopes.
  In this work we study the propagation of low energy primary electrons in the

separated into individual components. Thereby, derivation of the optimal
controllers in state-space follows immediately. The optimal controllers are
evaluated under the practical setting of heavy duty vehicle platooning with

that the proposed optimal distributed controller performs almost as well as the

interest when the RR Lyr star OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-02792 was found to be a member in
an eclipsing binary system4, as the mass of the pulsator (hitherto constrained
only by models) could be unambiguously determined. Here we report that
RRLYR-02792 has a mass of 0.26 M_sun and therefore cannot be a classical RR
Lyrae star. Through models we find that its properties are best explained by
the evolution of a close binary system that started with 1.4 M_sun and 0.8
M_sun stars orbiting each other with an initial period of 2.9 days. Mass
exchange over 5.4 Gyr produced the observed system, which is now in a very
short-lived phase where the physical properties of the pulsator happen to place
it in the same instability strip of the H-R diagram occupied by RR Lyrae stars.
We estimate that samples of RR Lyr stars may contain a 0.2 percent
contamination with systems similar to this one, implying that distances
measured with RR Lyrae stars should not be significantly affected by these

problem in computational geometry and linear programming. First, we prove a
Euclidean {\it distance duality}, distinct from classical separation theorems
such as Farkas Lemma: $p$ lies in $conv(S)$ if and only if for each $p' \in
conv(S)$ there exists a {\it pivot}, $v_j \in S$ satisfying $d(p',v_j) \geq
d(p,v_j)$. Equivalently, $p \not \in conv(S)$ if and only if there exists a
{\it witness}, $p' \in conv(S)$ whose Voronoi cell relative to $p$ contains
$S$. A witness separates $p$ from $conv(S)$ and approximate $d(p, conv(S))$ to
within a factor of two. Next, we describe the {\it Triangle Algorithm}: given
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$, an {\it iterate}, $p' \in conv(S)$, and $v \in S$, if
$d(p, p') < \epsilon d(p,v)$, it stops. Otherwise, if there exists a pivot
$v_j$, it replace $v$ with $v_j$ and $p'$ with the projection of $p$ onto the
line $p'v_j$. Repeating this process, the algorithm terminates in $O(mn \min

is the {\it visibility factor}, a constant satisfying $c \geq \epsilon^2$ and
$\sin (\angle pp'v_j) \leq 1/\sqrt{1+c}$, over all iterates $p'$. Additionally,
(i) we prove a {\it strict distance duality} and a related minimax theorem,
resulting in more effective pivots; (ii) describe $O(mn \ln

applied models do not satisfy the standard assumptions required for the strong

microphysical descriptions of high-density matter in order to explore the
equation-of-state dependence of the postmerger ring-down phase. The formation
of a deformed, oscillating, differentially rotating very massive NS is the
typical outcome of the coalescence of two stars with 1.35 $M_{\odot}$ for most
candidate EoSs. The oscillations of this object imprint a pronounced peak in
the gravitational-wave (GW) spectra, which is used to characterize the emission
for a given model. The peak frequency of this postmerger GW signal correlates
very well with the radii of nonrotating NSs, and thus allows to constrain the
high-density EoS by a GW detection. In the case of 1.35-1.35 $M_{\odot}$
mergers the peak frequency scales particularly well with the radius of a NS
with 1.6 $M_{\odot}$, where the maximum deviation from this correlation is only
60 meters for fully microphysical EoSs which are compatible with NS
observations. Combined with the uncertainty in the determination of the peak
frequency it appears likely that a GW detection can measure the radius of a 1.6
$M_{\odot}$ NS with an accuracy of about 100 to 200 meters. We also uncover
relations of the peak frequency with the radii of nonrotating NSs with 1.35
$M_{\odot}$ or 1.8 $M_{\odot}$, with the radius or the central energy density
of the maximum-mass Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff configuration, and with the
pressure or sound speed at a fiducial rest-mass density of about twice nuclear
saturation density. Furthermore, it is found that a determination of the
dominant postmerger GW frequency can provide an upper limit for the maximum
mass of nonrotating NSs. The prospects for a detection of the postmerger GW
signal and a determination of the dominant GW frequency are estimated to be in
the range of 0.015 to 1.2 events per year with the upcoming Advanced LIGO
detector.

classify SNe and measure expansion velocities. Guest users may view and
download spectra or other data that have been placed in the public domain.
Registered users may also view and download data that are proprietary to

systems are key to investigating fundamental quantum phenomena, generating
superpositions of macroscopic states, and form essential resources for
quantum-enhanced applications, e.g. entanglement distillation and quantum

the full potential of these hybrid systems requires quantum-optical
measurements sensitive to complementary observables such as field quadrature
amplitude and photon number. However, a thorough understanding of the practical
performance of an optical detector interpolating between these two regions is
absent. Here, we report the implementation of full quantum detector tomography,
enabling the characterization of the simultaneous wave and photon-number

for n < 100). Schreiber's solution to the problem of how to handle tied ranks
is convincing, in my opinion (cf. Pudovkin & Garfield, 2009). The fractional
attribution, however, is computationally intensive and cannot be done manually
for even moderately large batches of documents. Schreiber attributed scores
fractionally to the six percentile rank classes used in the Science and

my opinion, the point that fractional attribution at the level of hundred
percentiles-or equivalently quantiles as the continuous random variable-is only
a linear, and therefore much less complex problem. Given the quantile-values,
the non-linear attribution to the six classes or any other evaluation scheme is
then a question of aggregation. A new routine based on these principles

In the proposed algorithm, Lagrange multipliers are used to enforce continuity
of the velocity component across the subdomain domain boundary. The continuity
of the pressure component is enforced in the primal form, i.e., neighboring
subdomains share the same pressure degrees of freedom on the subdomain
interface and no Lagrange multipliers are needed. After eliminating all
velocity variables and the independent subdomain interior parts of the
pressures, a symmetric positive semi-definite linear system for the subdomain
boundary pressures and the Lagrange multipliers is formed and solved by a
preconditioned conjugate gradient method. A lumped preconditioner is studied
and the condition number bound of the preconditioned operator is proved to be
independent of the number of subdomains for fixed subdomain problem size.
Numerical experiments demonstrate the convergence rate of the proposed

bipartite quantum system in noninertial frames and analyze the decoherence
dynamics of GMQD and MIN at finite temperature. The dynamics under the
influence of amplitude damping, depolarizing and phase flip channels is
discussed. It is worth-noting that initial state entanglement plays an
important role in bipartite states. It is possible to distinguish the Bell,
Werner and general type initial quantum states using GMQD. Sudden transition in
the behaviour of GMQD and MIN occurs depending upon the mean photon number of
the local environment. The transition behaviour disappears for larger values of
n, i.e. n>0.3. It becomes more prominent, when environmental noise is

hydrodynamical system in interaction with the gravitational field and with
nothing else. The gravitational field of our Galaxy can be inferred from
observation of orbital velocities of the visible stars, in a first
approximation in which the field is taken to be due to the distribution of dark
matter only. An equation of state is determined by the gravitational field via
the equations of motion.
  To arrive at an estimate of the distribution of dark matter in our galaxy,
and simultaneously learn something about the gravitational field in the inner
regions, the following strategy was adopted: 1. The observed rotation curves
suggest an expression for the newtonian potential, valid in the outer region.
2. The assumption of a quasi stationary, spherically symmetric distribution of
dark matter then leads to a unique equation of state. 3. This equation of state
is assumed to be valid all the way to the center (though of course the
newtonian approximation is not). 4. Using this equation of state, together with
Einstein's equations and the relativistic hydrostatic condition, we calculate
the metric and the matter density throughout the galaxy. The solutions are
regular all the way to the center; there is no indication of a structure of the
type of a Black Hole.
  The equation of state that is thus determined experimentally is of the type
used by Chandrasekhar and others for the degenerate Fermi gas. In the
approximation of weak fields the associated ""sinh-Emden"" equation has a global,
nonsingular solution.

quality of its road system. Many roads built by Romans are still use in
continental Europe and UK. The Roman roads were built for military
transportations with efficiency in mind, as straight as possible. Thus the
roads make an ideal test-bed for developing experimental laboratory techniques
for evaluating man-made transport systems using living creatures. We imitate
development of road networks in Iron Age Italy using slime mould Physarum
polycephalum. We represent ten Roman cities with oat flakes, inoculate the
slime mould in Roma, wait till slime mould spans all flakes-cities with its
network of protoplasmic tubes, and analyse structures of the protoplasmic
networks. We found that most Roman roads, apart of those linking Placentia to
Bononia and Genua to Florenzia are represented in development of Physarum
polycephalum. Transport networks developed by Romans and by slime mould show
strong affinity of planar proximity graphs, and particular minimum spanning
tree. Based on laboratory experiments we reconstructed a speculative sequence
of road development in Iron Age Italy.

amplifier or as a switch. Here the alternating current (a.c) rectifying
property of the transistor is considered. The ordinary silicon diode exhibits a
voltage drop of ~0.6V across its terminals. In this article it is shown that
the transistor can be used to build a diode or rectify low current a.c (~mA)
with a voltage drop of ~0.03V. This voltage is ~20 times smaller than the
silicon diode. This article gives the half-wave and full-wave transistor
rectifier configurations along with some applications to justify their
usefulness.
