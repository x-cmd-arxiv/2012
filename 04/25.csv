propagate. These contact patterns can be represented by network structures.
Static structures have been the common modeling paradigm but recent results
suggest that temporal structures play different roles to regulate the spread of
infections or infection-like dynamics. On temporal networks a vertex is active
only at certain moments and inactive otherwise such that a contact is not
continuously available. In several empirical networks, the time between two
consecutive vertex-activation events typically follows heterogeneous activity
(e.g. bursts). In this chapter, we present a simple and intuitive stochastic
model of a temporal network and investigate how epidemics co-evolves with the
temporal structures, focusing on the growth dynamics of the epidemics. The
model assumes no underlying topological structure and is only constrained by
the time between two consecutive events of vertex activation. The main
observation is that the speed of the infection spread is different in case of
heterogeneous and homogeneous temporal patterns but the differences depend on
the stage of the epidemics. In comparison to the homogeneous scenario, the
power law case results in a faster growth in the beginning but turns out to be
slower after a certain time, taking several time steps to reach the whole
network.

morphologically resembling E2, E3, E4 and E5 galaxies, respectively. Within
each set, three different seed numbers were selected for the random number
generator used to create the initial conditions, so that the three models of
each set are statistically equivalent. We checked the stability of our models
using the values of their central densities and of their moments of inertia,
which turned out to be very constant indeed. The changes of those values were
all less than 3 per cent over one Hubble time and, moreover, we show that the
most likely cause of those changes are relaxation effects in the numerical
code. We computed the six Lyapunov exponents of nearly 5,000 orbits in each
model in order to recognize regular, partially and fully chaotic orbits. All
the models turned out to be highly chaotic, with less than 25 per cent of their
orbits being regular. We conclude that it is quite possible to obtain cuspy
triaxial stellar models that contain large fractions of chaotic orbits and are
highly stable. The difficulty to build such models with the method of
Schwarzschild (1979) should be attributed to the method itself and not to
physical causes.

flux pumping in an upper layer (the convection zone), and study the effects of
its inclusion on the evolution of buoyancy instabilities in a lower layer (the
radiative interior). We study its effects on the instability of both a
preconceived magnetic slab and of a shear-generated magnetic layer. In the
former, we find that in the regime in which the downward pumping velocity is
comparable with the Alfven speed of the magnetic layer, flux pumping is able to
hold back the bulk of the magnetic field, with only small pockets of strong
field able to rise into the upper layer. In simulations in which the magnetic
layer is generated by shear, we find that the shear velocity is not necessarily
required to exceed that of the pumping (therefore the kinetic energy of the
shear is not required to exceed that of the overlying convection), for strong
localised pockets of magnetic field to be produced which can rise into the
upper layer. This is because magnetic flux pumping acts to store the field
below the interface, allowing it to be amplified both by the shear, and by
vortical fluid motions, until pockets of field can achieve sufficient strength
to rise into the upper layer. In addition, we find that the interface between
the two layers is a natural location for the production of strong vertical
gradients in the magnetic field. If these gradients are sufficiently strong to
allow the development of magnetic buoyancy instabilities, strong shear is not
necessarily required to drive them (c.f. previous work by Vasil & Brummell). We
find that the addition of magnetic flux pumping appears to be able to assist
shear-driven magnetic buoyancy in producing strong flux concentrations that can
rise into the convection zone from the radiative interior.

dynamical signatures depend on the sign of detuning between the atomic and
field frequency, and predicts the generation of either atomic or field cat
states in the two opposite cases. We finally discuss the restrictions that the
buildup of atom-field entanglement during the collapse of Rabi oscillations
imposes on the validity of semi-classical approximations that neglect
entanglement.

  (2013)",,,,"physics.geo-ph math.DS physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is ongoing debate over whether Arctic sea-ice has already passed a
`tipping point', or whether it will do so in the future. Several recent studies
argue that the loss of summer sea ice does not involve an irreversible
bifurcation, because it is highly reversible in models. However, a broader
definition of a `tipping point' also includes other abrupt, non-linear changes
that are neither bifurcations nor necessarily irreversible. Examination of
satellite data for Arctic sea-ice area reveals an abrupt increase in the
amplitude of seasonal variability in 2007 that has persisted since then. We
identified this abrupt transition using recently developed methods that can
detect multi-modality in time-series data and sometimes forewarn of
bifurcations. When removing the mean seasonal cycle (up to 2008) from the
satellite data, the residual sea-ice fluctuations switch from uni-modal to
multi-modal behaviour around 2007. We originally interpreted this as a
bifurcation in which a new lower ice cover attractor appears in deseasonalised
fluctuations and is sampled in every summer-autumn from 2007 onwards. However,
this interpretation is clearly sensitive to how the seasonal cycle is removed
from the raw data, and to the presence of continental land masses restricting
winter-spring ice fluctuations. Furthermore, there was no robust early warning
signal of critical slowing down prior to the hypothesized bifurcation. Early
warning indicators do however show destabilization of the summer-autumn sea-ice
cover since 2007. Thus, the bifurcation hypothesis lacks consistent support,
but there was an abrupt and persistent increase in the amplitude of the
seasonal cycle of Arctic sea-ice cover in 2007, which we describe as a
(non-bifurcation) `tipping point'. Our statistical methods detect this `tipping
point' and its time of onset.

the Internet as well as one of the most important applications of outsourced
computing, producing results that critically affect users' decision-making
behaviors. As such, verifying the integrity of Internet-based searches over
vast amounts of web contents is essential.
  We provide the first solution to this general security problem. We introduce
the concept of an authenticated web crawler and present the design and
prototype implementation of this new concept. An authenticated web crawler is a
trusted program that computes a special ""signature"" $s$ of a collection of web
contents it visits. Subject to this signature, web searches can be verified to
be correct with respect to the integrity of their produced results. This
signature also allows the verification of complicated queries on web pages,
such as conjunctive keyword searches. In our solution, along with the web pages
that satisfy any given search query, the search engine also returns a
cryptographic proof. This proof, together with the signature $s$, enables any
user to efficiently verify that no legitimate web pages are omitted from the
result computed by the search engine, and that no pages that are non-conforming
with the query are included in the result. An important property of our
solution is that the proof size and the verification time both depend solely on
the sizes of the query description and the query result, but not on the number
or sizes of the web pages over which the search is performed.
  Our authentication protocols are based on standard Merkle trees and the more
involved bilinear-map accumulators. As we experimentally demonstrate, the
prototype implementation of our system gives a low communication overhead
between the search engine and the user, and allows for fast verification of the
returned results on the user side.

regarded as Turing computation, and Turing machines can be uniquely implemented
as nonlinear dynamical systems using generalized shifts and subsequent G\""odel
encoding of the symbolic repertoire. The resulting nonlinear dynamical automata
(NDA) are piecewise affine-linear maps acting on the unit square that is
partitioned into rectangular domains. Iterating a single point, i.e. a
microstate, by the dynamics yields a trajectory of, in principle, infinitely
many points scattered through phase space. Therefore, the NDAs microstate
dynamics does not necessarily terminate in contrast to its counterpart, the
symbolic dynamics obtained from the rectangular partition. In order to regain
the proper symbolic interpretation, one has to prepare ensembles of randomly
distributed microstates with rectangular supports. Only the resulting
macrostate evolution corresponds then to the original Turing machine
computation. However, the introduction of random initial conditions into a
deterministic dynamics is not really satisfactory. As a possible solution for
this problem we suggest a change of perspective. Instead of looking at point
dynamics in phase space, we consider functional dynamics of probability
distributions functions (p.d.f.s) over phase space. This is generally described
by a Frobenius-Perron integral transformation that can be regarded as a neural
field equation over the unit square as feature space of a dynamic field theory
(DFT). Solving the Frobenius-Perron equation, yields that uniform p.d.f.s with
rectangular support are mapped onto uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support,
again. Thus, the symbolically meaningful NDA macrostate dynamics becomes
represented by iterated function dynamics in DFT; hence we call the resulting
representation dynamic field automata.

surface, with initial velocities up to 1400 km/s decelerating to ~650 km/s. The
rapid expansion of the CME initiated at an elevated height of 110 Mm produces a
strong downward and lateral compression, which may play an important role in
driving the primary EUV wave and shaping its front forwardly inclined toward
the solar surface. The waves have a dominant 2 min periodicity that matches the
X-ray flare pulsations, suggesting a causal connection. The arrival of the
leading EUV wave front at increasing distances produces an uninterrupted chain
sequence of deflections and/or transverse (likely fast kink mode) oscillations

filament with delayed onsets consistent with the wave travel time at an
elevated (by ~50%) velocity within it. This suggests that the EUV wave
penetrates through a topological separatrix surface into the cavity, unexpected
from CME caused magnetic reconfiguration. These observations, when taken

the initial binary fraction, and the degree of initial mass segregation. Two
different pairing methods are used to construct massive binaries for more
realistic initial conditions of massive binaries. We find that lower mass
clusters (<= 10^2.5 Msun) do not shoot out their heaviest star. In the case of
massive clusters (>= 1000 Msun), no most-massive star escapes the cluster
within 3 Myr regardless of the initial conditions if clusters have initial
half-mass radii, r_0.5, >= 0.8 pc. However, a few of the initially smaller
sized clusters (r_0.5 = 0.3 pc), which have a higher density, eject their most
massive star within 3 Myr. If clusters form with a compact size and their
massive stars are born in a binary system with a mass-ratio biased towards
unity, the probability that the mass of the most massive star in the cluster
changes due to the ejection of the initially most massive star can be as large

double NS system masses thus directly point to the mass coordinate where the
supernova explosion was initiated, making them an excellent probe of the

the lack of broad range of SN model explosions of LMC to solar metallicity.

defects binding Majorana modes, by judiciously interfacing widely available
materials. Following this line of attack, we introduce a device fabricated from
conventional fractional quantum Hall states and s-wave superconductors that
supports exotic non-Abelian anyons that bind `parafermions', which can be
viewed as fractionalized Majorana fermions. We show that these modes can be
experimentally identified (and distinguished from Majoranas) using Josephson
measurements. We also provide a practical recipe for braiding parafermions and
show that they give rise to non-Abelian statistics. Interestingly, braiding in
our setup produces a richer set of topologically protected qubit operations
when compared to the Majorana case. As a byproduct, we establish a new,
experimentally realistic Majorana platform in weakly spin-orbit-coupled
materials such as GaAs.

between 70 $\mu$m and 3 mm are used to constrain the FIR SED, and we find a
best fit FIR luminosity of log[Lfir/Lsol] = 13.5+/-0.1, dust temperature T_d =

gas probed by CO(3-2), (5-4) and (7-6), is modelled with large velocity

characteristic size r0, are determined using the dust temperature from the FIR
SED as a prior for the gas temperature. The best fitting parameters are T_g =
90+/-8 K, n(H2) = 10^(3.9+/-0.1) cm^(-3) and r0 = 0.8+/-0.04 kpc. The ratio of
the [CI] lines gives a [CI] excitation temperature of 43+/-10 K, indicating the
[CI] and the high-excitation CO are not in thermal equilibrium. The [CI]
excitation temperature is below that of T_d and T_g of the high-excitation CO,
perhaps because [CI] lies at a larger radius where there may also be a large
reservoir of CO at a cooler temperature, perhaps detectable through the
CO(1-0). Using the [CI](1-0) line we can estimate the strength of the CO(1-0)
line and hence the gas mass. This suggests that a significant fraction (~30%)
of the molecular gas is missed from the high-excitation line analysis. The
Eddington limited black hole mass is found from the bolometric luminosity to be
Mbh >~ 1.5x10^9 Msol. Along with the stellar mass of 3x10^11 Msol, these give a
black hole - bulge mass ratio of Mbh/Mbulge >~ 0.005. This is in agreement with
studies on the evolution of the Mbh/Mbulge relationship at high redshifts,

approximation algorithms for the Set-Cover problem with approximation ratios
better than ln(n). In light of this result, it is natural to ask whether such
improvements can be achieved using lift-and-project methods. We present a
simpler combinatorial algorithm which has nearly the same time-approximation
tradeoff as the algorithm of Cygan et al., and which lends itself naturally to
a lift-and-project based approach.
  At a high level, our approach is similar to the recent work of Karlin,
Mathieu, and Nguyen [IPCO 2011], who examined a known PTAS for Knapsack
(similar to our combinatorial Set-Cover algorithm) and its connection to
hierarchies of LP and SDP relaxations for Knapsack. For Set-Cover, we show
that, indeed, using the trick of ""lifting the objective function"", we can match
the performance of our combinatorial algorithm using the LP hierarchy of Lovasz
and Schrijver. We also show that this trick is essential: even in the stronger
LP hierarchy of Sherali and Adams, the integrality gap remains at least (1-eps)
ln(n) at level Omega(n) (when the objective function is not lifted).
  As shown by Aleknovich, Arora, and Tourlakis [STOC 2005], Set-Cover
relaxations stemming from SDP hierarchies (specifically, LS+) have similarly
large integrality gaps. This stands in contrast to Knapsack, where Karlin et
al. showed that the (much stronger) Lasserre SDP hierarchy reduces the
integrality gap to (1+eps) at level O(1). For completeness, we show that LS+
also reduces the integrality gap for Knapsack to (1+eps). This result may be of
independent interest, as our LS+ based rounding and analysis are rather
different from those of Karlin et al., and to the best of our knowledge this is
the first explicit demonstration of such a reduction in the integrality gap of
LS+ relaxations after few rounds.

produces a correlated state at the output. However, when the inputs are
identical Gaussian states the output state is equal to the input, and no
correlations appear, as the interference had not taken place. On the other
hand, since physical phenomena do have observable effects, and the beam
splitter is there, a question arises on how to reveal the interference between
the two beams. We prove theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that this
is possible if at least one of the two beams is prepared in a discordant, i.e.
Gaussian correlated, state with a third beam. We also apply the same technique
to reveal the erasure of polarization information. Our experiments involves
thermal states and the results show that Gaussian discordant states, even when
they show a positive Glauber P-function, may be useful to achieve specific

a compact, non-degenerate core with an associated Peierls stress between 1.7

can only be gained by using more efficient atomistic simulations based on
semiempirical interatomic potentials. In this paper we assess the suitability
of five different potentials in terms of static properties relevant to screw
dislocations in pure W. As well, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of
stress-assisted glide using all five potentials to study the dynamic behavior
of screw dislocations under shear stress. Dislocations are seen to display
thermally-activated motion in most of the applied stress range, with a gradual
transition to a viscous damping regime at high stresses. We find that one
potential predicts a core transformation from compact to dissociated at finite
temperature that affects the energetics of kink-pair production and impacts the
mechanism of motion. We conclude that a modified embedded-atom potential
achieves the best compromise in terms of static and dynamic screw dislocation
properties, although at an expense of about ten-fold compared to central
potentials.

optical depth of the water ice among the five young stars. Our results suggest
that there is a critical inclination angle between 65deg and 75deg for the
circumstellar disk where the water ice absorption becomes strong. The average

replace the temporal fine tuning associated with Lambda with a spatial fine

unprecedented in the history of commerce, thanks to the formation of online
marketplaces for user data. Data providing agencies sell user information to
advertisers to allow them to match ads to viewers more effectively. In this
paper we study the design of optimal mechanisms for a monopolistic data
provider to sell information to a buyer, in a model where both parties have
(possibly correlated) private signals about a state of the world, and the buyer
uses information learned from the seller, along with his own signal, to choose
an action (e.g., displaying an ad) whose payoff depends on the state of the
world.
  We provide sufficient conditions under which there is a simple one-round
protocol (i.e. a protocol where the buyer and seller each sends a single
message, and there is a single money transfer) achieving optimal revenue. In
these cases we present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes the optimal
mechanism. Intriguingly, we show that multiple rounds of partial information
disclosure (interleaved by payment to the seller) are sometimes necessary to
achieve optimal revenue if the buyer is allowed to abort his interaction with
the seller prematurely. We also prove some negative results about the inability
of simple mechanisms for selling information to approximate more complicated
ones in the worst case.

from the outskirts of each galaxy to their nuclei. We employ this fact to probe
merger properties by using the emission lines in our IFS data to calculate the
gas-phase metallicity in each system. We create abundance maps and subsequently
derive a metallicity gradient from each map. We compare our measured gradients
to merger stage as well as several possible tracers of merger progress and
observed nuclear abundances. We discuss our work in the context of previous
abundance gradient observations and compare our results to new galaxy merger
models which trace metallicity gradient. Our results agree with the observed

before attempting to model radiative accretion disks, we have tested the new
code using a series of shock tube and Bondi (spherical inflow) problems. The
four radiative shock tube tests, first presented by Farris et al. (2008), have
known analytic solutions, allowing us to calculate errors and convergence rates
for our code. The Bondi problem only has an analytic solution when radiative
processes are ignored, but is pertinent because it is closer to the physics we
ultimately want to study. In our simulations, we include Thomson scattering and
thermal bremsstrahlung in the opacity, focusing exclusively on the
super-Eddington regime. Unlike accretion onto bodies with solid surfaces,
super-Eddington accretion onto black holes does not produce super-Eddington
luminosity. In our examples, despite accreting at up to 300 times the Eddington
rate, our measured luminosity is always several orders of magnitude below
Eddington.

simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously with Fermi/LAT and other instruments.
Two SEDs are available for each of the objects and the state is identified as a
low or high state according to its flux density at GeV/TeV band. The observed
SEDs of BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) are fitted well with the synchrotron +
synchrotron-self-Compton (syn+SSC) model, whereas the SEDs of the two flat
spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) need to include the contributions of external
Compton scattering. In this scenario, it is found that the Doppler factor delta
of FSRQs is smaller than that of BL Lacs, but the magnetic field strength B of
FSRQs is larger than that of BL Lacs. The increase of the peak frequency of the
SEDs is accompanied with the increase of the flux for the individual sources,
which seems opposite to the observational phenomena of the blazar sequence. We
refer this phenomenon to blazar anti-sequence of spectral variability for
individual TeV blazars. However, both the blazar sequence from FSRQs to BL Lacs
and blazar anti-sequence of the spectral variability from low state to high
state are accompanied by an increase of the break Lorentz factor of the
electron's spectrum gamma_b and a decrease of B. We propose a model in which
the mass accretion rate is the driving force behind both the blazar sequence
for ensembles of blazars and the blazar anti-sequence for individual blazars.
Specifically we suggest that the differences in mass accretion rate of
different blazars produce the observed blazar sequence, but \Delta M in each
blazar results in the observed blazar anti-sequence.

the free energy are, in fact, sensitive to the genuine quantum correlations.
Therefore, while individual moments of the amount of thermodynamical work can
be larger (or smaller) quantumly than classically, when they are all combined
together into the (exponential of) free energy, the total effect vanishes to
leave the Jarzynski equality intact. Whether this is a fortuitous coincidence
remains to be seen, but it certainly goes towards explaining why the laws of

We adopt initial conditions characteristic of the warm neutral medium and study
two different flow velocities - a slow flow with v = 6.8 km/s and a fast flow
with v = 13.6 km/s. The clouds formed by the collision of these flows form
stars, with star formation beginning after 16 Myr in the case of the slower
flow, but after only 4.4 Myr in the case of the faster flow. In both flows, the
formation of CO-dominated regions occurs only around 2 Myr before the onset of
star formation. Prior to this, the clouds produce very little emission in the J
= 1 -> 0 transition line of CO, and would probably not be identified as
molecular clouds in observational surveys. In contrast, our models show that
H2-dominated regions can form much earlier, with the timing depending on the
details of the flow. In the case of the slow flow, small pockets of gas become
fully molecular around 10 Myr before star formation begins, while in the fast
flow, the first H2-dominated regions occur around 3 Myr before the first
prestellar cores form. Our results are consistent with models of molecular
cloud formation in which the clouds are dominated by ""dark"" molecular gas for a

inhibition leads to a pinning of steps without defects, adsorbates, or
impurities (self-pinning of steps). We show that this inhibition of the
macro-step motion is caused by faceted steps, which are macro-steps that have a
smooth side surface. The faceted steps result from discontinuities in the
anisotropic surface tension (the surface free energy per area). The
discontinuities are brought into the surface tension by the short-range
step-step attraction. The short-range step-step attraction also originates
`step-droplets', which are locally merged steps, at higher temperatures. We
derive an analytic equation of the surface stiffness tensor for the vicinal
surface around the (001) surface. Using the surface stiffness tensor, we show
that step-droplets roughen the vicinal surface. Contrary to what we expected,
the step-droplets slow down the step velocity due to the diminishment of kinks
in the merged steps (smoothing of the merged steps).

and tangent linear models of finite element models. The technique is
significantly more efficient and automatic than standard algorithmic
differentiation techniques. The approach relies on a high-level symbolic
representation of the forward problem. In contrast to developing a model
directly in Fortran or C++, high-level systems allow the developer to express
the variational problems to be solved in near-mathematical notation. As such,
these systems have a key advantage: since the mathematical structure of the
problem is preserved, they are more amenable to automated analysis and
manipulation. The framework introduced here is implemented in a freely
available software package named dolfin-adjoint, based on the FEniCS Project.
Our approach to automated adjoint derivation relies on run-time annotation of
the temporal structure of the model, and employs the FEniCS finite element form
compiler to automatically generate the low-level code for the derived models.
The approach requires only trivial changes to a large class of forward models,
including complicated time-dependent nonlinear models. The adjoint model
automatically employs optimal checkpointing schemes to mitigate storage
requirements for nonlinear models, without any user management or intervention.
Furthermore, both the tangent linear and adjoint models naturally work in
parallel, without any need to differentiate through calls to MPI or to parse
OpenMP directives. The generality, applicability and efficiency of the approach
are demonstrated with examples from a wide range of scientific applications.

is, non-local excitations of two monomers and local double excitations to some
higher excited intra-monomer electronic state. As a consequence of the
inter-monomer Coulomb interaction these different excitation states are coupled
to each other. Higher excited intra-monomer states are rather short-lived due
to efficient internal conversion of electronic into vibrational energy.
Combining both processes leads to the annihilation of an electronic excitation
state, which is a major loss channel for establishing high excitation densities
in molecular aggregates. Applying theoretical pulse optimization techniques to
a Frenkel exciton model it is shown that the dynamics of two-exciton states in
linear aggregates (dimer to tetramer) can be influenced by ultrafast shaped
laser pulses. In particular, it is studied to what extent the decay of the
two-exciton population by inter-band transitions can be transiently suppressed.
Intra-band dynamics is described by a dissipative hierarchy equation approach,
which takes into account strong exciton-vibrational coupling in the

was first introduced by Kabluchko, Schlather and de Haan (2009).
  This paper deals with statistical inference for max-stable space-time
processes that are defined in an analogous fashion. We describe pairwise
likelihood estimation, where the pairwise density of the process is used to
estimate the model parameters and prove strong consistency and asymptotic
normality of the parameter estimates for an increasing space-time dimension,

integrate to central extensions of Lie groups, a fact which is due to the
vanishing of \pi_2 for each finite-dimensional Lie group. This fact was used by
Cartan (in a slightly other guise) to construct the simply connected Lie group

there is an obstruction for a central extension of Lie algebras to integrate to
a central extension of Lie groups. This obstruction comes from non-trivial
\pi_2 for general Lie groups. We show that this obstruction may be overcome by
integrating central extensions of Lie algebras not to Lie groups but to central

  Young stellar clusters with ages <7 Myr have significant internal extinction
in the range of Av=3-7m, while older ones typically have Av<1m. The cluster
luminosity function (CLF) is well-fitted by a power law with an exponent of
around -2 and displays no evidence of a high luminosity cut-off. The brightest
cluster complexes in the disk reach luminosities of Mk = -15.5m or estimated
masses of 10^6 Mo. At radii with a strong, two-armed spiral pattern, the star
formation rate in the arms is higher by a factor of 2-5 than in the inter-arm
regions. The CLF in the arms is also shifted towards brighter Mk by at least
0.4m. We also detect clusters with colors compatible with Large Magellanic

diagram of several galaxies shows, for the brightest clusters, a clear

  On the modified temperature scales, evolutionary trends in the abundances of
Mg and Fe are found to be significant at the 2{\sigma} and 3{\sigma} levels,
respectively. The detailed evolution of abundances for all six elements agrees
with theoretical isochrones, calculated with effects of atomic diffusion and a
weak to moderately strong efficiency of turbulent mixing. The age of these
models is compatible with the external determination from the white dwarf
cooling sequence. We find that the abundance analysis cannot be reconciled with
the strong turbulent-mixing efficiency inferred elsewhere for halo field stars.
A weak mixing efficiency reproduces observations best, indicating a
diffusion-corrected primordial lithium abundance of log {\epsilon}(Li) = 2.57
+- 0.10. At 1.2{\sigma}, this value agrees well with WMAP-calibrated Big-Bang
nucleosynthesis predictions.

to determine the observed frequencies of both transitions with so far unmatched
accuracy at high redshift. The redshift difference between the CO and CI lines
is sensitive to variations of dF/F with F=alpha^2/mu where alpha is the fine

the transition regime connecting a protoinflationary phase of decelerated
expansion to an accelerated epoch driven by a single inflaton field. The
protoinflationary inhomogeneities are suppressed when the transition to the
slow roll phase occurs sharply over space-like hypersurfaces of constant energy
density. If the transition is delayed, the interaction of the quasi-normal
modes related, asymptotically, to fluid phonons and inflaton quanta leads to an
enhancement of curvature perturbations. It is shown that the dynamics of the

monotonicity properties of the pump fields controlling the energy transfer
between the background geometry and the quasi-normal modes of the fluctuations.
After corroborating the analytical arguments with explicit numerical examples,

(LMPIT) for the problem of testing the covariance structure of a set of
Gaussian random vectors. The LMPIT is the optimal test for the case of close
hypotheses, among those satisfying the invariances of the problem, and in
practical scenarios can provide better performance than the typically used
generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). The derivation of the LMPIT usually
requires one to find the maximal invariant statistic for the detection problem
and then derive its distribution under both hypotheses, which in general is a
rather involved procedure. As an alternative, Wijsman's theorem provides the
ratio of the maximal invariant densities without even finding an explicit
expression for the maximal invariant. We first consider the problem of testing
whether a set of $N$-dimensional Gaussian random vectors are uncorrelated or
not, and show that the LMPIT is given by the Frobenius norm of the sample
coherence matrix. Second, we study the case in which the vectors under the null
hypothesis are uncorrelated and identically distributed, that is, the
sphericity test for Gaussian vectors, for which we show that the LMPIT is given
by the Frobenius norm of a normalized version of the sample covariance matrix.
Finally, some numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed
tests, which provide better results than their GLRT counterparts.

influenced by their neighbours can adopt one out of several alternatives. We
characterize social networks for which adoption of a product by the whole
network is possible (respectively necessary) and the ones for which a unique
outcome is guaranteed. These characterizations directly yield polynomial time
algorithms that allow us to determine whether a given social network satisfies
one of the above properties.
  We also study algorithmic questions for networks without unique outcomes. We
show that the problem of determining whether a final network exists in which
all nodes adopted some product is NP-complete. In turn, the problems of
determining whether a given node adopts some (respectively, a given) product in
some (respectively, all) network(s) are either co-NP complete or can be solved
in polynomial time.
  Further, we show that the problem of computing the minimum possible spread of
a product is NP-hard to approximate with an approximation ratio better than
$\Omega(n)$, in contrast to the maximum spread, which is efficiently
computable. Finally, we clarify that some of the above problems can be solved

change in dilaton generates a linear confining $\bar{q}q$ potential and opposes
the screening effect of temperature. We show that the persistence of the

selection processes of these kinds of services. Other few works were interested
in how to represent Web services search queries. However, these queries cannot
be processed by ensuring a high level of performance without being adequately
represented first. To this end, different query languages were designed. Even
so, in the absence of a standard, these languages are quite various. Their
diversity makes it difficult choosing the most suitable language. In fact, this
language should be able to cover all types of preferences or requirements of
clients such as their functional, nonfunctional,temporal or even specific
constraints as is the case of geographical or spatial constraints and meet
their needs and preferences helping to provide them the best answer. It must
also be mutually simple and imposes no restrictions or at least not too many
constraints in terms of prior knowledge to use and also provide a formal or
semi-formal queries presentation to support their automatic post-processing. A
comparative study is eventually established to allow to reveal the advantages
and limitations of various existing languages in this context. It is a
synthesis of this category of languages discussing their performance level and
their capability to respond to various needs related to the Web services
research and discovery case. The criterions identified at this stage may, in
our opinion, constitute then the main pre-requisite that a language should
satisfy to be called perfect or to be a future standard.

  Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/752/2/98",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent observational results indicate that the functional shape of the
spatially-resolved star formation-molecular gas density relation depends on the
spatial scale considered. These results may indicate a fundamental role of
sampling effects on scales that are typically only a few times larger than
those of the largest molecular clouds. To investigate the impact of this
effect, we construct simple models for the distribution of molecular clouds in
a typical star-forming spiral galaxy, and, assuming a power-law relation
between SFR and cloud mass, explore a range of input parameters. We confirm
that the slope and the scatter of the simulated SFR-molecular gas surface
density relation depend on the size of the sub-galactic region considered, due
to stochastic sampling of the molecular cloud mass function, and the effect is
larger for steeper relations between SFR and molecular gas. There is a general
trend for all slope values to tend to ~unity for region sizes larger than 1-2
kpc, irrespective of the input SFR-cloud relation. The region size of 1-2 kpc
corresponds to the area where the cloud mass function becomes fully sampled. We
quantify the effects of selection biases in data tracing the SFR, either as
thresholds (i.e., clouds smaller than a given mass value do not form stars) or
backgrounds (e.g., diffuse emission unrelated to current star formation is
counted towards the SFR). Apparently discordant observational results are
brought into agreement via this simple model, and the comparison of our

of strength $B$ is investigated within the Pekar-Tomasevich approximation. In
this approximation the energy of $N$ polarons is described in terms of a
non-quadratic functional with a quartic term that accounts for the
electron-electron self-interaction mediated by phonons. The size of a coupling
constant, denoted by $\alpha$, in front of the quartic is determined by the
electronic properties of the crystal under consideration, but in any case it is
constrained by $0<\alpha<1$. For all values of $N$ and $B$ we find an interval
$\alpha_{N,B}<\alpha<1$ where the $N$ polarons bind in a single cluster

exponentially localized in the $N$-particle configuration space $\R^{3N}$.

Max-CSPs, we introduce a relaxed notion of an approximate solution of a
Max-CSP. In this relaxed version, loosely speaking, the algorithm is allowed to
replace the constraints of an instance by some other (possibly real-valued)
constraints, and then only needs to satisfy as many of the new constraints as
possible.
  To be more precise, we introduce the following notion of a predicate $P$
being \emph{useful} for a (real-valued) objective $Q$: given an almost
satisfiable Max-$P$ instance, there is an algorithm that beats a random
assignment on the corresponding Max-$Q$ instance applied to the same sets of
literals. The standard notion of a nontrivial approximation algorithm for a
Max-CSP with predicate $P$ is exactly the same as saying that $P$ is useful for
$P$ itself.
  We say that $P$ is useless if it is not useful for any $Q$. This turns out to
be equivalent to the following pseudo-randomness property: given an almost
satisfiable instance of Max-$P$ it is hard to find an assignment such that the
induced distribution on $k$-bit strings defined by the instance is not
essentially uniform.
  Under the Unique Games Conjecture, we give a complete and simple
characterization of useful Max-CSPs defined by a predicate: such a Max-CSP is
useless if and only if there is a pairwise independent distribution supported
on the satisfying assignments of the predicate. It is natural to also consider
the case when no negations are allowed in the CSP instance, and we derive a
similar complete characterization (under the UGC) there as well.
  Finally, we also include some results and examples shedding additional light
on the approximability of certain Max-CSPs.

This leads to complexes with a charged core, and a more dilute corona of
dangling chains, or of loops (flower-like structure). The equilibrium
aggregation number of the complexes (number of polycations m+ and polyanions
m-) is determined by minimizing the relevant free energy functional, the
Coulombic contribution of which is worked out within Poisson-Boltzmann theory.
The complexes can be viewed as colloids that are permeable to micro-ionic
species, including salt. We find that the complexation process can be highly

is introduced to simulate colloidal aggregates under flow conditions. The
contact model mimics both the elastic and plastic behavior of the cohesive
connections between particles within clusters. Owing to this, clusters can
maintain their structures under low stress while restructuring or even breakage
may occur under sufficiently high stress conditions. SD is an efficient method
to deal with the long-ranged and many-body nature of hydrodynamic interactions
for low Reynolds number flows. By using such a coupled model, the restructuring
of colloidal aggregates under stepwise increasing shear flows was studied.
Irreversible compaction occurs due to the increase of hydrodynamic stress on
clusters. Results show that the greater part of the fractal clusters are
compacted to rod-shaped packed structures, while the others show isotropic
compaction.

limit of Fractional Topological Insulators in a series of simple models

one-dimensional limit of two dimensional Chern Insulators, and the Hubbard-type
interactions projected into their lowest band take particularly simple forms.
By exactly solving the many-body interacting spectrum of these models, we show
that, just like in the Fractional Quantum Hall effect, the zero modes of the
thin-torus limit are CDW states of occupation numbers satisfying generalized
Pauli principles. As opposed to the FQH where the thin-torus CDW appear in
orbital space, in the thin-torus FCI states, the CDW states are in real-space.
We show the counting of the quasihole excitations in the energy spectrum cannot
distinguish between a CDW state and a FQH state. However, by exactly computing
the entanglement spectrum for the thin-torus states, we show that it can
qualitatively and quantitatively distinguish between a CDW and a fractional
topological state such as the FCI. We then discover a previously unknown
separation of energy scales of the full FQH energy spectrum in the thin torus
limit and find that Chern insulator models exhibiting strong isotropic FCI
states have a similar structure in their thin-torus limit spectrum. We close by
numerically computing the evolution of energy and entanglement spectra from the

analysis of one-body, 1-dimensional topological insulators stabilized by

be offset from the line brightness peaks at lower velocities (i.e., presumably

continuation of the average HE spectral index into the VHE domain, these
results imply a cut-off in the \gamma-ray spectrum between the HE and VHE

present evidence that large Nc equivalence extends to the baryon sector, under
the same type of symmetry-realization assumptions as in the meson sector, by
adapting the classic Witten analysis of large Nc baryons.

bounded above by a certain universal limit $c_+$ which can coincide with the
speed of light $c$ in a vacuum.

Exact solutions of Einstein's modified field equations with perfect fluid and
heat conduction are obtained within the framework of Saez-Ballester
scalar-tensor theory of gravitation and the model is found to be in good
agreement with recent observations. We find, for n = 3, k = 1, the present
value of DP in derived model as q_0 = -0.67 which is very near to the observed
value of DP at present epoch. We find that the time-dependent DP is sensible
for the present day Universe and give an earmark description of evolution of
universe. Some physical and geometric properties of the models are also
discussed.

northeast part of NGC6888, we have generated maps of the extinction structure
and electron density. We produced statistical frequency distributions of the
radial velocity and diagnostic diagrams. We have found that the spectra of a
localized region to the southwest of this pointing can be represented well by
shock models. Furthermore, we performed a thorough study of integrated spectra
in nine regions over the whole nebula. We derived electron densities ranging
from <100 to 360 cm^(-3). The electron temperature varies from ~7700 K to
~10200 K. A strong variation of up to a factor 10 between different regions in
the nitrogen abundance has been found: N/H appears lower than the solar
abundance in those positions observed at the edges and very enhanced in the
observed inner parts. Oxygen appears slightly underabundant with respect to
solar value, whereas the helium abundance is found to be above it. Finally, we
provide a scenario for the evolution of NGC6888 to explain the features
observed. This scheme consists of a structure of multiple shells.

a specified subset (e.g., point or curve) of a given domain. The heat method is
robust, efficient, and simple to implement since it is based on solving a pair
of standard linear elliptic problems. The method represents a significant
breakthrough in the practical computation of distance on a wide variety of
geometric domains, since the resulting linear systems can be prefactored once
and subsequently solved in near-linear time. In practice, distance can be
updated via the heat method an order of magnitude faster than with
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy. We
provide numerical evidence that the method converges to the exact geodesic
distance in the limit of refinement; we also explore smoothed approximations of
distance suitable for applications where more regularity is required.
