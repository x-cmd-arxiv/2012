the influence of a strong, uniform, static magnetic field, neglecting any form
of interactions. Since the density of states for the electrons changes due to
the presence of the magnetic field (which gives rise to Landau quantization),
the corresponding equation of state also gets modified. In order to investigate
the effect of very strong magnetic field, we focus only on systems in which a
maximum of either one, two or three Landau level(s) is/are occupied. This is
important since, if a very large number of Landau levels are filled, it implies
a very low magnetic field strength which yields back Chandrasekhar's celebrated
non-magnetic results. The maximum number of occupied Landau levels is fixed by
the correct choice of two parameters, namely the magnetic field strength and
the maximum Fermi energy of the system. We study the equations of state of
these one-level, two-level and three-level systems and compare them by taking
three different maximum Fermi energies. We also find the effect of the strong
magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the underlying star composed of
the gas stated above. We obtain an exciting result that, it is possible to have
an electron degenerate static star, namely magnetized white dwarfs, with a mass
significantly greater than the Chandrasekhar limit in the range 2.3-2.6M_Sun,
provided it has an appropriate magnetic field strength and central density. In
fact, recent observations of peculiar Type Ia supernovae - SN 2006gz, SN
2007if, SN 2009dc, SN 2003fg - seem to suggest super-Chandrasekhar-mass white
dwarfs with masses up to 2.4-2.8M_Sun, as their most likely progenitors.
Interestingly our results seem to lie within the observational limits.

laminar or turbulent. To determine the boundary between convective and absolute
instability, we use Orr--Sommerfeld stability theory, and a combination of
linear modal analysis and ray analysis. For turbulent gas flow, and for the
density ratio r=1000, we find large regions of parameter space that produce
absolute instability. These parameter regimes involve viscosity ratios of
direct relevance to oil/gas flows. If, instead, the gas layer is laminar,
absolute instability persists for the density ratio r=1000, although the
convective/absolute stability boundary occurs at a viscosity ratio that is an
order of magnitude smaller than in the turbulent case. Two further unstable
temporal modes exist in both the laminar and the turbulent cases, one of which
can exclude absolute instability. We compare our results with an
experimentally-determined flow-regime map, and discuss the potential
application of the present method to non-linear analyses.

massive cold dust component (Mdust ~ 5e+5 Msun, Tdust ~ 12 K), which was
suggested based on millimeter observations from the inner 18.4 arcsec. Assuming
a reasonable gas-to-dust ratio of ~ 400, the dust mass in NGC 205 translates
into a gas mass Mgas ~ 4-7e+6 Msun. The non-detection of [OI] and the low

linear motion of two particles with opposite signs of masses having a small
difference between their absolute values $m_{1,2}=\pm (\mu\pm \Delta \mu) $,
$\mu > 0$, $|\Delta \mu | \ll \mu$ and a small difference between their
velocities. Assuming that the weak-field limit holds and the dynamical system
is conservative an elementary treatment of the problem based on the laws of
energy and momentum conservation shows that the system can be accelerated
indefinitely, or attain very large asymptotic values of the Lorentz factor
$\gamma$. The system experiences indefinite acceleration when its
energy-momentum vector is null and the mass difference $\Delta \mu \le 0$. When
modulus of the square of the norm of the energy-momentum vector, $|N^2|$, is
sufficiently small the system can be accelerated to very large $\gamma \propto
|N^2|^{-1}$. It is stressed that when only leading terms in the ratio of a
characteristic gravitational radius to the distance between the particles are
retained our elementary analysis leads to equations of motion equivalent to
those derived from relativistic weak-field equations of motion of Havas and
Goldberg 1962. Thus, in the weak-field approximation, it is possible to bring
the system to the state with extremely high values of $\gamma$. The positive
energy carried by the particle with positive mass may be conveyed to other
physical bodies say, by intercepting this particle with a target. Suppose that
there is a process of production of such pairs and the particles with positive
mass are intercepted while the negative mass particles are expelled from the
region of space occupied by physical bodies of interest. This scheme could
provide a persistent transfer of positive energy to the bodies, which may be
classified as a 'Perpetuum Motion of Third Kind'.

that such configurations could potentially exist in a stable state, thereby

accretion disks during the infall of matter to the black hole and its effect to
the flow. While the flow far away from the black hole might be
non-relativistic, in the vicinity of the black hole it is expected to be
relativistic behaving more like radiation. Therefore, the ratio of gas pressure
to total pressure (beta) and the underlying polytropic index (gamma) should not
be constant throughout the flow. We obtain that accretion flows exhibit
significant variation of beta and then gamma, which affects solutions described
in the standard literature based on constant beta. Certain solutions for a
particular set of initial parameters with a constant beta do not exist when the
variation of beta is incorporated appropriately. We model the viscous
sub-Keplerian accretion disk with a nonzero component of advection and pressure
gradient around black holes by preserving the conservations of mass, momentum,
energy, supplemented by the evolution of beta. By solving the set of five
coupled differential equations, we obtain the thermo-hydrodynamical properties
of the flow. We show that during infall, beta of the flow could vary upto
~300%, while gamma upto ~20%. This might have a significant impact to the disk
solutions in explaining observed data, e.g. super-luminal jets from disks,
luminosity, and then extracting fundamental properties from them. Hence any
conclusion based on constant gamma and beta should be taken with caution and

colorings. The case considered here is a counting or hard constraint problem in
which the range or color graph carries a free and vertex transitive Abelian
group action so that the colors are identified with the elements of this group.
A Fourier transform is used to obtain an expansion for the numbers of colorings
with terms indexed by isthmus free subgraphs of the domain. The terms are
products of a polynomial in the edge density a of the color graph and the
number of colorings of the indexing subgraph of the domain into the
complementary color graph. The polynomial in a is independent of the color
group and the term has order (1-a) to the r where r is the number of vertices
minus the number of components in the indexing subgraph. Thus if (1-a) is small
there is a main term indexed by the empty subgraph which is a polynomial in a
and the first dependence on the coloring group occurs in the lowest order
corrections which are indexed by the shortest cycles in the graph and are of
order (1-a) to the g-1 where g is the length of these shortest cycles. The main
theorem is stated as a reciprocity law. Examples are given in which the
coloring groups are long cycles and products of short cycles and adjacent
vertices are required to have distant rather than distinct colors. The
chromatic polynomial of a graph corresponds to using any group and taking the
allowed set to be the complement of the identity.

dwarf spheroidal galaxies around the Milky Way. Among these is a pair of
satellites called Leo IV and Leo V. This pair is found at large distances from
the Milky Way (154 and 175 kpc respectively). The rather small difference in
radial distance, and the fact that they also show a close projected distance on
the sky, has led to the idea that we might be seeing a new pair of bound
galaxies - like the Magellanic Clouds. In this paper we investigate this
speculation by means of a simple integration code (confirming the results with
full N-body simulations). As the luminous mass of both faint dwarfs is far too
low to allow them to be bound, we simulate the pair assuming extended dark
matter haloes. Our results show that the minimum dark matter mass required for
the pair to be bound is rather high - ranging from 1.6 x 10^10 Msun to 5.4 x
10^10 Msun (within the virial radii). Computing the mass of dark matter within
a commonly adopted radius of 300 pc shows that our models are well within the
predicted range of dark matter content for satellites so faint. We therefore
conclude that it could be possible that the two galaxies constitute a bound
pair.

square root of energy z and the direction of the wave, \xi, interpreted as a

measure zero, we show that, as z\to +\infty, E(z,\xi) microlocally converges to
a measure \mu_\xi, in average on energy intervals of fixed size, [z,z+1], and
in \xi. We express the rate of convergence to the limit in terms of the
classical escape rate of the geodesic flow and its maximal expansion rate -
when the flow is Axiom A on the trapped set, this yields a negative power of z.
As an application, we obtain Weyl type asymptotic expansions for local traces
of spectral projectors with a remainder controlled in terms of the classical
escape rate.

supermassive black hole system. Determining the beam powers of powerful
classical double radio sources requires substantial observing time, so it would
be useful to determine the relationship between beam power and radio power so
that radio power could be used as a proxy for beam power. A sample of 31
powerful classical double radio sources with previously determined beam and
radio powers are studied; the sources have redshifts between about 0.056 and
1.8. It is found that the relationship between beam power, Lj, and radio power,
P, is well described by Log(Lj) = 0.84 Log(P) + 2.15, where both L_j and P are
in units of 10^(44) erg/s. This indicates that beam power is converted to radio
power with an efficiency of about 0.7%. The ratio of beam power to radio power
is studied as a function of redshift; there is no significant evidence for
redshift evolution of this ratio over the redshift range studied. The
relationship is consistent with empirical results obtained by Cavagnolo et al.
(2010) for radio sources in gas rich environments, which are primarily FRI
sources, and with the theoretical predictions of Willott et al. (1999).

ultra-cold atoms in a disordered lattice with controlled noise and tunable

both interaction and noise tend to suppress localization and restore transport,
although with completely different mechanisms. When only noise or interaction
are present we observe a diffusion dynamics that can be explained by existing
microscopic models. When noise and interaction are combined, we observe instead
a complex anomalous diffusion. By combining experimental measurements with
numerical simulations, we show that such anomalous behavior can be modeled with
a generalized diffusion equation, in which the noise- and interaction-induced
diffusions enter in an additive manner. Our study reveals also a more complex
interplay between the two diffusion mechanisms in regimes of strong interaction

most popular theories of iron-based superconductors because of their unusual
electronic structure [1]. Controversial photoemission data taken in the
superconducting state [2-7] are in conflict with highly magnetic state seen by
neutron-, muSR-spectroscopies and transport/thermodynamic probes [8-10]. These
results lead to suggestions to consider all iron-based materials as originating
from Mott-insulators or semiconductors, thus once again raising the question of
close relation between the cuprates and Fe-based superconductors [e.g. 2]. Here
we study electronic and magnetic properties of Rb0.77Fe1.61Se2 (Tc = 32.6 K) in
normal and superconducting states by means of photoemission and muSR
spectroscopies as well as band structure calculations. We demonstrate that the
puzzling behavior of these novel materials is the result of separation into
metallic (~12%) and insulating (~ 88%) phases. Only the former becomes
superconducting and has a usual electronic structure of electron-doped
FeSe-slabs. Our results thus imply that the antiferromagnetic insulating phase
is just a byproduct of Rb-intercalation and its magnetic properties have hardly
any relation to the superconductivity. Instead, we find that also in this,
already third class of iron-based compounds, the key ingredient for
superconductivity is a certain proximity of a van Hove singularity to the Fermi
level. These findings set the direction for effective search of new
superconducting materials.

clusters as obtained by Planck and by the ground-based interferometer, the
Arcminute Microkelvin Imager. Assuming a universal spherically-symmetric
Generalised Navarro, Frenk & White (GNFW) model for the cluster gas pressure
profile, we jointly constrain the integrated Compton-Y parameter (Y_500) and
the scale radius (theta_500) of each cluster. Our resulting constraints in the
Y_500-theta_500 2D parameter space derived from the two instruments overlap
significantly for eight of the clusters, although, overall, there is a tendency
for AMI to find the Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal to be smaller in angular size and
fainter than Planck. Significant discrepancies exist for the three remaining
clusters in the sample, namely A1413, A1914, and the newly-discovered Planck
cluster PLCKESZ G139.59+24.18. The robustness of the analysis of both the
Planck and AMI data is demonstrated through the use of detailed simulations,
which also discount confusion from residual point (radio) sources and from
diffuse astrophysical foregrounds as possible explanations for the
discrepancies found. For a subset of our cluster sample, we have investigated
the dependence of our results on the assumed pressure profile by repeating the
analysis adopting the best-fitting GNFW profile shape which best matches X-ray
observations. Adopting the best-fitting profile shape from the X-ray data does
not, in general, resolve the discrepancies found in this subset of five
clusters. Though based on a small sample, our results suggest that the adopted
GNFW model may not be sufficiently flexible to describe clusters universally.

the density, but the correspondence has subtleties. It corresponds better to
the log-density A than the overdensity \delta. A Gaussian distribution in \psi\
produces a distribution in A with slight skewness; in \delta, we find that in
many cases the skewness is further increased by 3.
  A local spherical-collapse-based (SC) fit found by Bernardeau gives a formula
for \psi's particle-by-particle behavior that works quite well, better than
applying Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) at first or second (2LPT) order.
In 2LPT, there is a roughly parabolic relation between initial and final \psi\

2LPT realizations should be used with caution. The SC fit excels at predicting
\psi\ until streams cross; then, for particles forming haloes, \psi\ plummets
as in a waterfall to -3. This gives a new method for producing N-particle
realizations. Compared to LPT realizations, such SC realizations give reduced
stream-crossing, and better visual and 1-point-PDF correspondence to the
results of full gravity. LPT, on the other hand, predicts large-scale flows and
the large-scale power-spectrum amplitude better, unless an empirical correction

by joining them pairwise, by adding links chosen randomly one by one from a set
of predefined `virtual' links. In contrast, in agglomerative percolation (AP)
clusters grow by choosing randomly a `target cluster' and joining it with all
its neighbors, as defined by the same set of virtual links. Previous studies
showed that AP is in different universality classes from OP for several types
of (virtual) networks (linear chains, trees, Erdos-Renyi networks), but most
surprising were the results for 2-d lattices: While AP on the triangular
lattice was found to be in the OP universality class, it behaved completely
differently on the square lattice. In the present paper we explain this
striking violation of universality by invoking bipartivity. While the square
lattice is a bipartite graph, the triangular lattice is not. In conformity with
this we show that AP on the honeycomb and simple cubic (3-d) lattices -- both
of which are bipartite -- are also not in the OP universality classes. More
precisely, we claim that this violation of universality is basically due to a
Z_2 symmetry that is spontaneously broken at the percolation threshold. We also
discuss AP on bipartite random networks and suitable generalizations of AP on
k-partite graphs.

completely obscured the orbit of star B and a large portion of the orbit of

2001/2002 to 2005/2006 while star A was fully visible, fully occulted, and
during several ingress and egress events. The H$\alpha$ line profile shows
dramatic changes in these time series data over timescales ranging from days to
years. A fraction of the variations are due to ""edge effects"" and depend only
on the height of star A above or below the razor sharp edge of the occulting
disk. Other observed variations depend on the orbital phase: the H$\alpha$
emission line profile changes from an inverse P Cygni type profile during
ingress to an enhanced double-peaked profile, with both a blue and red emission

semiconductors such as Si:P or Si:B. We explore the possibility that the loss
of metallic transport occurs through Mott localization of electrons into a
quantum spin liquid state with diffusive charge neutral ""spinon"" excitations.
Such a quantum spin liquid state can appear as an intermediate phase between
the metal and the Anderson-Mott insulator. An immediate testable consequence is
the presence of metallic thermal conductivity at low temperature in the
electrical insulator near the metal-insulator transition. Further we show that
though the transition is second order the zero temperature residual electrical
conductivity will jump as the transition is approached from the metallic side.
However the electrical conductivity will have a non-monotonic temperature
dependence that may complicate the extrapolation to zero temperature.
Signatures in other experiments and some comparisons with existing data are
made.

accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries. They heat the neutron star
envelope such that the burning of accreted hydrogen and helium becomes stable,
and the common shorter X-ray bursts are quenched. Short bursts reappear only
after the envelope cools down. We study multi-zone one-dimensional models of
the neutron star envelope, in which we follow carbon burning during the
superburst, and we include hydrogen and helium burning in the atmosphere above.
We investigate both the case of a solar composition and a helium-rich
atmosphere. This allows us to study for the first time a wide variety of
thermonuclear burning behavior as well as the transitions between the different
regimes in a self-consistent manner. For solar composition, burst quenching
ends much sooner than previously expected. This is because of the complex
interplay between the 3-alpha, hot CNO, and CNO breakout reactions. Stable
burning of hydrogen and helium transitions via marginally stable burning (mHz
QPOs) to less energetic bursts with short recurrence times. We find a
short-lived bursting mode where weaker and stronger bursts alternate.
Eventually the bursting behavior changes back to that of the pre-superburst
bursts. Because of the scarcity of observations, this transition has not been
directly detected after a superburst. Using the MINBAR burst catalog we
identify the shortest upper limit on the quenching time for 4U 1636-536, and
derive further constraints on the time scale on which bursts return.

formation of the first structures in the Universe prior to astrophysical
reheating and reionization (15<~z<200). These are the first simulations
initialized in a manner that self consistently account for the impact of
pressure on the rate of growth of modes, temperature fluctuations in the gas,
and the dark matter-baryon supersonic velocity difference. Even with these
improvements, these are still difficult times to simulate accurately as the
Jeans length of the cold intergalactic gas must be resolved while also
capturing a representative sample of the Universe.
  Our simulations support the finding of recent studies that the dark
matter-baryon velocity difference has a surprisingly large impact on the
accretion of gas onto the first star-forming minihalos (with masses of ~10^6
Msun). In fact, the halo gas is often significantly downwind of such halos and
with lower densities, which delays the formation of the first stars in most
locations in the Universe. We also show that dynamical friction plays an
important role in the nonlinear evolution of the differential velocity, acting
to erase this velocity difference quickly in overdense gas as well as sourcing
visually-apparent bow shocks and Mach cones throughout the Universe.
  We use simulations with both the GADGET and Enzo cosmological codes to test
the robustness of these conclusions. We find that particle coupling in GADGET
between the gas and dark matter particles can result in spurious growth that
mimics nonlinear growth in the matter power spectrum. In a companion paper, we
use the simulations presented here to make detailed estimates for the impact of
the dark matter--baryon velocity differential on redshifted 21cm radiation. The

Ages the baryons were typically moving supersonically with respect to the dark
matter with a spatially variable Mach number. Such supersonic motion may source
shocks that heat the Universe. This motion may also suppress star formation in
the first halos. Even a small amount of coupling of the 21cm signal to this
motion has the potential to vastly enhance the 21cm brightness temperature
fluctuations at 15<z<40 as well as to imprint acoustic oscillations in this
signal. We present estimates for the size of this coupling, which we calibrate
with a suite of cosmological simulations. Our simulations, discussed in detail
in a companion paper, are initialized to self-consistently account for gas
pressure and the dark matter-baryon relative velocity, v_bc (in contrast to
prior simulations). We find that the supersonic velocity difference
dramatically suppresses structure formation at 10-100 comoving kpc scales, it
sources shocks throughout the Universe, and it impacts the accretion of gas
onto the first star-forming minihalos (even for halo masses as large as ~10^7
Msun). However, we find that the v_bc-sourced temperature fluctuations can
contribute only as much as ~10% of the fluctuations in the 21cm signal. We do
find that v_bc could source an O(1) component in the power spectrum of the 21cm
signal via the X-ray (but not ultraviolet) backgrounds produced once the first
stars formed. In a scenario in which ~10^6 Msun minihalos reheated the Universe
via their X-ray backgrounds, we find that the pre-reionization 21cm signal
would be larger than previously anticipated and exhibit significant acoustic
features. We show that structure formation shocks are unable to heat the

finite-bandwidth images along the elevation vector, which produces spurious
signals in weak gravitational lensing shear measurements unless this
atmospheric dispersion is calibrated and removed to high precision. Because
astrometric solutions and PSF characteristics are typically calibrated from
stellar images, differences between the reference stars' spectra and the
galaxies' spectra will leave residual errors in both the astrometric positions
(dr) and in the second moment (width) of the wavelength-averaged PSF (dv) for
galaxies.We estimate the level of dv that will induce spurious weak lensing
signals in PSF-corrected galaxy shapes that exceed the statistical errors of
the DES and the LSST cosmic-shear experiments. We also estimate the dr signals
that will produce unacceptable spurious distortions after stacking of exposures
taken at different airmasses and hour angles. We also calculate the errors in
the griz bands, and find that dispersion systematics, uncorrected, are up to 6
and 2 times larger in g and r bands,respectively, than the requirements for the
DES error budget, but can be safely ignored in i and z bands. For the LSST
requirements, the factors are about 30, 10, and 3 in g, r, and i
bands,respectively. We find that a simple correction linear in galaxy color is
accurate enough to reduce dispersion shear systematics to insignificant levels
in the r band for DES and i band for LSST,but still as much as 5 times than the
requirements for LSST r-band observations. More complex corrections will likely
be able to reduce the systematic cosmic-shear errors below statistical errors
for LSST r band. But g-band effects remain large enough that it seems likely
that induced systematics will dominate the statistical errors of both surveys,

of the spin angular momentum of the astrophysical black hole (the Kerr
parameter $a$ -- a representative feature of the background black hole metric)

feature of the corresponding analogue space time) has been investigated for
axially symmetric inflow of hydrodynamic fluid onto a rotating black hole.
Since almost all astrophysical black holes are supposed to posses some degree
of intrinsic rotation, the influence of the Kerr parameter on classical
analogue models is very important to understand.
  For certain values of the initial boundary conditions describing the
aforementioned flow, more than one acoustic horizons, namely two black hole
type and one white hole type, may form, where the surface gravity may become
formally infinite at the acoustic white hole. The connection between the
corresponding analogue Hawking temperature with astrophysically relevant

fit values of these constants but also their errors. Some of the neutrino
oscillation data is statistically poor and cannot be treated by normal
(Gaussian) statistics. To extract confidence intervals when the statistics are
not normal, one should not utilize the value for chisquare versus confidence
level taken from normal statistics. Instead, we propose that one should use the
normalized likelihood function as a probability distribution; the relationship
between the correct chisquare and a given confidence level can be computed by
integrating over the likelihood function. This allows for a definition of
confidence level independent of the functional form of the !2 function; it is
particularly useful for cases in which the minimum of the !2 function is near a
boundary. We present two pedagogic examples and find that the proposed method
yields confidence intervals that can differ significantly from those obtained
by using the value of chisquare from normal statistics. For example, we find
that for the first data release of the T2K experiment the probability that
chisquare is not zero, as defined by the maximum confidence level at which the
value of zero is not allowed, is 92%. Using the value of chisquare at zero and
assigning a confidence level from normal statistics, a common practice, gives
the over estimation of 99.5%.

$U=(u_1,...,u_t)$ and $V=(v_1,...,v_t)$ where $u_i,v_j \in \mathbb{Z}_m^n$ with
the following inner product pattern: for any $i$, $< u_i,v_i>=0$, and for any

products $< u_i,v_j>$ take at most $q$ different values.
  Our interest in MV families stems from their recent application in the
construction of sub-exponential locally decodable codes (LDCs). There,
$q$-restricted MV families are used to construct LDCs with $q$ queries, and
there is special interest in the regime where $q$ is constant. When $m$ is a
prime it is known that such constructions yield codes with exponential block
length. However, for composite $m$ the behaviour is dramatically different. A
recent work by Efremenko [STOC 2009] (based on an approach initiated by
Yekhanin [JACM 2008]) gives the first sub-exponential LDC with constant
queries. It is based on a construction of a MV family of super-polynomial size
by Grolmusz [Combinatorica 2000] modulo composite $m$.
  In this work, we prove two lower bounds on the block length of LDCs which are
based on black box construction using MV families. When $q$ is constant (or
sufficiently small), we prove that such LDCs must have a quadratic block
length. When the modulus $m$ is constant (as it is in the construction of
Efremenko) we prove a super-polynomial lower bound on the block-length of the
LDCs, assuming a well-known conjecture in additive combinatorics, the
polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture over $\mathbb{Z}_m$.

between spectral index and viewing angle, the simulations indicate that the
difference in spectral index distributions can be explained by allowing BAL
quasar viewing angles to extend about 10 degrees farther from the radio jet
axis than non-BAL sources, though both can be seen at small angles. These
results show that orientation cannot be the only factor determining whether BAL

loop oscillation event occurred on 2011 March 8, triggered by a CME. The
multiwavelength analysis reveals the presence of multithermal strands in the
oscillating loop, whose dynamic behaviors are temperature-dependent, showing
differences in their oscillation amplitudes, phases and emission evolution. The
physical parameters of growing oscillations of two strands in 171 A are
measured and the 3-D loop geometry is determined using STEREO-A/EUVI data.
These strands have very similar frequencies, and between two 193 A strands a
quarter-period phase delay sets up. These features suggest the coupling between
kink oscillations of neighboring strands and the interpretation by the
collective kink mode as predicted by some models. However, the temperature
dependence of the multistarnded loop oscillations was not studied previously
and needs further investigation. The transverse loop oscillations are
associated with intensity and loop width variations. We suggest that the
amplitude-growing kink oscillations may be a result of continuous non-periodic
driving by magnetic deformation of the CME, which deposits energy into the loop
system at a rate faster than its loss.

transport a single q-bit down a J1-J2 Heisenberg spin chain using a quantum
adiabatic process. The motivation for investigating such processes comes from
the idea that this method of transport could potentially be used as a means of
sending data to various parts of a quantum computer made of artificial spins,
and that this method could take advantage of the easily prepared ground state
at the so called Majumdar-Ghosh point. We examine several annealing protocols
for this process and find similar result for all of them. The annealing process
works well up to a critical frustration threshold.

able to benefit simultaneously from these RAT's. However, the major issue in
heterogeneous wireless communications is how to choose the most suitable access

network selection strategy which combines two multi attribute decision making
(MADM) methods such as analytic network process (ANP) and the technique for
order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. The ANP
method is used to find the differentiate weights of available networks by

alternatives. Our new strategy for network selection can dealing with the
limitations of MADM methods which are the ranking abnormality and the ping-ponf

in many astronomical sources, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). We give a complete presentation of the analytical
approximations for the Compton scattering of synchrotron emission with both
weak and strong synchrotron self-absorption. All possible orders of the
characteristic synchrotron spectral breaks ($\nu_{\rm a}$, $\nu_{\rm m}$, and
$\nu_{\rm c}$) are studied. In the weak self-absorption regime, i.e., $\nu_{\rm
a} < \nu_c$, the electron energy distribution is not modified by the
self-absorption process. The shape of the SSC component broadly resembles that
of synchrotron, but with the following features: The SSC flux increases
linearly with frequency up to the SSC break frequency corresponding to the
self-absorption frequency $\nu_{\rm a}$; and the presence of a logarithmic term
in the high-frequency range of the SSC spectra makes it harder than the
power-law approximation. In the strong absorption regime, i.e. $\nu_{\rm a} >
\nu_{\rm c}$, heating of low energy electrons due to synchrotron absorption
leads to pile-up of electrons, and form a thermal component besides the broken
power-law component. This leads to two-component (thermal + non-thermal)
spectra for both the synchrotron and SSC spectral components. For $\nu_{\rm c}
< \nu_{\rm a} < \nu_{\rm m}$, the spectrum is thermal (non-thermal) -dominated
if $\nu_a > \sqrt{\nu_m \nu_c}$ ($\nu_a < \sqrt{\nu_m \nu_c}$). Similar to the
weak-absorption regime, the SSC spectral component is broader than the simple
broken power law approximation. We derive the critical condition for strong
absorption (electron pile-up), and discuss a case of GRB reverse shock emission
in a wind medium, which invokes $\nu_{\rm a} > {\rm max} (\nu_{\rm m}, \nu_{\rm
c})$.

Trojan (1173) Anchises. Our results reveal a most unusual object. By examining
observational data taken by IRAS, Akari and WISE between 11.5 and 60 microns,
along with variations in its optical lightcurve, we find Anchises is most
likely an elongated body, with an axes-ratio of ~1.4. This yields calculated
best-fit dimensions of 170x121x121km (an equivalent diameter of 136+18/-11km).
We find the observations are best fit by Anchises having a retrograde sense of
rotation, and an unusually high thermal inertia (25 to 100 Jm-2s-0.5K-1). The
geometric albedo is found to be 0.027 (+0.006/-0.007). Anchises therefore has
one of the highest published thermal inertias of any object larger than 100km
in diameter, at such large heliocentric distances, and is one of the lowest
albedo objects ever observed. More observations are needed to see if there is a
link between the very shallow phase curve, with almost no opposition effect,
and the derived thermal properties for this large Trojan asteroid. Our
dynamical investigation of Anchises' orbit has revealed it to be dynamically
unstable on timescales of hundreds of Myr, similar to the unstable Neptunian
Trojans 2001 QR322 and 2008 LC18. Unlike those objects, we find that Anchises'
dynamical stability is not a function of its initial orbital elements, the
result of the exceptional precision with which its orbit is known. This is the
first time that a Jovian Trojan has been shown to be dynamically unstable, and
adds weight to the idea that planetary Trojans represent a significant ongoing
contribution to the Centaur population, the parents of the short-period comets.
The observed instability does not rule out a primordial origin for Anchises,
but when taken in concert with the result of our thermophysical analysis,
suggest that it would be a fascinating target for future study.

spectral-ripple subtraction, at spectral-line widths of \Deltav_FWHM > 103 km/s

spectral-line profiles are consistent with the theory that we are seeing
different orientations of the absorbing gas, in both the host galaxy and

momentum (p_t) are jet-hadrons produced inside the fluid. They pick up quarks
and antiquarks (or diquarks) from the thermal matter rather than creating them
via the Schwinger mechanism -- the usual mechanism of hadron production from
string fragmentation. These hadrons carry plasma properties (flavor, flow), but
also the large momentum of the transversely moving string segment connecting
quark and antiquark (or diquark). They therefore show up at quite large values
of p_t, not polluted by soft particle production. We will show that this
mechanism leads to a pronounced peak in the lambda / kaon ratio at intermediate

predictions is the perceived ambiguity in setting the renormalization scale
$\mu_r$. For example, by using the conventional way of setting $\mu_r \in
[m_t/2,2m_t]$, one obtains the total $t \bar{t}$ production cross-section
$\sigma_{t \bar{t}}$ with the uncertainty $\Delta \sigma_{t \bar{t}}/\sigma_{t
\bar{t}}\sim ({}^{+3%}_{-4%})$ at the Tevatron and LHC even for the present
NNLO level. The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) eliminates the
renormalization scale ambiguity in precision tests of Abelian QED and
non-Abelian QCD theories. In this paper we apply PMC scale-setting to predict
the $t \bar t$ cross-section $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ at the Tevatron and LHC
colliders. It is found that $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ remains almost unchanged by
varying $\mu^{\rm init}_r$ within the region of $[m_t/4,4m_t]$. The convergence
of the expansion series is greatly improved. For the $(q\bar{q})$-channel,
which is dominant at the Tevatron, its NLO PMC scale is much smaller than the
top-quark mass in the small $x$-region, and thus its NLO cross-section is
increased by about a factor of two. In the case of the $(gg)$-channel, which is
dominant at the LHC, its NLO PMC scale slightly increases with the subprocess
collision energy $\sqrt{s}$, but it is still smaller than $m_t$ for
$\sqrt{s}\lesssim 1$ TeV, and the resulting NLO cross-section is increased by
$\sim 20%$. As a result, a larger $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ is obtained in comparison
to the conventional scale-setting method, which agrees well with the present
Tevatron and LHC data. More explicitly, by setting $m_t=172.9\pm 1.1$ GeV, we
predict $\sigma_{\rm Tevatron,\;1.96\,TeV} = 7.626^{+0.265}_{-0.257}$ pb,
$\sigma_{\rm LHC,\;7\,TeV} = 171.8^{+5.8}_{-5.6}$ pb and $\sigma_{\rm

difficult to access low temperature and nonzero chemical potential $\mu$
regions in lattice QCD simulations. We address this issue in a lattice QCD with
the use of a dimensional reduction formula of the fermion determinant.
  We investigate spectral properties of a reduced matrix of the reduction
formula. Lattice simulations with different lattice sizes show that the
eigenvalues of the reduced matrix follow a scaling law for the temporal size
$N_t$. The properties of the fermion determinant are examined using the
reduction formula. We find that as a consequence of the $N_t$ scaling law, the
fermion determinant becomes insensitive to $\mu$ as $T$ decreases, and
$\mu$-independent at T=0 for $\mu<m_\pi/2$.
  The $N_t$ scaling law provides two types of the low temperature limit of the
fermion determinant: (i) for low density and (ii) for high-density. The fermion
determinant becomes real and the theory is free from the sign problem in both
cases. In case of (ii), QCD approaches to a theory, where quarks interact only
in spatial directions, and gluons interact via the ordinary Yang-Mills action.
The partition function becomes exactly $Z_3$ invariant even in the presence of
dynamical quarks because of the absence of the temporal interaction of quarks.
  The reduction formula is also applied to the canonical formalism and Lee-Yang
zero theorem. We find characteristic temperature dependences of the canonical
distribution and of Lee-Yang zero trajectory. Using an assumption on the
canonical partition function, we discuss physical meaning of those temperature
dependences and show that the change of the canonical distribution and Lee-Yang
zero trajectory are related to the existence/absence of $\mu$-induced phase
transitions.

= 3.1 K is induced by the bond breaking in a narrow range of x > xc in
Ir1-xPtxTe2. This result indicates that structural fluctuations can be involved
in the emergence of superconductivity.

with atomic-scale roughness, the periodic lateral frictional force and
stochastic fluctuations may induce stick-slip motion of the cantilever tip,
which greatly decreases the precision of the nano manipulation. This unwanted
motion cannot be reduced by open-loop control especially when there exist
parameter uncertainties in the system model, and thus needs to introduce
feedback control. However, real-time feedback cannot be realized by the
existing virtual reality virtual feedback techniques based on the position
sensing capacity of the atomic force microscopy (AFM). To solve this problem,
we propose a new method to design real-time feedback control based on the force
sensing approach to compensate for the disturbances and thus reduce the
stick-slip motion of the cantilever tip. Theoretical analysis and numerical
simulations show that the controlled motion of the cantilever tip tracks the
desired trajectory with much higher precision. Further investigation shows that
our proposal is robust under various parameter uncertainties. Our study opens
up new perspectives of real-time nano manipulation.

(BCNNRs) are investigated using the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)
approach. We find that the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) can be
remarkably enhanced by periodically embedding hexagonal BN (h-BN) into graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs). Compared to pristine GNRs, the ZT for armchair-edged BCNNRs
with width index 3p+2 is enhanced up to 10~20 times while the ZT of nanoribbons
with other widths is enhanced just by 1.5~3 times. As for zigzag-edge
nanoribbons, the ZT is enhanced up to 2~3 times. This improvement comes from
the combined increase in the Seebeck coefficient and the reduction in the
thermal conductivity outweighing the decrease in the electrical conductance. In
addition, the effect of component ratio of h-BN on the thermoelectric transport
properties is discussed. These results qualify BCNNRs as a promising candidate
for building outstanding thermoelectric devices.

a duty cycle close to 100%. This makes it well suited for an extensive
observation of neutrinos produced in astrophysical transient sources. In the
surrounding medium of blazars, i.e. active galactic nuclei with their jets
pointing almost directly towards the observer, neutrinos may be produced
together with gamma-rays by hadronic interactions, so a strong correlation
between neutrinos and gamma-rays emissions is expected. The time variability
information of the studied source can be obtained by the gamma-ray light curves
measured by the LAT instrument on-board the Fermi satellite. If the expected
neutrino flux observation is reduced to a narrow window around the assumed
neutrino production period, the point-source sensitivity can be drastically
improved. The ANTARES data collected in 2008 has been analysed looking for
neutrinos detected in the high state period of ten bright and variable Fermi
sources assuming that the neutrino emission follows the gamma-ray light curves.
First results show a sensitivity improvement by a factor 2-3 with respect to a
standard time-integrated point source search. The analysis has been done with
an unbinned method based on the minimization of a likelihood ratio applied to
data corresponding to a live time of 60 days. The width of the flaring periods
ranges from 1 to 20 days. Despite the fact that the most significant studied
source is compatible with background fluctuations, recently detected flares
promise interesting future analyse.

positive divisors of $N$ equals $2N$, denoted by $\sigma(N) = 2N$. The question
of the existence of odd perfect numbers (OPNs) is one of the longest unsolved
problems of number theory. This thesis presents some of the old as well as new
approaches to solving the OPN Problem. In particular, a conjecture predicting
an injective and surjective mapping $X = \sigma(p^k)/p^k, Y = \sigma(m^2)/m^2$
between OPNs $N = {p^k}{m^2}$ (with Euler factor $p^k$) and rational points on
the hyperbolic arc $XY = 2$ with $1 < X < 1.25 < 1.6 < Y < 2$ and $2.85 < X + Y
< 3$, is disproved. Various results on the abundancy index and solitary numbers
are used in the disproof. Numerical evidence against the said conjecture will
likewise be discussed. We will show that if an OPN $N$ has the form above, then
$p^k < (2/3){m^2}$ follows from \cite{D10}. We will also attempt to prove a
conjectured improvement of this last result to $p^k < m$ by observing that
$\sigma(p^k)/m \neq 1$ and $\sigma(p^k)/m \neq \sigma(m)/p^k$ in all cases.
Lastly, we also prove the following generalization: If $N =
\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^r {{p_i}^{{\alpha}_i}}$ is the canonical factorization
of an OPN $N$, then $$\sigma({p_i}^{{\alpha}_i}) \leq
(2/3){\frac{N}{{p_i}^{{\alpha}_i}}}$$ for all $i$. This gives rise to the
inequality $$N^{2 - r} \leq (1/3)(2/3)^{r - 1}$$ which is true for all $r$,
where $r = \omega(N)$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $N$.

the behaviour of traders at corresponding investment horizons. The proposed
methodology is moreover able to account for impact of jumps due to a recently
proposed jump wavelet two scale realized volatility estimator. We propose a
realized Jump-GARCH models estimated in two versions using maximum likelihood
as well as observation-driven estimation framework of generalized
autoregressive score. We compare forecasts using several popular realized
volatility measures on foreign exchange rate futures data covering the recent

interesting insight into the volatility process is also provided by its

classical and quantum cosmological models in the framework of the recently
proposed nonlinear massive gravity theory. Although the constraints which are
present in this theory prevent it from admitting the flat and closed FRW models
as its cosmological solutions, for the open FRW universe, it is not the case.
We have shown that, either in the absence of matter or in the presence of a
perfect fluid, the classical field equations of such a theory adopt physical
solutions for the open FRW model, in which the mass term shows itself as a
cosmological constant. These classical solutions consist of two distinguishable
branches: One is a contacting universe which tends to a future singularity with
zero size, while another is an expanding universe having a past singularity
from which it begins its evolution. A classically forbidden region separates
these two branches from each other. We then employ the familiar canonical
quantization procedure in the given cosmological setting to find the
cosmological wave functions. We use the resulting wave function to investigate
the possibility of the avoidance of classical singularities due to quantum
effects. It is shown that the quantum expectation values of the scale factor,
although they have either contracting or expanding phases like their classical
counterparts, are not disconnected from each other. Indeed, the classically
forbidden region may be replaced by a bouncing period in which the scale factor
bounces from the contraction to its expansion eras. Using the Bohmian approach
of quantum mechanics, we also compute the Bohmian trajectory and the quantum
potential related to the system, which their analysis shows are the direct
effects of the mass term on the dynamics of the universe.

study the effect of high magnetic field on relativistic cold electron, and
hence its effect on the stability and the mass-radius relation of a magnetic
white dwarf. In strong magnetic fields, the equation of state of the Fermi gas
is modified and Landau quantization comes into play. For relatively very high
magnetic fields (with respect to the energy density of matter) the number of
Landau levels is restricted to one or two. We analyse the equation of states
for magnetized electron degenerate gas analytically and attempt to understand
the conditions in which transitions from the zero-th Landau level to first

star collapsing to a white dwarf, and the mass-radius relation of the resulting
star. We obtain an interesting theoretical result that it is possible to have
white dwarfs with mass more than the mass set by Chandrasekhar limit.

viscoelastic cores. The tidal dissipation of such solid regions,
gravitationally perturbed by a companion body, highly depends on their rheology
and on the tidal frequency. Therefore, modelling tidal interactions presents a
high interest to provide constraints on planets' properties and to understand
their history and their evolution, in our Solar System or in exoplanetary
systems. We examine the equilibrium tide in the anelastic parts of a planet
whatever the rheology, taking into account the presence of a fluid envelope of
constant density. We show how to obtain the different Love numbers that
describe its tidal deformation. Thus, we discuss how the tidal dissipation in
solid parts depends on the planet's internal structure and rheology. Finally,
we show how the results may be implemented to describe the dynamical evolution
of planetary systems. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the
shape of the planet adiabatically along the line of centers. Then, the response
potential of the body to the tidal potential defines the complex Love numbers
whose real part corresponds to the purely adiabatic elastic deformation, while
its imaginary part accounts for dissipation. This dissipation is responsible
for the imaginary part of the disturbing function, which is implemented in the
dynamical evolution equations, from which we derive the characteristic
evolution times. The rate at which the system evolves depends on the physical
properties of tidal dissipation, and specifically on how the shear modulus
varies with tidal frequency, on the radius and also the rheological properties
of the solid core. The quantification of the tidal dissipation in solid cores
of giant planets reveals a possible high dissipation which may compete with
dissipation in fluid layers.

spectra. A negative polarisation rate of the photoluminescence, optical pumping
of the resident electron and the built-up of dynamic nuclear spin polarisation
(DNSP) are observed in time-resolved optical pumping experiments when the
quantum dot is excited at higher energy than the hot trion triplet state. The
time and magnetic field dependence of the polarisation rate of the $X^-$
emission allows to probe the dynamics of formation of the DNSP in the optical
pumping regime. We demonstrate using time-resolved measurements that the
creation of a DNSP at B=0T efficiently prevents longitudinal spin relaxation of
the electron caused by fluctuations of the nuclear spin bath. The DNSP is built
in the microsecond range at high excitation intensity. A relaxation time of the
DNSP in about 10 microseconds is observed at $B=0T$ and significantly increases

properties. However, it is a common experience that eliciting a honest prior
may be difficult and, in practice, people often take an {\em empirical Bayes}
approach, plugging empirical estimates of the prior hyperparameters into the
posterior distribution. Even if not rigorously justified, the underlying idea
is that, when the sample size is large, empirical Bayes leads to ""similar""
inferential answers. Yet, precise mathematical results seem to be missing. In
this work, we give a more rigorous justification in terms of merging of Bayes
and empirical Bayes posterior distributions. We consider two notions of
merging: Bayesian weak merging and frequentist merging in total variation.
Since weak merging is related to consistency, we provide sufficient conditions
for consistency of empirical Bayes posteriors. Also, we show that, under
regularity conditions, the empirical Bayes procedure asymptotically selects the
value of the hyperparameter for which the prior mostly favors the ""truth"".

  equation: optimality of a non-refocusing criterion",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the high frequency Helmholtz equation with a variable refraction
index $n^2(x)$ ($x \in \R^d$), supplemented with a given high frequency source
term supported near the origin $x=0$. A small absorption parameter
$\alpha_{\varepsilon}>0$ is added, which somehow prescribes a radiation
condition at infinity for the considered Helmholtz equation. The semi-classical
parameter is $\varepsilon>0$. We let $\eps$ and $\a_\eps$ go to zero {\em
simultaneaously}. We study the question whether the indirectly prescribed
radiation condition at infinity is satisfied {\em uniformly} along the
asymptotic process $\eps \to 0$, or, in other words, whether the conveniently
rescaled solution to the considered equation goes to the {\em outgoing}
solution to the natural limiting Helmholtz equation. This question has been
previously studied by the first autor. It is proved that the radiation
condition is indeed satisfied uniformly in $\eps$, provided the refraction
index satisfies a specific {\em non-refocusing condition}, a condition that is
first pointed out in this reference. The non-refocusing condition requires, in
essence, that the rays of geometric optics naturally associated with the
high-frequency Helmholtz operator, and that are sent from the origin $x=0$ at
time $t=0$, should not refocus at some later time $t>0$ near the origin again.
In the present text we show the {\em optimality} of the above mentionned
non-refocusing condition, in the following sense. We exhibit a refraction index
which {\em does} refocus the rays of geometric optics sent from the origin near
the origin again, and, on the other hand, we completely compute the asymptotic
behaviour of the solution to the associated Helmholtz equation: we show that
the limiting solution {\em does not} satisfy the natural radiation condition at
infinity. More precisely, we show that the limiting solution is a {\em
perturbation} of the outgoing solution to the natural limiting Helmholtz
equation, and that the perturbing term explicitly involves the contribution of
the rays radiated from the origin which go back to the origin. This term is

properties of selfadjoint operators in Krein spaces. It is our aim to show that
also sign type spectra for normal operators in Krein spaces provide insight in
the spectral nature of the operator: If the real part and the imaginary part of
a normal operator in a Krein space have real spectra only and if the growth of
the resolvent of the imaginary part (close to the real axis) is of finite
order, then the normal operator possesses a local spectral function defined for
Borel subsets of the spectrum which belong to positive (negative) type
spectrum. Moreover, the restriction of the normal operator to the spectral
subspace corresponding to such a Borel subset is a normal operator in some
Hilbert space. In particular, if the spectrum consists entirely out of positive
and negative type spectrum, then the operator is similar to a normal operator
in some Hilbert space. We use this result to show the existence of operator
roots of a class of quadratic operator polynomials with normal coefficients.

positive bias to local fNL at low frequencies but this bias is efficiently
reduced by masking detectable sources. IR sources produce a negative bias at
high frequencies, which is not dimmed by the masking, as their clustering is

order. We consider properties of ultrafilters which affect saturation of
unstable theories: the lower cofinality $\lcf(\aleph_0, \de)$ of $\aleph_0$
modulo $\de$, saturation of the minimum unstable theory (the random graph),
flexibility, goodness, goodness for equality, and realization of symmetric
cuts. We work in ZFC except when noted, as several constructions appeal to
complete ultrafilters thus assume a measurable cardinal. The main results are
as follows. First, we investigate the strength of flexibility, detected by
non-low theories. Assuming $\kappa > \aleph_0$ is measurable, we construct a
regular ultrafilter on $\lambda \geq 2^\kappa$ which is flexible (thus: ok) but
not good, and which moreover has large $\lcf(\aleph_0)$ but does not even
saturate models of the random graph. We prove that there is a loss of
saturation in regular ultrapowers of unstable theories, and give a new proof
that there is a loss of saturation in ultrapowers of non-simple theories.
Finally, we investigate realization and omission of symmetric cuts, significant
both because of the maximality of the strict order property in Keisler's order,
and by recent work of the authors on $SOP_2$. We prove that for any $n <
\omega$, assuming the existence of $n$ measurable cardinals below $\lambda$,
there is a regular ultrafilter $D$ on $\lambda$ such that any $D$-ultrapower of
a model of linear order will have $n$ alternations of cuts, as defined below.
Moreover, $D$ will $\lambda^+$-saturate all stable theories but will not
$(2^{\kappa})^+$-saturate any unstable theory, where $\kappa$ is the smallest
measurable cardinal used in the construction.

serves as a gravity model which can be tuned to facilitate or inhibit the
network percolation in a generic view, cover a broad range of thresholds.
Moreover, it yields a set of new scaling relations. In the present work, we
develop an approach to determine critical points for them by simulating the
temporal evolutions of type-I, type-II and type-III links(chosen from both
inter-cluster links, an intra-cluster link compared with an inter-cluster one,
and both intra-cluster ones, respectively) and corresponding average lengths.
Numerical results have revealed objective competition between fractions,
average lengths of three types of links, verified the balance happened at
critical points. The variation of decay exponents $a$ or transmission radius
$R$ always shifts the temporal pace of the evolution, while the steady average
lengths and the fractions of links always keep unchanged just as the values in
Achlioptas process. Strategy with maximum gravity can keep steady average
length, while that with minimum one can surpass it. Without the confinement of
transmission range, $\bar{l} \to \infty$ in thermodynamic limit, while
$\bar{l}$ does not when with it. However, both mechanisms support critical

functional for real-time correlation functions can be written down using the
Schwinger-Keldysh closed time path. This can be used to construct a
nonequilibrium functional renormalization group along similar lines as for
Euclidean field theories in thermal equilibrium. Important differences include
the absence of a fluctuation-dissipation relation for general
out-of-equilibrium situations. The nonequilibrium renormalization group takes
on a particularly simple form at a fixed point, where the corresponding
scale-invariant system becomes independent of the details of the initial
density matrix. We discuss some basic examples, for which we derive a hierarchy
of fixed point solutions with increasing complexity from vacuum and thermal
equilibrium to nonequilibrium. The latter solutions are then associated to the
phenomenon of turbulence in quantum field theory.

some of the exponential variance by allowing annihilation of noise -- whenever
two walkers arrive at the same configuration with opposite signs, they are
removed from the simulation. While FCI-QMC has been quite successful for
quantum chemistry problems, its application to problems in condensed systems
has been limited. In this paper, we apply FCI-QMC to the Fermi polaron problem,
which provides an ideal test-bed for improving the algorithm. In its simplest
form, FCI-QMC is unstable for even a fairly small system sizes. However, with a

stronger among the two lines, that Lyman beta fluorescence plays an important
role in their excitation. Recombination analysis of the HI lines is done which

baryonic mass vs rotational velocity in spiral galaxies) in the LCDM paradigm
has proved problematic. Simple calculations suggest too low a slope and too
high a scatter, and recent semi-analytic models and numerical galaxy
simulations typically fail to reproduce some aspects of the relation.
Furthermore, the assumptions underlying one model are often inconsistent with
those behind another. This paper aims to develop a rigorous prediction for the
BTFR in the context of LCDM, using only a priori expected effects and
relations, a minimum of theoretical assumptions, and no free parameters. The
robustness of the relation to changes in key galactic parameters will be
explored. I adopt a modular approach, taking each of the stand alone galaxy
relations necessary for constructing the BTFR from up-to-date numerical
simulations of dark halos. These relations -- and their expected scatter -- are
used to describe model spirals with a range of masses, resulting in a band in
the space of the BTFR that represents the current best guess for the LCDM
prediction. Consistent treatment of expected LCDM effects goes a large way
towards reconciling the naive slope-3 LCDM prediction with the data, especially
in the range 10^9 M_sun < M_bar < 10^11 M_sun. The theoretical BTFR becomes
significantly curved at M_bar > 10^11 M_sun, but this is difficult to test
observationally due to the scarcity of extremely high mass spirals. Low mass
gas-rich galaxies have systematically lower rotational velocity than the LCDM
prediction, although the relation used to describe baryon mass fractions must
be extrapolated in this regime. The fact that the BTFR slope derived here is
significantly greater than in early predictions is a direct consequence of a
corresponding increase in the expected sensitivity of baryon mass fraction to
total halo mass.

the predictions for the cosmological neutrino background (C$\nu$B) temperature
when one treats neutrino flavors in the framework of composite quantum systems.
Assuming that the final stage of neutrino interactions with the $\gamma
e^{-}e^{+}$ radiation plasma before decoupling works as a measurement scheme
that projects neutrinos into flavor quantum states, the resulting
free-streaming neutrinos can be described as a statistical ensemble of
flavor-mixed neutrinos. Even not corresponding to an electronic-flavor pure
state, after decoupling the statistical ensemble is described by a density
matrix that evolves in time with the full Hamiltonian accounting for flavor
mixing, momentum delocalization and, in case of an open quantum system
approach, decoherence effects. Since the statistical weights, $w$, shall follow
the electron elastic scattering cross section rapport given by $0.16\,w_{e} =
w_{\mu} = w_{\tau}$, the von-Neumann entropy will deserve some special
attention. Depending on the quantum measurement scheme used for quantifying the
entropy, mixing associated to dissipative effects can lead to an increasing of
the flavor associated von-Neumann entropy for free-streaming neutrinos. The
production of von-Neumann entropy mitigates the constraints on the predictions
for energy densities and temperatures of a cosmologically evolving isentropic
fluid, in this case, the cosmological neutrino background. The effects of
entropy changes on the cosmological neutrino temperature are quantified, and
the {\em constraint} involving the number of neutrino species, $N_{\nu} \approx
3$, in the phenomenological confront with Big Bang nucleosynthesis parameters
is consistently relieved.

amplitude events following and followed by long periods of ""ripening"". Major
earthquakes surely belong to the class of 'catastrophic' events. Because of the
space-time scales involved, an experimental approach is often difficult, not to
say impossible, however desirable it could be. Described in this article is a
""laboratory"" setup that yields data of a type that is amenable to theoretical
methods of prediction. Observations are made of a critical slowing down in the
noisy signal of a solder wire creeping under constant stress. This effect is
shown to be a fair signal of the forthcoming catastrophe in both of two
dynamical models. The first is an ""abstract"" model in which a time dependent
quantity drifts slowly but makes quick jumps from time to time. The second is a
realistic physical model for the collective motion of dislocations (the
Ananthakrishna set of equations for creep). Hope thus exists that similar
changes in the response to noise could forewarn catastrophes in other
situations, where such precursor effects should manifest early enough.

polytopes are considered in parallel. The underlying finite Coxeter groups are
those of simple Lie algebras of types An, Bn, Cn, F4 and of
non-crystallographic Coxeter groups H3, H4. Our method consists in recursively
decorating the appropriate Coxeter-Dynkin diagram. Each recursion step provides
the essential information about faces of a specific dimension. If, at each
recursion step, all of the faces are in the same Coxeter group orbit, i.e. are
identical, the solid is called Platonic.

physical properties. The uncertainty in the simultaneous knowledge of the
position deviation and the average rate of change of this deviation is found to
be governed by a relation equivalent to the one discovered by Heisenberg in
1925. Conversely, we prove that any physical system with a continuous position
function that is subject to an uncertainty relation must have a nowhere
differentiable position function, which makes the set of continuous and nowhere
