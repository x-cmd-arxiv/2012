the quarkyonic phase, adding the flavor-dependent complex chemical potentials
\mu_f=\mu+iT\theta_f with (\theta_f)=(0, \theta, -\theta) to the Polyakov-loop
extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. When \theta=0, the PNJL model with
the \mu_f agrees with the standard PNJL model with the real chemical potential
\mu. When \theta=2\pi/3, meanwhile, the PNJL model with the \mu_f has the
Z_{Nc} symmetry exactly for any real \mu, so that the quarkyonic phase exists
at small T and large \mu. Once \theta varies from 2\pi/3, the quarkyonic phase
exists only on a line of T=0 and \mu larger than the dynamical quark mass, and
the region at small T and large \mu is dominated by the quarkyonic-like phase
in which the Polyakov loop is small but finite.

the size of the CPU registers and the data-path are limited. Consequently,
arithmetic operations such as addition, can only be performed on numbers of
that length. To solve the problem of computation on big-integer numbers,
different algorithms were developed. However, these algorithms are considerably
slow because they operate on individual bits; and are only designed to run over
single-processor computers. In this paper, two algorithms for handling
arithmetic addition on big-integer numbers are presented. The first algorithm
is sequential while the second is parallel. Both algorithms, unlike existing
ones, perform addition on blocks or tokens of 60 bits (18 digits), and thus
boosting the execution time by a factor of 60.

understand their composition and formation processes. However, the large
contrast ratio of the brightness of each object to that of its parent star
limits our ability to extract a clean spectrum, free from any significant
contribution from the star. During the development of the long slit
spectroscopy (LSS) mode of IRDIS, the dual-band imager and spectrograph of
SPHERE, we proposed a data analysis method to estimate and remove the
contributions of the stellar spectrum. This method has never been tested on
real data because of the lack of instrumentation capable of combining adaptive
optics (AO), coronagraphy, and LSS. Nonetheless, a similar attenuation of the
star can be obtained using a particular observing configuration. Test data were
acquired using the AO-assisted spectrograph VLT/NACO. We obtained new J- and
H-band spectra of SCR J1845-6357 B, a T6 companion to a nearby (3.85\pm0.02 pc)
M8 star. This system is a well-suited benchmark as it is relatively wide
(~1.0"") with a modest contrast ratio (~4 mag), and a previously published JHK
spectrum is available for reference. We demonstrate that (1) our method is
efficient at estimating and removing the stellar contribution, (2) it allows to
properly recover the spectral shape of the companion, and (3) it is essential
to obtain an unbiased estimation of physical parameters. We also show that the
slit configuration associated with this method allows us to use long exposure
times with high throughput producing high signal-to-noise ratio data. However,
the signal of the companion gets over-subtracted, particularly in our J-band
data, compelling us to use a fake companion spectrum to estimate and compensate
for the loss of flux. Finally, we report a new astrometric measurement of the
position of the companion (sep = 0.817"", PA = 227.92 deg).

not due to a Slater mechanism, and it is stabilized by electron correlation.
HSE also reproduces the pressure-driven metalization. Our findings corroborate
previous analyses suggesting that the properties of this compound can be

due to the collapse of massive rotating stars. The precise collapse process
itself, however, is not yet fully understood. Strong winds, outbursts, and
intense ionizing UV radiation from single stars or strongly interacting
binaries are expected to destroy the molecular cloud cores that give birth to
them and create highly complex circumburst environments for the explosion. Such
environments might imprint features on GRB light curves that uniquely identify
the nature of the progenitor and its collapse. We have performed numerical
simulations of realistic environments for a variety of long-duration GRB
progenitors with ZEUS-MP, and have developed an analytical method for
calculating GRB light curves in these profiles. Though a full,
three-dimensional, relativistic magnetohydrodynamical computational model is
required to precisely describe the light curve from a GRB in complex
environments, our method can provide a qualitative understanding of these
phenomena. We find that, in the context of the standard afterglow model,
massive shells around GRBs produce strong signatures in their light curves, and
that this can distinguish them from those occurring in uniform media or steady
winds. These features can constrain the mass of the shell and the properties of
the wind before and after the ejection. Moreover, the interaction of the GRB
with the circumburst shell is seen to produce features that are consistent with
observed X-ray flares that are often attributed to delayed energy injection by
the central engine. Our algorithm for computing light curves is also applicable
to GRBs in a variety of environments such as those in high-redshift
cosmological halos or protogalaxies, both of which will soon be targets of
future surveys such as JANUS or Lobster.

commonly used assortativity coefficient is that in disassortative networks its
magnitude decreases with the network size. We mathematically explain this
phenomenon and validate the results on synthetic graphs and real-world network
data. As an alternative, we suggest to use rank correlation measures such as
Spearman's rho. Our experiments convincingly show that Spearman's rho produces
consistent values in graphs of different sizes but similar structure, and it is
able to reveal strong (positive or negative) dependencies in large graphs. In
particular, we discover much stronger negative degree-degree dependencies} in
Web graphs than was previously thought. {Rank correlations allow us to compare
the assortativity of networks of different sizes, which is impossible with the
assortativity coefficient due to its genuine dependence on the network size. We
conclude that rank correlations provide a suitable and informative method for
uncovering network mixing patterns.

essentially historical---ellipsoidal harmonics developed during the late 19th

are expressible in closed form. Each higher-order term requires the solution of
an eigenvalue problem, and tedious manual computation seems to have discouraged
applications and theoretical studies. The second explanation is practical: even
with modern computers and accurate eigenvalue algorithms, expansions in
ellipsoidal harmonics are significantly more challenging to compute than those
in Cartesian or spherical coordinates. The present implementations reduce the
""barrier to entry"" by providing an easy and free way for the community to begin
using ellipsoidal harmonics in actual research. We demonstrate our
implementation using the specific and physiologically crucial problem of how
charged proteins interact with their environment, and ask: what other
analytical tools await re-discovery in an era of inexpensive computation?

results with models for the evolution of the stellar wind, stellar XUV fluxes
and planetary exosphere characteristics, we determine the properties of the
magnetosphere and the exobase radius in order to estimate the level of
atmospheric mass losses. We use this model to evaluate the magnetic protection
of the potentially habitable super-Earths GJ 667Cc, Gl 581d and HD 85512b. We
confirm that Earth-like planets, even under the highest attainable magnetic
field strengths, will lose a significant fraction of their atmospheric
volatiles if they are tidally locked in the habitable zone of dM stars, or even
if having N/O-rich atmospheres they are in habitable zones closer than $\sim$

at the factory will become less practical. We would like for non-technical
human owners to be able to communicate, through interaction with their robot,

During task communication the robot must infer the details of the task from
unstructured human signals and it must choose actions that facilitate this
inference. In this paper we propose the use of a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) for representing the task communication problem; with
the unobservable task details and unobservable intentions of the human teacher
captured in the state, with all signals from the human represented as
observations, and with the cost function chosen to penalize uncertainty. We
work through an example representation of task communication as a POMDP, and
present results from a user experiment on an interactive virtual robot,
compared with a human controlled virtual robot, for a task involving a single
object movement and binary approval input from the teacher. The results suggest
that the proposed POMDP representation produces robots that are robust to
teacher error, that can accurately infer task details, and that are perceived
to be intelligent.

failure time models, we propose a generalized estimating equation approach to
account for the multivariate dependence through working correlation structures.
The marginal error distributions can be either identical as in sequential event

coefficients can be shared across margins as needed. The initial estimator is a
rank-based estimator with Gehan's weight, but obtained from an induced
smoothing approach with computation ease. The resulting estimator is consistent
and asymptotically normal, with a variance estimated through a multiplier
resampling method. In a simulation study, our estimator was up to three times
as efficient as the initial estimator, especially with stronger multivariate

inferred by assuming that block maxima derive from max-stable processes.
Weather stations provide daily records rather than just block maxima. The point
process approach for univariate extreme value analysis, which uses more
historical data and is preferred by some practitioners, does not adapt easily
to the spatial setting. We propose a two-step approach with a composite
likelihood that utilizes site-wise daily records in addition to block maxima.
The procedure separates the estimation of marginal parameters and dependence
parameters into two steps. The first step estimates the marginal parameters
with an independence likelihood from the point process approach using daily
records. Given the marginal parameter estimates, the second step estimates the
dependence parameters with a pairwise likelihood using block maxima. In a
simulation study, the two-step approach was found to be more efficient than the
pairwise likelihood approach using only block maxima. The method was applied to
study the effect of El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation on extreme precipitation
in California with maximum daily winter precipitation from 35 sites over 55
years. Using site-specific generalized extreme value models, the two-step
approach led to more sites detected with the El Ni\~{n}o effect, narrower
confidence intervals for return levels and tighter confidence regions for risk
measures of jointly defined events.

circuits (RQC) acting on the (hyper)edges of an underlying (hyper)graph
structure. The latter encodes for the locality structure associated with
finite-time quantum evolutions generated by physical i.e., local, Hamiltonians.
Our goal is to analyze physical properties of typical states in these
ensembles, in particular here we focus on proxies of quantum entanglement as
purity and $\alpha$-Renyi entropies. The problem is formulated in terms of
matrix elements of superoperators which depend on the graph structure, choice
of probability measure over the local unitaries and circuit length. In the
$\alpha=2$ case these superoperators act on a restricted multi-qubit space
generated by permutation operators associated to the subsets of vertices of the
graph. For permutationally invariant interactions the dynamics can be further
restricted to an exponentially smaller subspace. We consider different families
of RQCs and study their typical entanglement properties for finite-time as well
as their asymptotic behavior. We find that area law holds in average and that
the volume law is a typical property (that is, it holds in average and the
fluctuations around the average are vanishing for the large system) of physical
states. The area law arises when the evolution time is O(1) with respect to the
size $L$ of the system, while the volume law arises as typical when the
evolution time scales like O(L).

director field. The distortions are responsible for long-range effective
colloidal interactions whose asymptotic behaviour is well understood. The short
distance behaviour of the interaction, however, is sensitive to the structure
and dynamics of the topological defects nucleated near the colloidal particles
in the strong anchoring regime. The full non-linear theory is required in order
to determine the interaction at short separations. Spherical colloidal
particles with sufficiently strong planar degenerate anchoring nucleate a pair
of antipodal surface topological defects, known as boojums. We use the
Landau-de Gennes formalism in order to resolve the mesoscopic structure of the
boojum cores and to determine the pairwise colloidal interaction. We compare
the results in three (3D) and two (2D) spatial dimensions. The corresponding
free energy functionals are minimized numerically using finite elements with
adaptive meshes. Boojums are always point-like in 2D, but acquire a rather
complex structure in 3D which depends on the combination of the anchoring
potential, the radius of the colloid, the temperature and the LC elastic
anisotropy. We identify three types of defect cores in 3D which we call single,
double and split core boojums, and investigate the associated structural
transitions. In the presence of two colloidal particles there are substantial
re-arrangements of the defects at short distances, both in 3D and 2D. These
re-arrangements lead to qualitative changes in the force-distance profile when
compared to the asymptotic quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. In line with the
experimental results, the presence of the defects prevents coalescence of the
colloidal particles in 2D, but not in 3D systems.

a composite glueball field which consists of two massless gluons. The glueball
propagator is here evaluated by using the linear response theory for the
composite external glueball field. As a result, a finite glueball mass is
obtained through the interaction between two massless gluons, in which the

over a network with erasure links. In the context of consensus problems, the
unreliability of communication links between nodes has been traditionally
modeled by allowing the underlying graph to vary with time. In other words,
depending on the realization of the link erasures, the underlying graph at each
time instant is assumed to be a subgraph of the original graph. Implicit in
this model is the assumption that the erasures are symmetric: if at time t the
packet from node i to node j is dropped, the same is true for the packet
transmitted from node j to node i. However, in practical wireless communication
systems this assumption is unreasonable and, due to the lack of symmetry,
standard averaging protocols cannot guarantee that the network will reach
consensus to the true average. In this paper we explore the use of channel
coding to improve the performance of consensus algorithms. For symmetric
erasures, we show that, for certain ranges of the system parameters, repetition
codes can speed up the convergence rate. For asymmetric erasures we show that
tree codes (which have recently been designed for erasure channels) can be used
to simulate the performance of the original ""unerased"" graph. Thus, unlike
conventional consensus methods, we can guarantee convergence to the average in
the asymmetric case. The price is a slowdown in the convergence rate, relative
to the unerased network, which is still often faster than the convergence rate
of conventional consensus algorithms over noisy links.

assumes that the ebits of the receiver are error-free. In practical situations,
errors on these ebits are unavoidable, which diminishes the error-correcting
ability of these codes. We consider two different versions of this problem. We
first show that any (nondegenerate) standard stabilizer code can be transformed
into an EAQEC code that can correct errors on the qubits of both sender and
receiver. These EAQEC codes are equivalent to standard stabilizer codes, and
hence the decoding techniques of standard stabilizer codes can be applied.
Several EAQEC codes of this type are found to be optimal. In a second scheme,
the receiver uses a standard stabilizer code to protect the ebits, which we
call a ""combination code."" The performances of different quantum codes are
compared in terms of the channel fidelity over the depolarizing channel. We
give a formula for the channel fidelity over the depolarizing channel (or any
Pauli error channel), and show that it can be efficiently approximated by a
Monte Carlo calculation. Finally, we discuss the tradeoff between performing
extra entanglement distillation and applying an EAQEC code with imperfect
ebits.

chaotic field regions, ie non-integrability. In Hamiltonian dynamical systems
terms these coordinates are a form of action-angle variables, which are
normally defined only for integrable systems. In order to describe 3-D magnetic
field systems, a generalisation of this concept was proposed recently by the
present authors that unified the concepts of ghost surfaces and
quadratic-flux-minimising (QFMin) surfaces. This was based on a simple
canonical transformation generated by a change of variable $\theta =
\theta(\Theta,\zeta)$, where $\theta$ and $\zeta$ are poloidal and toroidal
angles, respectively, with $\Theta$ a new poloidal angle chosen to give
pseudo-orbits that are a) straight when plotted in the $\zeta,\Theta$ plane and
b) QFMin pseudo-orbits in the transformed coordinate. These two requirements
ensure that the pseudo-orbits are also c) ghost pseudo-orbits. In the present
paper, it is demonstrated that these requirements do not \emph{uniquely}
specify the transformation owing to a relabelling symmetry. A variational
method of solution that removes this lack of uniqueness is proposed.

self-absorbed incoherent synchrotron radio source is obtained from the size of
its gyro orbits, which in turn must lie well within the confines of the total
source extent. These temperature limits are obtained without recourse to
inverse Compton effects or the condition of equipartition of energy between
magnetic fields and relativistic particles. For radio variables, the intra-day
variability (IDV) implies brightness temperatures $\sim 10^{19}$ K in the
co-moving rest frame of the source. This, if interpreted purely due to an
incoherent synchrotron emission, would imply gyro radii $>10^{28}$ cm, the size
of the universe, while from the causality arguments the inferred maximum size
of the source in such a case is $\stackrel{<}{_{\sim}} 10^{15}$ cm. Such high
brightness temperatures are sometimes modeled in the literature as some
coherent emission process where bunches of non-thermal particles are somehow
formed that radiate in phase. We show that, unlike in case of curvature
radiation models proposed in pulsars, in the synchrotron radiation mechanism
the oppositely charged particles would contribute together to the coherent
phenomenon without the need to form separate bunches of the opposite charges.
At the same time we show that bunches would disperse over dimensions larger
than a wavelength in time shorter than the gyro orbital period
($\stackrel{<}{_{\sim}}0.1$ sec). Therefore a coherent emission by bunches
cannot be a plausible explanation of the high brightness temperatures inferred
in extragalactic radio sources showing variability over a few hours or longer.

running events by people who run the first half of the race faster than the

general agreement that performance in the 400 m and 800 m is limited somehow by
the amount of anaerobic metabolism that can be tolerated in the working muscles
in the legs. A toy model of anaerobic metabolism is presented, from which an
optimal pacing strategy is analytically calculated via the Euler-Lagrange
equation. This optimal strategy is then modified to account for the fact that
the runner starts the race from rest; this modification is shown to result in
the best possible outcome by use of an elementary variational technique that
supplements what is found in undergraduate textbooks. The toy model reproduces
the pacing strategies of elite 400 m and 800 m runners better than existing
models do. The toy model also gives some insight into training strategies that

additional expectation. However all the exponents are changed; either time
decay rates are slower (when the right hand side belongs to $L^2$), or

describing motion in elliptical as well as in disk galaxies, by suitably
choosing the dynamical parameters. Moreover, a new dynamical parameter, the
S(g) spectrum, is introduced and used, in order to detect islandic motion of
resonant orbits and the evolution of the sticky regions. We investigate the
regular or chaotic character of motion, with emphasis in the different
dynamical models and make an extensive study of the sticky regions of the
system. We use the classical method of the Poincare (r-pr) phase plane and the
new dynamical parameter of the S(g) spectrum. The LCE is used, in order to make
an estimation of the degree of chaos in our galactic model. In both cases, the
numerical calculations, suggest that our new model, displays a wide variety of
families of regular orbits, compared to other galactic models. In addition to
the regular motion, this new model displays also chaotic regions. Furthermore,
the extent of the chaotic regions increases, as the value of the flatness
parameter b of the model increases. Moreover, our simulations indicate, that
the degree of chaos in elliptical galaxies, is much smaller than that in dense
disk galaxies. In both cases numerical calculations show, that the degree of
chaos increases linearly, as the flatness parameter b increases. In addition, a
linear relationship between the critical value of angular momentum and the b
parameter if found, in both cases (elliptical and disk galaxies). Some
theoretical arguments to support the numerical outcomes are presented.
Comparison with earlier work is also made.

investigate the bulk zero-field orbital susceptibility of a non-interacting
Bloch electrons gas in graphene-like solids at fixed temperature and density of

we derive a complete expression which holds for an arbitrary number of bands
with possible degeneracies. In the particular case of a two-bands gapped model,
all involved quantities are explicitly written down. Besides the formula that
we obtain have the special feature to be suitable for numerical computations
since it only involves the eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of the
Bloch Hamiltonian, together with the derivatives (up to the second order)
w.r.t. the quasi-momentum of the matrix-elements of the Bloch Hamiltonian.
Finally we give a simple application for the two-bands gapped model by
considering the case of a dispersion law which is linear w.r.t. the
quasi-momentum in the gapless limit. Through this instance, the origin of the
singularity, which expresses as a Dirac delta function of the Fermi energy,
implied by the McClure's formula in purely monolayer graphene is discussed.

found at hip prostheses. Finite element models are developed using actual Al2O3
microstructures and a bilinear cohesive zone law. Simulation conditions are
similar to those found at a slip zone in a dry contact between a femoral head
and an acetabular cup of hip prosthesis. Contact stresses are imposed to
generate cracks in the models. Magnitudes of imposed stresses are higher than
those found at the microscopic scale. Effects of microstructures and contact
stresses are investigated in terms of crack formation. In addition, fatigue
behaviour of the microstructure is determined by performing simulations under
cyclic loading conditions. It is shown that crack density observed in a
microstructure increases with increasing magnitude of applied contact stress.
Moreover, crack density increases linearly with respect to the number of
fatigue cycles within a given contact stress range. Meanwhile, as applied
contact stress increases, number of cycles to failure decreases gradually.
Finally, this proposed finite element simulation offers an effective method for
identifying fracture and fatigue behaviours of a microstructure provided that
microstructure images are available.

parity-check (LDPC) codes can achieve near-Shannon limit performance. In order
to evaluate the error performance of LDPC codes, simulators running on CPUs are
commonly used. However, the time taken to evaluate LDPC codes with very good
error performance is excessive. In this paper, efficient LDPC block-code
decoders/simulators which run on graphics processing units (GPUs) are proposed.
We also implement the decoder for the LDPC convolutional code (LDPCCC). The
LDPCCC is derived from a pre-designed quasi-cyclic LDPC block code with good
error performance. Compared to the decoder based on the randomly constructed
LDPCCC code, the complexity of the proposed LDPCCC decoder is reduced due to
the periodicity of the derived LDPCCC and the properties of the quasi-cyclic
structure. In our proposed decoder architecture, $\Gamma$ (a multiple of a
warp) codewords are decoded together and hence the messages of $\Gamma$
codewords are also processed together. Since all the $\Gamma$ codewords share
the same Tanner graph, messages of the $\Gamma$ distinct codewords
corresponding to the same edge can be grouped into one package and stored
linearly. By optimizing the data structures of the messages used in the
decoding process, both the read and write processes can be performed in a
highly parallel manner by the GPUs. In addition, a thread hierarchy minimizing
the divergence of the threads is deployed, and it can maximize the efficiency
of the parallel execution. With the use of a large number of cores in the GPU
to perform the simple computations simultaneously, our GPU-based LDPC decoder
can obtain hundreds of times speedup compared with a serial CPU-based simulator
and over 40 times speedup compared with an 8-thread CPU-based simulator.

16 T. The magnetisation versus field isotherms reveal the occurrence of a clear
second magnetisation peak (SMP) also known as fish-tail effect for both H
parallel and perpendicular to c-axis of the crystal. The in-field resistance
and magnetisation data are used to put forth a vortex phase diagram. The nature
of the vortices have been determined from scaling behaviour of the pinning
force density extracted from the Jc-H isotherms. The scaled JC versus reduced
temperature behaviour seems to fit to a power law that indicates unambiguously
that pinning in this system arises due to the spatial variation in the mean
free path, viz. delta-l pinning.

spin-correlation matrix for the two-qubit system. If this matrix is non-zero,
the measure of the correlation between the qubits is the average of the
non-zero elements. Trivially, for zero matrix the bipartite is uncorrelated.
This criterion turns out to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the
full correlation, where it includes information on both entanglement and
correlation other than entanglement. Moreover, we discuss to what extent this
criterion can give information on the entanglement of the system. The criterion
is generic in the sense that it can be applied to mixed and pure systems. Also,
it can be easily extended to treat the correlation of multipartite systems. We
compare the results obtained from this criterion to those from concurrence for
various examples and we gain agreement regarding entanglement.
  We believe that this criterion may have a wide range of potential
applications in quantum information theory.

conductivity equation under the assumption that the conductivity is identically
one close to the boundary of the examined smooth, bounded and simply connected
domain. It is demonstrated that the so-called bisweep data, i.e., the
(relative) potential differences between two boundary points when delta
currents of opposite signs are applied at the very same points, uniquely
determine the whole Neumann-to-Dirichlet map. In two dimensions, the bisweep
data extend as a holomorphic function of two variables to some (interior)
neighborhood of the product boundary. It follows that the whole
Neumann-to-Dirichlet map is characterized by the derivatives of the bisweep
data at an arbitrary point. On the diagonal of the product boundary, these
derivatives can be given with the help of the derivatives of the (relative)
boundary potentials at some fixed point caused by the distributional current
densities supported at the same point, and thus such point measurements
uniquely define the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map. This observation also leads to a
new, truly local uniqueness result for the so-called Calder\'on inverse
conductivity problem.

went public. This event followed other recent IPOs in the world of social
networking companies, such as Groupon or Linkedin among others. With a
valuation close to 7 billion USD at the time when it went public, Zynga became
one of the biggest web IPOs since Google. This recent enthusiasm for social
networking companies raises the question whether they are overvalued. Indeed,
during the few months since its IPO, Zynga showed significant variability, its
market capitalization going from 5.6 to 10.2 billion USD, hinting at a possible
irrational behavior from the market. To bring substance to the debate, we
propose a two-tiered approach to compute the intrinsic value of Zynga. First,
we introduce a new model to forecast its user base, based on the individual
dynamics of its major games. Next, we model the revenues per user using a
logistic function, a standard model for growth in competition. This allows us
to bracket the valuation of Zynga using three different scenarios: 3.4, 4.0 and
4.8 billion USD in the base case, high growth and extreme growth scenario
respectively. This suggests that Zynga has been overpriced ever since its IPO.
Finally, we propose an investment strategy (dated April 19th, 2012 on the
arXive), which is based on our diagnostic of a bubble for Zynga and how this
herding / bubbly sentiment can be expected to play together with two important
coming events (the quarterly financial result announcement around April 26th,
2012 followed by the end of a first lock-up period around April 30th, 2012). On
the long term, our analysis indicates that Zynga's price should decrease
significantly. The paper ends with a post-mortem analysis added on May 24th,
2012, just before going to press, showing that we have successfully predicted
the downward trend of Zynga. Since April 27th, 2012, Zynga dropped 25%.

galaxy groups in the local Universe. It shows a prominent diffuse light
component that accounts for ~50% of the total observed light. This likely
indicates that the group is in an advanced evolutionary phase, which would
predict a significant hot gaseous component. Previous X-ray observations had
suggested a low luminosity for this system, but with large uncertainties and
poor resolution. We present the results from a deep (70 ks), high resolution
Chandra observation of Seyfert's Sextet, requested with the aim of separating
the X-ray emission associated with the individual galaxies from that of a more
extended inter-galactic component. We discuss the spatial and spectral
characteristics of this group we derive with those of a few similar systems
also studied in the X-ray band. The high resolution X-ray image indicates that
the majority of the detected emission does not arise in the compact group but
is concentrated towards the NW and corresponds to what appears to be a
background galaxy cluster. The emission from the group alone has a total
luminosity of ~1x10^40 erg/s in the (0.5-5) keV band. Most of the luminosity
can be attributed to the individual sources in the galaxies, and only ~2x10^39
erg/s is due to a gaseous component. However, we find that this component is
also mostly associated with the individual galaxies of the Sextet, leaving
little or no residual in a truly IGM component. The extremely low luminosity of
the diffuse emission in Seyfert's Sextet might be related to its small total
mass.

cosmological parameters, in particular the equation of state of dark energy. We
focus on the growth of the critical lines of lensing clusters with the source
redshift as this behaviour depends on the distance-redshift relation and is
therefore cosmologically sensitive. Purely analytical approaches are generally
insufficient because they rely on axisymmetric mass distributions and thus
cannot take irregular critical curves into account. We devise a numerical
method based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm: an elliptical generalization
of the NFW density profile is used to fit a lens model to an observed
configuration of giant luminous arcs while simultaneously optimizing the
geometry. A semi-analytic method, which derives geometric parameters from
critical points, is discussed as a faster alternative. We test the approaches
on mock observations of gravitational lensing by a numerically simulated
cluster. We find that no constraints can be derived from observations of
individual clusters if no knowledge of the underlying mass distribution is
assumed. Uncertainties are improved if a fixed lens model is used for a purely
geometrical optimization, but the choice of a parametric model may produce
strong biases.

nitride nano wave-guide core with a Rubidium (Rb) vapor cladding. We observe
the highly efficient interaction of the electromagnetic guided mode with the

which predicts the transmission spectrum of the system taking into account
Doppler and transit time broadening. We show, that due to the high confinement

molecular line profiles are a mix of emission and absorption, and can be
decomposed into 'medium', and 'broad' velocity components. The broad component
is the outflow associated with protostars of all masses. Our modeling shows
that the remainder of the water profiles can be well fitted by an infalling and
passively heated envelope, with highly supersonic turbulence varying from 2.2
km/s in the inner region to 3.5 km/s in the outer envelope. Also, W43-MM1 has a
high accretion rate, between 4.0 x 10^{-4} and 4.0 x 10^{-2} \msun /yr, derived
from the fast (0.4-2.9 km/s) infall observed. We estimate a lower mass limit of
gaseous water of 0.11 \msun and total water luminosity of 1.5 \lsun (in the 14
lines presented here). The central hot core is detected with a water abundance
of 1.4 x 10^{-4} while the water abundance for the outer envelope is 8
x10^{-8}. The latter value is higher than in other sources, most likely related
to the high turbulence and the micro-shocks created by its dissipation.
Examining water lines of various energies, we find that the turbulent velocity
increases with the distance to the center. While not in clear disagreement with
the competitive accretion scenario, this behavior is predicted by the turbulent
core model. Moreover, the estimated accretion rate is high enough to overcome
the expected radiation pressure.

coupling (RSOC) on a monolayer graphene sample. After recasting the originally
$4\times 4$ system of dynamical equations as two time-reversal related
two-level problems, the quasi-energy spectrum and the related dynamics are
investigated via various techniques and approximations. In the static case the
system is a gapped at the Dirac point. The rotating wave approximation (RWA)
applied to the driven system unphysically preserves this feature, while the
Magnus-Floquet approach as well as a numerically exact evaluation of the
Floquet equation show that this gap is dynamically closed. In addition, a
sizable oscillating pattern of the out-of-plane spin polarization is found in
the driven case for states which completely unpolarized in the static limit.
Evaluation of the autocorrelation function shows that the original uniform
interference pattern corresponding to time-independent RSOC gets distorted. The
resulting structure can be qualitatively explained as a consequence of the
transitions induced by the ac driving among the static eigenstates, i.e., these
transitions modulate the relative phases that add up to give the quantum
revivals of the autocorrelation function. Contrary to the static case, in the
driven scenario, quantum revivals (suppresions) are correlated to spin up
(down) phases.

retarded Green's function $G_R(x',x)$ for fields propagating on an arbitrary
globally hyperbolic spacetime. Our method combines the Hadamard form for $G_R$
(this form is only valid within a normal neighbourhood of $x$) together with
Kirchhoff's integral representation for the field in order to calculate $G_R$
outside the maximal normal neighbourhood of $x$. As an example, we apply this
method to the case of a scalar field on a black hole toy-model spacetime, the
Pleba{\'n}ski-Hacyan spacetime, $\mathbb{M}_2\times\mathbb{S}^2$. The method
allows us to determine in an exact manner that the singularity structure of the
`direct' term in the Hadamard form for $G_R(x',x)$ changes from a form
$\delta(\sigma)$ to `$1/\pi\sigma$' after the null geodesic joining $x$ and
$x'$ has crossed a caustic point, where $\sigma$ is the world function.
Furthermore, there is a change of form from a $\theta(-\sigma)$ to a
`$-\ln|\sigma|/\pi$' in the `tail' term, which has not been explicitly noted
before in the literature. We complement the results from the Kirchhoff integral
method with an analysis for large-$\ell$ of the Green function modes. This
analysis allows us to determine the singularity structure after null geodesics
have crossed an arbitrary number of caustics, although it raises a causality
issue which the Kirchhoff integral method resolves. Because of the similarity
in the caustic structure of the spacetimes, we expect our main results for wave
propagation to also be valid on Schwarzschild spacetime.

relativistic chiral quark potential model based on the one-pion and one-gluon

  It is argued that the N* and Delta* resonances strongly coupled to the pi-N
channel are identified with the orbital configurations $(1S_{1/2})^2(nlj)$ with
a single valence quark in the excited state (nlj). With the obtained selection
rules based on the ""chiral constraint"", we show that it is possible to
construct a schematic periodic table of baryon resonances, consistent with the
experimental data and yielding no ""missing resonances"". A new original method
for the treatment of the center of mass problem is suggested, which is based on
the separation of the three-quark Dirac Hamiltonian into the parts,
corresponding to the Jacobi coordinates. The numerical estimations for the
energy positions of the Nucleon and Delta baryons (up to and including F-wave
resonances), obtained within the field-theoretical framework by using time
ordered perturbation theory, yield an overall good description of the
experimental data at the level of the relativized CQM of S. Capstick and W.
Roberts without any fitting parameters. The Delta(1232) is well reproduced.
However, N g. s. and most of the radially excited baryon resonances (including
Roper) are overestimated. Contrary, the first band of the orbitally excited
baryon resonances with a negative parity are underestimated. At the same time,
the second band of the orbitally excited Delta* states with the negative parity
are mostly overestimated, while the N* states are close to the experimental
boxes. The positive parity baryon resonances with J=5/2, 7/2 are close to the
experimental data.
  At higher energies, where the experimental data are poor, we can extend our
model schematically and predict an existence of seven N* and four Delta* new
states with larger spin values.

intention inference from Social Media - such as Twitter - is presented. Our
case study is the UK 2010 General Election and we are focusing on predicting
the percentages of voting intention polls (conducted by YouGov) for the three
major political parties - Conservatives, Labours and Liberal Democrats - during
a 5-month period before the election date (May 6, 2010). We form three
methodologies for extracting positive or negative sentiment from tweets, which
build on each other, and then propose two supervised models for turning
sentiment into voting intention percentages. Interestingly, when the content of
tweets is enriched by attaching synonymous words, a significant improvement on
inference performance is achieved reaching a mean absolute error of 4.34% +/-
2.13%; in that case, the predictions are also shown to be statistically
significant. The presented methods should be considered as work-in-progress;
limitations and suggestions for future work appear in the final section of this

frequencies \nu>1GHz are reviewed. By exploiting all the most relevant data on
the polarized emission of ERS we study the frequency dependence of polarization
properties of ERS between 1.4 and 86GHz. For flat-spectrum sources the median
(mean) fractional polarization increases from 1.5% (2-2.5%) at 1.4GHz to 2.5-3%
(3-3.5%) at \nu>10GHz. Steep-spectrum sources are typically more polarized,
especially at high frequencies where Faraday depolarization is less relevant.
As a general result, we do not find that the fractional polarization of ERS
depends on the total flux density at high radio frequencies, i.e >20GHz.
Moreover, in this frequency range, current data suggest a moderate increase of
the fractional polarization of ERS with frequency. A formalism to estimate ERS
number counts in polarization and the contribution of unresolved polarized ERS
to angular power spectra at Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) frequencies is
also developed and discussed. As a first application, we present original
predictions for the Planck satellite mission. Our current results show that
only a dozen polarized ERS will be detected by the Planck Low Frequency
Instrument (LFI), and a few tens by the High Frequency Instrument (HFI). As for
CMB power spectra, ERS should not be a strong contaminant to the CMB E-mode
polarization at frequencies \nu>70GHz. On the contrary, they can become a
relevant constraint for the detection of the cosmological B--mode polarization
if the tensor-to-scalar ratio is <0.01.

efficiency of cluster spiral galaxies is investigated. We extend previous work
on radial profiles by a pixel-to pixel analysis looking for asymmetries due to
environmental interactions. The star formation rate is derived from GALEX UV
and Spitzer total infrared data. As in field galaxies, the star formation rate
for most Virgo galaxies is approximately proportional to the molecular gas
mass. Except for NGC 4438, the cluster environment does not affect the star
formation efficiency with respect to the molecular gas. Gas truncation is not
associated with major changes in the total gas surface density distribution of
the inner disk of Virgo spiral galaxies. In three galaxies, possible increases
in the molecular fraction and the star formation efficiency with respect to the
total gas, of factors of 1.5 to 2, are observed on the windward side of the
galactic disk. A significant increase of the star formation efficiency with
respect to the molecular gas content on the windward side of ram
pressure-stripped galaxies is not observed. The ram-pressure stripped
extraplanar gas of 3 highly inclined spiral galaxies shows a depressed star
formation efficiency with respect to the total gas, and one of them (NGC 4438)
shows a depressed rate even with respect to the molecular gas. The
interpretation is that stripped gas loses the gravitational confinement and
associated pressure of the galactic disk, and the gas flow is diverging, so the
gas density decreases and the star formation rate drops. However, the stripped
extraplanar gas in one highly inclined galaxy (NGC 4569) shows a normal star
formation efficiency with respect to the total gas. We propose this galaxy is
different because it is observed long after peak pressure, and its extraplanar
gas is now in a converging flow as it resettles back into the disk.

crystal microbalance (QCM) is presented. The thin films have been characterized
before and after sorption/desorption processes of NO2 by energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), grazing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD), Raman
spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atom force microscopy
(AFM) measurements. These studies indicated that physisorption occurs when NO2
gas molecules are introduced into the chalcogenide film and the thin film
composition or structure do not change. The mass loading due to NO2 gas
sorption was calculated by the resonator's frequency shift. At the conditions
of our experiment, up to 6.8 ng of the gas was sorbed into 200nm thick Ge33Se67
film at 5000 ppm NO2 concentration. It has been established that the process of
gas molecules sorption is reversible.

Several points clarified",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.86.053014",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The pattern of lepton mixing can emerge from breaking a flavor symmetry in
different ways in the neutrino and charged lepton Yukawa sectors. In this
framework, we derive the conditions imposed on the mixing matrix by the
structure of discrete groups of the von Dyck type which include A4, S4 and A5.
We show that, in general, these conditions reduce to two equations for the
mixing parameters (angles and CP phase \delta). These constraints, which
correspond to unbroken residual symmetries, are consistent with non-zero 13
mixing and deviations from maximal 2-3 mixing. For the allowed values of mixing
angles we predict \delta = 60 - 90^{\circ}.

recently attracted attention in the context of AdS/CFT dualities. In our work
we analyse the limit of N=(2,2) superconformal minimal models when the central
charge approaches c=3. The limiting theory is a non-rational N=(2,2)
superconformal theory, in which there is a continuum of chiral primary fields.
We determine the spectrum of the theory, the three-point functions on the
sphere, and the disc one-point functions.
