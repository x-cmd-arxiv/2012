model proved that the observed L\'evy exponents are nearly optimal, being close
to the exponent value that guarantees the maximal economical return to players.
Here, we rationalize these findings by adopting an evolutionary perspective. We
show that a simple evolutionary process is able to account for the empirical

requirements for physical admissibility. The exhaustive classification of these
theories in flat space, in terms of the behaviour of the Lagrangian densities
in vacuum and on the boundary of their domain of definition, defines twelve
families of admissible models. When these models are coupled to gravity, the
flat space classification leads to a complete characterization of the
associated sets of gravitating electrostatic spherically symmetric solutions by
their central and asymptotic behaviours. We focus on nine of these families,
which support asymptotically Schwarzschild-like black hole configurations, for
which the thermodynamic analysis is possible and pertinent. In this way, the
thermodynamic laws are extended to the sets of black hole solutions of these
families, for which the generic behaviours of the relevant state variables are
classified and thoroughly analyzed in terms of the aforementioned boundary
properties of the Lagrangians. Moreover, we find universal scaling laws (which
hold and are the same for all the black hole solutions of models belonging to
any of the nine families) running the thermodynamic variables with the electric
charge and the horizon radius. These scale transformations form a one-parameter
multiplicative group, leading to universal ""renormalization group""-like
first-order differential equations. The beams of characteristics of these
equations generate the full set of black hole states associated to any of these
gravitating nonlinear electrodynamics...

Varying $s$ changes the effective dimension $d_\text{eff} = d + z$ of the
system, where $z$ is the dynamical critical exponent and the number of spatial
dimensions $d$ is set to one. We consider two extreme cases of clock models,
namely Ising-like and U(1)-symmetric ones, and find the critical exponents
using Monte Carlo methods. The dynamical critical exponent and the anomalous
scaling dimension $\eta$ are independent of the order parameter symmetry for
all values of $s$. The dynamical critical exponent varies continuously from $z
\approx 2$ for $s=1$ to $z=1$ for $s=2$, and the anomalous scaling dimension
evolves correspondingly from $\eta \gtrsim 0$ to $\eta = 1/4$. The latter
exponent values are readily understood from the effective dimensionality of the
system being $d_\text{eff} \approx 3$ for $s=1$, while for $s=2$ the anomalous
dimension takes the well-known exact value for the 2D Ising and XY models,
since then $d_{\rm{eff}}=2$. A noteworthy feature is, however, that $z$
approaches unity and $\eta$ approaches 1/4 for values of $s < 2$, while naive
scaling would predict the dissipation to become irrelevant for $s=2$. Instead,
we find that $z=1,\eta=1/4$ for $s \approx 1.75$ for both Ising-like and U(1)
order parameter symmetry. These results lead us to conjecture that for all
site-dissipative $Z_q$ chains, these two exponents are related by the scaling
relation $z = \text{max} {(2-\eta)/s, 1}$. We also connect our results to
quantum criticality in nondissipative spin chains with long-range spatial

their host galaxies. It is commonly assumed that the high ambient densities and
intense radiation fields in galactic nuclei imply short cooling times, thus
making the outflows momentum-conserving. We show that cooling of high-velocity,
shocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,
including conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),
resulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast
energy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler
gas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity
v_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the
shocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal
pressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate
directly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton
cooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km
s^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience
energy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions. During the
energy-conserving phase, the momentum flux of an outflow is boosted by a factor
~v_in/2v_s by work done by the hot post-shock gas, where v_s is the velocity of
the swept-up material. Energy-conserving outflows driven by fast AGN winds
(v_in~0.1c) may therefore explain the momentum fluxes Pdot>>L_AGN/c of
galaxy-scale outflows recently measured in luminous quasars and ULIRGs. Shocked
wind bubbles expanding normal to galactic disks may also explain the
large-scale bipolar structures observed in some systems, including around the
Galactic Center, and can produce significant radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray

be reduced to non-magnetic junctions by setting the exchange field equal to

the direction of current-flow remains invariant at the others. The reversal

terms of high-scale supersymmetry breaking with a shift symmetry in the Higgs

extrapolates, within the (non-supersymmetric) Standard Model, to a vanishing
quartic Higgs coupling at a UV scale between 10^6 and 10^18 GeV. Such a small
value of lambda can be understood in terms of models with high-scale SUSY
breaking if the Kahler potential possesses a shift symmetry, i.e., if it
depends on H_u and H_d only in the combination (H_u+\bar{H}_d). This symmetry
is known to arise rather naturally in certain heterotic compactifications. We
suggest that such a structure of the Higgs Kahler potential is common in a
wider class of string constructions, including intersecting D7- and D6-brane

that baryon structure is largely flavour-blind, the first radial excitation of
ground-state baryons is constituted almost entirely from axial-vector diquark
correlations, and DCSB is the foundation for the ordering of low-lying baryon

galaxies as the detailed ionization distribution and velocity fields of this
region could significantly influence the scattering of Ly-alpha photons off
neutral H atoms as they traverse the IGM after escaping from the galaxy. We
simulate the surface brightness (SB) maps and spectra of more than 100 LAEs at
z=7.7 as seen by an observer at z=0. To achieve this, we extract the source
properties of galaxies and their surrounding IGM from cosmological simulations
of box sizes 5-30 Mpc/h and follow the coupled radiative transfer of ionizing
and Ly-alpha radiation through the IGM using CRASH-alpha. We find that the
simulated SB profiles are extended and their detailed structure is affected by
inhomogeneities in the IGM, especially at high neutral fractions. The
detectability of LAEs and the fraction of the flux observed depend heavily on
the shape of the SB profile and the SB threshold (SB_th) of the observational
campaign. Only ultradeep observations (e.g. SB_th ~ 10^-23
ergs/s/cm^2/arcsec^2) would be able to obtain the true underlying
mass-luminosity relation and luminosity functions of LAEs. The details of our
results depend on whether Ly-alpha photons are significantly shifted in the
galaxy to longer wavelengths, the mean ionization fraction in the IGM and the
clustering of ionizing sources. These effects can lead to an easier escape of
Ly-alpha photons with less scattering in the IGM and a concentrated SB profile
similar to the one of a point source. Finally, we show that the SB profiles are
steeper at high ionization fraction for the same LAE sample which can
potentially be observed from the stacked profile of a large number of LAEs.

naturally arises when two near-resonant planets interact in the presence of
weak dissipation that damps eccentricities. The two planets repel each other as
orbital energy is lost to heat. This moves near-resonant pairs just beyond
resonance, by a distance that reflects the integrated dissipation they
experienced over their lifetimes. We find that the observed distances may be
explained by tides if tidal dissipation is unexpectedly efficient (tidal
quality factor ~10). Once the effect of resonant repulsion is accounted for,
the initial orbits of these low mass planets show little preference for

its possible variation within and among clouds. We quantitatively characterize

to describe a variety of setups relevant to current experiments. The inclusion
of the internal degrees of freedom in this model allows for a variety of
optical activities of mirrors from those exhibiting broadband reflective
properties to the cases where reflection is suppressed except for a narrow band
centered around the characteristic frequency associated with the mirror's
internal dynamics. After establishing the model and the reflective properties

Consistent with low-energy electron microscopic observations, we find that the

grows. If small tunneling currents are used, it is possible to image
simultaneously the graphene/Au moir\'e and the Au herringbone reconstruction,
which forms underneath the graphene on cooling from the growth temperature. The
delicate herringbone structure and its periodicity remain unchanged from the
bare Au surface. Using a Frenkel-Kontorova model we deduce that this striking
observation is consistent with an attraction between graphene and Au of less
than 13 meV per C atom. Raman spectroscopy supports this weak interaction.
However, at the tunneling currents necessary for atomic resolution image of
graphene, the Au reconstruction is altered, implying influential tip-sample
interactions and a mobile Au surface beneath the graphene.

reduced equations implementing Pontryagine's Maximum Principle for singular
linear-quadratic optimal control problems is presented. This algorithm is
inspired on the well-known Rabier-Rheinhboldt constraints algorithm used to
solve differential-algebraic equations. Its geometrical content is exploited
fully by implementing a Hamiltonian extension of it which is closer to
Gotay-Nester presymplectic constraint algorithm used to solve singular
Hamiltonian systems. Thus, given an optimal control problem whose optimal
feedback is given in implicit form, a consistent set of equations is obtained
describing the first order differential conditions of Pontryaguine's Maximum
Principle. Such equations are shown to be Hamiltonian and the set of first
class constraints corresponding to controls that are not determined, are
obtained explicitly.
  The strength of the algorithm is shown by exhibiting a numerical
implementation with partial feedback on the controls that provides a partial
optimal feedback law for the problem. The numerical algorithm is inspired on a
previous analysis by the authors of the consistency conditions for singular
linear--quadratic optimal control problems. The numerical algorithm is
explicitly Hamiltonian. It is shown that only two possibilities can arise for
the reduced Hamiltonian PMP: that the reduced equations are completely
determined or that they depend on a family of free parameters that will be
called the ""gauge"" controls of the system determined by the first class
constraints. The existence of these extra degrees of freedom opens new
possibilities for the search of solutions. Numerical evidence of the stability
of the algorithm is presented by discussing various relevant numerical

losses. I argue that gamma rays are the source of ionization in the deepest
molecular clouds of dense starbursts, creating Gamma-Ray Dominated Regions
(GRDRs). Gamma rays are not deflected by magnetic fields, have a luminosity up
to ~1/3 that of the injected cosmic rays, and can easily penetrate column
depths of ~100 g/cm^2 before being attenuated by gamma-Z pair production. The
ionization rates of GRDRs, <~10^-16 s^-1, are much smaller than in cosmic ray
dominated regions, but in the most extreme starbursts, they may still reach
values comparable to those in Milky Way molecular clouds. The gas temperatures
in GRDRs could be likewise low, <~10 K if there is no additional heating from
dust or turbulence, while at high densities, the kinetic temperature will
approach the dust temperature. The ratio of ambipolar diffusion time to
free-fall time inside GRDRs in dense starbursts is expected to be similar to
those in Milky Way cores, suggesting star-formation can proceed normally in
them. The high columns of GRDRs may be opaque even to millimeter wavelengths,
complicating direct studies of them, but I argue that they could appear as
molecular line shadows in nearby starbursts with ALMA. Since GRDRs are cold,
their Jeans masses are not large, so that star-formation in GRDRs may have a
normal or even bottom-heavy initial mass function.

model the relation graph as a function of both latent feature factors and
latent cluster memberships of objects to collectively discover globally

in the network to improve prediction performance. We also develop an

stars and are a byproduct of star formation. The abundances of SLRs in the gas
of a star-forming galaxy are inversely proportional to the gas consumption
time. The rapid evolution of specific star formation rate (SSFR) of normal
galaxies implies they had mean SLR abundances ~3--10 times higher at z = 2.
During the epoch of Solar system formation, the background SLR abundances of
the Galaxy were up to twice as high as at present, if SLR yields from massive
stars do not depend on metallicity. If SLRs are homogenized in the gas of
galaxies, the high SSFRs of normal galaxies can partly explain the elevated
abundance of SLRs like $^{60}$Fe and $^{26}$Al in the early Solar system.
Starburst galaxies have much higher SSFRs still, and have enormous mean
abundances of $^{26}$Al ($^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ~ $10^{-3}$ for Solar metallicity
gas). The main uncertainty is whether the SLRs are mixed with the star-forming
molecular gas: they could be trapped in hot gas and decay before entering the
colder phases, or be blown out by starburst winds. I consider how variability
in star-formation rate affects the SLR abundances, and I discuss how SLR
transport may differ in these galaxies. The enhanced $^{26}$Al of starbursts
might maintain moderate ionization rates ($10^{-18}$ -- $10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$),
possibly dominating ionization in dense clouds not penetrated by cosmic rays.
Similar ionization rates would be maintained in protoplanetary discs of
starbursts, if the SLRs are well-mixed, and the radiogenic heating of
planetesimals would likewise be much higher. In this way, galaxy evolution can
affect the geological history of planetary systems.

waves in the inspiral phase. This allows us to see how additional polarizations
predicted in these theories modify the General Relativistic prediction of the

From these general arguments and specific modified gravity examples, we infer
an improved parameterized post-Einsteinian template family with complete

the inclusion of new theory parameters, reducing to the former when these
parameters acquire certain values, and recovering modified gravity predictions
for other values, including all polarizations. We conclude by discussing

constructing certain null channels through the combination of output from

(UV) wavelengths is a long-standing mystery. One important observational
constraint is the correlation between UV-optical colours and Mg2 line strengths
found by Burstein et al. (1988). The simplest interpretation of this phenomenon
is that the UV strength is related to the Mg line strength. Under this
assumption, we expect galaxies with larger Mg gradients to have larger UV
colour gradients. By combining UV imaging from GALEX, optical imaging from MDM
and SAURON integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially-resolved
relationships between UV colours and stellar population properties of 34
early-type galaxies from the SAURON survey sample. We find that galaxies with
old stellar populations show tight correlations between the FUV colours (FUV-V
and FUV-NUV) and the Mgb index, H{\beta} index and metallicity [Z/H]. The
equivalent correlations for the Fe5015 index, {\alpha}-enhancement
[{\alpha}/Fe] and age are present but weaker. We have also derived logarithmic
internal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar population
gradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the FUV-V and
FUV-NUV colour gradients on both the Mg b line strength and the metallicity
gradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. In particular, global
gradients of Mg b and [Z/H] with respect to the UV colour across galaxies are
consistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that the
global correlations also hold locally. From a simple model based on multi-band
colour fits of UV upturn and UV-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausible
range of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. In
these models, the centers of elliptical galaxies, where the UV flux is strong,
are enhanced in metals by roughly 60% compared to UV-weak regions.

stability at the bifurcation point. In addition, the two bifurcated solution
branches and the smooth branch have the opposite (same) stability when their
power slopes have the same (opposite) sign. One unusual feature on the
stability of these pitchfork bifurcations is that the smooth and bifurcated
solution branches can be both stable or both unstable, which contrasts such
bifurcations in finite-dimensional dynamical systems where the smooth and
bifurcated branches generally have opposite stability. For the special case of
positive solitary waves, stronger and more explicit stability results are also
obtained. It is shown that for positive solitary waves, their linear stability
near a bifurcation point can be read off directly from their power diagram.
Lastly, various numerical examples are presented, and the numerical results
confirm the analytical predictions both qualitatively and quantitatively.

formation rate (SFR), the MIR-detected galaxies at 22 \mu m or 12 \mu m tend to
be more metal rich and to have higher surface brightness than those without MIR
detection. Using these MIR-detected galaxies, we construct the IR luminosity
function (LF) and investigate its environmental dependence. Both total IR (TIR)
and 12 \mu m LFs are dominated by late-type, star-forming galaxies. The
contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN)-host galaxies increases with both
TIR and 12 \mu m luminosities. The contribution of early-type galaxies to the
12 \mu m LFs increases with decreasing luminosity. The faint-end slope of the
TIR LFs does not change with environment, but the change of faint-end slope in
the 12 \mu m LFs with the environment is significant: there is a steeper
faint-end slope in the cluster core than in the cluster outskirts. This
steepening results primarily from the increasing contribution of early-type
galaxies toward the cluster. These galaxies are passively evolving, and contain
old stellar populations with weak MIR emission from the circumstellar dust
around asymptotic giant branch stars.

adding Gaussian noise to each entry of the lower-dimensional representation. We
show that the method preserves differential privacy---where the more privacy is

exploit hidden information which is useful for discriminative classification.
This observation has motivated the development of approaches that couple
generative and discriminative models for classification. In this paper, we
propose a new approach to couple generative and discriminative models in an
unified framework based on PAC-Bayes risk theory. We first derive the
model-parameter-independent stochastic feature mapping from a practical MAP
classifier operating on generative models. Then we construct a linear
stochastic classifier equipped with the feature mapping, and derive the
explicit PAC-Bayes risk bounds for such classifier for both supervised and
semi-supervised learning. Minimizing the risk bound, using an EM-like iterative
procedure, results in a new posterior over hidden variables (E-step) and the
update rules of model parameters (M-step). The derivation of the posterior is
always feasible due to the way of equipping feature mapping and the explicit
form of bounding risk. The derived posterior allows the tuning of generative
models and subsequently the feature mappings for better classification. The
derived update rules of the model parameters are same to those of the uncoupled
models as the feature mapping is model-parameter-independent. Our experiments
show that the coupling between data modeling generative model and the
discriminative classifier via a stochastic feature mapping in this framework
leads to a general classification tool with state-of-the-art performance.

as cloud computing. India has well proven itself as a potential hub for
advanced technologies including cloud based industrial market. Microfinance
system has emerged out as a panacea to Indian economy since the population
encompasses of people who come under poverty and below poverty index. However,
one of the key challenges in successful operation of microfinance system in
India has given rise to integration of financial services using sophisticated
cloud computing model. This paper, therefore propose a fundamental cloud-based
microfinance model in order to reduce high transaction risks involved during
microfinance operations in an inexpensive and efficient manner.

approximation needs to be made within reasonable distance from scatterers.
  Luckily, the Helmholtz equation can be represented as a Lippmann-Schwinger

leads to our numerical scheme based on spherical harmonic polynomial transform.
In this paper, we present an efficient solver for the Helmholtz equation which

accurate for discontinuous material properties. The order increases with
increasing regularity leading to spectral convergence for globally smooth

characterised by a considerable over-abundance in their barium content. In

[Ba/Fe] can reach values as high as ~0.6 dex. The work also identified the
presence of an anti-correlation between [Ba/Fe] and cluster age. For clusters
in the age range ~4.5 Gyr-500 Myr, this is best explained by assuming a higher
contribution from low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars to the Galactic
chemical enrichment. The purpose of this work is to investigate the ubiquity of
the barium over-abundance in young stellar clusters. We analysed
high-resolution spectroscopic data, focusing on the s-process elemental
abundance for three nearby young associations, i.e. AB Doradus, Carina-Near,
and Ursa Major. The clusters have been chosen such that their age spread would
complement the D'Orazi et al. (2009) study. We find that while the s-process
elements Y, Zr, La, and Ce exhibit solar ratios in all three associations, Ba
is over-abundant by ~0.2 dex. Current theoretical models can not reproduce this
abundance pattern, thus we investigate whether this unusually large Ba content
might be related to chromospheric effects. Although no correlation between
[Ba/Fe] and several activity indicators seems to be present, we conclude that
different effects could be at work which may (directly or indirectly) be
related to the presence of hot stellar chromospheres.

by the order of perturbation, which is expected to make the scheme less

envelope via a slow dense wind back into the interstellar medium, to form the
next generation of stars and planets. Stellar pulsations are thought to elevate
gas to an altitude cool enough for the condensation of dust, which is then
accelerated by radiation pressure from starlight, entraining the gas and
driving the wind. However accounting for the mass loss has been a problem due
to the difficulty in observing tenuous gas and dust tens of milliarcseconds
from the star, and there is accordingly no consensus on the way sufficient
momentum is transferred from the starlight to the outflow. Here, we present
spatially-resolved, multi-wavelength observations of circumstellar dust shells
of three stars on the asymptotic giant branch of the HR diagram. When imaged in
scattered light, dust shells were found at remarkably small radii (<~ 2 stellar
radii) and with unexpectedly large grains (~300 nm radius). This proximity to
the photosphere argues for dust species that are transparent to starlight and
therefore resistant to sublimation by the intense radiation field. While
transparency usually implies insufficient radiative pressure to drive a wind,
the radiation field can accelerate these large grains via photon scattering
rather than absorption - a plausible mass-loss mechanism for lower-amplitude
pulsating stars.

with close binary central. We have made a Monte Carlo simulation to determine
the fraction of red giant binaries that go through a common envelope (CE) event
leading to the production of a close binary system or a merged star. The novel
aspect of this simulation is that we use the observed frequency of sequence E
binaries in the LMC to normalize our calculations. In our standard model, we
find that in the LMC today the fraction of PNe with close binary central stars
is 7-9%, the fraction of PNe with intermediate period binary central stars
having separations capable of influencing the nebula shape (P<500 yrs) is
23-27%, the fraction of PNe containing wide binaries that are unable to
influence the nebula shape (P>500 yrs) is 46-55%, the fraction of PNe derived
from single stars is 3-19% and 5-6% of PNe are produced by previously merged
stars. We also predict that the birthrate of post-RGB stars is ~4% of the total
PN birthrate, equivalent to ~50% of the production rate of PNe with close
binary central stars. These post-RGB stars most likely appear initially as
luminous low-mass helium white dwarf binaries. We use our model and the
observed number of red giant stars in the top one magnitude of the RGB in the
LMC to predict the number of PNe in the LMC. We predict 548 PNe in good
agreement with the 541+/-89 PNe observed by Reid & Parker (2006). Since most of
these PNe come from single or non-interacting binary stars in our model, this
means that most such stars produce PNe contrary to the ""Binary Hypothesis""
which suggests that binary interaction is required to produce a PN.

are reduced due to the effect of $H$ together with $Z$. Remarkably, $Z^{-1}$ is
found to be largely enhanced due to $H$ especially for $H_1 \siml H \siml H_2$,
where the field induced heavy-fermion state is realized. The obtained results
seem to be consistent with the experimental results observed in the anisotropic
Kondo semiconductors such as CeNiSn.

within an open cluster. Guided by the predictions of modern theoretical models
of the late-stage evolution of heavy-weight intermediate mass stars, we
conclude that there is a distinct possibility it has a core composed of O and
Ne. We also determine that despite the cooling times of the three new white
dwarfs in NGC3532 and the previously known degenerate member NGC3532-10
spanning ~90Myr, they all have remarkably similar masses (M~0.9-1Msun). This is
fully consistent with the results from our prior work on a heterogeneous sample
of ~50 white dwarfs from 12 stellar populations, on the basis of which we
argued that the stellar initial mass-final mass relation is less steep at
Minit>4Msun than in the adjacent lower initial mass regime. This change in the
gradient of the relation could account for the secondary peak observed in the
mass distribution of the field white dwarf population and mitigate the need to
invoke close binary evolution to explain its existence. Spectroscopic
investigation of numerous additional candidate white dwarf members of NGC3532
unearthed by a recent independent study would be useful to confirm (or
otherwise) these conclusions.

discussions. Among the approaches to finite elastoplasticity two became
especially popular. The first, implemented in the commercial finite element
codes, is based on the introduction of a hypoelastic constitutive law and the
additive elastic-plastic decomposition of the deformation rate tensor.
Unfortunately, the use of hypoelasticity may lead to a nonphysical creation or
dissipation of energy in a closed deformation cycle. In order to replace
hypoelasticity with hyperelasticity the second popular approach based on the
multiplicative elastic-plastic decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor
was developed. Unluckily, the latter theory is not perfect as well because it
introduces intermediate plastic configurations, which are geometrically
incompatible, non-unique, and, consequently, fictitious physically. In the
present work, an attempt is made to combine strengths of the described
approaches avoiding their drawbacks. Particularly, a tensor of the plastic
deformation rate is introduced in the additive elastic-plastic decomposition of
the velocity gradient. This tensor is used in the flow rule defined by the
generalized isotropic Reiner-Rivlin fluid. The tensor of the plastic
deformation rate is also used in an evolution equation that allows calculating
an elastic strain tensor which, in its turn, is used in the hyperelastic
constitutive law. Thus, the present approach employs hyperelasticity and the
additive decomposition of the velocity gradient avoiding nonphysical
hypoelasticity and the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient
associated with incompatible plastic configurations. The developed finite
elastoplasticity framework for isotropic materials is specified to extend the
classical -theory of metal plasticity to large deformations and the simple
shear deformation is analyzed.

theories of special interest, for which they can serve as approximations. The
idea can be applied to a large class of nonlinear theories, exemplified here
with a PL analogs of scalar theories, and of Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics.
The general class of such PL theories of electromagnetism are governed by a
Lagrangian L=-(1/2)F_mnQ^mn+ S(Q_mn), where the electromagnetic field couples
to currents in the standard way, while Qmn is an auxiliary field, derived from
a vector potential that does not couple directly to currents. By picking a
special form of S(Q_mn), we can make such a theory similar in some regards to a
given fully nonlinear theory, governed by the Lagrangian -U(F_mn). A
particularly felicitous choice is to take S as the Legendre transform of U. For
the BI theory, this Legendre transform has the same form as the BI Lagrangian
itself. Various matter-of-principle questions remain to be answered regarding
such theories. As a specific example, I discuss BI electrostatics in more
detail. As an aside, for BI, I derive an exact expression for the
short-distance force between two arbitrary point charges of the same sign, in

particles between the central bulk that moves with an almost constant velocity,

because shear-induced diffusion cannot efficiently disperse particles from the

parameter region than in the metallic host. The result indicates that the Kondo
resonance indeed can form ranged from the Kondo regime, to the mixed valence,
even to the empty orbital regime. While the Kondo resonance displays as a sharp
peak in the first regime, it has a peak-dip structure and/or an anti-resonance
in the remaining two regimes, which result from the Fano resonance due to the
significant background leaded by dramatically broadening of the impurity level

potential is tuned by the gate voltages applied to the graphene. Finally, we
explore the influence of the direct tunneling channel between the STM tip and

literature, while the observations of six stars, plus additional measurements
for a star previously observed, are presented here for the first time.
  All our determinations of magnetic field in the central planetary nebulae are
consistent with null results. Our field measurements have a typical error bar
of 150-300 G. Previous spurious field detections obtained with FORS were
probably due to the use of different wavelength calibration solutions for
frames obtained at different position angles of the retarder waveplate.
  Currently, there is no observational evidence for the presence of magnetic
fields with a strength of the order of hundreds Gauss or higher in the central
stars of planetary nebulae.

straight-line segmentation methods are rigorously analysed. These are
\emph{curvature corrections} that account for the induced velocity contribution
at a point on a vortex filament due to local curvature and \emph{core
corrections} that remove unrealistically high induced velocities near vortex
segments. Two alternative versions of the latter correction are studied: the
original as introduced by Scully and a recently introduced improved correction
by the authors. The problem is analysed using a viscous vortex ring. A
high-order numerical filament method is presented that uses rational B-spline
curves to model the vortex ring geometry exactly. First, the separate influence
of the two corrections on induced velocity values are studied using the
numerical filament method. Afterwards, the corrections are combined in four
separate cases that are studied using the segmentation method. It is found that
in order to get accurate results at coarse discretisations, curvature
corrections cannot be neglected. When used together with the original core
correction model, results start to diverge from the reference values for
discretisations smaller than approximately ten degrees. Combining the curvature
correction with the improved core correction extends the discretisation region
for which accurate results are found down by approximately one order. Finally,
it is shown that segmentation methods that use the original core correction
model without curvature correction completely fail to converge to the reference
values.

zero correlation time ($\tau$) in the presence of shear. Previous results
obtained when shear was absent are generalized to the case with shear. The
question of whether the mean magnetic field can grow in the presence of shear
and non helical turbulence, as seen in numerical simulations, is examined. We
show in a general manner that, if the motions are strictly non helical, then
such mean field dynamo action is not possible. This result is not limited to
low (fluid or magnetic) Reynolds numbers nor does it use any closure
approximation; it only assumes that the flow renovates itself after each time
interval $\tau$. Specifying to a particular form of the renovating flow with
helicity, we recover the standard dispersion relation of the $\alpha^2 \Omega$
dynamo, in the small $\tau$ or large wavelength limit. Thus mean fields grow
even in the presence of rapidly growing fluctuations, surprisingly, in a manner
predicted by the standard quasilinear closure, even though such a closure is
not strictly justified. Our work also suggests the possibility of obtaining
mean field dynamo growth in the presence of helicity fluctuations, although
having a coherent helicity will be more efficient.

Using this similarity it is possible to determine the k-nearest neighbors of an

resistance of the first junction is high, while the resistance of the second
one is low. In this case the first junction cools the left normal electrode,
while the second junction partially removes excited quasiparticles from the
superconductor. We consider cooling properties of this double junction

  Sigma Models with a potential in (A)dS4","Several typos corrected",,"10.1007/JHEP06(2012)127",,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of this paper is to construct accelerated, stationary and
axisymmetric exact solutions of the Einstein theory with self interacting
scalar fields in (A)dS4. To warm up, the backreaction of the (non)-minimally
coupled scalar field is solved, the scalar field equations are integrated and
all the potentials compatible with the metric ansatz and Einstein gravity are
found. With these results at hand the non-linear sigma model is tackled. The
scalar field Lagrangian is generic; neither the coupling to the curvature,
neither the metric in the scalar manifold nor the potential, are fixed ab
initio. The unique assumption in the analysis is the metric ansatz: it has the
form of the most general Petrov type D vacuum solution of general relativity;
it is a a cohomogeneity two Weyl rescaling of the Carter metric and therefore
it has the typical Plebanski-Demianski form with two arbitrary functions of one
variable and one arbitrary functions of two variables. It is shown, by an
straightforward manipulation of the field equations, that the metric is
completely integrable without necessity of specifiying anything in the scalar
Lagrangian. This results in that the backreaction of the scalar fields, within
this class of metrics, is universal. The metric functions generically show an
explicit dependence on a dynamical exponent that allows to smoothly connect
this new family of solutions with the actual Plebanski-Demianski spacetime. The
remaining field equations imply that the scalar fields follow geodesics in the
scalar manifold with an affine parameter given by a non-linear function of the
spacetime coordinates and define the on-shell form of the potential plus a
functional equation that it has to satisfy. Finally, a general family of (A)dS4
static hairy black holes is explicitly constructed and its properties are
outlined.

calculations (DFT) are used increasingly often in experimental condensed-matter
physics and materials engineering as data. These predictions are used to
analyze recent measurements, or to plan future experiments. Increasingly more
experimental scientists in these fields therefore face the natural question:
what is the expected error for such an ab initio prediction? Information and
experience about this question is scattered over two decades of literature. The
present review aims to summarize and quantify this implicit knowledge. This
leads to a practical protocol that allows any scientist - experimental or
theoretical - to determine justifiable error estimates for many basic property
predictions, without having to perform additional DFT calculations. A central
role is played by a large and diverse test set of crystalline solids,
containing all ground-state elemental crystals (except most lanthanides). For
several properties of each crystal, the difference between DFT results and
experimental values is assessed. We discuss trends in these deviations and
review explanations suggested in the literature. A prerequisite for such an
error analysis is that different implementations of the same first-principles
formalism provide the same predictions. Therefore, the reproducibility of
predictions across several mainstream methods and codes is discussed too. A
quality factor Delta expresses the spread in predictions from two distinct DFT
implementations by a single number. To compare the PAW method to the highly
accurate APW+lo approach, a code assessment of VASP and GPAW with respect to
WIEN2k yields Delta values of 1.9 and 3.3 meV/atom, respectively. These
differences are an order of magnitude smaller than the typical difference with
experiment, and therefore predictions by APW+lo and PAW are for practical
purposes identical.

lattice magnetic system FeGa2S4. A magnetic transition not previously detected
by specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements is found in zero
field at T^* \simeq 30 K. It is observed through the temperature dependencies
of the signal amplitude and the spin-lattice relaxation rate. This transition
is therefore not a conventional magnetic phase transition. Since persistent
spin dynamics is observed down to 0.1 K, the ground state cannot be of the
canonical spin-glass type, which could be suggested from hysteresis effects in
the bulk susceptibility below T_f \simeq 16 K. These results are compared to
those found for the isomorph NiGa2S4. It is argued that the fate of the
transition, which has been interpreted in terms of the Z_2 topological
transition in this latter system, is probably different in FeGa2S4.

correlations for the real eigenvalues of Hermitian random matrices of size NxN
can be extended to complex eigenvalues in the case of random matrices without
symmetry. Depending on the location in the spectrum, particular large-N limits
(the so-called weakly non-Hermitian limits) lead to one-parameter deformations
of the Airy, sine and Bessel kernels into the complex plane. This makes their
universality highly suggestive for all symmetry classes. We compare all the
known limiting real kernels and their deformations into the complex plane for
all three Dyson indices beta=1,2,4, corresponding to real, complex and
quaternion real matrix elements. This includes new results for Airy kernels in
the complex plane for beta=1,4. For the Gaussian ensembles of elliptic Ginibre
and non-Hermitian Wishart matrices we give all kernels for finite N, built from
orthogonal and skew-orthogonal polynomials in the complex plane. Finally we
comment on how much is known to date regarding the universality of these
kernels in the complex plane, and discuss some open problems.

Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect signal D_A^2 Y for a sample of 19 objects for
which weak lensing (WL) mass measurements obtained from Subaru Telescope data
are available in the literature. Hydrostatic X-ray masses are derived from
XMM-Newton archive data and the SZ effect signal is measured from Planck
all-sky survey data. We find an M_WL-D_A^2 Y relation that is consistent in
slope and normalisation with previous determinations using weak lensing masses;
however, there is a normalisation offset with respect to previous measures
based on hydrostatic X-ray mass-proxy relations. We verify that our SZ effect
measurements are in excellent agreement with previous determinations from
Planck data. For the present sample, the hydrostatic X-ray masses at R_500 are
on average ~ 20 per cent larger than the corresponding weak lensing masses, at
odds with expectations. We show that the mass discrepancy is driven by a
difference in mass concentration as measured by the two methods, and, for the
present sample, the mass discrepancy and difference in mass concentration is
especially large for disturbed systems. The mass discrepancy is also linked to
the offset in centres used by the X-ray and weak lensing analyses, which again
is most important in disturbed systems. We outline several approaches that are
needed to help achieve convergence in cluster mass measurement with X-ray and
weak lensing observations.

excited by either femtosecond pulses at a wavelength of 0.8 \mu m or broadband
(0.1 - 1.5 THz) picosecond pulses of coherent synchrotron radiation. The
transients in response to optical radiation are qualitatively well explained in
the framework of the two-temperature model with a fast component in the

During the experiment, a rat placed near the chamber comes into it (for the
innate preference for darkness) and locates itself inside with its head for the
exit. At that moment ECG recording starts. This method allows to record heart
rate in the intact rodents (without anesthesia and stress) and does not require

nearly 2 GHz. The unprecedented level of sensitivity allows us to detect
adsorption events of naphthalene molecules (C10H8) and to measure the binding
energy of a Xe atom on the nanotube surface (131 meV). These ultrasensitive
nanotube resonators offer new opportunities for mass spectrometry,
magnetometry, and adsorption experiments.

survey, RXC J1504.1-0248 (hereafter R1504; z=0.2153), using XMM-Newton X-ray
imaging spectroscopy, VLT/VIMOS optical spectroscopy, and WFI optical imaging.
The mass distributions were determined using both the so-called hydrostatic
method with X-ray imaging spectroscopy and the dynamical method with optical
spectroscopy, respectively, which yield M^{H.E.}_{500}=(5.81+/-0.49)*1.e14Msun
and M^{caustic}_{500}=(4.17+/-0.42)*1e14Msun. According to recent calibrations,
the richness derived mass estimates closely agree with the hydrostatic and
dynamical mass estimates. The line-of-sight velocities of spectroscopic members
reveal a group of galaxies with high-velocities (>1000 km/s) at a projected
distance of about r^{H.E.}_{500}=(1.18+/-0.03) Mpc south-east of the cluster
centroid, which is also indicated in the X-ray two-dimensional (2-D)
temperature, density, entropy, and pressure maps. The dynamical mass estimate
is 80% of the hydrostatic mass estimate at r^{H.E.}_{500}. It can be partially
explained by the ~20% scatter in the 2-D pressure map that can be propagated
into the hydrostatic mass estimate. The uncertainty in the dynamical mass
estimate caused by the substructure of the high velocity group is ~14%. The
dynamical mass estimate using blue members is 1.23 times that using red
members. The global properties of R1504 obey the observed scaling relations of
nearby clusters, although its stellar-mass fraction is rather low.

is based on 4.6/fb of proton-proton collision data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV collected
by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, using top quark pair
events with a tau lepton in the final state. The data are consistent with the
expected background from Standard Model processes. Assuming that the branching
ratio of the charged Higgs boson to a tau lepton and a neutrino is 100%, this
leads to upper limits on the branching ratio of top quark decays to a b quark
and a charged Higgs boson between 5% and 1% for charged Higgs boson masses
ranging from 90 GeV to 160 GeV, respectively. In the context of the mh-max
scenario of the MSSM, tan(beta) above 12-26, as well as between 1 and 2-6, can
be excluded for charged Higgs boson masses between 90 GeV and 150 GeV.

be used to construct estimators of the quantiles of the distribution of a root

These results are then applied (i) to construct confidence regions that behave
well uniformly over $\mathbf{P}$ in the sense that the coverage probability
tends to at least the nominal level uniformly over $\mathbf{P}$ and (ii) to
construct tests that behave well uniformly over $\mathbf{P}$ in the sense that
the size tends to no greater than the nominal level uniformly over
$\mathbf{P}$. Without these stronger notions of convergence, the asymptotic
approximations to the coverage probability or size may be poor, even in very
large samples. Specific applications include the multivariate mean, testing
moment inequalities, multiple testing, the empirical process and U-statistics.

Their adaptation and resilience behaviour is principal for understanding
restructuring of ecological communities. In spite of the importance of IGP food
webs their behaviour even for the simplest 3-species systems has not been fully
explored. One fundamental question is how an increase of diversity of the
lowest trophic level impacts the persistence of higher trophic levels in IGP
relationships. We analyze a 3-species food web model with a heterogeneous
resources and IGP. The model consists of two predators directly coupled via IGP
relation and indirectly via competition for resource. The resource is
subdivided into distinct subpopulations. Individuals in the subpopulations are
grazed at different rates by the predators. We consider two models: an IGP
module with immobilization by the top predator and an IGP module with species
turnover. We examine the effect of increasing enrichment and varying
immobilization (resource transfer) rate on a stable coexistence of predators
and resources. We explore how the predictions from the basic 3-species model
are altered when the IGP module is extended to multiple resource
subpopulations. We investigate which parameters support a robust coexistence in
the IGP system. For the case of multiple subpopulations of the resource we
present a numerical comparison of the percentage of food webs with stable
coexistence for different dimensionalities of the resource community. At low
immobilization (transfer) rates our model predicts a stable 3-species
coexistence only for intermediate enrichment meanwhile at high rates a large
set of stable equilibrium configurations is found for high enrichment as well.

  Collective intelligence has existed at least as long as humans have, because
families, armies, countries, and companies have all - at least sometimes -
acted collectively in ways that seem intelligent. But in the last decade or so
a new kind of collective intelligence has emerged: groups of people and
computers, connected by the Internet, collectively doing intelligent things.
For example, Google technology harvests knowledge generated by millions of
people creating and linking web pages and then uses this knowledge to answer
queries in ways that often seem amazingly intelligent. Or in Wikipedia,
thousands of people around the world have collectively created a very large and
high quality intellectual product with almost no centralized control, and
almost all as volunteers! These early examples of Internet-enabled collective
intelligence are not the end of the story but just the beginning. And in order
to understand the possibilities and constraints of these new kinds of
intelligence, we need a new interdisciplinary field.
