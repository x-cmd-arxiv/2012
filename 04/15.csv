high-contrast media. The background conductivity is taken to be one and we
assume the medium contains high (or low) conductivity inclusions. We derive an
asymptotic expansion with respect to the contrast and provide a procedure to
compute the terms in the expansion. The computation of the expansion does not
depend on the contrast which is important for simulations. The latter allows
avoiding increased mesh resolution around high conductivity features. This work
is partly motivated by our earlier work in \cite{ge09_1} where we design
efficient numerical procedures for solving high-contrast problems. These
multiscale approaches require local solutions and our proposed high-order
expansion can be used to approximate these local solutions inexpensively. In
the case of a large-number of inclusions, the proposed analysis can help to
design localization techniques for computing the terms in the expansion. In the
paper, we present a rigorous analysis of the proposed high-order expansion and
estimate the remainder of it. We consider both high and low conductivity
inclusions.

to quantum field theories and quantum gravity. The equivalence hypothesis can
be viewed as adaptation of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to quantum
mechanics. The construction reveals two key identities that underly the
formalism in Euclidean or Minkowski spaces. The first is a cocycle condition,
which is invariant under $D$--dimensional Mobius transformations with Euclidean
or Minkowski metrics. The second is a quadratic identity which is a
representation of the D-dimensional quantum Hamilton--Jacobi equation. In this
approach, the solutions of the associated Schrodinger equation are used to
solve the nonlinear quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation. A basic property of the
construction is that the two solutions of the corresponding Schrodinger
equation must be retained. The quantum potential, which arises in the
formalism, can be interpreted as a curvature term. I propose that the quantum
potential, which is always non-trivial and is an intrinsic energy term
characterising a particle, can be interpreted as dark energy. Numerical
estimates of its magnitude show that it is extremely suppressed. In the
multi--particle case the quantum potential, as well as the mass, are
cumulative.

dependent sequence of samples from complex distributions. Conventionally, these
methods require a source of independent random variates. Most implementations
use pseudo-random numbers instead because generating true independent variates
with a physical system is not straightforward. In this paper we show how to
modify some commonly used Markov chains to use a dependent stream of random
numbers in place of independent uniform variates. The resulting Markov chains
have the correct invariant distribution without requiring detailed knowledge of
the stream's dependencies or even its marginal distribution. As a side-effect,
sometimes far fewer random numbers are required to obtain accurate results.

completeness, for which it is necessary and sufficient that the zero set has

Hilbert-Schmidt class, equivalent to the zero set being of measure zero, and
the third, known as regularity, is equivalent to the zero set being empty. We

~2-4 in the number of ULXs per blue luminosity for the strongly interacting

star formation, as interacting galaxies tend to have enhanced star formation
rates on average. For most of the Arp galaxies in our sample, the total number
of ULXs compared to the far-infrared luminosity is consistent with values found
earlier for spiral galaxies. This suggests that for these galaxies, ULXs trace
recent star formation. However, for the most infrared-luminous galaxies, we
find a deficiency of ULXs compared to the infrared luminosity. For these very
infrared-luminous galaxies, AGNs may contribute to powering the far-infrared;
alternatively, ULXs may be highly obscured in the X-ray in these galaxies and
therefore not detected by these Chandra observations. We determined local
UV/optical colors within the galaxies in the vicinity of the candidate ULXs
using GALEX UV and SDSS optical images. In most cases, the distributions of
colors are similar to the global colors of interacting galaxies. However, the u
- g and r - i colors at the ULX locations tend to be bluer on average than
these global colors, suggesting that ULXs are preferentially found in regions
with young stellar populations. In the Arp sample there is a possible
enhancement of a factor of ~2 - 5 in the fraction of galactic nuclei that are
X-ray bright compared to more normal spirals.

theory uses the dihedral group D24 to study transformations between major and

developments of neo-Riemannian theory, many developments and generalizations
have been proposed, based on other sets of chords, other groups, etc. However
music theory also face problems for example when defining transformations
between chords of different cardinalities, or for transformations that are not
necessarily invertible. This paper introduces a categorical construction of
musical transformations based on category extensions using groupoids. This can
be seen as a generalization of a previous work which aimed at building
generalized neo-Riemannian groups of transformations based on group extensions.
The categorical extension construction allows the definition of partial
transformations between different set-classes. Moreover, it can be shown that
the typical wreath products groups of transformations can be recovered from the
category extensions by ""packaging"" operators and considering their composition.

We focus on measurements in the ""inter-moss"" region, that is, the region

reduce the uncertainties at the highest temperatures we present a new method
for isolating the Fe XVIII emission in the AIA/SDO 94 channel. The resulting

showing that the temperature distribution in an active region core is often
strongly peaked near 4 MK. We characterize the properties of the emission
distribution as a function of the total unsigned magnetic flux. We find that
the amount of high temperature emission in the active region core is correlated
with the total unsigned magnetic flux, while the emission at lower
temperatures, in contrast, is inversely related. These results provide
compelling evidence that high temperature active region emission is often close
to equilibrium, although weaker active regions may be dominated by evolving
million degree loops in the core.

""contamination-free"" result with z >~ 7 photometric Ly{\alpha} LFs previously

Ly{\alpha} though deep enough to detect it. We calculated the expected number
of LAEs in our survey, using five z=7 and three z=7.7 Ly{\alpha} LFs from
recent surveys. Seven of them are consistent with null detection
(0.1^{+1.8}_{-0.1}-1.1^{+2.2}_{-1.0} LAEs) within errors including Poisson
statistics and cosmic variance, but average values (0.7-1.1 LAEs) predicted
from one z=7 and two z=7.7 LFs among the seven indicate nearly a single
detection. The remaining one z=7 LF predicts 3.0^{+3.2}_{-2.0} LAEs. As to z=7,
the discrepancy likely comes from different LAE selection criteria. For z=7.7,
there are two possibilities; (1) If z=7.7 LAEs are somehow brighter in
Ly{\alpha} luminosity than lower redshift LAEs, z=7.7 LF is observed to be
similar to or higher than lower redshift LFs even if attenuated by neutral
hydrogen. (2) All/most of the z=7.7 candidates are not LAEs. This supports the
decline of LF from z ~ 6 to 7.7 and reionization at z ~ 6-7.7.

(FWHM ~ 21 nm centered at 1005 nm). We investigated if there exist objects
consistent with the color of z=7.3 LAEs behind the clusters but could not
detect any LAEs to the unlensed line limit F(Lya) ~ 6.9 x 10^{-18} erg/s/cm^2.
Using several z=7 Lya luminosity functions (LFs) from the literature, we
estimated and compared the expected detection numbers of z ~ 7 LAEs in lensing
and blank field surveys in the case of using an 8m class ground based
telescope. Given the steep bright-end slope of the LFs, when the detector
field-of view (FOV) is comparable to the angular extent of a massive lensing
cluster, imaging cluster(s) is more efficient in detecting z ~ 7 LAEs than
imaging a blank field. However, the gain is expected to be modest, a factor of
two at most and likely much less depending on the adopted LFs. The main
advantage of lensing-cluster survey, therefore, remains to be the gain in depth
and not necessarily in detection efficiency. For much larger detectors, the
lensing effect becomes negligible and the efficiency of LAE detection is
proportional to the instrumental FOV. We also inspected NB1006 images of three
z ~ 7 z-dropouts previously detected in Abell 2390 and found that none of them
are detected in NB1006. Two of them are consistent with predictions from the
previous studies that they would be at lower redshifts. The other one has a
photometric redshift of z ~ 7.3, and if it is at z=7.3, its unlensed Lya line
flux would be very faint: F(Lya) < 4.4 x 10^{-18} erg/s/cm^2 (1 sigma upper
limit) or rest frame equivalent width of W(Lya) < 26A. Its Lya emission might
be attenuated by neutral hydrogen, as recent studies show that the fraction of
Lyman break galaxies displaying strong Lya emission is lower at z ~ 7 than at z
<~ 6.

theory. The nearest neighbor transposition chain \cal{M}}_{nn} is known to
converge in time \Theta(n^3 \log n) in the uniform case and time \Theta(n^2) in

probability p \neq 1/2 and out of order with probability 1-p. Here we consider
the variable bias case where we put adjacent elements x<y in order with
probability p{x,y} and out of order with probability 1-p_{x,y}. The problem of
bounding the mixing rate of M_{nn} was posed by Fill and was motivated by the
Move-Ahead-One self-organizing list update algorithm. It was conjectured that
the chain would always be rapidly mixing if 1/2 \leq p_{x,y} \leq 1 for all x <
y, but this was only known in the case of constant bias or when p_{x,y} is
equal to 1/2 or 1, a case that corresponds to sampling linear extensions of a
partial order. We prove the chain is rapidly mixing for two classes: ""Choose
Your Weapon,"" where we are given r_1,..., r_{n-1} with r_i \geq 1/2 and
p_{x,y}=r_x for all x<y (so the dominant player chooses the game, thus fixing
his or her probability of winning), and ""League Hierarchies,"" where there are
two leagues and players from the A-league have a fixed probability of beating
players from the B-league, players within each league are similarly divided
into sub-leagues with a possibly different fixed probability, and so forth
recursively. Both of these classes include permutations with constant bias as a
special case. Moreover, we also prove that the most general conjecture is false
by constructing a counterexample where 1/2 \leq p_{x,y} \leq 1 for all x< y,

discovered in the study due to which the direction of mass flux changes. As a
result of this, the recirculation zone moves forward and backward during the
transients and the pressure in the secondary chamber rises and falls. The
system behaves as a damped oscillatory flow in which the direction of mass flux
keeps on changing and finally settles down to a state where there is no mass
flux in either direction. The movement of recirculation zone due to this
inertial effect is studied in more detail for various flow and geometric
parameters. The results obtained show that the pressure and mass flux through
the secondary chamber depend highly on both the thickness of the primary and
secondary jet and the chamber volume. The inertial effect reduces with the
reduction in thickness of primary and secondary flow. The inertial effect is
found to be decreasing with increasing secondary chamber volume. It is also
found that, the inertial effect decreases as the primary jet pressure
increases, for all other parameters remaining the same. The computationally
simulated flow field and the pressure on the secondary chamber are compared

weighted, quantifier-free formulas. In this paper we extend these earlier
results, and show that under the assumption that NETIME =/= ETIME, there is no

performance gains of highly managed medium access control schemes that would be
required to implement these placements. In a wireless network consisting of
randomly distributed nodes, our performance metrics are the optimum
transmission range that achieves the most optimal tradeoff between the progress
of packets in desired directions towards their respective destinations and the
total number of transmissions required to transport packets to their
destinations. We evaluate ALOHA based scheme where simultaneous transmitters
are dispatched according to a uniform Poisson distribution and compare it with
various grid pattern based schemes where simultaneous transmitters are
positioned in specific regular patterns. Our results show that optimizing the
medium access control in multi-hop network should take into account the
parameters like signal-to-interference ratio threshold and attenuation
coefficient. For instance, at typical values of signal-to-interference ratio
threshold and attenuation coefficient, the most optimal scheme is based on
triangular grid pattern and, under no fading channel model, the most optimal
transmission range and network capacity are higher than the optimum
transmission range and capacity achievable with ALOHA based scheme by factors
of two and three respectively. Later on, we also identify the optimal medium
access control schemes when signal-to-interference ratio threshold and

  without QCD","6 pages, 1 figure",,,,"nucl-th hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Excited states of the nucleon were predicted by Wentzel already in 1940.
Wentzel showed that such kind of states can be derived from models of meson
field theory if they are treated above a certain coupling strength. In
particular for a pseudo-scalar meson field theory such kind of states were
derived by Pauli and Dancoff in 1942 with equal amount of spin and isospin.
They can be understood as arising from excitation of the pionic cloud of the
nucleon by which the main part of nuclear forces also is coming out. The
excitation of these states also is the mechanism by which the pion-nucleon
resonance scattering is originated which firstly was experimentally discovered
by Fermi in 1955.
  In the following contribution a completion of the method of Wentzel and Pauli
& Dancoff is sketched following a work of the author and treating the
pion-nucleon resonance scattering. By means of a canonical and nonlinear
transformation of variables the original meson field is split into a free meson
part and a self field part of the nucleon. The transformation is defined such
that the interaction between the compound nucleon system thus arising and the
free mesons vanish in the case of infinitely strong coupling. The solution of
this field splitting problem is presented and the problem of calculating the
pion-nucleon resonance scattering from this strong-coupling theory is treated
on this basis. Numerical results obtained from such a calculation are
discussed. For the sake of simplicity the symmetric pseudoscalar
fixed-and-extended-source meson field theory is used and found that the lowest
pion-nucleon resonance scattering is quite well reproduced with essentially the
same parameters necessary to reproduce the nucleon-nucleon-potential. The
present investigation will serve to guide more extended considerations in this
direction.

synapses to transmit information between neurons, and within neuronal networks.
Even at the level of connections between single neurons, direct confirmation of
this simple conjecture has proven elusive. By combining paired-cell recordings,
realistic synaptic modelling and information theory, we provide evidence that
short-term plasticity can not only improve, but also reduce information
transfer between neurons. We focus on a concrete example in rat neocortex, but
our results may generalise to other systems. When information is contained in
the timings of individual spikes, we find that facilitation, depression and
recovery affect information transmission in proportion to their impacts upon
the probability of neurotransmitter release. When information is instead
conveyed by mean spike rate only, the influences of short-term plasticity
critically depend on the range of spike frequencies that the target network can
distinguish (its effective dynamic range). Our results suggest that to
efficiently transmit information, the brain must match synaptic type, coding
strategy and network connectivity during development and behaviour.

transitions of Yang-Mills matter at finite temperature, quark chemical
potential $\mu_Q$ and number of colors $N_c$. We find that, whereas the
critical $N_c$ for percolation goes down with density, the critical $N_c$ for
confinement generally goes up. Because of this, Yang-Mills matter falls into
two qualitatively different regimes: the ""low-$N_c$ limit"", where percolation
does not occur because matter deconfines before it percolates, and the
high-$N_c$ limit, where there are three distinct phases characterizing
Yang-Mills matter at finite temperature and density: confined, deconfined and
confined but percolating matter. The latter can be thought of as the recently
conjectured ""quarkyonic phase"". We attempt to estimate the critical $N_c$, to
see if the percolating phase can occur in our world. We find that, while
percolation will not occur at normal nuclear density as in the large-$N_c$
limit, a sliver of the phase diagram in $N_c$, energy density and baryonic
density where percolation occurs while confinement persists is possible. We
conclude by speculating on the phenomenological properties of such percolating
""quarkyonic"" matter, suggest avenues to study it quantitatively, and look for
it in experiment.

particles with nematic aligning interactions. This class of materials has polar
symmetry at the microscopic level, but forms macrostates of nematic symmetry.
We highlight three key features of the dynamics. First, as in polar active
fluids, the control parameter for the order-disorder transition, namely the
density, is dynamically convected by active currents, resulting in a generic,
model independent dynamical self-regulation that destabilizes the uniform
nematic state near the mean-field transition. Secondly, curvature driven
currents render the system unstable deep in the nematic state, as found
previously. Finally, and unique to self-propelled nematics, nematic order
induces local polar order that in turn leads to the growth of density
fluctuations. We propose this as a possible mechanism for the smectic order of
polar clusters seen in numerical simulations.

unsolved problem in stochastic control theory, i.e., to establish the
Pontryagin-type maximum principle for optimal controls of general infinite
dimensional nonlinear stochastic evolution equations. Both drift and diffusion
terms can contain the control variables, and the control domains are allowed to
be nonconvex. The key to reach it is to provide a suitable formulation of
operator-valued backward stochastic evolution equations (BSEEs for short), as
well as a way to define their solutions. Besides, both vector-valued and
operator-valued BSEEs, with solutions in the sense of transposition, are
studied. As a crucial preliminary, some weakly sequential Banach-Alaoglu-type
theorems are established for uniformly bounded linear operators between Banach
spaces.

randomly distributed adsorbates. When graphene is subjected to periodically
distributed adatoms, the enhanced spin-orbit couplings can result in various
topological phases. However, at certain adatom coverages, the intervalley
scattering renders the system a trivial insulator. By employing a finite-size
scaling approach and Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker formula, we show that the
randomization of adatom distribution greatly weakens the intervalley
scattering, but plays a negligible role in spin-orbit couplings. Consequently,
such a randomization turns graphene from a trivial insulator into a topological
state.

In this paper, we propose a dual-strategy routing model for network traffic
system, to realize the plenary utility of the whole network. The packets are
delivered according to different ""efficient routing strategies"" [Yan, et al,
Phys. Rev. E 73, 046108 (2006)]. We introduce the accumulate rate of packets,
{\eta} to measure the performance of traffic system in the congested phase, and
propose the so-called equivalent generation rate of packet to analyze the
jamming processes. From analytical and numerical results, we find that, for
suitable selection of strategies, the dual- strategy system performs better
than the single-strategy system in a broad region of strategy mixing ratio. The
analytical solution to the jamming processes is verified by estimating the
number of jammed nodes, which coincides well with the result from simulation.
