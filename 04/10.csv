tandem by viewing it as a stochastic hybrid system and developing a Stochastic
Flow Model (SFM) for it. Using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA), we
derive on-line gradient estimates of a cost metric with respect to the
controllable green and red cycle lengths. The IPA estimators obtained require
counting traffic light switchings and estimating car flow rates only when
specific events occur. The estimators are used to iteratively adjust light
cycle lengths to improve performance and, in conjunction with a standard
gradient-based algorithm, to obtain optimal values which adapt to changing
traffic conditions. Simulation results are included to illustrate the approach.

that if $X$ is a curve and $V$ is not strongly semistable, then some Frobenius

Biswas, Yogish I. Holla, A.J. Parameswaran, and S. Subramanian showed that
there is always a counterexample to this over any algebraically closed field of
positive characteristic which is uncountable. However, we will produce a smooth
projective variety over $\mathbb Z$ and a rank 2 vector bundle on it, which,
restricted to each prime $p$ in a nonempty open subset of $\spec\mathbb Z$,
constitutes a counterexample over $p$. Indeed, given any split semisimple
simply connected algebraic group $G$ of semisimple rank $>1$ over $\mathbb Z$,
we will show that there exists a smooth projective homogeneous space $X_Z$ over

scattering at small values of Bjorken $x$ is the gluon fusion. However, its
efficiency depends crucially on the vacuum color screening effect which
accompanies the multiplication and the diffusion of BFKL gluons from small to
large distances. From the fits to lattice data on field strength correlators
the propagation length of perturbative gluons is $R_c\simeq 0.2-0.3$ fermi. The

between the velocity and vorticity fields (i.e, the curl and Laplacian

domain via a zero-velocity margin, where an extended vorticity is found.
Re-calculation of the velocities (subjected to appropriate boundary

applied to the two- and three-dimensional problems for the homogeneous
Dirichlet, as well as periodic boundary conditions. The results show that the
solenoidality is satisfied up to the machine accuracy for the periodic boundary

an unprecedented spatial resolution of ~0.2 arcsec, corresponding to ~4 pc. We
have focused our study on the distribution and kinematics of the stars and the
ionised and molecular gas by studying in detail the Pa_alpha and Br_gamma
emission, the H_2 1-0S(1) line at 2.122 micron and the [FeII] line at 1.644
micron, together with the CO absorption bands at 2.293 micron and 2.323 micron.
Our results reveal a complex situation where the gas and stellar kinematics are
totally unrelated. Supernova explosions play an important role in shaping the
gas kinematics, dominated by shocks and inflows at scales of tens of parsecs
that make them unsuitable to derive general dynamical properties.
  We propose that the location of the nucleus of M83 is unlikely to be related
to the off-centre 'optical nucleus'. The study of the stellar kinematics
reveals that the optical nucleus is a gravitationally bound massive star
cluster with M_dyn = (1.1 \pm 0.4)x10^7 M_sun, formed by a past starburst. The
kinematic and photometric analysis of the cluster yield that the stellar
content of the cluster is well described by an intermediate age population of

The energies and widths of the various lines are shifted, and additional peaks
arise in the spectrum. Some of these peaks are Holstein sidebands, resulting
from the transfer of spectral weight in each Landau level (LL) into
phonon-assisted peaks in the spectral function. Other additional absorption
peaks result from transitions involving split LLs, which occur when a LL falls
sufficiently close to a peak in the self-energy. We establish the selection
rules for the additional transitions and characterize the additional absorption
peaks. For finite chemical potential, spectral weight is asymmetrically
distributed about the Dirac point; we discuss how this causes an asymmetry in
the transitions due to left- and right-handed circularly polarized light and
therefore oscillatory behavior in the imaginary part of the off-diagonal Hall
conductivity. We also find that the semiclassical cyclotron resonance region is
renormalized by an effective-mass factor but is not directly affected by the
additional transitions. Last, we discuss how the additional transitions can
manifest in broadened, rather than split, absorption peaks due to large
scattering rates seen in experiment.

First, we demonstrate that complete, elongated, and stable MACCs with fracture
strains exceeding 100% can be formed from both ultranarrow armchair and zigzag
GNRs. Second, we demonstrate that the deformation processes leading to the
MACCs have strong chirality dependence. Specifically, armchair GNRs first form
DNA-like chains, then develop into monatomic chains by passing through an
intermediate configuration in which monatomic chain sections are separated by
two-atom attachments. In contrast, zigzag GNRs form rope-ladder-like chains
through a process in which the carbon hexagons are first elongated into
rectangles; these rectangles eventually coalesce into monatomic chains through
a novel triangle-pentagon deformation structure under further tensile
deformation. Finally, we show that the width of GNRs plays an important role in
the formation of MACCs, and that the ultranarrow GNRs facilitate the formation
of full MACCs. The present work should be of considerable interest due to the
experimentally demonstrated feasibility of using narrow GNRs to fabricate novel
nanoelectronic components based upon monatomic chains of carbon atoms.

in a finitely connected domain $D \subset \mathbb{C}$ that behaves like a
Brownian motion away from the boundary of $D$ and picks a point according to
harmonic measure from infinity to reflect from every time it hits a boundary
component. We give a construction of ERBM using its conformal invariance and
develop the basic theory of its harmonic functions. One important reason for
studying ERBM is the hope that it will be a useful tool in the study of SLE in

construct conformal maps into certain classes of multiply connected domains.

the absence of forcing and examine in particular the role played by the
quadratic invariants of the system and by the symmetries of the initial
configurations. We observe that, when sufficient accuracy is used, initial
conditions with a high degree of symmetries, as in the absence of helicity, do
not travel through parameter space over time whereas by perturbing these
solutions either explicitly or implicitly using for example single precision
for long times, the flows depart from their original behavior and can become
either strongly helical, or have a strong alignment between the velocity and
the magnetic field. When the symmetries are broken, the flows evolve towards
different end states, as predicted by statistical arguments for non-dissipative
systems with the addition of an energy minimization principle, as already
analyzed in \cite{stribling_90} for random initial conditions using a moderate
number of Fourier modes. Furthermore, the alignment properties of these flows,
between velocity, vorticity, magnetic potential, induction and current,
correspond to the dominance of two main regimes, one helically dominated and
one in quasi-equipartition of kinetic and magnetic energy. We also contrast the
scaling of the ratio of magnetic energy to kinetic energy as a function of
wavenumber to the ratio of eddy turn-over time to Alfv\'en time as a function
of wavenumber. We find that the former ratio is constant with an approximate
equipartition for scales smaller than the largest scale of the flow whereas the
ratio of time scales increases with increasing wavenumber.

instances of perfect lattices, however it is analytically shown that the
densest lattices are not always the solution. This is a counter-intuitive
result at first sight, since previous work in the area showed a tight
connection between densest lattices and minimum distance. Since there are only
finitely many different perfect lattices, they can theoretically be enumerated
off-line. A new upper bound on the optimal minimum distance is derived, which
significantly improves upon a previously reported bound. Based on this bound,

(CAS), which describes a universal way of how patterns can appear in complex
networks even for small coupling strengths. The CAS phenomenon appears due to
the existence of an approximately constant local mean field and is
characterized by having nodes with trajectories evolving around periodic stable
orbits. Common notion based on statistical knowledge would lead one to
interpret the appearance of a local constant mean field as a consequence of the
fact that the behavior of each node is not correlated to the behaviors of the
others. Contrary to this common notion, we show that various well known weaker
forms of synchronization (almost, time-lag, phase synchronization, and
generalized synchronization) appear as a result of the onset of an almost
constant local mean field. If the memory is formed in a brain by minimising the
coupling strength among neurons and maximising the number of possible patterns,
then the CAS phenomenon is a plausible explanation for it.

However we do not exclude arbitrary choices of rule A. For example, the rule
could be determined on-line by an adversary, or could vary from vertex to
vertex.
  For even degree expander graphs, of bounded maximum degree, we have the
following result. Let G be an n vertex even degree expander graph, for which
every vertex is in at least one vertex induced cycle of length L. Any
edge-process on G has cover time (n+ (n log n)/L). This result is independent
of the rule A used to select the order of the unvisited edges, which can be
chosen on-line by an adversary.
  As an example, With high probability, random r-regular graphs, (r at least 4,
even), are expanders for which L = Omega(log n). Thus, for almost all such

the vertex cover time of such graphs by a factor of log n, compared to the

hydrodynamics codes has led to a dramatic improvement in studies of feedback in
various astrophysical environments. However, because of methodological
limitations and computational expense, the spectra of radiation sources are
generally sampled at only a few evenly-spaced discrete emission frequencies.
Using one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, we investigate the
discrepancies in gas properties surrounding model stars and accreting black
holes that arise solely due to spectral discretization. We find that even in
the idealized case of a static and uniform density field, commonly used
discretization schemes induce errors in the neutral fraction and temperature by
factors of two to three on average, and by over an order of magnitude in
certain column density regimes. The consequences are most severe for radiative
feedback operating on large scales, dense clumps of gas, and media consisting
of multiple chemical species. We have developed a method for optimally
constructing discrete spectra, and show that for two test cases of interest,
carefully chosen four-bin spectra can eliminate errors associated with
frequency resolution to high precision. Applying these findings to a fully
three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of the early universe, we
find that the HII region around a primordial star is substantially altered in
both size and morphology, corroborating the one-dimensional prediction that
discrete spectral energy distributions can lead to sizable inaccuracies in the
physical properties of a medium, and as a result, the subsequent evolution and
observable signatures of objects embedded within it.

The robustness of this switch is remarkable; although the first stages of the
lysogenic and lytic cycles are identical, a lysogen rarely spontaneously flips,
and external stressors or instantaneous cell conditions are required to induce
flipping. In particular, the cell fate decision can depend on the populations
of two proteins, cI and Cro, as well as their oligomerization and subsequent
binding affinities to three DNA sites. These processes in turn govern the rates
at which RNAp transcribes the cI and Cro genes to produce more of their
respective proteins.
  In this work, a dynamical model of the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
is revisited and generalized. The low number of proteins and other sources of
noise are non-negligble and corrections to the kinetics are essential to
understanding the stability. To this end, general integral forms for
advection-diffusion equations have been developed and numerically solved for a
variety of mutants and assumptions about the state of the cells. These
solutions quantify the probabilistic and flux landscapes of the ensembles'
evolution in concentration space and are used to predict the populations of the
cell states, entropy production, passage times, and potential barriers of wild
type and mutant bacteria to illuminate some structure of the configuration
space from which Nature naturally selects.

  operators",,,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the context of analytic functions on the open unit disk, a weighted
composition operator is simply a composition operator followed by a
multiplication operator. The class of weighted composition operators has an
important place in the theory of Banach spaces of analytic functions; for
instance, it includes all isometries on $H^p$ $(p\neq 2)$. Very recently it was
shown that only weighted composition operators preserve the class of outer
functions.
  The present paper considers a particular question motivated by applications:
Which smallest possible sets of test functions can be used to identify an
unknown weighted composition operator? This stems from a practical problem in
signal processing, where one seeks to identify an unknown minimum phase
preserving operator on $L^2(\real_+)$ using test signals.
  It is shown in the present paper that functions that determine weighted
composition operators are directly linked to the classical normal family of
schlicht functions. The main result is that a pair of functions $\{f,g\}$
distinguishes between any two weighted composition operators if and only if
there exists a zero-free function $h$ and a schlicht function $\sigma$ such
that $\spn\{f,g\}=\spn\{h\sigma,h\}$. This solves completely the underlying
signal processing problem and brings to light an intriguing geometric object,
the manifold of planes of the form $\spn\{h\sigma,h\}$. As an application of
the main result, it is proven that there exist compactly supported pairs in
$L^2(\real_+)$ that can be used to identify minimum phase preserving operators.

classification of data in a variety of settings, and perhaps the canonical
application is in uncovering thematic structure in a corpus of documents. A
number of foundational works both in machine learning and in theory have
suggested a probabilistic model for documents, whereby documents arise as a
convex combination of (i.e. distribution on) a small number of topic vectors,
each topic vector being a distribution on words (i.e. a vector of
word-frequencies). Similar models have since been used in a variety of
application areas; the Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA model of Blei et al.
is especially popular.
  Theoretical studies of topic modeling focus on learning the model's
parameters assuming the data is actually generated from it. Existing approaches
for the most part rely on Singular Value Decomposition(SVD), and consequently
have one of two limitations: these works need to either assume that each
document contains only one topic, or else can only recover the span of the
topic vectors instead of the topic vectors themselves.
  This paper formally justifies Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(NMF) as a main
tool in this context, which is an analog of SVD where all vectors are
nonnegative. Using this tool we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for
learning topic models without the above two limitations. The algorithm uses a
fairly mild assumption about the underlying topic matrix called separability,
which is usually found to hold in real-life data. A compelling feature of our
algorithm is that it generalizes to models that incorporate topic-topic
correlations, such as the Correlated Topic Model and the Pachinko Allocation
Model.
  We hope that this paper will motivate further theoretical results that use
NMF as a replacement for SVD - just as NMF has come to replace SVD in many
applications.

elements, can report whether one precedes the other in constant time. This is
equivalent to succinctly representing the transitive closure graph of the
poset, and we note that the same method can also be used to succinctly
represent the transitive reduction graph. For an $n$ element poset, the data
structure occupies $n^2/4 + o(n^2)$ bits, in the worst case, which is roughly
half the space occupied by an upper triangular matrix. Furthermore, a slight
extension to this data structure yields a succinct oracle for reachability in
arbitrary directed graphs. Thus, using roughly a quarter of the space required

accounting for the presence of a wind-wind collision (WWC) cavity carved in the
optically-thick wind of the primary star. By comparing synthetic line profiles
with HST/STIS spectra obtained near apastron, we show that the WWC cavity has a
strong influence on multi-wavelength diagnostics. This influence is regulated
by the modification of the optical depth in the continuum and spectral lines.
We find that H-alpha, H-beta, and Fe II lines are the most affected by the WWC
cavity, since they form over a large volume of the primary wind. These spectral
lines depend on latitude and azimuth since, according to the orientation of the
cavity, different velocity regions of a spectral line are affected. For 2D
models with orientation corresponding to orbital inclination angle 110deg < i <
140deg and longitude of periastron 210deg < omega < 330deg, the blueshifted and
zero-velocity regions of the line profiles are the most affected. These orbital
orientations are required to simultaneously fit the UV and optical spectrum of
Eta Car, for a half-opening angle of the cavity in the range 50-70deg. We find
that the excess P-Cygni absorption seen in H-alpha, H-beta and optical Fe II
lines in spherical models becomes much weaker or absent in the 2D models, in
agreement with the observations. The observed UV spectrum of Eta Car, dominated
by Fe II absorption lines, is superbly reproduced by our 2D cavity models.
Small discrepancies still remain, as H-gamma and H-delta absorptions are
overestimated by our models. We suggest that photoionization of the wind of the
primary by the hot companion star is responsible for the weak absorption seen
in these lines. Our CMFGEN models indicate that the primary star has a
mass-loss rate of 8.5x10e-4 Msun/yr and wind terminal velocity of 420 km/s
around the 2000 apastron.

visibilities and phases and the double-peaked line profile using a
Keplerian-rotating disk model. The derived mass of the central star is
5.4+/-0.4 M_sun*(d/1150 pc), which is considerably lower than expected from the
spectral classification, suggesting that V921 Sco might be more distant (d
approx 2kpc) than commonly assumed. Using the geometric information provided by

outflowing velocity component and the non-detection of age-indicating
spectroscopic diagnostics, our study provides new evidence for the

recently been identified at the center of the dwarf starburst galaxy Henize
2-10 (He 2-10). This discovery offers the first possibility of studying a
growing BH in a nearby galaxy resembling those in the earlier universe, and
opens up a new class of host galaxies to search for the smallest supermassive
BHs. Here we present very long baseline interferometry observations of He 2-10
taken with the Long Baseline Array (LBA) at 1.4 GHz with an angular resolution
of ~0.1"" x 0.03"". A single compact radio source is detected at the precise
location of the putative low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. The physical
size of the nuclear radio emission is < 3 pc x 1 pc, an order of magnitude
smaller than previous constraints from the Very Large Array (VLA), and the
brightness temperature of T_B > 3 x 10^5 K confirms a non-thermal origin. These
LBA observations indicate that the nuclear radio emission originates from a
single object and exclude the possibility of multiple supernova remnants as the
origin of the nuclear radio emission previously detected with the VLA at lower
resolution. A weaker, more extended, off-nuclear source is also detected with
the LBA and a comparison with multi-wavelength ancillary data indicate that,
unlike the nuclear source, the off-nuclear source is co-spatial with a super
star cluster, lacks a detectable X-ray point-source counterpart, and is almost
certainly due to a supernova remnant in the host star cluster.

from structural changes because of the centrifugal force, turbulent mixing and
meridional circulation caused by rotation can dramatically affect a star's
chemical evolution. This leads to changes in the surface temperature and
luminosity as well as modifying its lifetime. Observationally rotation
decreases the surface gravity, causes enhanced mass loss and leads to surface
abundance anomalies of various chemical isotopes. The replication of these
physical effects with simple stellar evolution models is very difficult and has
resulted in the use of numerous different formulations to describe the physics.

date. We implement a new Bayesian approach, which allows reliable calculation
of number counts down to flux limits that are factors of ~1.9-4.3 times fainter
than the previously deepest number-counts investigations. In the soft band, the
most sensitive bandpass in our analysis, the ~4 Ms CDF-S reaches a maximum
source density of ~27,800 deg-2. By virtue of the exquisite X-ray and
multiwavelength data available in the CDF-S, we are able to measure the number
counts from a variety of source populations (active galactic nuclei [AGNs],
normal galaxies, and Galactic stars) and subpopulations (as a function of
redshift, AGN absorption, luminosity, and galaxy morphology), and test models
that describe their evolution. We find that AGNs still dominate the X-ray
number counts down to the faintest flux levels for all bands and reach a
limiting soft-band source density of ~14,900 deg-2, the highest reliable AGN
source density measured at any wavelength. We find that the normal-galaxy
counts rise rapidly near the flux limits, and at the limiting soft-band flux,
reach source densities of ~12,700 deg-2 and make up 46+/-5% of the total number
counts. The rapid rise of the galaxy counts toward faint fluxes, and
significant normal-galaxy contributions to the overall number counts, indicate
that normal galaxies will overtake AGNs just below the ~4 Ms soft-band flux
limit and will provide a numerically significant new X-ray source population in
future surveys that reach below the ~4 Ms sensitivity limit. We show that a
future ~10 Ms CDF-S would allow for a significant increase in X-ray detected

varying the slit width. Secondly, the knot population consists of knots that

consists of two chordless cycles. Extending results of Ellingham and of
Goldwasser and Zhang, we prove that if e is an edge of M such that every
4-cycle containing an edge of M contains e, then e is contained in a

regimes the error growth rate can be a non-monotonic function of initial error
amplitude. In particular, troughs in the large scales of FSLE spectra is shown
to be a signature of slow regimes, whereas fast regimes are shown to cause
large peaks in the spectra where error growth rates far exceed those estimated

these signatures and corroborate them with numerical simulations. We show
further that these peaks disappear in stochastic parametrizations of the fast

quantifies Granger causality in a particular sequential prediction setting. We
also develop efficient methods to estimate the topological structure from data
that obviate estimating the joint statistics. One algorithm assumes
upper-bounds on the degrees and uses the minimal dimension statistics
necessary. In the event that the upper-bounds are not valid, the resulting
graph is nonetheless an optimal approximation. Another algorithm uses
near-minimal dimension statistics when no bounds are known but the distribution
satisfies a certain criterion. Analogous to how structure learning algorithms
for undirected graphical models use mutual information estimates, these
algorithms use directed information estimates. We characterize the
sample-complexity of two plug-in directed information estimators and obtain
confidence intervals. For the setting when point estimates are unreliable, we
propose an algorithm that uses confidence intervals to identify the best

and Littlewood [10] in their study of Lambert summability, and since then it
has attracted attention of many researchers. In particular, this function has
made a surprising appearance in the recent disproof by Alzer, Berg and
Koumandos [1] of a conjecture by Clark and Ismail [2]. More precisely, Alzer
et. al. [1] have shown that the Clark and Ismail conjecture is true if and only
if $Q(x)\ge -\pi/2$ for all $x>0$. It is known that $Q(x)$ is unbounded in the
domain $x \in (0,\infty)$ from above and below, which disproves the Clark and
Ismail conjecture, and at the same time raises a natural question of whether we
can exhibit at least one point $x$ for which $Q(x) < -\pi/2$. This turns out to
be a surprisingly hard problem, which leads to an interesting and non-trivial
question of how to approximate $Q(x)$ for very large values of $x$. In this
paper we continue the work started by Gautschi in [7] and develop several
approximations to $Q(x)$ for large values of $x$. We use these approximations
to find an explicit value of $x$ for which $Q(x)<-\pi/2$.

or optical/near-IR photometric redshifts of z<1. For sources with spectroscopic
redshifts at z<0.3, we find a linear correlation between the infrared
luminosity at 3.4 micron and that at 250 micron, with +-50% scatter over ~1.5
orders of magnitude in luminosity, ~10^9 - 10^{10.5} L_sun. By contrast, the
matched sources without previously measured redshifts (r>~20.5) have 250-350
micron flux density ratios that suggest either high-redshift galaxies (z>~1.5)
or optically faint low-redshift galaxies with unusually low temperatures
(T<~20). Their small 3.4-250 micron flux ratios favor a high-redshift galaxy
population, as only the most actively star-forming galaxies at low redshift
(e.g., Arp 220) exhibit comparable flux density ratios. Furthermore, we find a
relatively large AGN fraction (~30%) in a 12 micron flux-limited subsample of
H-ATLAS sources, also consistent with there being a significant population of
high-redshift sources in the no-redshift sample.

  Clustering",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectral partitioning is a simple, nearly-linear time, algorithm to find
sparse cuts, and the Cheeger inequalities provide a worst-case guarantee for
the quality of the approximation found by the algorithm. Local graph
partitioning algorithms [ST08,ACL06,AP09] run in time that is nearly linear in
the size of the output set, and their approximation guarantee is worse than the
guarantee provided by the Cheeger inequalities by a polylogarithmic
$\log^{\Omega(1)} n$ factor. It has been a long standing open problem to design
a local graph clustering algorithm with an approximation guarantee close to the
guarantee of the Cheeger inequalities and with a running time nearly linear in
the size of the output.
  In this paper we solve this problem; we design an algorithm with the same
guarantee (up to a constant factor) as the Cheeger inequality, that runs in
time slightly super linear in the size of the output. This is the first
sublinear (in the size of the input) time algorithm with almost the same
guarantee as the Cheeger's inequality. As a byproduct of our results, we prove
a bicriteria approximation algorithm for the expansion profile of any graph.
Let $\phi(\gamma) = \min_{\mu(S) \leq \gamma}\phi(S)$. There is a polynomial
time algorithm that, for any $\gamma,\epsilon>0$, finds a set $S$ of measure
$\mu(S)\leq 2\gamma^{1+\epsilon}$, and expansion $\phi(S)\leq
\sqrt{2\phi(\gamma)/\epsilon}$. Our proof techniques also provide a simpler
proof of the structural result of Arora, Barak, Steurer [ABS10], that can be
applied to irregular graphs.
  Our main technical tool is that for any set $S$ of vertices of a graph, a
lazy $t$-step random walk started from a randomly chosen vertex of $S$, will
remain entirely inside $S$ with probability at least $(1-\phi(S)/2)^t$. This
itself provides a new lower bound to the uniform mixing time of any finite
states reversible markov chain.

within the context of Einstein's gravity, where neither is spacetime required
to be asymptotically AdS nor the boundary to be located at conformal infinity.
We show that our holography works remarkably well at least at the level of

variation but also for the non-equilibrium entropy production, where a method
of conserved current is seen to be efficient in relating the black hole

energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from
ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently
drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point
wireless link over the narrowband flat-fading channel subject to time-varying
co-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power
supplies and thus needs to replenish energy opportunistically via WEH from the
unintended interference and/or the intended signal sent by the transmitter. We
further assume a single-antenna receiver that can only decode information or
harvest energy at any time due to the practical circuit limitation. Therefore,
it is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two
modes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the
instantaneous channel and interference condition. In this paper, we derive the
optimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs
between wireless information transfer and energy harvesting. Specifically, we
determine the minimum transmission outage probability for delay-limited
information transfer and the maximum ergodic capacity for no-delay-limited
information transfer versus the maximum average energy harvested at the
receiver, which are characterized by the boundary of so-called ""outage-energy""
region and ""rate-energy"" region, respectively. Moreover, for the case when the
channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate the
joint optimization of transmit power control, information and energy transfer
scheduling, and the receiver's mode switching. Our results provide useful
guidelines for the efficient design of emerging wireless communication systems
powered by opportunistic WEH.

approximation, this paper presents a new, analytic and rigorous approach to the
calculation of QCD phenomena. In this formulation a basic distinction between
the conventional ""idealistic"" description of QCD and a more ""realistic""
description is brought into focus by a non-perturbative, gauge-invariant
evaluation of the Schwinger solution for the QCD generating functional in terms
of the exact Fradkin representations of the Green's functional and the vacuum
functional. Because quarks exist asymptotically only in bound states, their
transverse coordinates can never be measured with arbitrary precision; the
non-perturbative neglect of this statement leads to obstructions that are
easily corrected by invoking in the basic Lagrangian a probability amplitude
which describes such transverse imprecision.
  The second result of this non-perturbative analysis is the appearance of a
new and simplifying output called ""Effective Locality"", in which the
interactions between quarks by the exchange of a ""gluon bundle"" - which
""bundle"" contains an infinite number of gluons, including cubic and quartic
gluon interactions - display an exact locality property that reduces the
several functional integrals of the formulation down to a set of ordinary
integrals. It should be emphasized that ""non-perturbative"" here refers to the
effective summation of all gluons between a pair of quark lines, but does not
(yet) include a summation over all closed-quark loops which are tied by
gluon-bundle exchange to the rest of the ""Bundle Diagram"". As an example of the
power of these methods we offer as a first analytic calculation the
quark-antiquark binding potential of a pion, and the corresponding three-quark
binding potential of a nucleon, obtained in a simple way from relevant eikonal
scattering approximations.

indicates a trend of decreasing spin-down rate over our entire data set, again
of about a factor of 2 over 700 days, but also an erratic variability in the
spin-down rate within this time span. Integrated pulse profiles are often close
to 100 per cent linearly polarized, but large variations in both the profile
shape and fractional polarization are regularly observed. Furthermore, the
behaviour of the position angle of the linear polarization is very complex -
offsets in both the absolute position angle and the phase of the position angle
sweep are often seen and the occasional presence of orthogonal mode jumps
further complicates the picture. However, model fitting indicates that the
magnetic and rotation axes are close to aligned. Finally, a single pulse
analysis has been carried out at four observing frequencies, demonstrating that
the wide pulse profile is built up of narrow spikes of emission, with widths
that scale inversely with observing frequency. All three of the known radio

understood using a single approach. However, by identifying coherent structures
in their state spaces, i.e., regions of uniform and simpler behavior, we could
hope to study each of the structures separately and then form the understanding
of the system as a whole. The method we present in this paper uses trajectory
averages of scalar functions on the state space to: (a) identify invariant sets
in the state space, (b) form coherent structures by aggregating invariant sets
that are similar across multiple spatial scales. First, we construct the
ergodic quotient, the object obtained by mapping trajectories to the space of
trajectory averages of a function basis on the state space. Second, we endow
the ergodic quotient with a metric structure that successfully captures how
similar the invariant sets are in the state space. Finally, we parametrize the
ergodic quotient using intrinsic diffusion modes on it. By segmenting the
ergodic quotient based on the diffusion modes, we extract coherent features in
the state space of the dynamical system. The algorithm is validated by
analyzing the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, which was the test-bed for
alternative approaches: the Ulam's approximation of the transfer operator and
the computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. Furthermore, we explain how
the method extends the Poincar\'e map analysis for periodic flows. As a
demonstration, we apply the method to a periodically-driven three-dimensional
Hill's vortex flow, discovering unknown coherent structures in its state space.
In the end, we discuss differences between the ergodic quotient and
alternatives, propose a generalization to analysis of (quasi-)periodic
structures, and lay out future research directions.

UV (SOHO/EIT) and Radio (Learmonth, Australia) from the super-active region
NOAA 10484 on 25 October, 2003. Several bright structures visible in H{\alpha}
and UV corresponding to subflares are also observed at the base of each surge.
Type III bursts are triggered and RHESSI X-ray sources are evident with surge
activity. The major surge consists of the bunches of ejective paths forming a
fan-shape region with an angular size of (\approx 65\degree) during its maximum
phase. The ejection speed reaches upto \sim200 km/s. The SOHO/MDI magnetograms
reveal that a large dipole emerges east side of the active region on 18-20
October 2003, a few days before the surges. On October 25, 2003, the major
sunspots were surrounded by ""moat regions"" with moving magnetic features
(MMFs). Parasitic fragmented positive polarities were pushed by the ambient
dispersion motion of the MMFs and annihilated with negative polarities at the
borders of the moat region of the following spot to produce flares and surges.
A topology analysis of the global Sun using PFSS shows that the fan structures
visible in the EIT 171 A images follow magnetic field lines connecting the
present AR to a preceding AR in the South East. Radio observations of type III
bursts indicate that they are coincident with the surges, suggesting that
magnetic reconnection is the driver mechanism. The magnetic energy released by
reconnection is transformed into plasma heating and provides the kinetic energy
for the ejections. A lack of a radio signature in the high corona suggests that
the surges are confined to follow the closed field lines in the fans. We
conclude that these cool surges may have some local heating effects in the
closed loops, but probably play a minor role in global coronal heating and the
surge material does not escape to the solar wind.

  interface","13 pages",,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optical microscopy and multi-particle tracking are used to investigate the
spatially correlated motion of weakly charged silica spheres at an air-water
interface for different area fraction $n$ occupied by the particles. When the
area fraction is very small, e.g. $n=0.03$, the correlation function along the
line joining the centers of particles $D_{rr}$ decays with inter-particle
distance $R$ as $1/R^{0.86\pm0.02}$, and the function perpendicular to this
line $D_{\theta\theta}$ decays with $R$ as $1/R^{1.45\pm0.03}$, which differs
from the results of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 176001 (2006)] with low surface
viscosity (where $D_{rr}\propto 1/R$, $D_{\theta\theta}\propto 1/R^2$). We
argue that the differences arise from the Coulomb interaction between
particles. The Coulomb interaction enhances the correlated motion of particles.
Experimental results show that with the increase of $n$, the decay rate of
$D_{rr}$ and $D_{\theta\theta}$ with $R$ decreases and the cross-correlation
enhances for the Coulomb interaction increases. The Coulomb interaction between
colloidal particles should serve as an effective surface viscoelastical role in
our system. With the scaled separation $\frac R {d}(\frac {\eta_{w}d}
{\eta_{es,2p}})^{3/2}$, the correlated motions for various values of $n$ and
different particles can be scaled onto a single master curve, where $d$ is
particles' diameter, $\eta_{w}$ is the viscosity of the water, and
$\eta_{es,2p}$ is the effective surface viscosity whose measurements agree well
with that of one-particle surface viscosity $\eta_{es,1p}$. The effective
surface viscosity $\eta_{es,2p}$ as a function of the area fraction $n$ for
different silica spheres is presented.

non-thermal motions, and the data also revealed some potential sites of strong
CO depletion. In G11.36+0.80, which is the best example of a filamentary IRDC

of the filament can be understood in terms of a ""sausage""-type fluid
instability, in agreement with the results for other IRDCs. The formation of
filamentary IRDCs might be caused by converging turbulent flows, and the same
process may play a role in exciting the fluid perturbations responsible for the

generalizes the Salpeter's one by taking into account the finite size of the
nuclei, the Coulomb interactions as well as electroweak equilibrium in a
self-consistent relativistic fashion. The mass $M$, radius $R$, angular
momentum $J$, eccentricity $\epsilon$, and quadrupole moment $Q$ of RWDs are
calculated as a function of the central density $\rho_c$ and rotation angular
velocity $\Omega$. We construct the region of stability of RWDs ($J$-$M$ plane)
taking into account the mass-shedding limit, inverse $\beta$-decay instability,
and the boundary established by the turning-points of constant $J$ sequences
which separates stable from secularly unstable configurations. We found the
minimum rotation periods $\sim 0.3$, 0.5, 0.7 and 2.2 seconds and maximum

found that RWDs can indeed be axisymmetrically unstable and we give the range
of WD parameters where it occurs. We also construct constant rest-mass
evolution tracks of RWDs at fixed chemical composition and show that, by
loosing angular momentum, sub-Chandrasekhar RWDs (mass smaller than maximum
static one) can experience both spin-up and spin-down epochs depending on their

reconsidered and shown to be inherently inconsistent -- in the sense that a
linearized theory, the Monge model, is used to predict a nonlinear effect.
Furthermore, numerical simulations of one-dimensional stiff membranes are
presented which clearly demonstrate, first, that the internal 'intrinsic'

second, that the fluctuations are nevertheless driven by the frame tension.

time-dependent models for the wind parameters of the two stars. At the end of
the stellar evolution (4.5 and 7.0 million years for the 40 and 25 solar mass

star initially creates its own bubble. However, as the bubbles expand they
merge, creating a combined, aspherical bubble. The combined bubble evolves over
time, influenced by the stellar winds and supernova explosions. The evolution
of a wind-blown bubble created by two stars deviates from that of the bubbles
around single stars. In particular, once one of the stars has exploded, the
bubble is too large for the wind of the remaining star to maintain and the
outer shell starts to disintegrate. The lack of thermal pressure inside the
bubble also changes the behavior of circumstellar features close to the
remaining star. The supernovae are contained inside the bubble, which reflects
part of the energy back into the circumstellar medium.

the critical CMO mass derived by King, which scales with the halo velocity

sufficient, to drive shells to large radii in the halo. Furthermore, a CMO mass
at least 3 times the King value is required to drive the shell to the escape

geometric representation of a Coxeter group. Our main theorem asserts that if
$v$ is an element of the Tits cone of a linear Coxeter system and $\cW$ is the
corresponding Coxeter group, then $\cW v \subeq v - C_v,$ where $C_v$ is the
convex cone generated by the coroots $\check \alpha$, for which $\alpha(v) >
0$. This implies that the convex hull of $\cW v$ is completely determined by
the image of $v$ under the reflections in $\cW$. We also apply an analogous
result for convex hulls of $\cW$-orbits in the dual space, although this action
need not correspond to a linear Coxeter system. Motivated by the applications
in representation theory, we further extend these results to Weyl group orbits
of locally finite and locally affine root systems. In the locally affine case,
we also derive some applications on minimizing linear functionals on Weyl group
orbits.

mounted on satellites, planes, ground-based vehicles and monitoring stations, a
need has arisen for statistical methods suitable for the analysis of large
spatial datasets observed on large spatial domains. Statistical analyses of
such datasets provide two main challenges: First, traditional
spatial-statistical techniques are often unable to handle large numbers of
observations in a computationally feasible way. Second, for large and
heterogeneous spatial domains, it is often not appropriate to assume that a
process of interest is stationary over the entire domain.
  We address the first challenge by using a model combining a low-rank
component, which allows for flexible modeling of medium-to-long-range
dependence via a set of spatial basis functions, with a tapered remainder
component, which allows for modeling of local dependence using a compactly
supported covariance function. Addressing the second challenge, we propose two
extensions to this model that result in increased flexibility: First, the model
is parameterized based on a nonstationary Matern covariance, where the
parameters vary smoothly across space. Second, in our fully Bayesian model, all
components and parameters are considered random, including the number,
locations, and shapes of the basis functions used in the low-rank component.
  Using simulated data and a real-world dataset of high-resolution soil
measurements, we show that both extensions can result in substantial
improvements over the current state-of-the-art.

  Results: The [C II] 158 {\mu}m emission resembles the spectral signature of
ground-based atomic and molecular lines, which indicates a common origin. The
emission from GMC E can be decomposed into a cool, molecular component with
weak far-ultraviolet (FUV) fields and low, mean densities of 103 cm^-3 and a
strongly excited starburst/PDR region with higher densities of 104 cm^-3 and
FUV intensities of 250-300 Draine fields. The emission from GMC C is consistent
with gas densities of 5000 cm^-3, FUV intensities of a few Draine fields and
total gas masses of 20\times10^6 M$_\odot$.
  Conclusions: The high spectral resolution of the GREAT receiver allowed us to
decompose the [C II] emission of the GMC E into a strongly excited gas
component resembling a PDR/starburst environment and a quieter, less excited
gas component and to analyze the different components within a single beam
individually.

as crest lines on a gradient image. The watershed transform associates to a
topographic surface a partition into catchment basins, defined as attraction
zones of a drop of water falling on the relief and following a line of steepest
descent. Unfortunately, catchment basins may overlap and do not form a
partition. Moreover, current watershed algorithms, being shortsighted, do not
correctly estimate the steepness of the downwards trajectories and overestimate
the overlapping zones of catchment basins. An arbitrary division of these zones
between adjacent catchment basin results in a poor localization of the
contours. We propose an algorithm without myopia, which considers the total
length of a trajectory for estimating its steepness. We first consider
topographic surfaces defined on node weighted graphs. The graphs are pruned in
order to eliminate all downwards trajectories which are not the steepest. An
iterative algorithm with simple neighborhood operations performs the pruning
and constructs the catchment basins. The algorithm is then adapted to gray tone
images. The graph structure itself is encoded as an image thanks to the fixed
neighborhood structure of grids. A pair of adaptative erosions and dilations
prune the graph and extend the catchment basins. As a result one obtains a
precise detection of the catchment basins and a graph of the steepest
trajectories. A last iterative algorithm allows to follow selected downwards
trajectories in order to detect particular structures such as rivers or thalweg
lines of the topographic surface.

Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform, ""performs new tricks"" -- it gives a novel way
of preserving differential privacy. We show that if we take two databases, $D$
and $D'$, such that (i) $D'-D$ is a rank-1 matrix of bounded norm and (ii) all
singular values of $D$ and $D'$ are sufficiently large, then multiplying either
$D$ or $D'$ with a vector of iid normal Gaussians yields two statistically
close distributions in the sense of differential privacy. Furthermore, a small,
deterministic and \emph{public} alteration of the input is enough to assert
that all singular values of $D$ are large.
  We apply the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to the task of approximating
cut-queries: the number of edges crossing a $(S,\bar S)$-cut in a graph. We
show that the JL transform allows us to \emph{publish a sanitized graph} that
preserves edge differential privacy (where two graphs are neighbors if they
differ on a single edge) while adding only $O(|S|/\epsilon)$ random noise to
any given query (w.h.p). Comparing the additive noise of our algorithm to
existing algorithms for answering cut-queries in a differentially private
manner, we outperform all others on small cuts ($|S| = o(n)$).
  We also apply our technique to the task of estimating the variance of a given
matrix in any given direction. The JL transform allows us to \emph{publish a
sanitized covariance matrix} that preserves differential privacy w.r.t bounded
changes (each row in the matrix can change by at most a norm-1 vector) while
adding random noise of magnitude independent of the size of the matrix (w.h.p).
In contrast, existing algorithms introduce an error which depends on the matrix
dimensions.

tasks by specific users in a specific context. Usability evaluation involves
testing the system for its expected usability. Usability testing is performed
in natural environment (field) or artificial environment (laboratory). The
result of usability evaluation is affected by the environment in which it is
carried out. Previous studies have focused only on the physical environment
(lab and field) effect on the results but rarely focused on the effect of
social environment (people present during testing). Therefore, this study aims
to review how important it is to take context into account during usability
evaluation. Context is explored through the theory of behaviour settings,
according to which behaviour of individuals is strongly influenced by the
physical as well as the social environment in which they function. The result
of this review indicates that the physical and social context plays a
substantial role in usability evaluations. Further, it also suggests that the
usability evaluation model should encompass context as an important component
in the framework.

  We consider, in particular, the Gaussian diamond network (layered network
with a single layer of relay nodes) and a class of symmetric layered networks.
For these networks we show that each relay layer increases the additive gap
between the optimal analog network coding performance with and without network
simplification (using k instead of N relays in each layer, k < N) by no more
than log(N/k)^2 bits and the corresponding multiplicative gap by no more than a

network simplification in general layered amplify-and-forward relay networks.

optimal rates either within an additive gap or a multiplicative gap, our
results suggest a new rate approximation scheme that allows for the
simultaneous computation of additive and multiplicative gaps.

propagating in a random disorder potential, like a liquid flowing through a
capillary. We analyze the interplay between the kinetic energy, the
localization energy, and the interaction between particles in 1D and 2D
polariton condensates. The finite life time of polaritons is taken into account
as well. In the first part, we remind the results of [G. Malpuech et al. Phys.
Rev. Lett. 98, 206402 (2007).] where we considered the case of a static
condensate. In that case, the condensate forms either a glassy insulating phase
at low polariton density (strong localization), or a superfluid phase above the
percolation threshold. We also show the calculation of the first order spatial
coherence of the condensate versus the condensate density. In the second part,
we consider the case of a propagating non-interacting condensate which is
always localized because of Anderson localization. The localization length is
calculated in the Born approximation. The impact of the finite polariton life
time is taken into account as well. In the last section we consider the case of
a propagating interacting condensate where the three regimes of strong
localization, Anderson localization, and superfluid behavior are accessible.
The localization length is calculated versus the system parameters. The
localization length is strongly modified with respect to the non-interacting
case. It is infinite in the superfluid regime whereas it is strongly reduced if
the fluid flows with a supersonic velocity.

gravity. At first we consider the contracted BTZ black hole solution. We obtain
entropy formula for the $GCA_2$ in term of contracted scaling dimension
$\Delta$ and central charge $C_1$. This entropy formula exactly matches with
the non-relativistic limit of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of BTZ black hole.
Then we extend our study to the contracted warped $AdS_3$ black hole solution
of CNMG. We obtain the entropy of dual $GCA_2$ in terms of central charges and
finite temperatures, $T_1, T_2$. Again this expression coincides with the
non-relativistic limit of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula of warped $AdS_3$
black hole.

generated by the transverse sloshing modes of the channel. Here the influence

wave function for correlated electrons. The method, which is strictly
variational in the limit of infinite lattice-coordination, is quite general and
flexible, and it is applicable to generic non-equilibrium conditions, even far
beyond the linear response regime. As an application, we discuss the quench
dynamics of a single-band Hubbard model at half-filling, where the method
predicts a dynamical phase transition above a critical quench that resembles
the sharp crossover observed by time-dependent dynamical mean field theory. We
next show that one can actually define in some cases a multi-configurational
wave function combination of a whole set of mutually orthogonal Gutzwiller wave
functions. The Hamiltonian projected in that subspace can be exactly evaluated
and is equivalent to a model of auxiliary spins coupled to non-interacting
electrons, closely related to the slave-spin theories for correlated electron
models. The Gutzwiller approximation turns out to be nothing but the mean-field
approximation applied to that spin-fermion model, which displays, for any

non-commutative analog of Brenier's monotone transport theorem: if an $n$-tuple
of self-adjoint non-commutative random variables $Z_{1},...,Z_{n}$ satisfies a
regularity condition (its conjugate variables $\xi_{1},...,\xi_{n}$ should be
analytic in $Z_{1},...,Z_{n}$ and $\xi_{j}$ should be close to $Z_{j}$ in a
certain analytic norm), then there exist invertible non-commutative functions
$F_{j}$ of an $n$-tuple of semicircular variables $S_{1},...,S_{n}$, so that
$Z_{j}=F_{j}(S_{1},...,S_{n})$. Moreover, $F_{j}$ can be chosen to be monotone,
in the sense that $F_{j}=\mathscr{D}_{j}g$ and $g$ is a non-commutative
function with a positive definite Hessian. In particular, we can deduce that
$C^{*}(Z_{1},...,Z_{n})\cong C^{*}(S_{1},...,S_{n})$ and
$W^{*}(Z_{1},...,Z_{n})\cong L(\mathbb{F}(n))$. Thus our condition is a useful
way to recognize when an $n$-tuple of operators generate a free group factor.
We obtain as a consequence that the q-deformed free group factors
$\Gamma_{q}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ are isomorphic (for sufficiently small $q$, with
bound depending on $n$) to free group factors. We also partially prove a
conjecture of Voiculescu by showing that free Gibbs states which are small
perturbations of a semicircle law generate free group factors. Lastly, we show
that entrywise monotone transport maps for certain Gibbs measure on matrices
are well-approximated by the matricial transport maps given by free monotone
transport.

solely be derived for weights equal or greater than one. This latter limitation
highlights the inherent difficulties associated with working with

that protein homeostatic machinery plays an active role in maintaining
intracellular concentrations of proteins. Fitness also shows a significant
correlation with intracellular abundance of soluble DHFR in cells growing at
30oC. At 42oC, on the other hand, the picture was mixed, yet remarkable: a few
strains carrying mutant DHFR proteins aggregated rendering them nonviable, but,
intriguingly, the majority exhibited fitness higher than wild type. We found
