implement scattering events as multiple Landau-Zener transitions by driving the

qubit transition rate, similar to the interference patterns created when
coherent light is scattered off a disordered potential. Since the scattering
events are imposed by the driving protocol, we can control the time-reversal

research of baryon resonances in the second resonance region via pion-proton
elastic scattering and kaon-lambda production. The experiment features high
statistics and better than 1 MeV resolution in the invariant mass thus allowing
searches for narrow resonances with the coupling to the pi p channel as low as
5%. The experiment is of ""formation"" type, i.e. the resonances are produced in
s-channel and the scan over the invariant mass is done by the variation of the
incident pion momentum which is measured with the accuracy of 0.1% with a set
of 1 mm pitch proportional chambers located in the first focus of the beam
line. The reaction is identified by a magnetless spectrometer based on wire
drift chambers with a hexagonal structure. Background suppression in this case
depends on the angular resolution, so the amount of matter in the chambers and
the setup was minimized to reduce multiple scattering.

pion-proton scattering. With 3 billions of triggers already recorded the
differential cross section of the elastic pi p-scattering on a liquid hydrogen

of fast diffusion dynamics on R^n to the Barenblatt (self similar) solution.
Degeneracies in the parabolicity of this equation are cured by re-expressing
the dynamics on a manifold with a cylindrical end, called the cigar. The
nonlinear evolution becomes differentiable in Hoelder spaces on the cigar. The
linearization of the dynamics is given by the Laplace-Beltrami operator plus a
transport term (which can be suppressed by introducing appropriate weights into
the function space norm), plus a finite-depth potential well with a universal
profile. In the limiting case of the (linear) heat equation, the depth
diverges, the number of eigenstates increases without bound, and the continuous
spectrum recedes to infinity. We provide a detailed study of the linear and
nonlinear problems in Hoelder spaces on the cigar, including a sharp
boundedness estimate for the semi-group, and use this as a tool to obtain sharp
convergence results toward the Barenblatt solution, and higher order
asymptotics. In finer convergence results (after modding out symmetries of the
problem), a subtle interplay between convergence rates and tail behavior is
revealed. The difficulties involved in choosing the right functional spaces in
which to carry out the analysis can be interpreted as genuine features of the
equation rather than mere annoying technicalities.

However, most of the authors seem to be more interested in claiming positive

worrisome that many recent papers seem to only acknowledge those studies

theorem has an explicit tractability criterion expressible in terms of

transformable to a product type, or (4) F is vanishing, combined with the right

the components of the Deodhar decomposition of the Grassmannian by certain

characterize the contour plots of solitons solutions when t<<0. Finally we use
these results to show that a soliton solution u_A(x,y,t) is regular for all

semi-inner product formulated in terms of a vector distributional operator
$\mathbf{P}$ consisting of finitely or countably many distributional operators
$P_n$, which are defined on the dual space of the Schwartz space. The types of
operators we consider include not only differential operators, but also more
general distributional operators such as pseudo-differential operators. We
deduce that a certain appropriate full-space Green function $G$ with respect to
$L:=\mathbf{P}^{\ast T}\mathbf{P}$ now becomes a conditionally positive
definite function. In order to support this claim we ensure that the
distributional adjoint operator $\mathbf{P}^{\ast}$ of $\mathbf{P}$ is
well-defined in the distributional sense. Under sufficient conditions, the
native space (reproducing-kernel Hilbert space) associated with the Green
function $G$ can be isometrically embedded into or even be isometrically
equivalent to a generalized Sobolev space. As an application, we take linear
combinations of translates of the Green function with possibly added polynomial
terms and construct a multivariate minimum-norm interpolant $s_{f,X}$ to data
values sampled from an unknown generalized Sobolev function $f$ at data sites
located in some set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We provide several examples, such
as Mat\'ern kernels or Gaussian kernels, that illustrate how many
reproducing-kernel Hilbert spaces of well-known reproducing kernels are
isometrically equivalent to a generalized Sobolev space. These examples further
illustrate how we can rescale the Sobolev spaces by the vector distributional
operator $\mathbf{P}$. Introducing the notion of scale as part of the
definition of a generalized Sobolev space may help us to choose the ""best""
kernel function for kernel-based approximation methods.

solutions with a denser fluid lying above the free interface with the second
fluid, then we turn to an analysis of the equations obtained from linearization
around such a steady state. In the presence of uniform rotation, there is no
natural variational framework for constructing growing mode solutions to the
linearized problem. Using the general method of studying a family of modified
variational problems introduced in \cite{Y-I2}, we construct normal mode
solutions that grow exponentially in time with rate like
$e^{t\sqrt{c|\xi|-1}}$, where $\xi$ is the spatial frequency of the normal mode
and the constant $c$ depends on some physical parameters of the two layer
fluids. A Fourier synthesis of these normal mode solutions allows us to
construct solutions that grow arbitrarily quickly in the Sobolev space $H^k$,
and lead to an ill-posedness result for the linearized problem. Moreover, from
the analysis we see that rotation diminishes the growth of instability. Using
the pathological solutions, we then demonstrate the ill-posedness for the

  The sparsity in G naturally induces the sparsity of the so-called graph of

sparsity and the graph sparsity, which ensures that in a broad context, the set
of true signals decompose into many different small-size components of GOSD,
where different components are disconnected.
  We propose Graphlet Screening (GS) as a new approach to variable selection,

of GS is to use GOSD to guide both the screening and cleaning. Compared to
m-variate brute-forth screening that has a computational cost of p^m, the GS
only has a computational cost of p (up to some multi-log(p) factors) in
screening.
  We measure the performance of any variable selection procedure by the minimax
Hamming distance. We show that in a very broad class of situations, GS achieves
the optimal rate of convergence in terms of the Hamming distance. Somewhat
surprisingly, the well-known procedures subset selection and the lasso are rate
non-optimal, even in very simple settings and even when their tuning parameters

controls research communities for a long time, and many algorithms have been
developed for their solution. Among them, incremental sampling-based motion
planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), and the
Probabilistic Road Maps (PRMs) have become very popular recently, owing to
their implementation simplicity and their advantages in handling
high-dimensional problems. Although these algorithms work very well in
practice, the quality of the computed solution is often not good, i.e., the
solution can be far from the optimal one. A recent variation of RRT, namely the
RRT* algorithm, bypasses this drawback of the traditional RRT algorithm, by
ensuring asymptotic optimality as the number of samples tends to infinity.
Nonetheless, the convergence rate to the optimal solution may still be slow.
This paper presents a new incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithm
based on Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs (RRG), denoted RRT# (RRT ""sharp"")
which also guarantees asymptotic optimality but, in addition, it also ensures
that the constructed spanning tree of the geometric graph is consistent after
each iteration. In consistent trees, the vertices which have the potential to
be part of the optimal solution have the minimum cost-come-value. This implies
that the best possible solution is readily computed if there are some vertices
in the current graph that are already in the goal region. Numerical results
compare with the RRT* algorithm.

manipulating the natural outcome of the decision process. For that purpose,
game theory is a natural framework. In that context, voting systems represent
an interesting alternative that, to our knowledge, has not yet been considered.
They allow competing entities to decide among different options. Strong
theoretical results showed that all voting systems are susceptible to be
manipulated by one single voter, except for some ""degenerated"" and
non-acceptable cases. However, very little is known about how much a voting
system is manipulable in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate

efficiency. We show that one particular system, called \Single Transferable

paths close to the economical optimum, whether the participants try to cheat or

our GeoSnakes active contour, causing a Pseudo Stationary Phenomenon (PSP). To
address the PSP problem, we propose an auxiliary curve evolution equation,
named the equilibrium flow (EF) equation. Based on the EF and the conventional
curve evolution, we obtain a solution to the full EL equation of GeoSnakes
active contour. Experimental results validate the proposed geometrical
interpretation of the early termination problem, and they also show that the
proposed method overcomes the problem.

idea is to replace its permutation matrix by adding to it a rank 1 matrix. The
motivation for this change is twofold: it would allow the use of codes that
were shown to be insecure in the original McEliece's cryptosystem, and it would
reduce the key size while keeping the same security against generic decoding
attacks. The authors suggest to use generalized Reed-Solomon codes instead of
Goppa codes. The public code built with this method is not anymore a
generalized Reed-Solomon code. On the other hand, it contains a very large
secret generalized Reed-Solomon code. In this paper we present an attack that
is built upon a distinguisher which is able to identify elements of this secret
code. The distinguisher is constructed by considering the code generated by
component-wise products of codewords of the public code (the so-called ""square
code""). By using square-code dimension considerations, the initial generalized
Reed-Solomon code can be recovered which permits to decode any ciphertext. A
similar technique has already been successful for mounting an attack against a
homomorphic encryption scheme suggested by Bogdanoc et \textit{al.}. This work
can be viewed as another illustration of how a distinguisher of Reed-Solomon
codes can be used to devise an attack on cryptosystems based on them.

diagrams of ferroelastic-quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 films was studied using
Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory. The phase diagrams in coordinates
temperature - film thickness were calculated for different epitaxial misfit
strains. Tensile misfit strains stimulate appearance of the spontaneous
out-of-plane structural order parameter (displacement vector of an appropriate
oxygen atom from its cubic position) in the structural phase. Compressive
misfit strains stimulate appearance of the spontaneous in-plane structural
order parameter. Gradients of the structural order parameter components, which
inevitably exist in the vicinity of film surfaces due to the termination and
symmetry breaking, induce improper polarization and pyroelectric response via
the flexoelectric and rotostriction coupling mechanism. Flexoelectric and
rotostriction coupling results in the roto-flexoelectric field that is
antisymmetric inside the film, small in the central part of the film, where the
gradients of the structural parameter are small, and maximal near the surfaces,
where the gradients of the structural parameter are highest. The field induces
improper polarization and pyroelectric response. Penetration depths of the
improper phases (both polar and structural) can reach several nm from the film
surfaces. An improper pyroelectric response of thin films is high enough to be
registered with planar-type electrode configurations by conventional
pyroelectric methods.

However, the kinematical study also reveals that in each case the end velocity
of the primary wave matches the initial velocity of the reflected wave. In all
three events the primary and reflected waves obey the Huygens-Fresnel
principle, as the incident angle with ~10{\deg} to the normal is of the same
size as the angle of reflection. The correlation between the speed and the
strength of the primary EUV waves, the homologous appearance of both the

quark chemical potential on an onset of the quark number density at
$\mu=m_\pi/2$. We introduce a physical parametrization of the eigenvalues in
the reduction formula of the fermion determinant. It is shown that the
parametrization reduces the quark number density operator to an expression with
the Fermi distribution of the quark. For each configuration, the eigenvalues of
the reduced matrix correspond to one-particle energy states of a quark. The gap
of the eigenspectrum of the reduced matrix corresponds to the gap of the energy
states, which causes the $\mu$-independence of the fermion determinant for
small $\mu$ at T=0. Once $\mu$ exceeds the gap, the quark number density
becomes nonzero for each configuration, which causes the early onset of the
quark number density.

ignore the resource costs incurred when determining optimal actions. Here we
propose an information-theoretic formalization of bounded rational
decision-making where decision-makers trade off expected utility and
information processing costs. Such bounded rational decision-makers can be
thought of as thermodynamic machines that undergo physical state changes when
they compute. Their behavior is governed by a free energy functional that
trades off changes in internal energy-as a proxy for utility-and entropic
changes representing computational costs induced by changing states. As a
result, the bounded rational decision-making problem can be rephrased in terms
of well-known concepts from statistical physics. In the limit when
computational costs are ignored, the maximum expected utility principle is
recovered. We discuss the relation to satisficing decision-making procedures as
well as links to existing theoretical frameworks and human decision-making
experiments that describe deviations from expected utility theory. Since most
of the mathematical machinery can be borrowed from statistical physics, the
main contribution is to axiomatically derive and interpret the thermodynamic
free energy as a model of bounded rational decision-making.

point-to-point OFDM systems under imperfect channel state information quality
and non-ideal circuit power. We consider the dynamic back- pressure (DBP)
algorithm, where the transmitter determines the rate and power control actions
based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSIT) and the queue state
information (QSI). We exploit a general fluid queue dynamics using a continuous
time dynamic equation. Using the sample-path approach and renewal theory, we
decompose the average delay in terms of multiple unfinished works along a
sample path, and derive an upper bound on the average delay under the DBP power
control, which is asymptotically accurate at small delay regime. We show that
despite imperfect CSIT quality and non-ideal circuit power, the average power
(P) of the DBP policy scales with delay (D) as P = O(Dexp(1/D)) at small delay
regime. While the impacts of CSIT quality and circuit power appears as the
coefficients of the scaling law, they may be significant in some operating
regimes.

the distinguished economist Duncan Foley from the New School for Social
Research in New York. This Chapter reviews applications of statistical physics
methods, such as the principle of entropy maximization, to the probability
distributions of money, income, and global energy consumption per capita. The
exponential probability distribution of wages, predicted by the statistical
equilibrium theory of a labor market developed by Foley in 1996, is supported
by empirical data on income distribution in the USA for the majority (about
97%) of population. In addition, the upper tail of income distribution (about
3% of population) follows a power law and expands dramatically during financial
bubbles, which results in a significant increase of the overall income
inequality. A mathematical analysis of the empirical data clearly demonstrates
the two-class structure of a society, as pointed out Karl Marx and recently
highlighted by the Occupy Movement. Empirical data for the energy consumption
per capita around the world are close to an exponential distribution, which can
be also explained by the entropy maximization principle.

problem on n Boolean variables and m constraints (CSPs such as k-SAT, k-AND,
k-LIN) is a bipartite graph describing which variables appear in which
constraints. The factor graph describes the instance up to the polarity of the
variables, and hence there are up to 2km instances of the CSP that share the
same factor graph. It is well known that factor graphs with certain structural
properties make the underlying CSP easier to either solve exactly (e.g., for
tree structures) or approximately (e.g., for planar structures). We are
interested in the following question: is there a factor graph for which if one
can solve every instance of the CSP with this particular factor graph, then one
can solve every instance of the CSP regardless of the factor graph (and
similarly, for approximation)? We call such a factor graph universal. As one
needs different factor graphs for different values of n and m, this gives rise
to the notion of a family of universal factor graphs. We initiate a systematic
study of universal factor graphs, and present some results for max-kSAT. Our
work has connections with the notion of preprocessing as previously studied for
closest codeword and closest lattice-vector problems, with proofs for the PCP
theorem, and with tests for the long code. Many questions remain open.

The author derives a solution of DT-NT-DT form for an arbitrary model in which
the the traded asset has diffusive dynamics described by one or more stochastic
risk factors. The width of the NT zone is found to be, as expected,
proportional to the cube root of the transaction cost. It is also proportional
to the 2/3 power of the volatility of the target position, thereby causing a
faster trading strategy to be buffered more than a slower one. The displacement
of the middle of the buffer from the costfree position is found to be
proportional to the square of the width, and hence to the 2/3 power of the
transaction cost; the proportionality constant depends on the expected
short-term change in position.

is vacuum energy dominated but contains a subdominant linear term which changes
the slope abruptly at a point. We show that on large scales compared with the
transition scale $k_0$ and in the equilateral limit the analogue of the
non-linearity parameter scales as $(k/k_0)^2$, that is its amplitude decays for
larger and larger scales until it becomes subdominant with respect to the usual
slow-roll suppressed corrections. On small scales we show that the
non-linearity parameter oscillates with angular frequency given by $3/k_0$ and
its amplitude grows linearly towards smaller scales and can be large depending
on the model parameters. We also compare our results with previous results in
the literature.
