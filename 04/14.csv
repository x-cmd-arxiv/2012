its environment. We explore numerically the existence of thermalisation over a

the strength of the coupling between the subsystem and the rest of the lattice.
We find thermalisation over a wide range of parameters and that interactions
are crucial for efficient thermalisation of small systems. We relate this
thermalisation behaviour to the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis and
quantify numerically the extent to which eigenstate thermalisation holds. We
also verify our numerical results theoretically with the help of previously
established results from random matrix theory for the local density of states,
particularly the finite-size scaling for the onset of thermalisation.

in relation to both its origin and its very small value. By using a
Bose-Einstein condensate analogue model for gravitational dynamics, we address
here the cosmological constant issue from an analogue gravity standpoint.
Starting from the fundamental equations describing a system of condensed
bosons, we highlight the presence of a vacuum source term for the analogue
gravitational field, playing the role of a cosmological constant. In this
simple system it is possible to compute from scratch the value of this
constant, to compare it with other characteristic energy scales and hence
address the problem of its magnitude within this framework, suggesting a
different path for the solution of this longstanding puzzle. We find that, even
though this constant term is related with quantum vacuum effects, it is not
immediately related to the ground state energy of the condensate. On the
gravity side this result suggests that the interpretation and computation of
the cosmological term as a form of renormalized vacuum energy might be
misleading, its origin being related to the mechanism that instead produces
spacetime from its pregeometric progenitor, shedding a different light on the
subject and at the same time suggesting a potentially relevant role of analogue
models in the understanding of quantum gravity.

of d-dimensional matrices, whose entries consist of valid distributions. The

Here we demonstrate that the steeply pulsed emission profile in the tail of the

This mechanism will also broaden the feature in the power spectrum and
introduce power at harmonics of the oscillation. The observed strength of the
oscillation depends on the amplitude of the underlying starquake, the
orientation and location of the emission on the surface of the star, and the
gradient of the light curve profile. While the amplification of the signal can
be significant, we demonstrate that even with uncertainties in the emission
geometry, this effect is not sufficient to produce the observed QPOs. This
result excludes the direct observation of a starquake, and suggests that the
observed variations come from modulations in the intensity of the emission.

intriguing manifestations of quantum physics. At the same time single photons
and pairs of single photons are important building blocks in the fields of
linear optical based quantum computation and quantum repeater infrastructure.
These fields possess enormous potential and much scientific and technological
progress has been made in developing individual components, like quantum
memories and photon sources using various physical implementations. However,
further progress suffers from the lack of compatibility between these different
components. Ultimately, one aims for a versatile source of single photons and
photon pairs in order to overcome this hurdle of incompatibility. Such a photon
source should allow for tuning of the spectral properties (wide wavelength
range and narrow bandwidth) to address different implementations while
retaining high efficiency. In addition, it should be able to bridge different
wavelength regimes to make implementations compatible. Here we introduce and
experimentally demonstrate such a versatile single photon and photon pair
source based on the physics of whispering gallery resonators. A disk-shaped,
monolithic and intrinsically stable resonator is made of lithium niobate and
supports a cavity-assisted triply-resonant spontaneous parametric
down-conversion process. Measurements show that photon pairs are efficiently
generated in two highly tunable resonator modes. We verify wavelength tuning
over 100 nm between both modes with a controllable bandwidth between 7.2 and 13
MHz. Heralding of single photons yields anti-bunching with $g^{(2)}(0) < 0.2$.
This compact source provides unprecedented possibilities to couple to different

end-to-end communication routes at any instant. Still, connectivity can
generally be established over time and space. The optimality of a temporal path
(journey) in this context can be defined in several terms, including
topological (e.g. {\em shortest} in hops) and temporal (e.g. {\em fastest,
foremost}). The combinatorial problem of computing shortest, foremost, and
fastest journeys {\em given full knowledge} of the network schedule was
addressed a decade ago (Bui-Xuan {\it et al.}, 2003). A recent line of research
has focused on the distributed version of this problem, where foremost,
shortest or fastest {\em broadcast} are performed without knowing the schedule
beforehand. In this paper we show how to build {\em fastest} broadcast trees
(i.e., trees that minimize the global duration of the broadcast, however late
the departure is) in Time-Varying Graphs where intermittent edges are available
periodically (it is known that the problem is infeasible in the general case
even if various parameters of the graph are know). We address the general case
where contacts between nodes can have arbitrary durations and thus fastest
routes may consist of a mixture of {\em continuous} and {\em discontinuous}
segments (a more complex scenario than when contacts are {\em punctual} and
thus routes are only discontinuous). Using the abstraction of \tclocks to
compute the temporal distances, we solve the fastest broadcast problem by first
learning, at the emitter, what is its time of {\em minimum temporal
eccentricity} (i.e. the fastest time to reach all the other nodes), and second
by building a {\em foremost} broadcast tree relative to this particular
emission date.

paper, we consider time-critical influence maximization, in which one wants to
maximize influence spread within a given deadline. Since timing is considered
in the optimization, we also extend the Independent Cascade (IC) model and the
Linear Threshold (LT) model to incorporate the time delay aspect of influence
diffusion among individuals in social networks. We show that time-critical
influence maximization under the time-delayed IC and LT models maintains
desired properties such as submodularity, which allows a greedy approximation
algorithm to achieve an approximation ratio of $1-1/e$. To overcome the
inefficiency of the greedy algorithm, we design two heuristic algorithms: the
first one is based on a dynamic programming procedure that computes exact
influence in tree structures and directed acyclic subgraphs, while the second
one converts the problem to one in the original models and then applies
existing fast heuristic algorithms to it. Our simulation results demonstrate
that our algorithms achieve the same level of influence spread as the greedy

heterogeneities in the distribution of species. In the extreme case of a
localized patch of increased growth rates, reproducing populations can become
strongly concentrated at the patch despite the entropic tendency for population
to distribute evenly. Several deterministic mathematical models have been used
to characterize the conditions under which localized states can form, and how
they break down due to convective driving forces. Here, we study the
delocalization of a finite population in the presence of number fluctuations.
We find that any finite population delocalizes on sufficiently long time
scales. Depending on parameters, however, populations may remain localized for
a very long time. The typical waiting time to delocalization increases
exponentially with both population size and distance to the critical wind speed
of the deterministic approximation. We augment these simulation results by a
mathematical analysis that treats the reproduction and migration of individuals
as branching random walks subject to global constraints. For a particular
constraint, different from a fixed population size constraint, this model
yields a solvable first moment equation. We find that this solvable model
approximates very well the fixed population size model for large populations,
but starts to deviate as population sizes are small. The analytical approach
allows us to map out a phase diagram of the order parameter as a function of
the two driving parameters, inverse population size and wind speed. Our results
may be used to extend the analysis of delocalization transitions to different
settings, such as the viral quasi-species scenario.

Hubble Space Telescope (HST), revealing hundreds of cometary-like structures.
One or both ends of the structures often show a brightness enhancement relative
to the structures' middle sections, but there is no simple regularity to their
morphologies (in contrast with the Helix nebula). Some of the structures'
morphologies suggest the presence of slow-moving or stationary material with
which the ejecta is colliding, while others suggest shaping from a wind
emanating from GK Per itself. A detailed expansion map of the nova's ejecta was
created by comparing HST images taken in successive years. WFPC2 narrowband
images and STIS spectra demonstrate that the physical conditions in the ejecta
vary strongly on spatial scales much smaller than those of the ejecta. Directly
measuring accurate densities and compositions, and hence masses of this and
other nova shells, will demand data at least as resolved spatially as those
presented here. The filling factor the ejecta is < 1%, and the nova ejecta mass
must be less than $10^{-4} \Msun$. A few of the nebulosities vary in brightness
by up to a factor of two on timescales of one year. Finally, we present the
deepest images yet obtained of a jet-like feature outside the main body of GK
Per nebulosity, and the first spectrum of that feature. Dominated by strong,
narrow emission lines of [NII], [OII], [OIII], and [SII], this feature is
probably a shock due to ejected material running into stationary ISM, slowly
moving ejecta from a previous nova episode, or circum-binary matter present
before 1901. An upper limit to the mass of the jet is of order a few times
$10^{-6} \Msun$. The jet might be an important, or even dominant mass sink from
the binary system. The jet's faintness suggests that similar features could
easily have been missed in other cataclysmic binaries.

followed in time by the evolution function y(t). In this Lagrangian
description, the fluid velocity v = dr/dt = {\eta}dy/dt is not a fluid
variable, contrary to the commonly used Eulerian fluid description. As a
result, the parameter space is one dimensional in {\eta}, in contrast to the
(x, v) two-parameter space of Eulerian formulation. In terms of Lagrangian
coordinate, the evolution function y(t), which is not limited to a linear time
scaling, agrees with the well established parametric form of Mestel (Mestel
1965) for cold cloud collapse. The spatial structure is described by an
equation which corresponds to the one derived by Goldreich and Weber (Goldreich
& Weber 1980). The continuous self-similar density distribution presents a
peaked central core followed by oscillations with decreasing amplitude,
somewhat reminiscent to the expansion-wave inside-out collapse of Shu (Shu
1977). This continuous solution could account for the planetary system of a
protostar. There is also a disconnected density distribution, which could be
relevant to cavity formation between the highly peaked central core and the
external infalling envelope of a magnetar-in-a-cavity pre-supernova

surface brightness profiles as Type III in late-type galaxies. In order to
estimate the contribution of the stellar halo light to the total galaxy light,
we carried out a Bulge/Disk/Stellar Halo decomposition by simoultaneously
fitting all components. The light contribution of the halo to the total galaxy
light varies from ~ 1% to ~ 5%, but in case of ongoing mergers, the halo light

confronting these colors with model predictions, we encounter problems to fit
our very red colors onto stellar population grids with conventional IMFs. Very

conductance peak associated with the zero-energy Majorana mode in the
topological superconducting phase as a function of temperature, tunnel barrier
potential, and a magnetic field tilted from the direction of the wire for
realistic wires of finite lengths. We find that higher temperatures and tunnel
barriers as well as a large magnetic field in the direction transverse to the
wire length could very strongly suppress the zero-bias conductance peak as
observed in Ref.[1]. We also show that a strong magnetic field along the wire
could eventually lead to the splitting of the zero bias peak into a doublet
with the doublet energy splitting oscillating as a function of increasing
magnetic field. Our results based on the standard theory of topological
superconductivity in a semiconductor hybrid structure in the presence of
proximity-induced superconductivity, spin-orbit coupling, and Zeeman splitting
show that the recently reported experimental data are generally consistent with
the existing theory that led to the predictions for the existence of the
Majorana modes in the semiconductor hybrid structures in spite of some apparent
anomalies in the experimental observations at first sight. We also make several
concrete new predictions for future observations regarding Majorana splitting

and explore the differences in the effects of neutrino heating and the standing
accretion shock instability (SASI). We find that early on the amplitude of the
dipolar mode of the shock is factors of 2 to 3 smaller in 3D than in 2D.
However, later in both 3D and 2D the monopole and dipole modes start to grow
until explosion. Whereas in 2D the (l,m) = (1,0) mode changes sign
quasi-periodically, producing the ""up-and-down"" motion always seen in modern 2D
simulations, in 3D this almost never happens. Rather, in 3D when the dipolar
mode starts to grow, it grows in magnitude and wanders stochastically in
direction until settling before explosion to a particular patch of solid angle.
In 2D we find that the amplitude of the dipolar shock deformation separates
into two classes. For the first, identified with the SASI and for a wide range
of ""low"" neutrino luminosities, this amplitude remains small and roughly
constant. For the other, identified with higher luminosities and
neutrino-driven convection, the dipolar amplitude grows sharply. Importantly,
it is only for this higher luminosity class that we see neutrino-driven
explosions within ~1 second of bounce. Moreover, for the ""low"" luminosity runs,
the power spectra of these dipolar oscillations peak in the 30-50 Hz range
associated with advection timescales, while for the high-luminosity runs the
power spectra at lower frequencies are significantly more prominent. We
associate this enhanced power at lower frequencies with slower convective
effects and the secular growth of the dipolar shock amplitude. On the basis of
our study, we hypothesize that neutrino-driven buoyant convection should almost
always dominate the SASI when the supernova explosion is neutrino-driven.

m^4/hbar^3, where m is the DM particle mass, sigma(r) is the DM velocity
dispersion and K is a pure number of order one which we estimate. N-body galaxy
simulations produce a divergent Q(r) at r = 0 violating this quantum bound.
Combining this bound with the behaviour of Q(r) from simulations, the virial
and galaxy data on Q implies lower bounds on the halo radius and a minimal
distance r_{min} at which classical dynamics for DM fermions breaks down. This
quantum bound rules out the presence of galaxy cusps for fermionic WDM, in
agreement with astronomical observations, which show that the DM halos are
cored. We show that compact dwarf galaxies are quantum objects supported
against gravity by the fermionic WDM quantum pressure. Quantum mechanical
calculations become necessary to compute galaxy structures at kpc scales and
below. Classical N-body simulations are not valid at scales below r_{min}. We
apply the Thomas-Fermi semiclassical approach to fermionic WDM galaxies and
find the physical magnitudes: mass, halo radius, phase-space density, velocity
dispersion, consistent with observations especially for compact dwarf galaxies.
Namely, fermionic WDM treated quantum mechanically, as it must be, reproduces
the sizes of the observed cores. The lightest known galaxy Willman I implies a
lower bound for the WDM particle mass m > 0.96 keV. These results and the
observed galaxies with halo radius > 30 pc and halo mass > 4 10^5 M_sun provide
further indication that the WDM particle mass m is in the range 1-2 keV.

243(252)h^(-1) Mpc, with an error on the mean value of +/- 43h^(-1) Mpc. We
also re-evaluate the estimates of lambda_mfp from Prochaska et al. (2009) and
place constraints on the evolution of lambda_mfp with redshift, including an
estimate of the ""breakthrough"" redshift of z = 1.6. Consistent with results at
higher z, we find that a significant fraction of the opacity for absorption of
ionizing photons comes from systems with N_HI <= 10^{17.5} cm^(-2) with a value
for the total Lyman opacity of tau_lyman = 0.40 +/- 0.15. Finally, we determine
that at minimum, a 5-parameter (4 power-law) model is needed to describe the
column density distribution function f(N_HI, X) at z \sim 2.4, find that
f(N_HI,X) undergoes no significant change in shape between z \sim 2.4 and z
\sim 3.7, and provide our best fit model for f(N_HI,X).

this paper, we present a Chandra and XMM study of one such candidate, NGC1521,

morphologically relaxed hot gas halo, extending almost to R500, that is well
described by hydrostatic models similar to the benchmark, baryonically closed,
Milky Way-mass elliptical galaxy NGC720. We obtain good constraints on the
enclosed gravitating mass (M500=3.8e12+/-1e12 Msun, slightly higher than
NGC\thin 720), and baryon fraction (fb500=0.13+/-0.03). We confirm at 8.2-sigma
the presence of a dark matter (DM) halo consistent with LCDM. Assuming a
Navarro-Frenk-White DM profile, our self-consistent, physical model enables
meaningful constraints beyond R500, revealing that most of the baryons are in
the hot gas. Within the virial radius, fb is consistent with the Cosmic mean,
suggesting that the predicted massive, quasi-hydrostatic gas halos may be more
common than previously thought. We confirm that the DM and stars conspire to
produce an approximately powerlaw total mass profile (rho \propto r^-alpha)
that follows the recently discovered scaling relation between alpha and optical
effective radius. Our conclusions are insensitive to modest, observationally
motivated, deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium. Finally, after correcting
for the enclosed gas fraction, the entropy profile is close to the self-similar
prediction of gravitational structure formation simulations, as observed in
massive galaxy clusters.

detect the continuum between 3700-22000A and several strong absorption features
(Balmer series, Ca H+K, G-band), from which we derive a stellar velocity
dispersion of 318 +/- 53 km/s. We perform detailed modeling of the continuum
emission and line indices and derive strong simultaneous constraints on the
age, metallicity, and stellar mass. The galaxy is a dusty (A_V=0.77
(+0.36,-0.32)) solar metallicity (log(Z/Zsun) = 0.02 (+0.20,-0.41)) post
starburst galaxy, with a mean luminosity weighted log(age/yr) of 8.9 +/- 0.1.
The galaxy formed the majority of its stars at z>3 and currently has little or
no ongoing star formation. We compile a sample of three other z~2 quiescent
galaxies with measured velocity dispersions, two of which are also post
starburst like. Their dynamical mass-size relation is offset significantly less
than the stellar mass-size relation from the local early type relations, which
we attribute to a lower central dark matter fraction. Recent cosmological
merger simulations qualitatively agree with the data, but can not fully account
for the evolution in the dark matter fraction. The z~2 FP requires additional
evolution beyond passive stellar aging, to be in agreement with the local FP.
The structural evolution predicted by the cosmological simulations is
insufficient, suggesting that additional, possibly non-homologous structural
evolution is needed.

which $k$ users wish to share a unique message with all other users. Each of
the $n$ users only has knowledge of its own contents and state information;
this corresponds to a one-sided push-only scenario. The goal is to disseminate
all messages efficiently, hopefully achieving an order-optimal spreading rate
over unicast wireless random networks. First, we show that a random-push
strategy -- where a user sends its own or a received packet at random -- is
order-wise suboptimal in a random geometric graph: specifically,
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ times slower than optimal spreading. It is known that this
gap can be closed if each user has ""full"" mobility, since this effectively
creates a complete graph. We instead consider velocity-constrained mobility
where at each time slot the user moves locally using a discrete random walk
with velocity $v(n)$ that is much lower than full mobility. We propose a simple
two-stage dissemination strategy that alternates between individual message
flooding (""self promotion"") and random gossiping. We prove that this scheme
achieves a close to optimal spreading rate (within only a logarithmic gap) as
long as the velocity is at least $v(n)=\omega(\sqrt{\log n/k})$. The key
insight is that the mixing property introduced by the partial mobility helps
users to spread in space within a relatively short period compared to the
optimal spreading time, which macroscopically mimics message dissemination over
a complete graph.

causing still births and reduction in gestational age. An estimated 24 million

the pregnant baboons were infected with Plasmodium knowlesi H strain parasites

two days post inoculation until the 159th day of gestation when caesarean
section was done on one baboon in order to obtain the placenta. Two baboons
aborted their conceptus. Smears prepared from placental blood demonstrated the
presence of Plasmodium knowlesi parasites in all the three sampled placentas.
These new findings show that P. knowlesi sequesters in the baboon placenta. In

P. knowlesi model for studying human placental/pregnancy malaria now offers an
opportunity for circumventing the obstacles experienced during human studies
like having inadequate tissue for analysis, inaccurate estimation of

Omega(KS) with boundary KS is, a priori, not well defined. That is, one cannot
a priori determine the minimal path traversed by a billiard ball subject to a
collision in the boundary of the table. It is this problem which makes
Omega(KS) such an interesting, yet difficult, table to analyze. In this paper,
we approach this problem by approximating (from the inside) Omega(KS) by
well-defined (prefractal) rational polygonal billiard tables Omega(KS_n). We
first show that the flat surface S(KS_n) determined from the rational billiard
Omega(KS_n) is a branched cover of the singly punctured hexagonal torus. Such a
result, when combined with the results of [Gut2], allows us to define a
sequence of compatible orbits of prefractal billiards. We define a hybrid orbit
of a prefractal billiard Omega(KS_n) and show that every dense orbit of a
prefractal billiard is a dense hybrid orbit of Omega(KS_n). This result is key
in obtaining a topological dichotomy for a sequence of compatible orbits.
Furthermore, we determine a sufficient condition for a sequence of compatible
orbits to be a sequence of compatible periodic hybrid orbits. We then examine
the limiting behavior of a sequence of compatible periodic hybrid orbits. We
show that the trivial limit of particular (eventually) constant sequences of
compatible hybrid orbits constitutes an orbit of Omega(KS). In addition, we
show that the union of two suitably chosen nontrivial polygonal paths connects
two elusive limit points of the Koch snowflake. Finally, we discuss how it may
be possible for our results to be generalized to other fractal billiard tables
and how understanding the structures of the Veech groups of the prefractal
billiards may help in determining `fractal flat surfaces' naturally associated

devices. Fano shot noise, a standard metric to assess the mechanism for
electronic transport in mesoscopic devices, has been shown to produce almost
the same magnitude ($\approx 1/3$) in ballistic and diffusive graphene devices
and is therefore of limited applicability. We consider a two-terminal geometry
where the graphene flake is contacted by narrow metallic leads. We propose that
the dependence of the conductance on the position of one of the leads, a
conductance profile, can give us insight into the charge flow, which can in
turn be used to analyze the transport mechanism. Moreover, we simulate scanning
probe microscopy (SPM) measurements for the same devices, which can visualize
the flow of charge inside the device, thus complementing the transport
calculations. From our simulations, we find that both the conductance profile
and SPM measurements are excellent tools to assess the transport mechanism
differentiating ballistic and diffusive graphene systems.

black hole event horizons might be quantized in a quite specific manner, in
terms of linear combinations of square roots of positive integers. It is
important to realise that there are significant physical constraints on such
integer-based proposals when one (somewhat speculatively) attempts to extend
them outside their original extremal and supersymmetric framework.
Specifically, in their most natural and direct physical interpretations, some
of the more speculative integer-based proposals for the quantization of horizon
areas fail for the ordinary Kerr-Newman black holes in (3+1) dimensions,
essentially because the fine structure constant is not an integer. A more
baroque interpretation involves asserting the fine structure constant is the
square root of a rational number; but such a proposal has its own problems.
Insofar as one takes (3+1) general relativity (plus the usual quantization of
angular momentum and electric charge) as being paramount, the known explicitly
calculable spectra of horizon areas for the physically compelling Kerr-Newman
spacetimes indicate that some caution is called for when assessing the
universality of some of the more speculative integer-based string-inspired
proposals.

\cite[5.7]{BLM} for quantum $\frak{gl}_n$ via a geometric setting of quantum
Schur algebras. We will generailze their result to the classical affine case.
More precisely, we first use Ringel-Hall algebras to construct an integral form
${\mathcal U}_{\mathbb Z}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n)$ of ${\mathcal
U}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n)$, where ${\mathcal U}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n)$ is the
universal enveloping algebra of the loop algebra
$\hat{\frak{gl}}_n:=\frak{gl}_n(\mathbb Q)\otimes\mathbb Q[t,t^{-1}]$. We then
establish the stabilization property of multiplication for the classical affine

manifolds, which generalize ribbons of Legendrian graphs and pages of
supporting open books. Liouville hypersurfaces are used to define a gluing
operation for contact manifolds called the Liouville connect sum. Performing
this operation on a contact manifold $(M, \xi)$ gives an exact -- and in many
cases, Weinstein -- cobordism whose concave boundary is $(M, \xi)$ and whose
convex boundary is the surgered manifold. These cobordisms are used to
establish the existence of ""fillability"" and ""non-vanishing contact homology""
monoids in symplectomorphism groups of Liouville domains, study the symplectic
fillability of a family of contact manifolds which fiber over the circle,
associate cobordisms to certain branched coverings of contact manifolds, and
construct exact symplectic cobordisms that do not admit Weinstein structures.
  The Liouville connect sum generalizes the Weinstein handle attachment and is
used to extend the definition of contact $(1/k)$-surgery along Legendrian knots
in contact 3-manifolds to contact $(1/k)$-surgery along Legendrian spheres in
contact manifolds of arbitrary dimension. We use contact surgery to construct
exotic contact structures on $5$- and $13$-dimensional spheres after
establishing that $S^{2}$ and $S^{6}$ are the only spheres along which
generalized Dehn twists smoothly square to the identity mapping. The exoticity
of these contact structures implies that Dehn twists along $S^{2}$ and $S^{6}$
do not symplectically square to the identity, generalizing a theorem of Seidel.
A similar argument shows that the $(2n+1)$-dimensional contact manifold
determined by an open book whose page is $(T^{*}S^{n}, -\lambda_{can})$ and
whose monodromy is any negative power of a symplectic Dehn twist is not exactly
fillable.

problem of electrostatic patches. All calibration parameters are shown to be
separation-independent after the corrections for mechanical drift are included.
The gradient of the Casimir force was measured in two ways with applied
compensating voltage to the plate and with different applied voltages and
subsequent subtraction of electric forces. The obtained mean gradients are
shown to be in mutual agreement and in agreement with previous experiments
performed using a micromachined oscillator. The obtained data are compared with
theoretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory including corrections beyond the
proximity force approximation. An independent comparison with no fitting
parameters demonstrated that the Drude model approach is excluded by the data
at a 67% confidence level over the separation region from 235 to 420 nm. The
theoretical approach using the generalized plasma-like model is shown to be
consistent with the data over the entire measurement range. Corrections due to
the nonlinearity of oscillator are calculated and the application region of the
linear regime is determined. A conclusion is made that the results of several

soon clear that peaks statistics can also be used as a way to constrain the

statistics particularly interesting from the point of view of discriminating
between General Relativity and modified gravity. Here we consider a general
class of $f(R)$ theories and compute the observable mass function based on the
aperture mass statistics. We complement our theoretical analysis with a Fisher
matrix forecast of the constraints that an Euclid\,-\,like survey can impose on
the $f(R)$ model parameters. We show that peak statistics alone can in
principle discriminate between General Relativity and $f(R)$ models and
strongly constrain the $f(R)$ parameters that are sensitive to the non-linear
growth of structure. However, further analysis is needed in order to include

Sr$_2$CrFeO$_6$, which is as yet unsynthesized. In LSDA calculations, this
system shows formally tetravalent Cr and Fe ions both having antialigned $S$=1
moments, but is a simple metal. Once applying on-site Coulomb repulsion U on
both Cr and Fe ions, this system becomes half-metallic and the moment of Fe is
substantially reduced, resulting in zero net moment. These results are
consistent with our fixed spin moment studies. Our results suggest a precisely
compensated half-metallic Sr$_2$CrFeO$_6$.

complete graph. We investigate two types of stochasticity that, using the
language of social sciences, can be interpreted as different kinds of
nonconformity. From a social point of view, it is very important to distinguish
between two types nonconformity, so called anti-conformity and independence. A
majority of works suggests that these social differences may be completely
irrelevant in terms of microscopic modeling that uses tools of statistical
physics and that both types of nonconformity play the role of so called 'social
temperature'. In this paper we clarify the concept of 'social temperature' and
show that different type of 'noise' may lead to qualitatively different
emergent properties. In particularly, we show that in the model with
anti-conformity the critical value of noise increases with parameter $q$,
whereas in the model with independence the critical value of noise decreases
with the $q$. Moreover, in the model with anti-conformity the phase transition
is continuous for any value of $q$, whereas in the model with independence the
transition is continuous for $q \le 5$ and discontinuous for $q>5$.

conserved in general; price and quantity trajectories must either end at a
local minimum of a scalar potential or circulate endlessly; and disturbances
into a subspace of substitutable commodities decay over time. From this we
argue, although we do not prove, that the model features global stability,
combined with local instability, a characteristic of many real markets.
Following these observations and a brief survey of empirical results for
price-setting and consumption behavior in markets for ""real"" goods (as opposed
to financial markets), we conjecture that Stigler and Becker's well-known

in commodity space, and therefore that price and quantity trajectories could
lie on a relatively low-dimensional subspace within the full commodity space.

the cm radio emission of an SDSS/ROSAT/FIRST matched sample of 13 X-raying AGN
in the redshift range 0.11< z < 0.37 at high angular resolution with the goal
of searching for jet structures or diffuse, extended emission on sub-kpc
scales. We use MERLIN at 18 cm for all objects and Western EVN at 18 cm for
four objects to study the radio emission on scales of ~500 pc and ~40 pc for
the MERLIN and EVN observations, respectively. The detected emission is
dominated by compact nuclear radio structures. We find no kpc collimated jet
structures. The EVN data indicate for compact nuclei on 40 pc scales, with
brightness temperatures typical for accretion-disk scenarios. Comparison with
FIRST shows that the 18 cm emission is resolved out up to 50% by MERLIN.
Star-formation rates based on large aperture SDSS spectra are generally too
small to produce considerable contamination of the nuclear radio emission. We
can, therefore, assume the 18 cm flux densities to be produced in the nuclei of
the AGN. Together with the ROSAT soft X-ray luminosities and black hole mass
estimates from the literature, our sample objects follow closely the Merloni et
al. (2003) fundamental plane relation, which appears to trace the accretion
processes. Detailed X-ray spectral modeling from deeper hard X-ray observations

proceed in the disentangling of jet and accretion related processes.

typically rely on either over-simplified Wyner-type models or complex

Wyner models) seem to materialize neither in complex simulations nor in
practice. To more accurately investigate the theoretical performance of MCC,
this paper models an entire plane of interfering cells as a Poisson random
tessellation. The base stations (BSs) are then clustered using a regular
lattice, whereby BSs in the same cluster mitigate mutual interference by
beamforming with perfect channel state information. Techniques from stochastic
geometry and large deviation theory are applied to analyze the outage
probability as a function of the mobile locations, scattering environment, and
the average number of cooperating BSs per cluster, L. For mobiles near the
centers of BS clusters, it is shown that as L increases, outage probability
diminishes sub-exponentially if scattering is sparse, and following a power law
with an exponent proportional to the signal diversity order if scattering is
rich. For randomly located mobiles, regardless of scattering, outage
probability is shown to scale with increasing L following a power law with an
exponent no larger than 0.5. These results confirm analytically that
cluster-edge mobiles are the bottleneck for network coverage and provide a
plausible analytic framework for more realistic analysis of other multi-cell

property allows to determine the dependency of $F[u]$ on $u_k$ from the top
level part of the conserved density conditions. We apply this structure to the
classification of ""level homogeneous"" scalar evolution equations and we obtain
the top level parts of integrable evolution equations of ""KdV-type"", admitting
an unbroken sequence of conserved densities at orders $m=5,7,9,11,13,15$.

quantities are estimated by ensemble average over a sample set containing a
large number of correlated samples. These samples are selected in accordance
with the probability distribution function, known from the partition function
of equilibrium state. As the stochastic error of the simulation results is
significant, it is desirable to understand the variance of the estimation by
ensemble average, which depends on the sample size (i.e., the total number of
samples in the set) and the sampling interval (i.e., cycle number between two
consecutive samples). Although large sample sizes reduce the variance, they
increase the computational cost of the simulation. For a given CPU time, the
sample size can be reduced greatly by increasing the sampling interval, while
having the corresponding increase in variance be negligible if the original
sampling interval is very small. In this work, we report a few general rules
that relate the variance with the sample size and the sampling interval. These
results are observed and confirmed numerically. These variance rules are
derived for the MCMC method but are also valid for the correlated samples
obtained using other Monte Carlo methods. The main contribution of this work
includes the theoretical proof of these numerical observations and the set of
assumptions that lead to them.

scenario where the phantom field is responsible for the dark energy. We obtain
the statically and spherically approximate solution for this kind of the galaxy
system with a supermassive black hole at its center. The solution of the metric
functions is satisfied with $g_{tt} = - g_{rr}^{-1}$. Constrained by the
observation of the rotational stars moving in circular orbits with nearly
constant tangential speed in a spiral galaxy, the background of the phantom
field which is spatially inhomogeneous has an exponential potential. To avoid
the well-known quantum instability of the vacuum at high frequencies, the
phantom field defined in an effective theory is valid only at low energies.
Under this assumption, we further investigate the following properties. The
absorption cross section of the low-energy $S$-wave excitations of the phantom
field into the central black hole is shown to be the horizontal area of the
central black hole. Because the infalling phantom particles have a total
negative energy, the accretion of the phantom energy is related to the decrease
of the black hole mass which is estimated to be much less than a solar mass in
the lifetime of the Universe. Using a simple model with the cold dark matter
very weakly coupled to the ""{\it low-frequency}"" phantom particles which are
generated from the background, we show that these two densities can be
quasi-stable in the galaxy.

multirate-, and photonic-switching) is to determine the minimum number of some
switching components so that the design is non-blocking in some sense (e.g.,
strict- or wide-sense). We show that, in many cases, this task can be
accomplished with a simple two-step strategy: (1) formulate a linear program
whose optimum value is a bound for the minimum number we are seeking, and (2)
specify a solution to the dual program, whose objective value by weak duality
immediately yields a sufficient condition for the design to be non-blocking.
  We illustrate this technique through a variety of examples, ranging from
circuit to multirate to photonic switching, from unicast to $f$-cast and
multicast, and from strict- to wide-sense non-blocking. The switching
architectures in the examples are of Clos-type and Banyan-type, which are the
two most popular architectural choices for designing non-blocking switching
networks.
  To prove the result in the multirate Clos network case, we formulate a new
problem called {\sc dynamic weighted edge coloring} which generalizes the {\sc
dynamic bin packing} problem. We then design an algorithm with competitive
ratio 5.6355 for the problem. The algorithm is analyzed using the linear
programming technique. A new upper-bound for multirate wide-sense non-blocking
Clos networks follow, improving upon a decade-old bound on the same problem.

where pairwise addition is not well-defined. In general metric spaces, the
Frechet sample mean is not a consistent estimator of the theoretical Frechet
mean. For graph-valued random variables, for instance, the Frechet sample mean
may fail to converge to a unique value. Hence, it becomes necessary to consider
the convergence of sequences of sets of graphs. We show that a specific type of
almost sure convergence for the Frechet sample mean previously introduced by
Ziezold (1977) is, in fact, equivalent to the Kuratowski outer limit of a
sequence of Frechet sample means. Equipped with this outer limit, we provide a
new proof of the strong consistency of the Frechet sample mean for graph-valued
random variables in separable (pseudo-)metric space. Our proof strategy
exploits the fact that the metric of interest is bounded, since we are
considering graphs over a finite number of vertices. In this setting, we
describe two strong laws of large numbers for both the restricted and
unrestricted Frechet sample means of all orders, thereby generalizing a
previous result, due to Sverdrup-Thygeson (1981).

supporting a 'No Big Rip' cosmology. It has also been shown that in this model
the universe follows the power law form of expansion around the critical point,

size and distribution, and consequently on cosmological evolution scenarios.
The number of PBHs that have evaporated to present day is estimated, assuming
they account for all dark matter. Entropy conservation during dimensional
transition imposes additional constraints. If the cosmological constant is
non-negative, no black holes can exist in the $(2+1)$-dimensional epoch, and
consequently a $(1+1)$-dimensional black hole will evolve to become a new type
of remnant. Although these results are conjectural and likely model-dependent,
