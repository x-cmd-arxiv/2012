of the Kolmogorov distance between the cumulative distribution of two
probability functions as the statistical metric to estimate the magnitude of
any spectral dispersion within transient features in a light-curve and we also
show that it performs well in the presence of modest energy resolutions (~20%)

apply it to a parameterised simulated lightcurve based on the extreme VHE
gamma-ray flare of PKS 2155-304 observed with H.E.S.S. in 2006, in order to
illustrate its potential through the concrete example of setting constraints on
quantum-gravity induced Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) effects. We obtain
comparable limits to those of the most advanced techniques used in LIV searches
applied to similar datasets, but the present method has the advantage of being
particularly straightforward to use. Whilst the development of the method was
motivated by LIV searches, it is also applicable to other astrophysical
situations where energy-dependent dispersion is expected, such as spectral lags
from the acceleration and cooling of particles in relativistic outflows.

ask the question: when are they equivalent as contact structures while
inequivalent as toric contact structures? In general this appears to be a

contact equivalent, we show that the corresponding 3-tori belong to distinct

we present an analysis of small scale motions in penumbral filaments in both
simulations and observations. The simulations, when viewed from above, show
fine structure with dark lanes running outwards from the dark core of the
penumbral filaments. The dark lanes either occur preferentially on one side or
alternate between both sides of the filament. We identify this fine structure
with transverse (kink) oscillations of the filament, corresponding to a
sideways swaying of the filament. These oscillations have periods in the range
of 5-7 min and propagate outward and downward along the filament. Similar
features are found in observed G-band intensity time series of penumbral
filaments in a sunspot located near disk center obtained by the Broadband
Filter Imager (BFI) on board {\it Hinode}. We also find that some filaments
show dark striations moving to both sides of the filaments. Based on the
agreement between simulations and observations we conclude that the motions of

emission produced during the inspiral and merger of supermassive black holes
when these are immersed in a force-free plasma threaded by a uniform magnetic
field. As anticipated in a recent letter, our results show that although a
dual-jet structure is present, the associated luminosity is ~ 100 times smaller
than the total one, which is predominantly quadrupolar. We here discuss the
details of our implementation of the equations in which the force-free
condition is not implemented at a discrete level, but rather obtained via a
damping scheme which drives the solution to satisfy the correct condition. We
show that this is important for a correct and accurate description of the
current sheets that can develop in the course of the simulation. We also study
in greater detail the three-dimensional charge distribution produced as a
consequence of the inspiral and show that during the inspiral it possesses a
complex but ordered structure which traces the motion of the two black holes.
Finally, we provide quantitative estimates of the scaling of the
electromagnetic emission with frequency, with the diffused part having a
dependence that is the same as the gravitational-wave one and that scales as L
~ Omega^{10/3-8/3}, while the collimated one scales as L ~ Omega^{5/3-6/3},
thus with a steeper dependence than previously estimated. We discuss the impact
of these results on the potential detectability of dual jets from supermassive
black holes and the steps necessary for more accurate estimates.

lensing surveys on the model of \emph{Euclid}, with particular reference to
primordial non-Gaussianity. Our analysis considers several different estimators
of the projected matter power spectrum, based on both shear and flexion, for
which we review the covariances and Fisher matrices. The bounds provided by
cosmic shear alone for the local bispectrum shape, marginalized over
$\sigma_8$, are at the level of $\Delta f_\mathrm{NL} \sim 100$. We consider
three additional bispectrum shapes, for which the cosmic shear constraints
range from $\Delta f_\mathrm{NL}\sim 340$ (equilateral shape) up to $\Delta
f_\mathrm{NL}\sim 500$ (orthogonal shape). The competitiveness of cosmic
flexion constraints against cosmic shear ones depends on the galaxy intrinsic
flexion noise, that is still virtually unconstrained. Adopting the very high
value that has been occasionally used in the literature results in the flexion
contribution being basically negligible with respect to the shear one, and for
realistic configurations the former does not improve significantly the
constraining power of the latter. Since the flexion noise decreases with
decreasing scale, by extending the analysis up to $\ell_\mathrm{max} = 20,000$
cosmic flexion, while being still subdominant, improves the shear constraints
by $\sim 10%$ when added. However on such small scales the highly non-linear
clustering of matter and the impact of baryonic physics make any error
estimation uncertain. By considering lower, and possibly more realistic, values
of the flexion intrinsic shape noise results in flexion constraining power
being a factor of $\sim 2$ better than that of shear, and the bounds on
$\sigma_8$ and $f_\mathrm{NL}$ being improved by a factor of $\sim 3$ upon
their combination. (abridged)

Guo et al. (2011). We generate mock lensing observations for the two models,
and then employ Fast Fourier Transform methods to compute second- and
third-order aperture statistics in the simulated fields for various galaxy
samples. We find that both models predict qualitatively similar aperture
signals, but there are large quantitative differences. The Durham model
predicts larger amplitudes in general. In both models, red galaxies exhibit
stronger aperture signals than blue galaxies. Using these aperture measurements
and assuming a linear deterministic bias model, we measure relative bias ratios
of red and blue galaxy samples. We find that a linear deterministic bias is
insufficient to describe the relative clustering of model galaxies below ten
arcmin angular scales. Dividing galaxies into luminosity bins, the aperture
signals decrease with decreasing luminosity for brighter galaxies, but increase
again for fainter galaxies. This increase is likely an artifact due to too many
faint satellite galaxies in massive group and cluster halos predicted by the
models. Our study shows that galaxy-galaxy(-galaxy) lensing is a sensitive

renormalizable, and features dynamical mass generation, as well as asymptotic
freedom. At one-loop, it is only logarithmically divergent, but the superficial
degree of divergence of the two-point functions is 3. We calculate the two-loop
corrections to the propagators, and show that, at this order, the
Lorentz-violating corrections to the IR dispersion relation are quadratic in
the cut off. Furthermore, these corrections are too important to represent a
physical effect. As a consequence, the predictive power of the model in terms
of Lorentz-violating effects in the propagation of particles is limited.

initial temperature of the system where the presence of 'hotspots' in the
initial state translates into enhanced production of photons compared to a
smooth profile. The effect of fluctuations in the initial state is found to be
stronger for peripheral collisions and for lower beam energies. The pT spectra
are found to be quite sensitive to the value of the initial formation time of
the plasma which is not known unambiguously and which may vary with collision
centralities at a particular beam energy. Increase in the value of the
formation time lowers the production of thermal photons compared to the results
from a shorter formation time. However, the relative enhancement from
fluctuating initial tates (compared to a smooth initial state) is found to be
stronger for the larger values of formation time. The pT spectra alone are
found to be insufficient to quantify the fluctuations in the initial density

from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks has received attention in the
post-genomic era. A popular strategy has been to cluster the network into
functionally coherent groups of proteins and predict protein function from the
clusters. Traditionally, network research has focused on clustering of nodes.
However, why favor nodes over edges, when clustering of edges may be preferred?
For example, nodes belong to multiple functional groups, but clustering of
nodes typically cannot capture the group overlap, while clustering of edges
can. Clustering of adjacent edges that share many neighbors was proposed
recently, outperforming different node clustering methods. However, since some
biological processes can have characteristic ""signatures"" throughout the
network, not just locally, it may be of interest to consider edges that are not
necessarily adjacent. Hence, we design a sensitive measure of the ""topological
similarity"" of edges that can deal with edges that are not necessarily

different baker's yeast PPI networks, outperforming existing node and edge

gravitational lensing studies as well as a probe of the physical mechanisms
involved in galaxy formation and evolution. We develop a formalism for treating
this intrinsic alignment (IA) in the context of galaxy-galaxy lensing and
present an improved method for measuring IA contamination, which can arise when
sources physically associated with the lens are placed behind the lens due to
photometric redshift scatter. We apply the technique to recent Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) measurements of Luminous Red Galaxy lenses and typical (L*)
source galaxies with photometric redshifts selected from the SDSS imaging data.
Compared to previous measurements, this method has the advantage of being fully
self-consistent in its treatment of the IA and lensing signals, solving for the
two simultaneously. We find an IA signal consistent with zero, placing tight
constraints on both the magnitude of the IA effect and its potential
contamination to the lensing signal. While these constraints depend on source
selection and redshift quality, the method can be applied to any measurement
that uses photometric redshifts. We obtain a model-independent upper-limit of
roughly 10% IA contamination for projected separations of approximately 0.1-100
Mpc/h. With more stringent photo-z cuts and reasonable assumptions about the
physics of intrinsic alignments, this upper limit is reduced to 1-2%. These
limits are well below the statistical error of the current lensing
measurements. Our results suggest that IA will not present intractable
challenges to the next generation of galaxy-galaxy lensing experiments, and the
methods presented here should continue to aid in our understanding of alignment
processes and in the removal of IA from the lensing signal.

In addition, the bulge and main disc are characterised by a remarkable
geometrical decoupling. Indeed they appear elongated orthogonally to each
other. In this work the complex structure of the galaxy is investigated by a
detailed photometric decomposition of optical and near-infrared images. The
intrinsic shape of the bulge was constrained from its apparent ellipticity, its
twist angle with respect to the major axis of the main disc, and the
inclination of the main disc. The bulge is actually elongated perpendicular to
the main disc and it is equally likely to be triaxial or axisymmetric. The
central surface brightness, scalelength, inclination, and position angle of the
nuclear disc were derived by assuming it is infinitesimally thin and
exponential. Its size, orientation, and location do not depend on the observed
passband. These findings support a scenario in which the nuclear disc is the
end result of the acquisition of external gas by the pre-existing triaxial
bulge on the principal plane perpendicular to its shortest axis and
perpendicular to the galaxy main disc. The subsequent star formation either
occurred homogeneously all over the extension of the nuclear disc or through an

structure of main sequence stars, although its signatures are revealed only
later in the evolution when the first dredge-up occurs. Thermohaline mixing is
likely the dominating process that governs the photospheric composition of
low-mass red giant branch stars and has been shown to drastically reduce the
net 3He production in these stars. The predictions of these new stellar models
need to be tested against galaxy evolution. In particular, the resulting
evolution of the light elements D, 3He and 4He should be compared with their
primordial values inferred from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data

Galactic Nuclei sample, consisting of Radio Galaxies and Steep Spectrum Radio
Quasars, recently detected by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope. Our analysis of
the 24-month gamma-ray light curve shows that 3C 111 was only occasionally
detected at high energies. It was bright at the end of 2008 and faint, below
the Fermi-Large Area Telescope sensitivity threshold, for the rest of the time.
A multifrequency campaign of 3C~111, ongoing in the same period, revealed an
increase of the mm, optical and X-ray fluxes in 2008 September-November,
interpreted by Chatterjee et al. (2011) as due to the passage of a superluminal
knot through the jet core. The temporal coincidence of the mm-optical-X-ray
outburst with the GeV activity suggests a co-spatiality of the events,
allowing, for the first time, the localization of the gamma-ray dissipative
zone in a FRII jet. We argue that the GeV photons of 3C 111 are produced in a
compact region confined within 0.1 pc and at a distance of about 0.3 pc from
the black hole.

the VMC observations of two fields in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The VMC
Ks-band light curves of the Cepheids are well sampled (12-epochs) and of

are mostly pulsating in the First Overtone (FO) mode, and to obtain FO
Period-Luminosity (PL), Period-Wesenheit (PW), and Period-Luminosity-Color
(PLC) relations, spanning the full period range from 0.25 to 6 day. Since the
longest period Cepheid in our dataset has a variability period of 23 day, we
have complemented our sample with literature data for brighter F Cepheids. On
this basis we have built a PL relation in the Ks band that, for the first time,
includes short period pulsators, and spans the whole range from 1.6 to 100 days

distance modulus of (m-M)0=18.46\pm0.03 for the LMC. This result is in

shown that the heavy element content of gas giants increases with host star
metallicity. Since metal-poor planets are less dense and have larger radii than
metal-rich planets of the same mass, one might expect that metal-poor stars
host a higher proportion of gas giants with large radii than metal-rich stars.
Here I present evidence for a negative correlation at the 2.3-sigma level
between eclipse depth and stellar metallicity in the Kepler gas giant
candidates. Based on Kendall's tau statistics, the probability that eclipse
depth depends on star metallicity is 0.981. The correlation is consistent with
planets orbiting low-metallicity stars being, on average, larger in comparison
with their host stars than planets orbiting metal-rich stars. Furthermore,
since metal-rich stars have smaller radii than metal-poor stars of the same
mass and age, a uniform population of planets should show a rise in median
eclipse depth with [M/H]. The fact that I find the opposite trend indicates
that substantial changes in gas giant interior structure must accompany
increasing [M/H]. I investigate whether the known scarcity of giant planets
orbiting low-mass stars could masquerade as an eclipse depth-metallicity
correlation, given the degeneracy between metallicity and temperature for cool
stars in the Kepler Input Catalog. While the eclise depth-metallicity
correlation is not yet on firm statistical footing and will require
spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements for validation, it is an intriguing window
into how the interior structure of planets and even the planet formation
mechanism may be changing with Galactic chemical evolution.

distances q < 1.3 AU and orbital periods P > 10^3 yr). We have considered the
sample of LPCs discovered during the period 1900-2009 and their estimated
absolute total visual magnitudes H. For the period 1900-1970 we have relied
upon historical estimates of absolute total magnitudes, while for the more
recent period 1970-2009 we have made our own estimates of H based on Green's
photometric data base and IAU Circulars. We have also used historical records
for the sample of brightest comets (H < 4.5) covering the period: 1500-1899,
based mainly on Vsekhsvyatskii, Hasegawa and Kronk catalogues. We find that the
cumulative distribution of H can be represented by a three-modal law of the
form log_{10}N_{<H} = C + alpha times H, where the C's are constants for the
different legs, and alpha \simeq 0.28 +/- 0.10 for H < 4.0, alpha \simeq 0.56
+/- 0.10 for 4.0 <= H < 5.8, and alpha \simeq 0.20 +/- 0.02 for 5.8 <= H <8.6.
The large increase of the slope of the second leg of the H-distribution might
be at least partially attributed to splitting of comet nuclei leading to the
creation of two or more daughter comets. The cumulative H-distribution tends to
flatten for comets fainter than H <= 8.6. LPCs fainter than H <= 12 (or
diametres D \lesssim 0.5 km) are extremely rare, despite several sky surveys of
near-Earth objects implemented during the last couple of decades, suggesting a
minimum size for a LPC to remain active. We also find that about 30 % of all
LPCs with q < 1.3 AU are new (original bound energies 0 < E_{or} < 10^{-4}
AU^{-1}), and that among the new comets about half come from the outer Oort
cloud (energies 0 \lesssim E_{or} \lesssim 0.3 times 10^{-4} AU^{-1}), and the
other half from the inner Oort cloud (energies 0.3 times 10^{-4} \lesssim

approximation. At nonzero ${\cal N}_0$ and $U_0$, the phase diagram consists of
two hybrid spin-valley symmetry-broken phases with both nontrivial nematic and
mass-type order parameters. The corresponding phases are separated by a
critical line of first- and second-order phase transitions at small and large
values of ${\cal N}_0$, respectively. The existence of a critical end point,
where the line of first-order phase transitions terminates, is predicted. For
${\cal N}_0=0$, a pure gapped state with a broken spin-valley symmetry is the
ground state of the system. As ${\cal N}_{0}$ increases, the nematic order
parameter increases, and the gap weakens in the hybrid state. For $U_{0}=0$, a
quantum second-order phase transition from the hybrid state into a pure gapless
nematic state occurs when the strain reaches a critical value. A nonzero
$U_{0}$ suppresses the critical value of the strain. The relevance of these

This splitting originates from two possible configurations developed by [CuBr]

arrangement along the 'c' direction remains partially disordered. The
predominant and energetically more favorable configuration features an
additional doubling of the 'c' lattice parameter that was not observed in

TN=32 K, which is nearly 70% of the leading exchange coupling J4~48 K. The Br
compound does not show any experimental signatures of low-dimensional
magnetism, because the underlying spin lattice is three-dimensional. The
coupling along the 'c' direction is comparable to the couplings in the 'ab'
plane, even though the shortest Cu--Cu distance along 'c' (11.69 A) is three
times larger than nearest-neighbor distances in the 'ab' plane (3.55 A). The

methodologies cannot identify the potentially global structure of these
asymmetries. We give a spectral algorithm called di-sim that builds on a dual
measure of similarity that correspond to how a node (i) sends and (ii) receives
edges. Using di-sim, we analyze the global asymmetries in the networks of Enron
emails, political blogs, and the c elegans neural connectome. In each example,
a small subset of nodes have persistent asymmetries; these nodes send edges
with one cluster, but receive edges with another cluster. Previous approaches
would have assigned these asymmetric nodes to only one cluster, failing to
identify their sending/receiving asymmetries. Regularization and ""projection""
are two steps of di-sim that are essential for spectral clustering algorithms
to work in practice. The theoretical results show that these steps make the
algorithm weakly consistent under the degree corrected Stochastic
co-Blockmodel, a model that generalizes the Stochastic Blockmodel to allow for
both (i) degree heterogeneity and (ii) the global asymmetries that we intend to
detect. The theoretical results make no assumptions on the smallest degree
nodes. Instead, the theorem requires that the average degree grows sufficiently
fast and that the weak consistency only applies to the subset of the nodes with
sufficiently large leverage scores. The results results also apply to bipartite
graphs.

potentials of nucleus-nucleus systems and reproduces the existing elastic
scattering data for stable heavy-ion projectiles at incident energies above 50

correlated iron-based superconductors has raised the question of how to
properly treat $s_\pm$ gaps in strongly correlated superconductors. Unlike the
d-wave cuprates, the Coulomb repulsion does not vanish by symmetry, and a
careful treatment is essential. Thus far, only the weak correlation approaches
have included this Coulomb pseudopotential, so here we introduce a symplectic N
treatment of the t-J model that incorporates the strong Coulomb repulsion
through the complete elimination of on-site pairing. Through a proper extension
of time-reversal symmetry to the large N limit, symplectic-N is the first
superconducting large N solution of the t-J model. For d-wave superconductors,
the previous uncontrolled mean field solutions are reproduced, while for
$s_\pm$ superconductors, the SU(2) constraint enforcing single occupancy acts
as a pair chemical potential adjusting the location of the gap nodes. This
adjustment can capture the wide variety of gaps proposed for the iron based
superconductors: line and point nodes, as well as two different, but related
full gaps on different Fermi surfaces.

recently been proposed. There it has been highlighted a possible measurement of
the angle $\beta_c$, in the charm unitarity triangle, using the decays $D^0\to
K^+ K^-$ and $D^0\to \pi^+ \pi^-$, and a measurement of the mixing phase
$\phi_{MIX}$. The same method can be used to measure the value of the parameter
$x$, one of the two parameters defining charm mixing. We numerically evaluate
the impact of a time-dependent analysis in terms of the possible outcomes from
present and future experiments. We consider the scenarios of correlated $D^0$
mesons production at the center of mass energy of the $\Psi(3770)$ at Super$B$,
uncorrelated production at the center of mass energy of the $\Upsilon(4S)$ at
Super$B$ and Belle II, and LHCb. Recently a hint of direct CP violation in
charm decays was reported by the LHCb collaboration, we estimate the rate of
time-dependent asymmetry that could be achieved using their available data, and
we generalise the result for the full LHCb program. We conclude that LHCb is
already able to perform a first measurement of $\beta_{c,eff}$, and slightly
improve the present constraints on the parameters $x$ and $\phi_{MIX}$. A more
precise determination of $\beta_{c,eff}$, $\phi_{MIX}$ and $x$ will require a
larger data sample, and most probably the cleaner environment of the new high
luminosities $B$-factories (both Super$B$ and Belle II) will be needed. We show
that Super$B$ will be able to measure $\beta_{c,eff}$ and $\phi_{MIX}$ with a
precision of $1.4^o$ and improve the precision on $x$ by a factor of two.

small neighbourhoods of periodic points of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical
systems is compound Poisson. The returns to small balls around a fixed point in
the phase space correspond to the occurrence of rare events, or exceedances of
high thresholds, so that there is a connection between the laws of Return Times
Statistics and Extreme Value Laws. The fact that the fixed point in the phase
space is a repelling periodic point implies that there is a tendency for the
exceedances to appear in clusters whose average sizes is given by the Extremal
Index, which depends on the expansion of the system at the periodic point.
  We recall that for generic points, the exceedances, in the limit, are
singular and occur at Poisson times. However, around periodic points, the
picture is different: the respective point processes of exceedances converge to
a compound Poisson process, so instead of single exceedances, we have entire
clusters of exceedances occurring at Poisson times with a geometric
distribution ruling its multiplicity.
  The systems to which our results apply include: general piecewise expanding
maps of the interval (Rychlik maps), maps with indifferent fixed points
(Manneville-Pomeau maps) and Benedicks-Carleson quadratic maps.

intergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.
However, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years
(Myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond the
sensitivity limits of current large telescopes. Gravitational lensing by galaxy
clusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter than
what otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. We report the
discovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the cluster
MACS1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnified
object from the early universe. The object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in the
two reddest bands of HST/WFC3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching the
characteristics of z\sim9 objects. We derive a robust photometric redshift of z
= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15Myr (i.e., 3.6% of
the age of the Universe). The large number of bands used to derive the redshift
estimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such a
distant object. The significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of
\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosity
in its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,
star-formation rate and age. If the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,
then its age is less than 200 Myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying a
formation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. The object is the first z>9 candidate
that is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with JWST,
demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highly
magnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

Ia) observed in the near-infrared J and H bands. We select SNe exclusively from
the redshift range 0.03 < z < 0.09 to reduce uncertainties coming from peculiar
velocities while remaining in a cosmologically well-understood region. All of
the SNe in our sample exhibit no spectral or B-band light-curve peculiarities
and lie in the B-band stretch range of 0.8-1.15. Our results suggest that SNe
Ia observed in the near-infrared (NIR) are the best known standard candles. We
fit previously determined NIR light-curve templates to new high-precision data
to derive peak magnitudes and to determine the scatter about the Hubble line.
Photometry of the 12 SNe is presented in the natural system. Using a standard
cosmology of (H_0, Omega_m, Lambda) = (70,0.27,0.73) we find a median J-band
absolute magnitude of M_J = -18.39 with a scatter of 0.116 and a median H-band
absolute magnitude of M_H = -18.36 with a scatter of 0.085. The scatter in the
H band is the smallest yet measured. We search for correlations between
residuals in the J- and H-band Hubble diagrams and SN properties, such as SN
colour, B-band stretch and the projected distance from host-galaxy centre. The
only significant correlation is between the J-band Hubble residual and the J-H
pseudo-colour. We also examine how the scatter changes when fewer points in the
near-infrared are used to constrain the light curve. With a single point in the
H band taken anywhere from 10 days before to 15 days after B-band maximum light
and a prior on the date of H-band maximum set from the date of B-band maximum,
we find that we can measure distances to an accuracy of 6%. The precision of
SNe Ia in the NIR provides new opportunities for precision measurements of both
the expansion history of the universe and peculiar velocities of nearby
galaxies.

applications such as face recognition, motion segmentation, etc. It
approximates the nonnegative data in an original high dimensional space with a
linear representation in a low dimensional space by using the product of two
nonnegative matrices. In many applications data are often partially corrupted
with large additive noise. When the positions of noise are known, some existing
variants of NMF can be applied by treating these corrupted entries as missing
values. However, the positions are often unknown in many real world
applications, which prevents the usage of traditional NMF or other existing
variants of NMF. This paper proposes a Robust Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
(RobustNMF) algorithm that explicitly models the partial corruption as large
additive noise without requiring the information of positions of noise. In
practice, large additive noise can be used to model outliers. In particular,
the proposed method jointly approximates the clean data matrix with the product
of two nonnegative matrices and estimates the positions and values of
outliers/noise. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm with a solid
theoretical justification has been proposed to learn the desired matrix
factorization. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
algorithm.

how much workload to be executed in each data center and how much workload to
be delayed and migrated to other data centers for energy saving while meeting
deadlines. We present an offline formulation for geographical load balancing

assignment of workload to the data centers and the migration of workload
between data centers in order to adapt with dynamic electricity price changes.
We compare our algorithms with the greedy approach and show that significant

We prove that the parameters $c_i$ which decide initial prepared states affect

central galaxies of clusters, most of these cavities are thought to be inflated
by jets of AGNs. The jets can be either powered by rotating black holes or the
accretion disks surrounding black holes, or both. In this work, we choose the
most energetic cavity, MS 0735+7421, with stored energy ~ 10^62 erg, to
constrain the jet formation mechanisms and the evolution of the central massive
black hole in this source. The bolometric luminosity of the AGN in this cavity
is ~ 10^(-5) L_Edd, however, the mean power of the jet required to inflate the
cavity is estimated as ~ 0.02 L_Edd, which implies that the source has
experienced strong outbursts previously. During outbursts, the jet power and
the mass accretion rate should be significantly higher than its present values.
We construct an accretion disk model, in which the angular momentum and energy
carried away by jets is properly included, to calculate the spin and mass
evolution of the massive black hole. In our calculations, different jet
formation mechanisms are employed, and we find that the jets generated with the
Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism are unable to produce the giant cavity with ~
10^62 erg in this source. Only the jets accelerated with the combination of the
Blandford-Payne (BP) and BZ mechanisms can successfully inflate such a giant
cavity, if the magnetic pressure is close to equipartition with the total
(radiation+gas) pressure of the accretion disk. For dynamo generated magnetic
field in the disk, such an energetic giant cavity can be inflated by the
magnetically driven jets only if the initial black hole spin parameter a_0 >
0.95. Our calculations show that the final spin parameter a of the black hole
is always ~ 0:9 - 0.998 for all the computational examples which can provide
sufficient energy for the cavity of MS 0735+7421.

order homogeneous matrix equation in the divided-difference operator termed the
spectral equation. Attached to the spectral equation is a structure which
constitutes a number of relations such as those arising from compatibility with
the three-term recurrence relation. Here this structure is elucidated in the
general case of quadratic lattices. The simplest examples of the
$\mathbb{D}$-semi-classical orthogonal polynomial systems are precisely those
in the Askey table of hypergeometric and basic hypergeometric orthogonal
polynomials. However within the $\mathbb{D}$-semi-classical class it is
entirely natural to define a generalisation of the Askey table weights which
involve a deformation with respect to new deformation variables. We completely
construct the analogous structures arising from such deformations and their
relations with the other elements of the theory. As an example we treat the
first non-trivial deformation of the Askey-Wilson orthogonal polynomial system
defined by the $q$-quadratic divided-difference operator, the Askey-Wilson

predicts a [22O(0+) + n (2s_{1/2})] configuration for its ground state, with a
one neutron separation energy in close agreement with the corresponding
experimental value. The wave function describing the valence neutron-core
relative motion was then used to calculate the Coulomb dissociation of 23O on a
lead target at a beam energy of 422 MeV/nucleon. The experimental neutron-core
relative energy spectrum and the total one-neutron removal cross sections are
well described by the calculations. The widths of the longitudinal momentum
distributions of the 22O fragment are found to be broad, which do not support
the formation of a neutron halo in this nucleus.

been compared to the experimental data on the centrality dependence of
invariant yield, elliptic flow ($v_{2}$), and hexadecapole flow ($v_{4}$) as a
function of transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) of charged hadrons in Au-Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm {NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. Results from two types of
initial transverse energy density profile, one based on the Glauber model and
other based on Color-Glass-Condensate (CGC) are presented. We observe no
difference in the simulated results on the invariant yield of charged hadrons
for the calculations with different initial conditions. The comparison to the
experimental data on invariant yield of charged hadrons supports a shear
viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s$) between 0 to 0.12 for the 0-10%
to 40-50% collision centralities. The simulated $v_{2}(p_{T})$ is found to be
higher for a fluid with CGC based initial condition compared to Glauber based
initial condition for a given collision centrality. Consequently the Glauber
based calculations when compared to the experimental data requires a lower
value of $\eta/s$ relative to CGC based calculations. In addition, a centrality
dependence of the estimated $\eta/s$ is observed from the $v_{2}(p_{T})$ study.
The $v_{4}(p_{T})$ for the collision centralities 0-10% to 40-50% supports a
$\eta/s$ value between 0 - 0.08 for a CGC based initial condition. While
simulated results using the Glauber based initial condition for the ideal fluid
evolution under estimates the $v_{4}(p_{T})$ for collision centralities 0-10%
to 30-40%.

Problem (TSP). Firstly, we will focus on human performance on the TSP.
Experimental data shows that untrained humans appear to have the ability to
perform well in the TSP. On the other hand, experimental data also supports the
hypothesis of convex hull i.e. human relies on convex hull to search for the
optimal tour for the TSP. Secondly, from the paper published by Bonabeau,
Dorigo and Theraulaz, social insect behavior would be able to help in some of
the optimizing problems, especially the TSP. Thus, we propose convex layers to
the TSP based on the argument that, by the analogy to the social insect
behavior, untrained humans' cognition should be able to help in the TSP.
Lastly, we will use Tour Improvement algorithms on convex layers to search for
an optimal tour for a 13-cities problem to demonstrate the idea.

statistics. Hard-thresholding methods such as $l_0$ regularization are
theoretically ideal but computationally infeasible. In this paper, we propose a
new approach, called the LAGS, short for ""least absulute gradient selector"", to
this challenging yet interesting problem by mimicking the discrete selection
process of $l_0$ regularization. To estimate $\beta$ under the influence of
noise, we consider, nevertheless, the following convex program [\hat{\beta} =
\textrm{arg min}\frac{1}{n}\|X^{T}(y - X\beta)\|_1 + \lambda_n\sum_{i =
1}^pw_i(y;X;n)|\beta_i|]
  $\lambda_n > 0$ controls the sparsity and $w_i > 0$ dependent on $y, X$ and
$n$ is the weights on different $\beta_i$; $n$ is the sample size.
Surprisingly, we shall show in the paper, both geometrically and analytically,
that LAGS enjoys two attractive properties: (1) LAGS demonstrates discrete
selection behavior and hard thresholding property as $l_0$ regularization by
strategically chosen $w_i$, we call this property ""pseudo-hard thresholding"";
(2) Asymptotically, LAGS is consistent and capable of discovering the true
model; nonasymptotically, LAGS is capable of identifying the sparsity in the
model and the prediction error of the coefficients is bounded at the noise
level up to a logarithmic factor---$\log p$, where $p$ is the number of
predictors.
  Computationally, LAGS can be solved efficiently by convex program routines
for its convexity or by simplex algorithm after recasting it into a linear
program. The numeric simulation shows that LAGS is superior compared to
soft-thresholding methods in terms of mean squared error and parsimony of the
model.

case of collaborative representation based classification (CRC), which has
various instantiations by applying different norms to the coding residual and
coding coefficient. More specifically, the l1 or l2 norm characterization of
coding residual is related to the robustness of CRC to outlier facial pixels,

the degree of discrimination of facial features. Extensive experiments were

the absence of systematic (e.g. diagrammatic) way to express LDA (local density
approximation) contribution to exchange correlation energy appearing in the
density functional theory. It is not clear then, which part of interaction
entering DMFT (dynamical mean-field theory) is already taken into account
through LDA calculations. Because of that, up to now there is no accepted
unique expression for the double counting correction in LDA+DMFT. To avoid this
problem we propose here the consistent LDA'+DMFT approach, where LDA exchange
correlation contribution is explicitly excluded for correlated states (bands)
during self-consistent band structure calculations. What is left out of Coulomb
interaction for those strongly correlated states (bands) is its non-local part,
which is not included in DMFT, and the local Hartree like contribution. Then
the double counting correction is uniquely reduced to the local Hartree
contribution. Correlations for strongly correlated states are then directly
accounted for via the standard DMFT. We further test the consistent LDA'+DMFT
scheme and compare it with conventional LDA+DMFT calculating the electronic
structure of NiO. Opposite to the conventional LDA+DMFT our consistent
LDA'+DMFT approach unambiguously produces the insulating band structure in
agreement with experiments.

the strength of spreading magnetic field. The ratio of nucleation time and
effective time is also studied with strength of spreading magnetic field. The
effective time would introduce itself as a new scale of time in the case of
nucleation by spatially spreading magnetic field. The effective time and the
nucleation time both are observed to decrease as a power law fashion with the
rate factor of spreading magnetic field.

planetary systems. A handful of ""warm"" debris disks have been discovered in the
last years, where emission in excess starts in the mid-infrared. An interesting
subset within these warm debris disks are those where emission features are
detected in mid-IR spectra, which points towards the presence of warm
micron-sized dust grains. Given the ages of the host stars, the presence of
these grains is puzzling, and questions their origin and survival in time. This
study focuses on determining the mineralogy of the dust around 7 debris disks
with evidence for warm dust, based on Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic data, in order
to provide new insights into the origin of the dust grains. We present a new
radiative transfer code dedicated to SED modeling of optically thin disks. We
make use of this code on the SEDs of seven warm debris disks, in combination
with recent laboratory experiments on dust optical properties. We find that
most, if not all, debris disks in our sample are experiencing a transient
phase, suggesting a production of small dust grains on relatively short
timescales. From a mineralogical point of view, we find that enstatite grains
have small abundances compared to crystalline olivine grains. The main result
of our study is that we find evidences for Fe-rich crystalline olivine grains
(Fe / [Mg + Fe] ~ 0.2) for several debris disks. This finding contrasts with
studies of gas-rich protoplanetary disks. The presence of Fe-rich olivine
grains, and the overall differences between the mineralogy of dust in Class II
disks compared to debris disks suggest that the transient crystalline dust is
of a new generation. We discuss possible crystallization routes to explain our
results, and comment on the mechanisms that may be responsible for the
production of small dust grains.

is presented and background information on their operation in GREAT is given.
Our mixer units are waveguide-based and couple to free-space radiation via a
feedhorn antenna. The HEB mixers are designed, fabricated, characterized, and
flight-qualified in-house. We are able to use the full intermediate frequency
bandwidth of the mixers using silicon-germanium multi-octave cryogenic
low-noise amplifiers with very low input return loss. Superconducting HEB
mixers have proven to be practical and sensitive detectors for high-resolution
THz frequency spectroscopy on SOFIA. We show that our niobium-titanium-nitride
(NbTiN) material HEBs on silicon nitride (SiN) membrane substrates have an
intermediate frequency (IF) noise roll-off frequency above 2.8 GHz, which does
not limit the current receiver IF bandwidth. Our mixer technology development
efforts culminate in the first successful operation of a waveguide-based HEB
mixer at 2.5 THz and deployment for radioastronomy. A significant contribution
to the success of GREAT is made by technological development, thorough
characterization and performance optimization of the mixer and its IF interface
for receiver operation on SOFIA. In particular, the development of an optimized
mixer IF interface contributes to the low passband ripple and excellent
stability, which GREAT demonstrated during its initial successful astronomical

Intense thermionic emission from ionized hot spots migrating on the relatively
cold surface of charged explosive particles, can convert these particles into
short-circuited thermionic batteries, turning an aerosol cloud consisting of
such unipolar charged, gradually decomposing explosive particles into ball
lightning. The slow exothermic decomposition of the highly sensitive explosive
aerosol particles, catalyzed by excess ions on their surface, and also
ion-catalyzed reactions of slow water vapor induced oxidation of charged
combustible aerosol particles underlie two main classes of natural ball
lightning. At the same time, the artificially generated clouds consisting of
such unipolar charged aerosol nanobatteries, probably, can have some useful
applications, not only military ones. In particular, it seems that
high-performance pyroelectric fusion reactors could be created on the basis of
such ball-shaped aerosol clouds self-assembled of pyroelectric nanocrystals -
short-circuited pyroelectric nanobatteries.

TeV centre-of-mass energy have been used to search for the standard model Higgs

The combination of the results has allowed CMS to set 95% confidence-level
limits on the Higgs boson mass, constraining it to lay in the region
114.4<M(H)<127 GeV or M(H)>600 GeV. An excess of events with a local

universe"" and analyze the structure of these initial data. We study the
relation between the mean expansion rate of the 3-space, which corresponds to
the Hubble parameter, and the mass density of black holes. The result implies
that the same relation as that of the Einstein-de Sitter universe is realized
in the limit of the large separation between neighboring black holes. The
applicability of the cosmological Newtonian $N$-body simulation to the dark
matter composed of black holes is also discussed. The deviation of the spatial
metric of the cosmological Newtonian $N$-body system from that of the black
hole universe is found to be smaller than about 1% in a region distant from the
particles, if the separation length between neighboring particles is 20 times
larger than their gravitational radius. By contrast, the deviation of the
square of the Hubble parameter of the cosmological Newtonian $N$-body system
from that of the black hole universe is about 20% for the same separation
length.

the modal axioms are generated from a formal grammar. We consider a proof
theory, in nested sequent calculus, of grammar logics with converse, i.e.,
every modal operator [a] comes with a converse. Extending previous works on
nested sequent systems for tense logics, we show all grammar logics (with or
without converse) can be formalised in nested sequent calculi, where the axioms
are internalised in the calculi as structural rules. Syntactic cut-elimination
for these calculi is proved using a procedure similar to that for display
logics. If the grammar is context-free, then one can get rid of all structural
rules, in favor of deep inference and additional propagation rules. We give a
novel semi-decision procedure for context-free grammar logics, using nested
sequent calculus with deep inference, and show that, in the case where the
given context-free grammar is regular, this procedure terminates. Unlike all
other existing decision procedures for regular grammar logics in the
literature, our procedure does not assume that a finite state automaton

important to compare the SN rate in galaxies with the GRB rate. To do that we
computed Type Ib/c SN rates in galaxies of different morphological type by
assuming different histories of star formation and different supernova Ib/c
progenitors. We included some recent suggestions about the dependence of the
minimum mass of single Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars upon the stellar metallicity and
therefore upon galactic chemical evolution. We adopted several cosmic star
formation rates as functions of cosmic time, either observationally or
theoretically derived, including the one computed with our galaxy models. Then
we computed the cosmic Type Ib/c SN rates. We derived the following
conclusions: i) the ratio cosmic GRB - Type Ib/c rate varies in the range
10^{-2}-10^{-4} in the whole redshift range, thus suggesting that only a small
fraction of all the Type Ib/c SNe gives rise to GRBs. ii) The metallicity
dependence of Type Ib/c SN progenitors produces lower cosmic SN Ib/c rates at
early times, for any chosen cosmic star formation rate. iii) Different
theoretical cosmic star formation rates, computed under different scenarios of
galaxy formation, produce SN Ib/c cosmic rates which differ mainly at very high
redshift. However, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the high
redshift trend because of the large uncertainties in the data. iv) GRBs can be
important tracers of star formation at high redshift if their luminosity
function does not vary with redshift and they can help in discriminating among
different galaxy formation models.

similar for the CN and C3 comae. The CN features expanded outwards with the
sky-plane projected velocities between 0.1 to 0.3 km/s. A corkscrew structure,
observed on November 6, evolved with a much higher velocity of 0.66 km/s.
Photometry of the inner coma of CN shows variability with a period of

iron-based superconductors [1-9], many consider Fermi surface (FS) nesting [2,
4, 8, 10] and dimensionality [4, 9] as important contributors. Precise
determination of the electronic spectrum and its modification by
superconductivity, crucial for further theoretical advance, were hindered by a
rich structure of the FS [11-17]. Here, using the angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) with resolution of all three components of electron
momentum and electronic states symmetry, we disentangle the electronic
structure of hole-doped BaFe2As2, and show that nesting and dimensionality of
FS sheets have no immediate relation to the superconducting pairing.
Alternatively a clear correlation between the orbital character of the
electronic states and their propensity to superconductivity is observed: the
magnitude of the superconducting gap maximizes at 10.5 meV exclusively for iron
3dxz;yz orbitals, while for others drops to 3.5 meV. Presented results reveal
similarities of electronic response to superconducting and magneto-structural
transitions [18, 19], implying that relation between these two phases is more

  Communication System with Unitary and Non-Unitary Constellations",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we derive a maximum likelihood (ML) decoder of the
differential data in a decode-and-forward (DF) based cooperative communication
system utilizing uncoded transmissions. This decoder is applicable to
complex-valued unitary and non-unitary constellations suitable for differential
modulation. The ML decoder helps in improving the diversity of the DF based
differential cooperative system using an erroneous relaying node. We also
derive a piecewise linear (PL) decoder of the differential data transmitted in
the DF based cooperative system. The proposed PL decoder significantly reduces
the decoding complexity as compared to the proposed ML decoder without any
significant degradation in the receiver performance. Existing ML and PL
decoders of the differentially modulated uncoded data in the DF based
cooperative communication system are only applicable to binary modulated
signals like binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and binary frequency shift keying
(BFSK), whereas, the proposed decoders are applicable to complex-valued unitary
and non-unitary constellations suitable for differential modulation under
uncoded transmissions. We derive a closedform expression of the uncoded average
symbol error rate (SER) of the proposed PL decoder with M-PSK constellation in
a cooperative communication system with a single relay and one
source-destination pair. An approximate average SER by ignoring higher order
noise terms is also derived for this set-up. It is analytically shown on the
basis of the derived approximate SER that the proposed PL decoder provides full
diversity of second order. In addition, we also derive approximate SER of the
differential DF system with multiple relays at asymptotically high
signal-to-noise ratio of the source-relay links.

the theory of M-matrices and the geometric interpretation of NMF. This approach
provably leads to optimal and sparse solutions under the separability

clusters and appear to have magnetic fields at the microGauss level. Here we
investigate the possible origins of these magnetic fields. Turbulence produced
by the shock itself cannot explain the magnitude of these fields. However, we
argue that if the turbulent pressure support in the ICM upstream of the merger
shock is of the order of 10 to 30 percent of the total pressure on scales of a
few times 100 kpc, then vorticity generated by compressive and baroclinic
effects across the shock discontinuity can lead to a sufficient amplification
of the magnetic field. Compressional amplification can explain the large
polarisation of the radio emission more easily than dynamo turbulent
amplification. Finally, clumping of the ICM is shown to have a negligible
effect on magnetic field amplification.

rotational profile of some 180 nearby stars with spectral types A-F. The
overall broadening profile is derived analysing spectral line shape from
hundreds of spectral lines by the method of least-squares deconvolution. Rigid
and differential rotation can be distinguished in 56 cases. Ten stars with
significant differential rotation rates are identified.
  As of now, 33 differential rotators detected by line profile analysis have
been confirmed. The frequency of differential rotators decreases towards high
effective temperature and rapid rotation. There is evidence for two populations
of differential rotators with a gap in between at spectral type early-F. The
gap can only partly be explained by an upper bound found for the horizontal
shear of F stars. Apparently, the physical conditions of differential rotation
change at early-F spectral types.

not the case, possibly in the strong sense that the mentioned probability

  If each $\mbK_n$ is the set of structures with universe ${1, ..., n}$, in a
fixed relational language, in which certain ""forbidden"" structures cannot be
weakly embedded and $\mbK$ has the disjoint amalgamation property, then there
is a condition (concerning the set of forbidden structures) which, if we
consider the uniform measure, gives a dichotomy; i.e. the condition holds if
and only if the answer to the first question is `yes'. In general, we do not
obtain a dichotomy, but we do obtain a condition guaranteeing that the answer
is `yes' for the first question, as well as a condition guaranteeing that the
answer is `no'; and we give examples showing that in the gap between these
conditions the answer may be either `yes' or `no'. This analysis is made for
both the uniform measure and for the dimension conditional measure. The later
measure has closer relation to random generation of structures and is more
""generous"" with respect to satisfiability of extension axioms.

physics, chemistry and biology. The essential theoretical issue in
understanding pattern formation is to explain how a spatially homogeneous
initial state can undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking leading to a stable
spatial pattern. This problem is most commonly studied using partial
differential equations to model a reaction-diffusion system of the type
introduced by Turing. We report here on a much simpler and more robust model of
spatial pattern formation, which is formulated as a novel type of coupled map
lattice. In our model, the local site dynamics are coupled through a
competitive, rather than diffusive, interaction. Depending only on the strength
of the interaction, this competitive coupling results in spontaneous symmetry
breaking of a homogeneous initial configuration and the formation of stable
spatial patterns. This mechanism is very robust and produces stable pattern
formation for a wide variety of spatial geometries, even when the local site
dynamics is trivial.

orb}$ = 16.6 d), eccentric orbit. After two years of relatively low X-ray
luminosity, in May 2010 Circinus X-1 went into outburst, reaching 0.4 Crab
flux. This outburst lasted for about two orbital cycles and was followed by
another shorter and fainter outburst in June. We focus here on the broadband
X-ray spectral evolution of the source as it spans about three order of
magnitudes in flux. We attempt to relate luminosity, spectral shape, local
absorption, and orbital phase. We use multiple Rossi-XTE/PCA (3.0--25 keV) and
Swift/XRT (1.0--9.0 keV) observations and a 20 ks long Chandra/HETGS
observation (1.0--9.0 keV), to comprehensively track the spectral evolution of
the source during all the outbursting phases. These observations were taken
every two/three days and cover about four orbital cycles. The PCA data mostly
cover the major outburst, the XRT data monitor the declining phase of the major
outburst and all the phases of the minor outburst, and Chandra data provide an
essential snapshot of the end of this overall outbursting phase. The X-ray
spectrum can be satisfactorily described by a thermal Comptonization model with
variable neutral local absorption in all phases of the outburst. No other
additive component is statistically required. The first outburst decays
linearly, with an ankle in the light curve as the flux decreases below
$\sim$\,5 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. At the same time, the
source shows a clear spectral state transition from an optically thick to an
optically thin state. While the characteristics of the first, bright, outburst
can be interpreted within the disk-instability scenario, the following, minor,
outburst shows peculiarities that cannot be easily reconciled in this
framework.

packets might traverse a longer path or even a loop. An even worse transient

In this context, this paper describes a proactive fast rerouting approach,
named Fast Emergency Paths Schema (FEP-S), to overcome problems originating
from transient link failures in OSPF routing. Extensive experiments were done
using several network topologies with different dimensionality degrees. Results
show that the recovery paths, obtained by FEPS, are shorter than those from
other rerouting approaches and can improve the network reliability by reducing
the packet loss rate during the routing protocols convergence caused by a

sphere exists only in the regime $\epsilon\leq\epsilon_{max}$ for prograde
photon. The upper limit $\epsilon_{max}$ is a function of the rotation

ray closing very to the naked singularity is a positive finite value, which is
different from those in both the usual Kerr black hole spacetime and in the
rotating naked singularity described by Janis-Newman-Winicour metric. For the
oblate black hole and the retrograde photon, there does not exist such a

coupled transport in the sense of linear irreversible thermodynamics. Monte
Carlo thermostats are implemented to impose a given temperature and chemical
potential at the chain ends. As a result, we find that the Onsager coefficients

the position in the parameter space, the ""Seebeck coefficient"" may be either
positive or negative. For large differences between the thermostat parameters,
density and temperature profiles may display an unusual nonmonotonic shape.

severely restricted by random force errors induced by particle disorder,
especially in shear flows, which are ubiquitous in astrophysics. The increase
in the number NH of neighbours when switching to more extended smoothing
kernels at fixed resolution (using an appropriate definition for the SPH
resolution scale) is insufficient to combat these errors. Consequently, trading
resolution for better convergence is necessary, but for traditional smoothing
kernels this option is limited by the pairing (or clumping) instability.
Therefore, we investigate the suitability of the Wendland functions as
smoothing kernels and compare them with the traditional B-splines. Linear
stability analysis in three dimensions and test simulations demonstrate that
the Wendland kernels avoid the pairing instability for all NH, despite having
vanishing derivative at the origin (disproving traditional ideas about the
origin of this instability; instead, we uncover a relation with the kernel
Fourier transform and give an explanation in terms of the SPH density
estimator). The Wendland kernels are computationally more convenient than the
higher-order B-splines, allowing large NH and hence better numerical
convergence (note that computational costs rise sub-linear with NH). Our
analysis also shows that at low NH the quartic spline kernel with NH ~= 60
obtains much better convergence then the standard cubic spline.

may be enlarged or narrowed. The LIV effects could be viewed as influence from
an anisotropic media on the electromagnetic wave. In addition, the
birefringence of light will not emerge at the leading order in this model. A
constraint on the spacetime anisotropy is obtained from observations on

organizational level as well as the spontaneous emergence of computation
(Langton), indicate the relevance of self-organized criticality (SOC). But
extrapolating complex bio-systems to life's origins, brings up a paradox: how
could simple organics--lacking the 'soft matter' response properties of today's
bio-molecules--have dissipated energy from primordial reactions in a controlled
manner for their 'ordering'? Nevertheless, a causal link of life's macroscopic
irreversible dynamics to the microscopic reversible laws of statistical
mechanics is indicated via the 'functional-takeover' of a soft magnetic
scaffold by organics (c.f. Cairns-Smith's 'crystal-scaffold'). A
field-controlled structure offers a mechanism for bootstrapping--bottom-up
assembly with top-down control: its super-paramagnetic components obey
reversible dynamics, but its dissipation of H-field energy for aggregation
breaks time-reversal symmetry. The responsive adjustments of the controlled
(host) mineral system to environmental changes would bring about mutual
coupling between random organic sets supported by it; here the generation of
long-range correlations within organic (guest) networks could include SOC-like
mechanisms. And, such cooperative adjustments enable the selection of the
functional configuration by altering the inorganic network's capacity to assist
a spontaneous process. A non-equilibrium dynamics could now drive the
kinetically-oriented system towards a series of phase-transitions with
appropriate organic replacements 'taking-over' its functions.

plasma-to-cyclotron frequency. Thus, growth rates of microinstabilities are
changed by the ion-to-electron mass ratio, even with the same Mach number and
plasma beta. The present two-dimensional simulations show that the electron
cyclotron drift instability is dominant for a lower mass ratio, and
electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic waves are excited. For a higher mass

in the OMC-2/3 region, MMS 6, has been observed in the 850 um continuum
emission with approximately 10 times better angular resolution than previous
studies (~0.3""; ~120 AU at Orion). The deconvolved size, the mass, and the
column density of MMS 6-main are estimated to be 0.32""x0.29"" (132 AUx120 AU),
0.29 Mo, and 2.1x10^{25} cm^{-2}, respectively. The estimated extremely high
mean number density, 1.5x10^{10} cm^{-3}, suggests that MMS 6-main is likely
optically thick at 850 um. We compare our observational data with three
theoretical core models: prestellar core, protostellar core + disk-like
structure, and first adiabatic core. These comparisons clearly show that the
observational data cannot be modeled as a simple prestellar core with a gas
temperature of 20 K. A self-luminous source is necessary to explain the
observed flux density in the (sub)millimeter wavelengths. Our recent detection
of a very compact and energetic outflow in the CO (3-2) and HCN (4-3) lines,
supports the presence of a protostar. We suggest that MMS 6 is one of the first
cases of an intermediate mass protostellar core at an extremely young stage. In
addition to the MMS 6-main peak, we have also spatially resolved a number of
spiky structures and sub-clumps, distributed over the central 1000 AU. The
masses of these sub-clumps are estimated to be 0.066-0.073 Mo, which are on the
order of brown dwarf masses. Higher angular resolution and higher sensitivity
observations with ALMA and EVLA will reveal the origin and nature of these
structures such as whether they are originated from fragmentations, spiral
arms, or inhomogeneity within the disk-like structures/envelope.
