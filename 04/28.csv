and prove that a large deviation principle holds for the spectral measures. The
rate function is associated to a vector equilibrium problem coming from
logarithmic potential theory, which in our case is a quadratic map involving
the logarithmic energies, or Voiculescu's entropies, of two measures in the
presence of an external field and an upper constraint. The proof is based on a
two type particles Coulomb gas representation for the eigenvalue distribution,
which gives a new insight on why such variational problems should describe the
limiting spectral distribution. This representation is available because of a
Nikishin structure satisfied by the weights of the multiple orthogonal
polynomials hidden in the background.

suspensions show an abrupt solidification transition after a long delay time
tc. We measure the dependence of tc on stress amplitude, frequency, and on the
age-dependent initial loss modulus. At first sight our observations appear
quantitatively consistent with a simple soft-glassy rheology (SGR)-type model,
in which barrier crossings by mesoscopic elements are purely strain-induced.
For a given strain amplitude {\gamma}0 each element can be classified as fluid
or solid according to whether its local yield strain exceeds {\gamma}0. Each
cycle, the barrier heights E of yielded elements are reassigned according to a
fixed prior distribution {\rho}(E): this fixes the per-cycle probability
R({\gamma}0) of a fluid elements becoming solid. As the fraction of solid
elements builds up, {\gamma}0 falls (at constant stress amplitude), so
R({\gamma}0) increases. This positive feedback accounts for the sudden
solidification after a long delay. The model thus appears to directly link
macroscopic rheology with mesoscopic barrier height statistics: within its
precepts, our data point towards a power law for {\rho}(E) rather than the
exponential form usually assumed in SGR. However, despite this apparent
success, closer investigation shows that the assumptions of the model cannot be
reconciled with the extremely large strain amplitudes arising in our
experiments. The quantitative explanation of delayed solidification in Laponite
therefore remains an open theoretical challenge.

The system is a two-dimensional nonlinear Langevin equation involving a
dissipative, non-potential force, which has the essential effect of creating a
line of stable fixed points (attracting line) touching a line of unstable fixed
points (repelling line). Using different analytical and numerical techniques,
we show that the stationary distribution of this system satisfies in the
low-noise limit a large deviation principle containing two competing terms: i)
a classical but sub-dominant large deviation term, which can be derived from
the Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations by studying the fluctuation
paths or instantons of the system near the attracting line, and ii) a dominant
large deviation term, which does not follow from the Freidlin-Wentzell theory,
as it is related to fluctuation paths of zero action, referred to as
sub-instantons, emanating from the repelling line. We discuss the nature of
these sub-instantons, and show how they arise from the connection between the
attracting and repelling lines. We also discuss in a more general way how we
expect these to arise in more general stochastic systems having connected sets
of stable and unstable fixed points, and how they should determine the large
deviation properties of these systems.

the phase diagram of this model and its critical indices both on annealed and
quenched networks. To uncover the phase diagram of the model we use the tools
of heterogeneous mean-field calculations for the annealed networks and the most
advanced techniques of quantum cavity methods for the quenched networks. The
phase diagram of the dynamical process depends on the temperature T, the
coupling constant J and on the value of the branching ratio <k(k-1)>/<k> where
k is the degree of the nodes in the network. For fixed value of the coupling
the critical temperature increases linearly with the branching ration which
diverges with the increasing cutoff value \xi or value of the \gamma exponent
\gamma< 3. This result suggests that the fractal disorder of the
superconducting material can be responsible for an enhancement of the
superconducting critical temperature. At low temperature and low couplings T<<1
and J<<1, instead, we observe a different behavior for annealed and quenched
networks. In the annealed networks there is no phase transition at zero
temperature while on quenched network we observe a Griffith phase dominated by
extremely rare events and a phase transition at zero temperature. The Griffiths
critical region, nevertheless, is decreasing in size with increasing value of
the cutoff \xi of the degree distribution for values of the \gamma exponents

suggested, although more observations are needed. An assessment of our errors
and scatter in the radial velocity points hints at the presence of stellar
radial velocity variations. Of our sample of 7 stars, 2 show radial velocity
signals at 6-sigma and 10-sigma of the cross correlation uncertainties. If the
signals are planetary in origin, our findings are consistent with estimates of
Neptune mass planets that predict a frequency of 13 - 27 per cent for early M
dwarfs.Our current analysis indicates the we can achieve a sensitivity that is
equivalent to the amplitude induced by a 6 M_Earth planet orbiting in the
habitable zone. Based on simulations, we estimate that <10 M_Earth habitable
zone planets will be detected in a new stellar mass regime, with <=20 epochs of
observations.

unexpected spectral features between 200 GeV and 100 TeV. They could be due to
the presence of nearby and young cosmic ray sources. This can be studied in the
myriad model, in which cosmic rays diffuse from point-like instantaneous
sources located randomly throughout the Galaxy. To test this hypothesis, one
must compute the flux due to a catalog of local sources, but also the error
bars associated to this quantity. This turns out not to be as straightforward
as it seems, as the standard deviation is infinite when computed for the most
general statistical ensemble. The goals of this paper are to provide a method
to associate error bars to the flux measurements which has a clear statistical
meaning, and to explore the relation between the myriad model and the more
usual source model based on a continuous distribution. To this end, we show
that the quantiles of the flux distribution are well-defined, even though the
standard deviation is infinite. They can be used to compute 68% confidence
levels, for instance. We also use the fact that local sources have known
positions and ages to reduce the statistical ensemble from which random sources
are drawn in the myriad model. We present a method to evaluate meaningful error

Current intensity-based registration algorithms, such as demons, may fail in
the context of CT-CBCT DIR because of inconsistent intensities between the two
modalities. In this paper, we propose a variant of demons, called Deformation
with Intensity Simultaneously Corrected (DISC), to deal with CT-CBCT DIR. DISC
distinguishes itself from the original demons algorithm by performing an
adaptive intensity correction step on the CBCT image at every iteration step of
the demons registration. Specifically, the intensity correction of a voxel in
CBCT is achieved by matching the first and the second moments of the voxel
intensities inside a patch around the voxel with those on the CT image. It is
expected that such a strategy can remove artifacts in the CBCT image, as well
as ensuring the intensity consistency between the two modalities. DISC is
implemented on computer graphics processing units (GPUs) in compute unified
device architecture (CUDA) programming environment. The performance of DISC is
evaluated on a simulated patient case and six clinical head-and-neck cancer
patient data. It is found that DISC is robust against the CBCT artifacts and
intensity inconsistency and significantly improves the registration accuracy

photometry measurements from HST/NICMOS, SIRIUS, 2MASS, Spitzer/IRAC, and
Chandra X-ray observations. We correct for extinctions toward individual stars,
improve the Pa-a line equivalent width measurements, quantify the substantial
mid-IR dust emission associated with WC stars, and find X-ray counterparts. In
the process, we identify 10 foreground sources, some of which may be nearby
cataclysmic variables. The WN stars in the Arches and Central clusters show
correlations between the Pa-a equivalent width and the adjacent continuum
emission. However, the WN stars in the latter cluster are systematically dimmer
than those in the Arches cluster, presumably due to the different ages of the
two clusters. In the EW-magnitude plot, WNL stars, WC stars and OB supergiants
roughly fall into three distinct regions. We estimate that the dust mass
associated with individual WC stars in the Quintuplet cluster can reach 1e-5 M,
or more than one order of magnitude larger than previous estimates. Thus WC
stars could be a significant source of dust in the galaxies of the early
universe. Nearly half of the evolved massive stars in the GC are located
outside the three known massive stellar clusters. The ionization of several
compact HII regions can be accounted for by their enclosed individual evolved
massive stars, which thus likely formed in isolation or in small groups.

This can be matched to the free spectral range of the optical cavity, such that
the mechanical oscillator will resonantly couple cavity modes at different

quantum ground state of motion can be reached with conventional refrigeration
techniques. Estimation of the coupling strength with realistic parameters
suggests that optomechanical effects can be observable with this dilational
mode. It is shown how this system can be used as a quantum limited optical
amplifier. The dilational motion can also lead to quantum correlations between
cavity modes at different frequencies, which is quantified with an
experimentally accessible two-mode squeezing spectrum. Finally, an explicit

We investigate the heating effect of NGC6611 on the entire M16 star-forming
complex seen by Herschel including the diffuse cloud environment and the dense
filamentary structures identified in this region. In addition, we interpret the
three-dimensional geometry of M16 with respect to the nebula, its surrounding
environment, and the NGC6611 cavity. The dust temperature and column density
maps reveal a prominent eastern filament running north-south and away from the
high-mass star-forming central region and the NGC6611 cluster, as well as a
northern filament which extends around and away from the cluster. The dust
temperature in each of these filaments decreases with increasing distance from
the NGC6611 cluster, indicating a heating penetration depth of \sim 10 pc in

that in high-mass star-forming regions OB clusters impact the temperature of
future star-forming sites, modifying the initial conditions for collapse and
effecting the evolutionary criteria of protostars developed from spectral
energy distributions. Possible scenarios for the origin of the morphology seen

squeezed limit of the primordial bispectrum which smoothly interpolates between
the local and equilateral models. This dependence is directly related to the
mass of the isocurvatons in the theory which is determined by the
supersymmetry. Therefore, in the event of detection of a non-zero primordial
bispectrum, additional constraints on the parameter controlling the
momentum-dependence in the squeezed limit becomes an important question. We
explore the effects of these non-Gaussian initial conditions on large-scale
structure and the cosmic microwave background, with particular attention to the
galaxy power spectrum at large scales and scale-dependence corrections to
galaxy bias. We determine the simultaneous constraints on the two parameters
describing the QSF bispectrum that we can expect from upcoming large-scale
structure and cosmic microwave background observations. We find that for
relatively large values of the non-Gaussian amplitude parameters, but still
well within current uncertainties, galaxy power spectrum measurements will be
able to distinguish the QSF scenario from the predictions of the local model. A
CMB likelihood analysis, as well as Fisher matrix analysis, shows that there is
also a range of parameter values for which Planck data may be able distinguish
between QSF models and the related local and equilateral shapes. Given the
different observational weightings of the CMB and LSS results, degeneracies can
be significantly reduced in a joint analysis.

generation gas from outgassing of planetesimals and dust grains via

ratio close to unity, where hydrodynamics cannot be ignored. A clumping
instability exists in this configuration, that has been hitherto explored only
in one-dimensional, incompressible models. We performed 2D numerical
compressible models of a disk with comparable amounts of gas and dust to study
the growth and development of this instability. Our model solves the momentum
equation for the gas and dust, together with energy and continuity equations.
We uncover that the backreaction of the drag force from the gas onto the dust
shepherds rings, similar to those observed in debris disks and usually
attributed to the presence of hypothetical undetected planets. We also uncover
that the eccentricity of these rings, usually presented as convincing evidence
for the presence of a planet, can actually be simply explained by a standing
wave propagating along the ring. The rings support a spectrum of oscillations,
with one particular mode representing epicyclic motion. The apparent
eccentricity matches the eccentricity in observed systems. This suggests that
the planet possibility, though thrilling, is not necessarily required to
explain these systems.

among different shapes. In particular, we ask whether it can constrain the
behavior of the primordial three-point function in the squeezed limit where one
of the momenta is much smaller than the other two. This is potentially
interesting since the observation of a three-point function with a squeezed
limit that does not go like the local nor equilateral templates would be a
signal of non-trivial dynamics during inflation. To this end we use the
quasi-single field inflation model of Chen and Wang as a representative
two-parameter model, where one parameter governs the amplitude of
non-Gaussianity and the other the shape. We also perform a model-independent
analysis by parametrizing the scale-dependent bias as a power-law on large
scales, where the power is to be constrained from observations. We find that
proposed large-scale structure surveys (with characteristics similar to the
dark energy task force stage IV surveys) have the potential to distinguish
among the squeezed limit behavior of different bispectrum shapes for a wide
range of fiducial model parameters. Thus the halo bias can help discriminate

with microbes are a powerful tool to study mutations and natural selection.
These experiments, however, are often limited to the well-mixed environments of
a test tube or a chemostat. Since spatial organization can significantly affect
evolutionary dynamics, the need is growing for evolutionary experiments in
spatially structured environments. The surface of a Petri dish provides such an
environment, but a more detailed understanding of microbial growth on Petri
dishes is necessary to interpret such experiments. We formulate a simple
deterministic reaction-diffusion model, which successfully predicts the spatial
patterns created by two competing species during colony expansion. We also
derive the shape of these patterns analytically without relying on microscopic
details of the model. In particular, we find that the relative fitness of two
microbial strains can be estimated from the logarithmic spirals created by
selective sweeps. The theory is tested with strains of the budding yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for spatial competitions with different initial
conditions and for a range of relative fitnesses. The reaction-diffusion model
also connects the microscopic parameters like growth rates and diffusion
constants with macroscopic spatial patterns and predicts the relationship
between fitness in liquid cultures and on Petri dishes, which we confirmed
experimentally. Spatial sector patterns therefore provide an alternative
fitness assay to the commonly used liquid culture fitness assays.

correlation among the mass of the partners and the one of the Higgs boson.
Because of this correlation, the presence of light partners could be essential
to obtain a realistic Higgs mass.
  We quantitatively confirm this generic prediction, which applies to a broad
class of composite Higgs models, by studying the simplest calculable framework
with a composite Higgs, the Discrete Composite Higgs Model. In this setup we
show analytically that the requirement of a light enough Higgs strongly
constraints the fermionic spectrum and makes the light partners appear.
  The light top partners thus provide the most promising manifestation of the
composite Higgs scenario at the LHC. Conversely, the lack of observation of
these states can put strong restrictions on the parameter space of the model. A
simple analysis of the 7-TeV LHC searches presently available already gives
some non-trivial constraint. The strongest bound comes from the exclusion of
the 5/3-charged partner. Even if no dedicated LHC search exists for this

distinguishing characteristic of the new method is that the optimization can be
exploited also during the nondeterministic phase. In particular, after some
assumptions have been made during the computation, parts of the program may
become irrelevant to a query under these assumptions. This allows for dynamic
pruning of the search space. In contrast, the effect of the previously defined
MS methods for disjunctive Datalog is limited to the deterministic portion of
the process. In this way, the potential performance gain by using the proposed
method can be exponential, as could be observed empirically.
  The correctness of MS is established thanks to a strong relationship between
MS and unfounded sets that has not been studied in the literature before. This
knowledge allows for extending the method also to programs with stratified
negation in a natural way.
  The proposed method has been implemented in DLV and various experiments have
been conducted. Experimental results on synthetic data confirm the utility of
MS for disjunctive Datalog, and they highlight the computational gain that may
be obtained by the new method w.r.t. the previously proposed MS methods for
disjunctive Datalog programs. Further experiments on real-world data show the
benefits of MS within an application scenario that has received considerable
attention in recent years, the problem of answering user queries over possibly
inconsistent databases originating from integration of autonomous sources of
information.

strategy involves a modified Gaussian MAC, where the relay decodes the XOR of
the two messages using the naturally-occurring sum of symbols simultaneously
transmitted by user nodes. In this work, we consider the Gaussian MAC in
bidirectional relaying with an additional secrecy constraint for protection
against a honest but curious relay. The constraint is that, while the relay
should decode the XOR, it should be fully ignorant of the individual messages
of the users. We exploit the symbol addition that occurs in a Gaussian MAC to
design explicit strategies that achieve perfect independence between the
received symbols and individual transmitted messages. Our results actually hold
for a more general scenario where the messages at the two user nodes come from
a finite Abelian group, and the relay must decode the sum within the group of
the two messages. We provide a lattice coding strategy and study optimal rate

  In this work, conformal transformations and ghosts will be analyzed in the
framework of the metric-affine theory of gravity. Within this framework, metric
and connection are independent variables, and hence, transform independently
under conformal transformations. It will be shown that, if affine connection is
invariant under conformal transformations then the scalar field under concern
is a non-ghost, non-dynamical field. It is an auxiliary field at the classical
level, and might develop a kinetic term at the quantum level.
  Alternatively, if connection transforms additively with a structure similar
to yet more general than that of the Levi-Civita connection, the resulting
action describes the gravitational dynamics correctly, and more importantly,
the scalar field becomes a dynamical non-ghost field. The equations of motion,
for generic geometrical and matter-sector variables, do not reduce connection
to the Levi-Civita connection, and hence, independence of connection from
metric is maintained. Therefore, metric-affine gravity provides an arena in
which ghosts arising from conformal factor are avoided thanks to the
independence of connection from the metric.

(CBCT) related research projects. A projection image contains primary signal,
scatter signal, and noise. It is computationally demanding to perform accurate
and realistic computations for all of these components. In this work, we
develop a package on GPU, called gDRR, for the accurate and efficient
computations of x-ray projection images in CBCT under clinically realistic
conditions. The primary signal is computed by a tri-linear ray-tracing
algorithm. A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is then performed, yielding the
primary signal and the scatter signal, both with noise. A denoising process is
applied to obtain a smooth scatter signal. The noise component is then obtained
by combining the difference between the MC primary and the ray-tracing primary
signals, and the difference between the MC simulated scatter and the denoised
scatter signals. Finally, a calibration step converts the calculated noise
signal into a realistic one by scaling its amplitude. For a typical CBCT
projection with a poly-energetic spectrum, the calculation time for the primary
signal is 1.2~2.3 sec, while the MC simulations take 28.1~95.3 sec. Computation
time for all other steps is negligible. The ray-tracing primary signal matches
well with the primary part of the MC simulation result. The MC simulated
scatter signal using gDRR is in agreement with EGSnrc results with a relative
difference of 3.8%. A noise calibration process is conducted to calibrate gDRR
against a real CBCT scanner. The calculated projections are accurate and
realistic, such that beam-hardening artifacts and scatter artifacts can be
reproduced using the simulated projections. The noise amplitudes in the CBCT
images reconstructed from the simulated projections also agree with those in
the measured images at corresponding mAs levels.

scalar field possessing a non-minimal kinetic coupling to the curvature. It is
shown that the kinetic coupling provides an essentially new inflationary
mechanism. Namely, at early cosmological times the domination of coupling terms
in the field equations guarantees the quasi-De Sitter behavior of the scale
factor: $a(t)\propto e^{H_{\kappa} t}$ with $H_\kappa=1/\sqrt{9\kappa}$, where
$\kappa\simeq 10^{-74}$ sec$^2$ is the coupling parameter. The primary
inflationary epoch driven by non-minimal kinetic coupling comes to the end at
$t_f \simeq 10^{-35}$ sec. Later on, the matter terms are dominating, and the
universe enters into the matter-dominated epoch which lasts approximately
$0.5H_0^{-1}\sim 0.5\times10^{18}$ sec. Then, the cosmological term comes into
play, and the universe enters into the secondary inflationary epoch with
$a(t)\propto e^{H_{\Lambda} t}$, where $H_\Lambda=\sqrt{\Lambda/3}$. Note that
the present value of the acceleration parameter $q=\ddot a a/\dot a^2$ is
estimated as $q_0\simeq0.25$, that is the universe is at the beginning of the
epoch of accelerated expansion. Thus, the cosmological model non-minimal
kinetic coupling represents the realistic cosmological scenario which
successfully describes basic cosmological epochs and provide the natural
mechanism of epoch change without any fine-tuned potential.

Classicalization in theories with derivatively-coupled scalars. We observe that
the information about the UV-completion road is encoded in the sign of the
derivative terms. We note that the sign of the derivative couplings for which
there is no consistent Wilsonian UV-completion is the one that allows for
consistent classicalons. This is an indication that for such a sign the vertex
must be treated as fundamental and the theory self-protects against potential
inconsistencies, such as superluminality, via self-completion by
classicalization. Applying this reasoning to the UV-completion of the Standard
Model, we see that the information about the Higgs versus classicalization is
encoded in the sign of the scattering amplitude of longitudinal W-bosons.
Negative sign excludes Higgs or any other weakly-coupled Wilsonian physics.

coherent structures in two-dimensional inviscid turbulence: while the
fine-grained vorticity field, described by the Euler equation, becomes more and
more filamented through time, its dynamical evolution is constrained by some
global conservation laws (energy, Casimir invariants). As a consequence, the
coarse-grained vorticity field can be predicted through standard statistical
mechanics arguments (relying on the Hamiltonian structure of the
two-dimensional Euler flow), for any given set of the integral constraints.
  It has been suggested that the theory applies equally well to geophysical
turbulence; specifically in the case of the quasi-geostrophic equations, with
potential vorticity playing the role of the advected quantity. In this study,
we demonstrate analytically that the Miller-Robert-Sommeria theory leads to
non-trivial statistical equilibria for quasi-geostrophic flows on a rotating
sphere, with or without bottom topography. We first consider flows without
bottom topography and with an infinite Rossby deformation radius, with and
without conservation of angular momentum. When the conservation of angular
momentum is taken into account, we report a case of second order phase
transition associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. In a second step, we
treat the general case of a flow with an arbitrary bottom topography and a
finite Rossby deformation radius. Previous studies were restricted to flows in
a planar domain with fixed or periodic boundary conditions with a beta-effect.
  In these different cases, we are able to classify the statistical equilibria
for the large-scale flow through their sole macroscopic features. We build the
phase diagrams of the system and discuss the relations of the various
statistical ensembles.

a continuous challenge. For instance, one key motivator for kids is the ability
to entertain their friends. Another success factor is the ability to learn from
and cooperate with other children. In this short position paper we attempt at
identifying the requirements for the success of such an online community, both
from the point of view of the kids as well as of their parents, and at finding
ways to make it attractive for both.

radiation (CMB) data, we investigate locally rotational symmetric (LRS) Bianchi
type I spacetimes with non-minimally coupled scalar fields. To single out
potentially more interesting solutions, we search for Noether symmetry in this
system. We then specialize to the Brans-Dicke (BD) field in such a way that the
Lagrangian becomes degenerate (nontrivial) and solve the equations for Noether
symmetry and the potential that allows it. Then we find the exact solutions of
the equations of motion in terms of three parameters and an arbitrary function.
We illustrate with families of examples designed to be generalizations of the
well-known power-expansion, exponential expansion and Big Rip models in the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) framework. The solutions display surprising
variation, a large subset of which features late-time acceleration as is
usually ascribed to dark energy (phantom or quintensence), and is consistent
with observational data.

deterministic nature of the game of roulette for profit. Moreover, through its
history the inherent determinism in the game of roulette has attracted the
attention of many luminaries of chaos theory. In this paper we provide a short
review of that history and then set out to determine to what extent that
determinism can really be exploited for profit. To do this, we provide a very
simple model for the motion of a roulette wheel and ball and demonstrate that
knowledge of initial position, velocity and acceleration is sufficient to
predict the outcome with adequate certainty to achieve a positive expected
return. We describe two physically realisable systems to obtain this knowledge
both incognito and {\em in situ}. The first system relies only on a mechanical
count of rotation of the ball and the wheel to measure the relevant parameters.
By applying this techniques to a standard casino-grade European roulette wheel
we demonstrate an expected return of at least 18%, well above the -2.7%
expected of a random bet. With a more sophisticated, albeit more intrusive,
system (mounting a digital camera above the wheel) we demonstrate a range of
systematic and statistically significant biases which can be exploited to
provide an improved guess of the outcome. Finally, our analysis demonstrates
that even a very slight slant in the roulette table leads to a very pronounced
bias which could be further exploited to substantially enhance returns.

Hall C at Jefferson Lab are presented. For the existing HMS and SOS
spectrometers design considerations, relevant construction information, and
comparisons of simulated and experimental results are included. The energy
resolution of the HMS and SOS calorimeters is better than $\sigma/E \sim
6%/\sqrt E $, and pion/electron ($\pi/e$) separation of about 100:1 has been
achieved in energy range 1 -- 5 GeV. Good agreement has been observed between
the experimental and simulated energy resolutions, but simulations
systematically exceed experimentally determined $\pi^-$ suppression factors by
close to a factor of two. For the SHMS spectrometer presently under
construction details on the design and accompanying GEANT4 simulation efforts
are given. The anticipated performance of the new calorimeter is predicted over
the full momentum range of the SHMS. Good electron/hadron separation is
anticipated by combining the energy deposited in an initial (preshower)
calorimeter layer with the total energy deposited in the calorimeter.
