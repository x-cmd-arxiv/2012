  Opportunities to Synthesize Ceramic Materials at High Pressures","30 PAGES, 10 FIGURES",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis investigates a transformation path between the Th3P4-type and the
spinel-type structures of hafnium (IV) and titanium (IV) nitride, M3N4 (M = Hf,
Ti) with computational methods. For both compounds, the Th3P4-type was
synthesized experimentally at high-pressure conditions and was quenched to
ambient conditions. Computations reveal that while at high pressure Th3P4-type
structures are favored by enthalpy, at low pressure the Th3P4-type is only
meta-stable. The spinel-type is energetically more favorable at zero pressure
than the Th3P4- type in both systems. However, even the spinel-type is
surpassed by another ground state modification for both Hf3N4 and Ti3N4. The
research presented in this thesis then addresses (i) thermal stability of the
Th3P4 polymorphs and (ii) the conditions necessary to synthesize spinel-type
structures of both compounds. The foundation for the study is a simple
structural relation between Th3P4-type and the spinel-type structures: while
the Th3P4-type is based on a body-centered cubic arrangement of anions with
cations in interstitial sites, the spinel-type is best described by a
face-centered cubic arrangement of anions with cations in interstitial sites.
With anions following the Bain path of the bcc-fcc transformation, and cations
undergoing a minor shuffle distortion, the Th3P4 to spinel transformation
parallels the martensitic transformation known in many metal systems -- only
with additional cations in the structure.

least $k-1$. A function $f:V\rightarrow \{-1,1\}$ is called a \emph{signed
$k$-dominating function} of $G$ if $\sum_{u\in N_G[v]}f(u)\geq k$ for all $v\in
V$. The \emph{signed $k$-domination number} of $G$ is the minimum value of
$\sum_{v\in V}f(v)$ taken over all signed $k$-dominating functions of $G$. The
\emph{signed total $k$-dominating function} and \emph{signed total
$k$-domination number} of $G$ can be similarly defined by changing the closed
neighborhood $N_G[v]$ to the open neighborhood $N_G(v)$ in the definition. The
\emph{upper signed $k$-domination number} is the maximum value of $\sum_{v\in
V}f(v)$ taken over all \emph{minimal} signed $k$-dominating functions of $G$.
In this paper, we study these graph parameters from both algorithmic complexity
and graph-theoretic perspectives. We prove that for every fixed $k\geq 1$, the
problems of computing these three parameters are all \NP-hard. We also present
sharp lower bounds on the signed $k$-domination number and signed total
$k$-domination number for general graphs in terms of their minimum and maximum
degrees, generalizing several known results about signed domination.

Swift X-ray observations of the outburst decay of the transient black hole
candidate MAXI J1659-152 in 2011. We discuss the distance to the source taking
the high inclination into account and we conclude that the source distance is
probably 6+-2 kpc. The lowest observed flux corresponds to a luminosity of
2x10^31 (d/6 kpc)^2 erg/s This, together with the orbital period of 2.4 hr
reported in the literature, suggests that the quiescent X-ray luminosity is
higher than predicted on the basis of the orbital period -- quiescent X-ray
luminosity relationship. The relation between the accretion and ejection
mechanisms can be studied using the observed correlation between the radio and
X-ray luminosities as these evolve over an outburst. We determine the behaviour
of MAXI J1659-152 in the radio -- X-ray diagram at low X-ray luminosities using
the observations reported in this paper and at high X-ray luminosities using
values reported in the literature. At high X-ray luminosities the source lies
closer to the sources that follow a correlation index steeper than 0.6-0.7.
However, when compared to other sources that follow a steeper correlation
index, the X-ray luminosity in MAXI J1659-152 is also lower. The latter can
potentially be explained by the high inclination of MAXI J1659-152 if the X-ray
emission comes from close to the source and the radio emission is originating
in a more extended region. However, it is probable that the source was not in
the canonical low-hard state during these radio observations and this may
affect the behaviour of the source as well. At intermediate X-ray luminosities
the source makes the transition from the radio underluminous sources in the
direction of the relation traced by the 'standard' correlation similar to what
has been reported for H1743-322. (abridged)

with respect to the interstellar medium. These stars can produce bowshocks in
the surrounding gas. Bowshocks develop as arc-shaped structures, with bows
pointing to the same direction as the stellar velocity, while the star moves
supersonically through the interstellar gas. The piled-up shocked matter emits
thermal radiation and a population of locally accelerated relativistic
particles is expected to produce non-thermal emission over a wide range of
energies. We aim to model the non-thermal radiation produced in these sources.
Under some assumptions, we computed the non-thermal emission produced by the
relativistic particles and the thermal radiation caused by free-free
interactions, for O4I and O9I stars. We applied our model to Zeta Oph (HD
149757), an intensively studied massive star seen from the northern hemisphere.
This star has spectral type O9.5V and is a well-known runaway. Spectral energy
distributions of massive runaways are predicted for the whole electromagnetic
spectrum. We conclude that the non-thermal radiation might be detectable at
various energy bands for relatively nearby runaway stars, especially at
high-energy gamma rays. Inverse Compton scattering with photons from the heated
dust gives the most important contribution to the high-energy spectrum. This
emission approaches Fermi sensitivities in the case of Zeta Oph.

sensors' energy efficiency are both relevant and conflicting issues. Therefore,
it is important to operate the wireless body-area sensor network at some

curve is a function of the employed physical-layer protocol: in particular, it
depends on the multiple-access scheme and on the coding and modulation schemes

widely-used Bluetooth standard. First, we consider the calculation of the

guarantees the stability of all transmission queues in the network. Then, we
apply the general theory developed by Neely to develop a dynamic scheduling

adaptively switches between connected and disconnected (sleeping) modes. We
demonstrate that the proposed policy can achieve significant gains in the

uses this quantum calculus locally, i.e. for each context corresponding to a
measurement, and for its real version it does not need the property of
'linearity of the set of states' to model the quantum effect. In this sense,
QMod is a generalization of quantum mechanics, similar to how the general
relativity manifold mathematical formalism is a generalization of special
relativity. We prove by means of a representation theorem that QMod can be used
for any entity entailing the typical quantum effects mentioned above. Some
examples of application of QMod in concept theory and macroscopic physics are
also considered.

high-redshift galaxies at z>=6 using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We
find that, even though individual galaxies have bursty SFH, the averaged SFH
between z~15 to z=6 can be characterized well by either an exponentially
increasing functional form with characteristic time-scales of 70 Myr to 200 Myr
for galaxies with stellar masses Ms~10^6 Msun to >10^10 Msun respectively, or
by a simple power-law form which exhibits a similar mass dependent time-scales.
Using the SFH of individual galaxies, we measure the duty cycle of star
formation (DC_SFH); i.e., the fraction of time a galaxy of a particular mass
spends above a star formation rate (SFR) threshold which would make it
observable to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during a given epoch. We also
examine the fraction of galaxies at a given redshift that are brighter than a
rest-frame UV magnitude (Muv ~ -18), which is sufficient enough to make them
observable (DC_Muv). We find that both DC_SFH and DC_Muv make a sharp
transition from zero (for galaxies with Ms <= 10^7 Msun) to unity (for Ms >
10^9 Msun). The measured duty cycle is also manifested in the intrinsic scatter
in the Ms-SFR relationship (~ 1 dex) and Ms-Muv relationship (\Delta Muv ~ +-1
mag). We provide analytic fits to the DC as a function of Ms using a sigmoid
function, which can be used to correct for catalogue incompleteness. We
consider the effects of duty cycle to the observational estimate of galaxy
stellar mass functions (GSMF) and the star formation rate density (SFRD), and
find that it results in a much shallower low-mass end slopes of the GSMF and a
reduction of >~ 70% of our intrinsic SFRD, making our simulation results more
compatible with observational estimates.

power flow (OPF) that consists of two relaxation steps. The first step
eliminates the voltage and current angles and the second step approximates the
resulting problem by a conic program that can be solved efficiently. For radial
networks, we prove that both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there
are no upper bounds on loads. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always
exact but the angle relaxation may not be exact, and we provide a simple way to
determine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We propose convexification
of mesh networks using phase shifters so that OPF for the convexified network
can always be solved efficiently for an optimal solution. We prove that
convexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the
network and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power
flows, generation, loads, or operating constraints. Part I introduces our

NP-hard in most cases. In this work we propose a multiscale framework for
coping with the NP-hardness of discrete optimization. Our approach utilizes
algebraic multiscale principles to efficiently explore the discrete solution
space, yielding improved results on challenging, non-submodular energies for
which current methods provide unsatisfactory approximations. In contrast to
popular multiscale methods in computer vision, that builds an image pyramid,
our framework acts directly on the energy to construct an energy pyramid.
Deriving a multiscale scheme from the energy itself makes our framework
application independent and widely applicable. Our framework gives rise to two
complementary energy coarsening strategies: one in which coarser scales involve
fewer variables, and a more revolutionary one in which the coarser scales
involve fewer discrete labels. We empirically evaluated our unified framework
on a variety of both non-submodular and submodular energies, including energies
from Middlebury benchmark.

radial distribution of the dusty accreting material in AGNs at sub-pc scales.
We currently focus on Type 1 AGNs, where the innermost region is unobscured and
its intrinsic structure can be studied directly. As a first systematic study of
Type 1s, we obtained mid-/near-IR data for small samples over ~3-4 orders of
magnitudes in UV luminosity L of the central engine. Here we effectively trace
the structure by observing dust grains that are radiatively heated by the
central engine. Consistent with a naive expectation for such dust grains, the
dust sublimation radius R_in is in fact empirically known to be scaling with
L^1/2 from the near-IR reverberation measurements, and this is also supported
by our near-IR interferometry. Utilizing this empirical relationship, we
normalize the radial extent by R_in and eliminate the simple L^1/2 scaling for
a direct comparison over the samples. We then find that, in the mid-IR, the
overall size in units of R_in seems to become more compact in higher luminosity
sources. More specifically, the mid-IR brightness distribution is rather well
described by a power-law, and this power-law becomes steeper in higher
luminosity objects. The near-IR flux does not seem to be a simple inward
extrapolation of the mid-IR power-law component toward shorter wavelengths, but
it rather comes from a little distinct brightness concentration at the inner
rim region of the dust distribution. Its structure is not well constrained yet,
but there is tentative evidence that this inner near-IR-emitting structure has
a steeper radial distribution in jet-launching objects. All these should be
scrutinized with further observations.

time-dependent shaped selective radiofrequency pulse. The derivation is built
on the same scheme as the Maricq's (J. Chem. Phys. 86 (1987) 5647). It is shown
that the criterion depends only upon amplitude of the time-dependent field
applied to the system, and the Magnus expansion converges and the Magnus
solution exists when the flip angle of a non-negative-amplitude shaped RF pulse
or a weak-amplitude shaped pulse is smaller than 2pi. The exponential
propagator then can be decomposed into a product of a series of elementary
propagators and can be used to determine time evolution of the spin system
under the shaped pulse. The linear differential equations to determine the
unknown parameters in the Magnus solution are obtained explicitly. An
alternative propagator in an expansion form for the Magnus solution is also
proposed to describe the time evolution when the criterion is not met.

elemental electric dipole at an arbitrary location above the PEC plane. The
full wave problem, for arbitrary widths of the strip, is solved by means of a
mode matching approach and expansion of the strip surface current into
Chebyshev polynomials. For narrow strips, an approximate method using only
longitudinal currents is derived, and compared numerically with the full wave
method. Utilizing the concept of equivalent radius, the approximate method for
narrow strips is evaluated numerically against results for thin circular wires.
It is concluded that the approximate method is suitable for handling multiple
wires in layered structures, wherefore the method has potential usefulness for
estimating long range propagation of high frequency waves in wire structures
like power lines and railway feeding systems, containing over-head wires and
wires submerged into ground.

and natural selection. These experiments, however, are often limited to the
well-mixed environments of a test tube or a chemostat. Since spatial
organization can significantly affect evolutionary dynamics, the need is
growing for evolutionary experiments in spatially structured environments. The
surface of a Petri dish provides such an environment, but a more detailed
understanding of microbial growth on Petri dishes is necessary to interpret
such experiments. We formulate a simple deterministic reaction-diffusion model,
which successfully predicts the spatial patterns created by two competing
species during colony expansion. We also derive the shape of these patterns
analytically without relying on microscopic details of the model. In
particular, we find that the relative fitness of two microbial strains can be
estimated from the logarithmic spirals created by selective sweeps. The theory
is tested with strains of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for
spatial competitions with different initial conditions and for a range of
relative fitnesses. The reaction-diffusion model also connects the microscopic
parameters like growth rates and diffusion constants with macroscopic spatial
patterns and predicts the relationship between fitness in liquid cultures and
on Petri dishes, which we confirmed experimentally. Spatial sector patterns
therefore provide an alternative fitness assay to the commonly used liquid
culture fitness assays.

measures on the circle group that are weak star limits of squared moduli of
trigonometric polynomials with frequencies in F. Fourier transforms of these
measures are positive and supported in F - F but the converse generally fails.
The characteristic function chiF of F is a binary sequence whose orbit closure
gives a symbolic dynamical system O(F). Analytic properties of S(F) are related
to dynamical properties of chiF. The Riemann-Lebesque lemma implies that if
chiF is minimal, then S(F) is convex and hence S(F) is the closure of the
convex hull of its extreme points Se(F). In this paper we (i) review the
relationship between these concepts and the special case of the still open 1959
Kadison-Singer problem called Feichtinger's conjecture for exponential
functions, (ii) partially characterize of elements in Se(F), for minimal chiF,
in terms of ergodic properties of (O(F),lambda) where lambda is a shift
invariant probability measure whose existence in ensured by the 1937
Krylov-Bogoyubov theorem, (iii) refine previous numerical studies of the
Morse-Thue minimal binary sequence by exploiting a new MATLAB algorithm for
computing smallest eigenvalues of 4,000,000 x 4,000,000 matrices, (iv) describe
recent results characterizing S(F) for certain Bohr sets F related to
quasicrystals, (v) extend these concepts to general discrete groups including
those with Kazhdan's T-property, such as SL(n,Z), n > 2, which can be
characterized by several equivalent properties such as: any sequence of
positive definite functions converging to 1 uniformly on compact subsets
converges uniformly. This exotic property may be useful to construct a
counterexample to the generalization of Feichtinger's conjecture and hence to
provide a no answer to the question of Kadison and Singer whcih they themselves
