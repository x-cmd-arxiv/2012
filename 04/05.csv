XMM-Newton light curves with those from other observatories, to ultimately use
them to derive precise physical quantities. The XMM-Newton timing calibration
is based on pulsar analysis. However, as pulsars show both timing noise and
glitches, it is essential to monitor these calibration sources regularly. To
this end, the XMM-Newton observatory performs observations twice a year of the
Crab pulsar to monitor the absolute timing accuracy of the EPIC-pn camera in
the fast Timing and Burst modes. We present the results of this monitoring
campaign, comparing XMM-Newton data from the Crab pulsar (PSR B0531+21) with
radio measurements. In addition, we use five pulsars (PSR J0537-69, PSR
B0540-69, PSR B0833-45, PSR B1509-58 and PSR B1055-52) with periods ranging
from 16 ms to 197 ms to verify the relative timing accuracy. We analysed 38
XMM-Newton observations (0.2-12.0 keV) of the Crab taken over the first ten
years of the mission and 13 observations from the five complementary pulsars.
All the data were processed with the SAS, the XMM-Newton Scientific Analysis
Software, version 9.0. Epoch folding techniques coupled with \chi^{2} tests
were used to derive relative timing accuracies. The absolute timing accuracy
was determined using the Crab data and comparing the time shift between the
main X-ray and radio peaks in the phase folded light curves. The relative
timing accuracy of XMM-Newton is found to be better than 10^{-8}. The strongest
X-ray pulse peak precedes the corresponding radio peak by 306\pm9 \mus, which
is in agreement with other high energy observatories such as Chandra, INTEGRAL
and RXTE. The derived absolute timing accuracy from our analysis is \pm48 \mus.

dense neutral torus in Enceladus's orbit around Saturn. This neutral torus is
redistributed by charge exchange, impact/photodissociation, and neutral-neutral
collisions to produce Saturn's neutral clouds. Here we consider the former
processes in greater detail than in previous studies. In the case of
dissociation, models have assumed that OH is produced with a single speed of 1
km/s, whereas laboratory measurements suggest a range of speeds between 1 and
1.6 km/s. We show that the high-speed case increases dissociation's range of
influence from 9 to 15 Rs. For charge exchange, we present a new modeling
approach, where the ions are followed within a neutral background, whereas
neutral cloud models are conventionally constructed from the neutrals' point of
view. This approach allows us to comment on the significance of the ions'
gyrophase at the moment charge exchange occurs. Accounting for gyrophase: (1)
has no consequence on the H2O cloud; (2) doubles the local density of OH at the
orbit of Enceladus; and (3) decreases the oxygen densities at Enceladus's orbit
by less than 10%. Finally, we consider velocity-dependent, as well as
species-dependent cross sections and find that the oxygen cloud produced from
charge exchange is spread out more than H2O, whereas the OH cloud is the most
confined.

orbital path as Earth around the Sun, but at Earth's L4. This proto-Moon (PM)
was 4 times less massive than the usual Giant Impact (GI) object ""Theia"" and
was captured into Earth orbit. It had a 32% Iron-Nickel-Sulfur core supporting
a dynamo, which explains magnetized lunar rocks. Following capture, it was torn
apart by tidal forces and its core of iron plastered itself, with some of its
rock mantle, on the surface of Earth at a very flat angle (producing the ""Late
Veneer""). After tidal stripping, the remaining PM rock was driven away from
Earth to about 3.8 times Earth's radius and formed into what is now the Moon.
The GI theory has several troubles: The violent collision melts the entire
Earth, contrary to geological evidence. The Moon itself also has to condense
out of the vapor cloud generated in the collision, but there is evidence that
the Moon was not condensed out of vapor. In the new theory, the Moon as we know
it may be only 3.8 - 3.9 billion years old, not 4.56 as usually assumed. That
is the age of the PM. The minerals in the Moon would be about as old as the
Earth, but would have been re-arranged in the capture and temporary
disintegration process. If the Moon is as young as suggested, its origin would
coincide with the beginning of life on Earth, which is unexplained in the GI
theory. The manuscript asks, ""Was the Moon Turned Inside-Out"" and the answer is
""Essentially, Yes.""

For the non-interacting case, we find that half of the bosons of an initially

acts on one lattice site in the center of the lattice. A physical
interpretation of this result is that the surviving particles interfere
destructively when they tunnel to the location of the dissipative defect and
therefore never reach it. Furthermore we find for a one-dimensional model that
a fraction of the particles can propagate across the dissipative defect even if
the rate of tunneling between adjacent lattice sites is much slower than the
loss rate at the defect. In the interacting case, the phase coherence is
destroyed and all particles eventually decay. We thus analyze the effect of
small interactions and small deviations from the perfectly symmetric setting on
the protection of the particles against the localized losses. A possible
experimental realization of our setup is provided by ultracold bosonic atoms in
an optical lattice, where an electron beam on a single lattice site ionizes
atoms that are then extracted by an electrostatic field.

PUF is defined as a hardware device which implements a physical function with
an output value that changes with its argument. A PUF can be clonable, but a
secure PUF must be unclonable. This proposed meaning of a PUF is cleanly
delineated from the closely related concepts of ""conventional unclonable
function"", ""physically obfuscated key"", ""random-number generator"", ""controlled

PUF enabled by the proposed formal definition is outlined. Practically all
current and novel physical (but not conventional) unclonable physical functions
are PUFs by our definition. Thereby the proposed definition captures the
existing intuition about what is a PUF and remains flexible enough to encompass
further research. In a second part we quantitatively characterize two classes
of PUF security mechanisms, the standard one, based on a minimum secret
read-out time, and a novel one, based on challenge-dependent erasure of stored
information. The new mechanism is shown to allow in principle the construction
of a ""quantum-PUF"", that is absolutely secure while not requiring the storage
of an exponentially large secret. The construction of a PUF that is
mathematically and physically unclonable in principle does not contradict the

less-crowded outer region of the galaxy, for which the color-magnitude diagram
(CMD) shows predominantly a red giant branch (RGB) that reaches down to the red
clump/horizontal branch feature (RC/HB). A simple stellar population analysis
gives clear evidence for a more complicated star formation history (SFH) in the
outer region. We derive the full SFH using a newly developed code, SFHMATRIX,
which fits the CMD Hess diagram by solving a non-negative least squares

conventional least-squares based PSSE, the decentralized framework accommodates
a robust state estimator. By exploiting interesting links to the compressive

employs a multiple Markov chain scheme for minimizing a general scoring
function which includes not only free energy contributions for pair stacking,

successfully validated against TT2NE which uses the same free energy

networks in a qualitative framework with continuous time. Mathematical modeling
is used as a systems biology tool to answer biological questions, and more
precisely, to validate a network that describes biological observations and to
predict the effect of perturbations.
  We propose a modeling approach that is intrinsically continuous in time. The
algorithm presented here fills the gap between qualitative and quantitative
modeling. It is based on continuous time Markov process applied on a Boolean
state space. In order to describe the temporal evolution, we explicitly specify
the transition rates for each node. For that purpose, we built a language that
can be seen as a generalization of Boolean equations. The values of transition
rates have a natural interpretation: it is the inverse of the time for the
transition to occur. Mathematically, this approach can be translated in a set
of ordinary differential equations on probability distributions; therefore, it
can be seen as an approach in between quantitative and qualitative.
  We developed a C++ software, MaBoSS, that is able to simulate such a system
by applying Kinetic Monte-Carlo (or Gillespie algorithm) in the Boolean state
space. This software, parallelized and optimized, computes temporal evolution
of probability distributions and can also estimate stationary distributions.
Applications of Boolean Kinetic Monte-Carlo have been demonstrated for two
qualitative models: a toy model and a published p53/Mdm2 model. Our approach
allows to describe kinetic phenomena which were difficult to handle in the
original models. In particular, transient effects are represented by time
dependent probability distributions, interpretable in terms of cell
populations.

arising from the spin-orbit interaction of electrons and the inversion
asymmetric environment. It is believed that at least for a single adatom
scanning tunneling microscopy measurements are insensitive to the Rashba

Resting on scattering theory, we demonstrate that, if magnetic, one single

Secondly, the finite size aggregates formed at lower inter-particle attraction
show unidirectional rotation. These micro-rotors demonstrate the self assembly
of functional structures using active particles. The angular speed of the
rotating clusters scales approximately as the inverse of their size, which may
be understood theoretically by assuming that the torques exerted by the

both the suppression of phase separation and the self assembly of rotors are
generic features of aggregating swimmers, and should therefore occur in a

can be spun at high-speed to shift the molecular velocity distribution downward
or upward over a wide range. Here we consider mostly the slowing mode.
Introducing a pulsed gas inlet system, cryocooling, and a shutter gate
eliminated the main handicap of the original device, in which continuous gas
flow imposed high background pressure. The new version provides intense pulses,
of duration 0.1-0.6 ms (depending on rotor speed) and containing ~10^12
molecules at lab speeds as low as 35 m/s and ~ 10^15 molecules at 400 m/s.
Beams of any molecule available as a gas can be slowed (or speeded); e.g., we
have produced slow and fast beams of rare gases, O2, Cl2, NO2, NH3, and SF6.
For collision experiments, the ability to scan the beam speed by merely
adjusting the rotor is especially advantageous when using two merged beams. By
closely matching the beam speeds, very low relative collision energies can be
attained without making either beam very slow.

properties using RXTE, Swift, and Chandra observations. We measure a spin
frequency of 0.1185154343(8) s$^{-1}$ and a frequency derivative of
$-4.3\pm0.3\times10^{-15}$ at MJD 55761.0, in a timing analysis that include
significant non-zero second and third frequency derivatives that we attribute
to timing noise. This corresponds to an estimated spin-down inferred dipole
magnetic field of $B\sim5\times10^{13}$ G, consistent with previous estimates
though still possibly affected by unmodelled noise. We find that the
post-outburst 1--10 keV flux evolution can be characterized by a
double-exponential decay with decay timescales of $15.5\pm0.5$ and $177\pm14$
days. We also fit the light curve with a crustal cooling model which suggests

of inference problems for time series. To accommodate the dependence, these
resampling methods involve a bandwidth parameter, such as subsampling window
width and block size in the block-based bootstrap. In empirical work, using
different bandwidth parameters could lead to different inference results, but
the traditional first order asymptotic theory does not capture the choice of
the bandwidth. In this article, we propose to adopt the fixed-b approach, as
advocated by Kiefer and Vogelsang (2005) in the
heteroscedasticity-autocorrelation robust testing context, to account for the
influence of the bandwidth on the inference. Under the fixed-b asymptotic
framework, we derive the asymptotic null distribution of the p-values for
subsampling and the moving block bootstrap, and further propose a calibration
of the traditional small-b based confidence intervals (regions, bands) and
tests. Our treatment is fairly general as it includes both finite dimensional
parameters and infinite dimensional parameters, such as marginal distribution
function and normalized spectral distribution function. Simulation results show
that the fixed-b approach is more accurate than the traditional small-b
approach in terms of approximating the finite sample distribution, and that the
calibrated confidence sets tend to have smaller coverage errors than the
uncalibrated counterparts.

(effective temperatures, surface gravities, global metallicities, alpha element

the period 2005 to 2010. These spectra correspond to ~6285 stars.
  The determination of the stellar parameters was carried out using the stellar

spectroscopic studies in galactic archaeology. An analysis pipeline has been
constructed that integrates spectral reduction and radial velocity correction
procedures with MATISSE in order to automatically determine the stellar

  Stellar atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g, [M/H] and [alpha/Fe]) were
determined for 6508 (30.2%) of the FEROS archived spectra (~3087 stars). Radial
velocities were determined for 11963 (56%) of the archived spectra. 2370 (11%)

Spectromagnetograph and the 512-Channel Magnetograph instruments, and
longitudinal full-disk magnetograms from the Mt. Wilson 150-foot tower. We
analyzed 37 years of observations from these two observatories that have been
observing daily, weather permitting, since 1974, offering an opportunity to
study the evolving relationship between the active region and polar fields in
some detail over several solar cycles. It is found that the annual averages of
a proxy for the active region poloidal magnetic field strength, the magnetic
field strength of the high-latitude poleward streams, and the time derivative
of the polar field strength are all well correlated in each hemisphere. These
results are based on statistically significant cyclical patterns in the active
region fields and are consistent with the Babcock-Leighton phenomenological
model for the solar activity cycle. There was more hemispheric asymmetry in the
activity level, as measured by total and maximum active region flux, during
late Cycle 23 (after around 2004), when the southern hemisphere was more
active, and Cycle 24 up to the present, when the northern hemisphere has been
more active, than at any other time since 1974. The active region net proxy
poloidal fields effectively disappeared in both hemispheres around 2004, and
the polar fields did not become significantly stronger after this time. We see
evidence that the process of Cycle 24 field reversal has begun at both poles.

The linear energy dispersion leads to the unusual nonsaturated linear
magnetoresistance since all Dirac fermions occupy the lowest Landau level in
the quantum limit. The transverse magnetoresistance exhibits a crossover at a
critical field $B^*$ from semiclassical weak-field $B^2$ dependence to the
high-field linear-field dependence. With increase in the temperature, the
critical field $B^*$ increases and the temperature dependence of $B^*$
satisfies quadratic behavior which is attributed to the Landau level splitting
of the linear energy dispersion. The effective magnetoresistant mobility
$\mu_{MR}\sim 3400$ cm$^2$/Vs is derived. Angular dependent magnetoresistance
and quantum oscillations suggest dominant two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surfaces.
Our results illustrate the dominant 2D Dirac fermion states in SrMnBi$_2$ and
imply that bulk crystals with Bi square nets can be used to study low

less massive than the other components in the ternary, enabling the ""eccentric
Kozai mechanism (EKM):"" the mutual inclination between the inner and outer
binary can flip signs driving the inner binary to very high eccentricity,
leading to a close binary or collision. We demonstrate this ""Mass-loss Induced

an ad-hoc minimal separation between the inner two members at which tidal

uniform distributions of eccentricity and cosine of the mutual inclination,
~10% of systems interact tidally or collide while the primary is on the MS due

strong correlation of the GC mean colours and the degree of colour bimodality
with the host galaxy luminosity in low-density environments, in good agreement
with high-density environments. In contrast, the GC mean colours at a given
host luminosity are somewhat bluer (\Delta(g-z) ~ 0.05) than those for cluster
galaxies, indicating more metal-poor (\Delta[Fe/H] ~ 0.10-0.15) and/or younger
(\Delta age > 2 Gyr) GC systems than those in dense environments. Furthermore,
with decreasing host luminosity, the colour bimodality disappears faster, when
compared to galaxies in cluster environments. Our results suggest that: (1) in
both high- and low-density environments, the mass of the host galaxy has the
dominant effect on GC system properties, (2) the local environment has only a
secondary effect on the history of GC system formation, (3) GC formation must
be governed by common physical processes across a range of environments.

The unfamiliar feature for gravitational systems is that the local phase space

L_Jup(2 x 10-7-2 x 10-6 L_Sun) during a typical ~ Gyr migration timescale.
Their large orbital separations and expected high planet-to-star flux ratios in
IR make them potentially accessible to high-contrast imaging instruments on 10
m class telescopes. ~10 such planets are expected to exist around FGK dwarfs
within ~50 pc. Long-period radial velocity planets are viable candidates, and
the highly eccentric planet HD 20782b at maximum angular separation ~0.''08 is
a promising candidate. Directly imaging these tidally powered Jupiters would
enable a direct test of high-e migration mechanisms. Once detected, the
luminosity would provide a direct measurement of the migration rate, and
together with mass (and possibly radius) estimate, they would serve as a
laboratory to study planetary spectral formation and tidal physics.

to dS-invariant plane-wave type vacua, while the bulk Euclidean vacuum is dual
to a certain mixed state in the CFT$_3$. CFT$_3$ states created by operator

is defined on the $R^3$ bulk Hilbert space and shown for the scalar case to be
equivalent to both the Zamolodchikov and pseudounitary C-norm of the $Sp(N)$

possibility that the intermediate state in the scattering can have spin |j \pm
1| and the same mass as the target. The second sum rule applies if the theory
at hand possesses intermediate narrow resonances with masses different from the
mass of the scatterer. These sum rules are generalizations of the
Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn-Weinberg sum rule. Along with the requirement of tree
level unitarity, they relate different low energy couplings in the theory.
Using these sum rules, we show that in certain cases the gyromagnetic ratio can
differ from the ""natural"" value g=2, even at tree level, without spoiling
perturbative unitarity. These sum rules can be used as constraints applicable
to all supergravity and higher-spin theories that contain particles charged
under some U(1) gauge field. In particular, applied to four dimensional N=8
supergravity in a spontaneously broken phase, these sum rules suggest that for
the theory to have a good ultraviolet behavior, additional massive states need
to be present, such as those coming from the embedding of the N=8 supergravity
in type II superstring theory. We also discuss the possible implications of the

represent the changing spacetime in the region occupied by the orbiting matter

simulated the MHD evolution of a circumbinary disk surrounding an equal-mass
non-spinning binary. Prior to the beginning of the inspiral, the structure of
the circumbinary disk is predicted well by extrapolation from Newtonian
results. The binary opens a low-density gap whose radius is roughly two binary
separations, and matter piles up at the outer edge of this gap as inflow is
retarded by torques exerted by the binary; nonetheless, the accretion rate is
diminished relative to its value at larger radius by only about a factor of 2.
During inspiral, the inner edge of the disk at first moves inward in
coordination with the shrinking binary, but as the orbital evolution
accelerates, the rate at which the inner edge moves toward smaller radii falls
behind the rate of binary compression. In this stage, the rate of angular
momentum transfer from the binary to the disk slows substantially, but the net
accretion rate decreases by only 10-20%. When the binary separation is tens of
gravitational radii, the rest-mass efficiency of disk radiation is a few
percent, suggesting that supermassive binary black holes in galactic nuclei
could be very luminous at this stage of their evolution. If the luminosity were
optically thin, it would be modulated at a frequency that is a beat between the
orbital frequency of the disk's surface density maximum and the binary orbital
frequency. However, a disk with sufficient surface density to be luminous
should also be optically thick; as a result, the periodic modulation may be
suppressed.

their fundamental plane. It is confirmed that residuals in the Tully-Fisher
relation are correlated with surface brightness, but that even after
accommodating the surface brightness dependence through the dwarf fundamental
plane, residuals in absolute magnitude are far larger than expected from
observational errors. Rather, a more fundamental plane is identified which
connects the potential to HI line width and surface brightness. Residuals
correlate with the axis ratio in a way which can be accommodated by recognizing
the galaxies to be oblate spheroids viewed at varying angles. Correction of
surface brightnesses to face-on leads to a correlation among the potential,
line width, and surface brightness for which residuals are entirely
attributable to observational uncertainties. The mean mass-to-light ratio of
the diffuse component of the galaxies is constrained to be 0.88 +/- 0.20 in Ks.
Blue compact dwarfs lie in the same plane as dwarf irregulars. The dependence
of the potential on line width is less strong than expected for virialized
systems, but this may be because surface brightness is acting as a proxy for
variations in the mass-to-light ratio from galaxy to galaxy. Altogether, the
observations suggest that gas motions are predominantly disordered and
isotropic, that they are a consequence of gravity, not turbulence, and that the
mass and scale of dark matter haloes scale with the amount and distribution of
luminous matter. The tight relationship between the potential and observables
offers the promise of determining distances to unresolved star-forming dwarfs
to an accuracy comparable to that provided by the Tully-Fisher relation for
spirals.

contrary to the state-of-art methods, our approaches use a weak sparsity source
assumption: we look for tiny temporal zones where only one source is active. We
investigate two nonlinear single-source confidence measures, using the mutual
information and a local linear tangent space approximation (LTSA). For this
latter measure, we derive two extensions of linear single-source measures,
respectively based on correlation (LTSA-correlation) and eigenvalues
(LTSA-PCA). A second novelty of our approach consists of applying functional
data clustering techniques to the scattered observations in the above
single-source zones, thus allowing us to accurately estimate them.We first
study a classical approach using a B-spline approximation, and then two
approaches which locally approximate the nonlinear functions as lines. Finally,
we extend our PNL methods to more general nonlinear mixtures. Combining
single-source zones and functional data clustering allows us to tackle speech
signals, which has never been performed by other PNL-SCA methods. We
investigate the performance of our approaches with simulated PNL mixtures of
real speech signals. Both the mutual information and the LTSA-correlation
measures are better-suited to detecting single-source zones than the LTSA-PCA
measure. We also find local-linear-approximation-based clustering approaches to
be more flexible and more accurate than the B-spline one.

  Symposium on Computational Geometry, 2013",,,,"cs.DM cs.CG math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the longest-standing open problems in computational geometry is to
bound the lower envelope of $n$ univariate functions, each pair of which
crosses at most $s$ times, for some fixed $s$. This problem is known to be
equivalent to bounding the length of an order-$s$ Davenport-Schinzel sequence,
namely a sequence over an $n$-letter alphabet that avoids alternating
subsequences of the form $a \cdots b \cdots a \cdots b \cdots$ with length
$s+2$. These sequences were introduced by Davenport and Schinzel in 1965 to
model a certain problem in differential equations and have since been applied
to bounding the running times of geometric algorithms, data structures, and the
combinatorial complexity of geometric arrangements.
  Let $\lambda_s(n)$ be the maximum length of an order-$s$ DS sequence over $n$
letters. What is $\lambda_s$ asymptotically? This question has been answered
satisfactorily (by Hart and Sharir, Agarwal, Sharir, and Shor, Klazar, and
Nivasch) when $s$ is even or $s\le 3$. However, since the work of Agarwal,
Sharir, and Shor in the mid-1980s there has been a persistent gap in our
understanding of the odd orders.
  In this work we effectively close the problem by establishing sharp bounds on
Davenport-Schinzel sequences of every order $s$. Our results reveal that,
contrary to one's intuition, $\lambda_s(n)$ behaves essentially like
$\lambda_{s-1}(n)$ when $s$ is odd. This refutes conjectures due to Alon et al.
(2008) and Nivasch (2010).

location of facilities in the 2-dimensional case. A classical method to solve
the Weber problem, proposed by Weiszfeld in 1937, is based on a fixed point
iteration.
  In this work a Weber problem constrained to a closed and convex set is
considered. A Weiszfeld-like algorithm, well defined even when an iterate is a
vertex, is presented. The iteration function $Q$ that defines the proposed
algorithm, is based mainly on an orthogonal projection over the feasible set,
combined with the iteration function of a modified Weiszfeld algorithm
presented by Vardi and Zhang in 2001.
  It can be seen that the proposed algorithm generates a sequence of feasible
iterates that have descent properties. Under certain hypotheses, the limit of
this sequence satisfies the KKT optimality conditions, is a fixed point of the
iteration function that defines the algorithm, and is the solution of the
constrained minimization problem. Numerical experiments confirmed the
theoretical results.

networks (HCNs) due to their realism, tractability, and scalability. A major
limitation of such models to date in the context of HCNs is the neglect of
network traffic and load: all base stations (BSs) have typically been assumed
to always be transmitting. Small cells in particular will have a lighter load
than macrocells, and so their contribution to the network interference may be
significantly overstated in a fully loaded model. This paper incorporates a
flexible notion of BS load by introducing a new idea of conditionally thinning
the interference field. For a K-tier HCN where BSs across tiers differ in terms
of transmit power, supported data rate, deployment density, and now load, we
derive the coverage probability for a typical mobile, which connects to the
strongest BS signal. Conditioned on this connection, the interfering BSs of the
$i^{th}$ tier are assumed to transmit independently with probability $p_i$,
which models the load. Assuming - reasonably - that smaller cells are more
lightly loaded than macrocells, the analysis shows that adding such access
points to the network always increases the coverage probability. We also
observe that fully loaded models are quite pessimistic in terms of coverage.

conditions when control is lacking. The medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) is a
critically important brain region required for plasticity of stress resilience.
We found that control over stress induces plasticity of the intrinsic
voltage-gated conductances of pyramidal neurons in the PFC. To gain insight
into the underlying biophysical mechanisms of this plasticity we used the
conductance- based neural simulation software tool, NEURON, to model the
increase in membrane excitability associated with resilience to stress. A ball
and stick multicompartment conductance-based model was used to realistically
fit passive and active data traces from prototypical pyramidal neurons in
neurons in rats with control over tail shock stress and those lacking control.
The results indicate that the plasticity of membrane excitability associated
with control over stress can be attributed to an increase in Na+ and Ca2+
T-type conductances and an increase in the leak conductance. Using simulated
dendritic synaptic inputs we observed an increase in excitatory postsynaptic
summation and amplification resulting in elevated action potential output. This
realistic simulation suggests that control over stress enhances the output of
the PFC and offers specific testable hypotheses to guide future
electrophysiological mechanistic studies in animal models of resilience and

range we prove the existence for all time of radially symmetric measure
solutions that are monotone decreasing as a function of the radius, thus
allowing for continuation of the solution past the blowup time. The monotone
constraint on the data is consistent with the typical blowup profiles observed
in recent numerical studies of these singularities. We prove monotonicity is
preserved for all time, even after blowup, in contrast to the case $\alpha >2$
where radially symmetric solutions are known to lose monotonicity. In the case
of the Newtonian potential ($\alpha=2-d$), under the assumption of radial
symmetry the equation can be transformed into the inviscid Burgers equation on
a half line. This enables us to prove preservation of monotonicity using the
classical theory of conservation laws. In the case $2 -d < \alpha < 2$ and at
the critical exponent $p$ we exhibit initial data in $L^p$ for which the
solution immediately develops a Dirac mass singularity. This extends recent
work on the local ill-posedness of solutions at the critical exponent.

the instantaneous or statistical channel state information (CSI) of the
interfering channels to the primary receivers (PRs) is completely unknown to
the CR. For the single underlay receiver scenario, we assume a minimum
information rate must be guaranteed on the CR main channel whose CSI is known
at the CR transmitter. We first show that low-rank CR interference is
preferable for improving the throughput of the PRs compared with spreading less
power over more transmit dimensions. Based on this observation, we then propose
a rank minimization CR transmission strategy assuming a minimum information
rate must be guaranteed on the CR main channel. We propose a simple solution
referred to as frugal waterfilling (FWF) that uses the least amount of power
required to achieve the rate constraint with a minimum-rank transmit covariance
matrix. We also present two heuristic approaches that have been used in prior
work to transform rank minimization problems into convex optimization problems.
The proposed schemes are then generalized to an underlay MIMO CR downlink
network with multiple receivers. Finally, a theoretical analysis of the
interference temperature and leakage rate outage probabilities at the PR is
presented for Rayleigh fading channels.We demonstrate that the direct FWF
solution leads to higher PR throughput even though it has higher interference
""temperature (IT) compared with the heuristic methods and classic waterfilling,
which calls into question the use of IT as a metric for CR interference.

($k\gg \xi^{-1}$) having a universal $k^{-3}$ scaling arising from the vortex
core structure, and an infrared regime ($k\ll\xi^{-1}$) with a spectrum that
arises purely from the configuration of the vortices. The Novikov power-law
distribution of intervortex distances with exponent -1/3 for vortices of the
same sign of circulation leads to an infrared kinetic energy spectrum with a
Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ power law, consistent with the existence of an inertial
range. The presence of these $k^{-3}$ and $k^{-5/3}$ power laws, together with
the constraint of continuity at the smallest configurational scale
$k\approx\xi^{-1}$, allows us to derive a new analytical expression for the
Kolmogorov constant that we test against a numerical simulation of a forced
homogeneous compressible two-dimensional superfluid. The numerical simulation
corroborates our analysis of the spectral features of the kinetic energy
distribution, once we introduce the concept of a {\em clustered fraction}
consisting of the fraction of vortices that have the same sign of circulation
as their nearest neighboring vortices. Our analysis presents a new approach to
understanding two-dimensional quantum turbulence and interpreting similarities

finite correlation functions involving the first L sites for the stationary

specialization of the stationary distribution of an ASEP on a finite
one-dimensional lattice with L sites. Namely, if the output and input rates of

respectively, and we set delta=-beta, then this specialization corresponds to
sending the right boundary of the lattice to infinity. Combining this
observation with work of the second author and Corteel, we obtain a

a Ramsey-type theorem for bi-colorings of so-called {\em exactly large} sets.
An {\it exactly large} set is a set $X\subset\Nat$ such that
$\card(X)=\min(X)+1$. The theorem we analyze is as follows. For every infinite
subset $M$ of $\Nat$, for every coloring $C$ of the exactly large subsets of
$M$ in two colors, there exists and infinite subset $L$ of $M$ such that $C$ is
constant on all exactly large subsets of $L$. This theorem is essentially due
to Pudl\`ak and R\""odl and independently to Farmaki. We prove that --- over
Computable Mathematics --- this theorem is equivalent to closure under the
$\omega$ Turing jump (i.e., under arithmetical truth). Natural combinatorial
theorems at this level of complexity are rare. Our results give a complete
characterization of the theorem from the point of view of Computable
Mathematics and of the Proof Theory of Arithmetic. This nicely extends the
current knowledge about the strength of Ramsey Theorem. We also show that
analogous results hold for a related principle based on the Regressive Ramsey
Theorem. In addition we give a further characterization in terms of truth
predicates over Peano Arithmetic. We conjecture that analogous results hold for
larger ordinals.

values of these four criteria were lower with A-SG, compared to Z-SG. In

$T^*$ is typically between 10-50K and is sample dependent. For $T<T^*$ the

sluggishness is related to the current carrying network becoming very dilute in

electrically very weakly connected and the transport is dominated by very few
weak links. This enables studying the glassy properties of the sample as it
transitions from a macroscopic sample to a mesocopic sample, hence, the results
provide new insight on the underlying physics of electron glasses.

acceleration, and heating of electrons in solar flares. Height and size
measurements of X-ray footpoints sources can be used to determine the
chromospheric density and constrain the parameters of magnetic field
convergence and electron pitch-angle evolution. We investigate the influence of
the chromospheric density, magnetic mirroring and collisional pitch-angle
scattering on the size of X-ray sources. The time-independent Fokker-Planck
equation for electron transport is solved numerically and analytically to find
the electron distribution as a function of height above the photosphere. From
this distribution, the expected X-ray flux as a function of height, its peak
height and full width at half maximum are calculated and compared with RHESSI
observations. A purely instrumental explanation for the observed source size
was ruled out by using simulated RHESSI images. We find that magnetic mirroring
and collisional pitch-angle scattering tend to change the electron flux such
that electrons are stopped higher in the atmosphere compared with the simple
case with collisional energy loss only. However, the resulting X-ray flux is
dominated by the density structure in the chromosphere and only marginal
increases in source width are found. Very high loop densities (>10^{11}
cm^{-3}) could explain the observed sizes at higher energies, but are
unrealistic and would result in no footpoint emission below about 40 keV,
contrary to observations. We conclude that within a monolithic density model
the vertical sizes are given mostly by the density scale-height and are
predicted smaller than the RHESSI results show.

emission. We reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution (SED),
decomposed into a host-galaxy and an AGN component. A smooth-torus model for
circum-nuclear dust is used to account for the direct and re-processed
contribution from the AGN. We confirm that galaxies with typical
L_{8-1000um}\sim10^{12}Lo at z\sim2 are powered predominantly by
star-formation. An AGN component is present in nine objects (\sim35% of the
sample) at the 3sigma confidence level, but its contribution to the 8-1000 um
emission accounts for only \sim5% of the energy budget. The AGN contribution
rises to \sim23% over the 5-30 um range (in agreement with Spitzer IRS results)
and to \sim60% over the narrow 2-6 um range. The presence of an AGN is
confirmed by X-ray data for 3 (out of nine) sources, with X-ray spectral
analysis indicating the presence of significant absorption, i.e.
NH\sim10^{23}-10^{24} cm^{-2}. An additional source shows indications of
obscured AGN emission from X-ray data. The comparison between the
mid-IR--derived X-ray luminosities and those obtained from X-ray data suggests
that obscuration is likely present also in the remaining six sources that
harbour an AGN according to the SED-fitting analysis.

crucial for the studies of stellar evolution, galaxy evolution and cosmology.
They are generally thought to be thermonuclear explosions of accreting
carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) in close binaries, however, the nature of
the mass donor star is still unclear. In this article, we review various
progenitor models proposed in the past years and summarize many observational
results that can be used to put constraints on the nature of their progenitors.
We also discuss the origin of SN Ia diversity and the impacts of SN Ia
progenitors on some fields. The currently favourable progenitor model is the
single-degenerate (SD) model, in which the WD accretes material from a
non-degenerate companion star. This model may explain the similarities of most
SNe Ia. It has long been argued that the double-degenerate (DD) model, which
involves the merger of two CO WDs, may lead to an accretion-induced collapse
rather than a thermonuclear explosion. However, recent observations of a few
SNe Ia seem to support the DD model, and this model can produce normal SN Ia
explosion under certain conditions. Additionally, the sub-luminous SNe Ia may
be explained by the sub-Chandrasekhar mass model. At present, it seems likely
that more than one progenitor model, including some variants of the SD and DD
models, may be required to explain the observed diversity of SNe Ia.

a single Dirac fermion trapped in each core, to the case where vortices trap
two Dirac fermions with U(2) symmetry. Such a system of vortices with
non-Abelian Dirac fermions appears in color superconductors at extremely high
densities, and in supersymmetric QCD. We show that the exchange of two vortices
having doublet Dirac fermions in each core is expressed by non-Abelian
representations of a braid group, which is explicitly verified in the matrix
representation of the exchange operators when the number of vortices is up to
four. We find that the result contains the matrices previously obtained for the
vortices with a single Dirac fermion in each core as a special case. The whole
braid group does not immediately imply non-Abelian statistics of identical
particles because it also contains exchanges between vortices with different
numbers of Dirac fermions. However, we find that it does contain, as its
subgroup, a genuine non-Abelian statistics for the exchange of the identical
particles, that is, vortices with the same number of Dirac fermions. This
result is surprising compared with conventional understanding because all Dirac
fermions are defined locally at each vortex, unlike the case of Majorana
fermions for which Dirac fermions are defined non-locally by Majorana fermions
located at two spatially separated vortices.

detection of H-alpha and/or [OIII] emission lines by FMOS observations. In the
high density regions such as cluster core and clumps, star-forming [OII]
emitters show a high overdensity by a factor of more than 10 compared to the
field region. Although the star formation activity is very high even in the
cluster core, some massive quiescent galaxies also exits at the same time.
Furthermore, the properties of the individual [OII] emitters, such as star
formation rates, stellar masses and specific star formation rates, do not show
a significant dependence on the local density, either. Such lack of
environmental dependence is consistent with our earlier result by Hayashi et
al. (2011) on a z=1.5 cluster and its surrounding region. The fact that the
star-forming activity of galaxies in the cluster core is as high as that in the
field at z~1.6 may suggest that the star-forming galaxies are probably just in
a transition phase from a starburst mode to a quiescent mode, and are thus
showing comparable level of star formation rates to those in lower density
environments. We may be witnessing the start of the reversal of the local
SFR--density relation due to the ""biased"" galaxy formation and evolution in
high density regions at high this redshift, beyond which massive galaxies would
be forming vigorously in a more biased way in proto-cluster cores.

quasi-biennial solar cycle-related variations in solar rotational splitting
frequencies of low-degree solar p modes. Although no 11-yr signals were
observed, variations on a shorter timescale (~2yrs) were apparent. We show that
the variations arose from complications/artifacts associated with the
realization noise in the data and the process by which the data were analyzed.
More specifically, the realization noise was observed to have a larger effect
on the rotational splittings than accounted for by the formal uncertainties.
When used to infer the rotation profile of the Sun these variations are not
important. The outer regions of the solar interior can be constrained using
higher-degree modes. While the variations in the low-l splittings do make large
differences to the inferred rotation rate of the core, the core rotation rate
is so poorly constrained, even by low-l modes, that the different inferred
rotation profiles still agree within their respective 1sigma uncertainties. By
contrast, in asteroseismology, only low-l modes are visible and so higher-l
modes cannot be used to constrain the rotation profile of stars. Furthermore,
we usually only have one data set from which to measure the observed low-l
splitting. In such circumstances the inferred internal rotation rate of a main
sequence star could differ significantly from estimates of the surface rotation
rate, hence leading to spurious conclusions. Therefore, extreme care must be
taken when using only the splittings of low-l modes to draw conclusions about
the average internal rotation rate of a star.

users can share the available bandwidth by means of different spreading codes

recover the timing information of the transmitted symbols. Simulation results

scientific scope of the Herschel-HIFI mission. The presentation of science
results from the mission follows the life cycle of gas in galaxies as grouped
into five themes: Structure of the interstellar medium, First steps in

and Evolved stellar envelopes. The HIFI observations paint a picture where the
interstellar medium in galaxies has a mixed, rather than a layered structure;
the same conclusion may hold for protoplanetary disks. In addition, the HIFI

substantially exceed the separation velocities of the photospheric magnetic

region of leading magnetic polarity are more powerful and exist longer than
those in regions of following polarity. The Doppler velocity asymmetry between

ghost-free model of non-linear massive gravity. We focus on a branch of
solutions where the helicity-0 mode can be strongly coupled within certain
radial regions, giving rise to the Vainshtein effect. We truncate the analysis
to scales below the gravitational Compton wavelength, and consider the weak
field limit for the gravitational potentials, while keeping all non-linearities
of the helicity-0 mode. We determine analytically the number and properties of
local solutions which exist asymptotically on large scales, and of local
(inner) solutions which exist on small scales. We find two kinds of asymptotic
solutions, one of which is asymptotically flat, while the other one is not, and
also two types of inner solutions, one of which displays the Vainshtein
mechanism, while the other exhibits a self-shielding behaviour of the
gravitational field. We analyse in detail in which cases the solutions match in
an intermediate region. The asymptotically flat solutions connect only to inner
configurations displaying the Vainshtein mechanism, while the non
asymptotically flat solutions can connect with both kinds of inner solutions.
We show furthermore that there are some regions in the parameter space where
global solutions do not exist, and characterise precisely in which regions of
the phase space the Vainshtein mechanism takes place.

alternating Fe and Mo along each cubic axes, and a homogeneous ferromagnetic
metallic ground state. Imperfect annealing leads to the formation of structural
domains. The moments on mislocated Fe atoms that adjoin each other across the
domain boundary have an antiferromagnetic coupling between them. This leads to
a peculiar magnetic state, with ferromagnetic domains coupled
antiferromagnetically. At short distance the system exhibits ferromagnetic
correlation while at large lengthscales the net moment is strongly suppressed
due to inter-domain cancellation. We provide a detailed description of the spin
wave excitations of this complex magnetic state, obtained within a 1/S
expansion, for progressively higher degree of mislocation, i.e., antisite
disorder. At a given wavevector the magnons propagate at multiple energies,
related, crudely, to `domain confined' modes with which they have large
overlap. We provide a qualitative understanding of the trend observed with
growing antisite disorder, and contrast these results to the much broader
spectrum that one obtains for uncorrelated antisites.

anti-Chaplygin gas and dust-like matter exhibits a future soft singularity,
where the pressure of the anti-Chaplygin gas diverges (while its energy density
is finite). Despite infinite tidal forces the geodesics pass through the
singularity. Due to the dust component, the Hubble parameter has a non-zero
value at the encounter with the singularity, therefore the dust implies further
expansion. With continued expansion however, the energy density and the
pressure of the anti-Chaplygin gas would become ill-defined, hence from the
point of view of the anti-Chaplygin gas only a contraction is allowed.
Paradoxically, the universe in this cosmological model would have to expand and
contract simultaneously. This obviosly could not happen. We solve the paradox
by redefining the anti-Chaplygin gas in a distributional sense. Then a
contraction could follow the expansion phase at the singularity at the price of
a jump in the Hubble parameter. Although such an abrupt change is not common in
any cosmological evolution, we explicitly show that the set of Friedmann,
Raychaudhuri and continuity equations are all obeyed both at the singularity

planetary nebulae (CSPNs) might not be universally valid. While earlier optical
analyses could not derive masses and luminosities independently (instead taking
them from theoretical evolutionary models) hydrodynamically consistent
modelling of the stellar winds allows using fits to the UV spectra to
consistently determine also stellar radii, masses, and luminosities without
assuming a mass-luminosity relation. Recent application to a sample of CSPNs
raised questions regarding the validity of the theoretical mass-luminosity
relation of CSPNs.
  Aims: The results of the earlier UV analysis are reassessed by means of a
simultaneous comparison of observed optical and UV spectra with corresponding
synthetic spectra.
  Methods: Using published stellar parameters (a) from a consistent UV analysis
and (b) from fits to optical H and He lines, we calculate simultaneous optical
and UV spectra with our model atmosphere code, which has been improved by
implementing Stark broadening for H and He lines.
  Results: Spectra computed with the parameter sets from the UV analysis yield
good agreement to the observations, but spectra computed with the stellar
parameters from the published optical analysis and using corresponding
consistent wind parameters show large discrepancies to both the observed
optical and UV spectra. The published optical analyses give good fits to the
observed spectrum only because the wind parameters assumed in these analyses
are inconsistent with their stellar parameters. By enforcing consistency
between stellar and wind parameters, stellar parameters are obtained which
disagree with the core-mass-luminosity relation for the objects analyzed. This
disagreement is also evident from a completely different approach: an
investigation of the dynamical wind parameters.

Motivated by these results, we describe a pseudo-matched filter, which removes
noise from the same chaotic signal. It consists of a notch filter followed by a
first-order, low-pass filter. We compare quantitatively the matched filter's
performance to that of our pseudo-matched filter using correlation functions in
a simulated radar application. On average, the pseudo-matched filter performs
with a correlation signal-to-noise ratio that is 2.0 dB below that of the

The third problem is a basic geometric question: given points

recovered from $D+L$ for any diagonal matrix $D$ using a convex

form of the corresponding superfield and component actions, as well as of the

  It is shown that the Hamiltonian H=D*D, where D is flat four-dimensional
Dirac operator in an external self-dual gauge background, Abelian or
non-Abelian, is supersymmetric with N=4 supersymmetry. A generalization of this
Hamiltonian to the motion on a curved conformally flat four-dimensional
manifold exists. For an Abelian self-dual background, the corresponding
Lagrangian can be derived from certain harmonic superspace expressions.
  If the Hamiltonian involves a non-Abelian self-dual gauge field, one can
construct the Lagrangian formulation of it by introducing auxiliary bosonic
variables with Wess-Zumino type action. For a special class of such Lagrangians
when the gauge group is SU(2) and the gauge field is expressed in the `t Hooft
ansatz form, it is possible to give a superfield description using the harmonic
superspace formalism. As a new explicit example, the N=4 mechanics with Yang
monopole in R^5 (= instanton on S^4) is considered.
  Independently, a similar system with N=4 supersymmetry in three dimensions
also admits the superfield description. Although the three-dimensional system
involves different superfields, its component Lagrangian and Hamiltonian appear
to be the three-dimensional reduction of the mentioned four-dimensional system.
The off-shell N=4 supersymmetry requires the gauge field to be a static form of
the 't Hooft ansatz for the four-dimensional self-dual SU(2) gauge fields, that
is a particular solution of Bogomolny equations for BPS monopoles.

the integer lattice with a random potential $\xi$. We consider the case when
$\{\xi(z):z\in\mathbb{Z}^d\}$ is a collection of independent identically
distributed random variables with Weibull distribution with parameter
$0<\gamma<2$, and we assume that the solution is initially localised in the
origin. We prove that, as time goes to infinity, the solution completely
localises at just one point with high probability, and we identify the
asymptotic behaviour of the localisation site. We also show that the intervals
between the times when the solution relocalises from one site to another
increase linearly over time, a phenomenon known as ageing.

of a random concatenation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers, immersed in
a micro-emulsion of random droplets of oil and water. The copolymer interacts
with the micro-emulsion through an interaction Hamiltonian that favors matches
and disfavors mismatches between the monomers and the solvents, in such a way
that the interaction with the oil is stronger than with the water.
  The configurations of the copolymers are directed self-avoiding paths in
which only steps up, down and right are allowed. The configurations of the
micro-emulsion are square blocks with oil and water arranged in
percolation-type fashion. The only restriction imposed on the path is that in
every column of blocks its vertical displacement on the block scale is bounded.
The way in which the copolymer enters and exits successive columns of blocks is
a directed self-avoiding path as well, but on the block scale. We refer to this
path as the coarse-grained self-avoiding path. We are interested in the limit
as the copolymer and the blocks become large, in such a way that the copolymer
spends a long time in each block yet visits many blocks. This is a
coarse-graining limit in which the space-time scales of the copolymer and of
the micro-emulsion become separated.
  We derive a variational formula for the quenched free energy per monomer,
where quenched means that the disorder in the copolymer and the disorder in the
micro-emulsion are both frozen. In a sequel paper we will analyze this
variational formula and identify the phase diagram. It turns out that there are
two regimes, supercritical and subcritical, depending on whether the oil blocks
percolate or not along the coarse-grained self-avoiding path. The phase
diagrams in the two regimes turn out to be completely different.

combining exponential Laplace (LSR) and finite energy (FESR) sum rules known
perturbatively to lowest order (LO) in alpha_s but including non-perturbative
terms up to the complete dimension-six condensate contributions. This approach
allows to fix more precisely the value of the QCD continuum threshold (often
taken ad hoc) at which the optimal result is extracted.
  We use double ratio of sum rules (DRSR) for determining the SU(3) breakings
terms. We also study the effects of the heavy quark mass definitions on these
LO results.
  The SU(3) mass-splittings of about (50 - 110) MeV and the ones of about (250
- 300) MeV between the lowest ground states and their 1st radial excitations
are (almost) heavy-flavour independent.
  The mass predictions summarized in Table 4 are compared with the ones in the
literature (when available) and with the three Y_c(4260,~4360,~4660) and
Y_b(10890) 1^{--} experimental candidates. We conclude (to this order
approximation) that the lowest observed state cannot be a pure 1^{--}
four-quark nor a pure molecule but may result from their mixings. We extend the
above analyzes to the 0^{++} four-quark and molecule states which are about
(0.5-1) GeV heavier than the corresponding 1^{--} states, while the splittings
between the 0^{++} lowest ground state and the 1st radial excitation is about
(300-500) MeV. We complete the analysis by estimating the decay constants of
the 1^{--} and 0^{++} four-quark states which are tiny and which exhibit a
1/M_Q behaviour.
  Our predictions can be further tested using some alternative non-perturbative
approaches or/and at LHCb and some other hadron factories.

  Transmitters","This is the longer version of a paper to appear in IEEE Transactions
  on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the design of a wireless communication device relying
exclusively on energy harvesting is considered. Due to the inability of
rechargeable energy sources to charge and discharge at the same time, a
constraint we term the energy half-duplex constraint, two rechargeable energy
storage devices (ESDs) are assumed so that at any given time, there is always
one ESD being recharged. The energy harvesting rate is assumed to be a random
variable that is constant over the time interval of interest. A
save-then-transmit (ST) protocol is introduced, in which a fraction of time
{\rho} (dubbed the save-ratio) is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting,
with the remaining fraction 1 - {\rho} used for data transmission. The ratio of
the energy obtainable from an ESD to the energy harvested is termed the energy
storage efficiency, {\eta}. We address the practical case of the secondary ESD
being a battery with {\eta} < 1, and the main ESD being a super-capacitor with
{\eta} = 1. The optimal save-ratio that minimizes outage probability is
derived, from which some useful design guidelines are drawn. In addition, we
compare the outage performance of random power supply to that of constant power
supply over the Rayleigh fading channel. The diversity order with random power
is shown to be the same as that of constant power, but the performance gap can
be large. Furthermore, we extend the proposed ST protocol to wireless networks
with multiple transmitters. It is shown that the system-level outage
performance is critically dependent on the relationship between the number of
transmitters and the optimal save-ratio for single-channel outage minimization.
Numerical results are provided to validate our proposed study.

important to share cloud resources, so as to provide them economically. In
cloud computing services, multiple types of resources, such as processing
ability, bandwidth and storage, need to be allocated simultaneously. If there
is a surge of requests, a competition will arise between these requests for the
use of cloud resources. This leads to the disruption of the service and it is
necessary to consider a measure to avoid or relieve congestion of cloud
computing environments.
  This paper proposes a new congestion control method for cloud computing
environments which reduces the size of required resource for congested resource
type instead of restricting all service requests as in the existing networks.
Next, this paper proposes the user service specifications for the proposed
congestion control method, and clarifies the algorithm to decide the optimal
size of required resource to be reduced, based on the load offered to the
system. It is demonstrated by simulation evaluations that the proposed method
can handle more requests compared with the conventional methods and relieve the
congestion. Then, this paper proposes to enhance the proposed method, so as to
enable the fair resource allocation among users in congested situation.

  (IJCNC) Vol.3, No.1, January 2011",,,"cs.NI cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) had been deployed by many data
networking service providers, including the next-generation mobile backhaul
networks, because of its undeniable potential in terms of virtual private
network (VPN) management, traffic engineering, etc. In MPLS networks, IP
packets are transmitted along a Label Switched Path (LSP) established between
edge nodes. To improve the efficiency of resource use in MPLS networks, it is
essential to utilize the LSPs efficiently.
  This paper proposes a method of selecting the optimal LSP pair from among
multiple LSP pairs which are established between the same pair of edge nodes,
on the assumption that both the upward and downward LSPs are established as a
pair (both-way operation). It is supposed that both upward and downward
bandwidths are allocated simultaneously in the selected LSP pair for each
service request. It is demonstrated by simulation evaluations that the proposal
method could reduce the total amount of the bandwidth required by up to 15%
compared with the conventional selection method. The proposed method can also
reuse the know-how and management tools in many existing networks which are
based on both-way operation.

Model with a fourth generation is part of the experimental program of the
Tevatron and LHC experiments. Besides being directly produced, these states
affect drastically the production and decay properties of the Higgs boson. In
this note, we first reemphasize the known fact that in the case of a light and
long-lived fourth neutrino, the present collider searches do not permit to
exclude a Higgs boson with a mass below the WW threshold. In a second step, we
show that the recent results from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations which
observe an excess in the $\gamma \gamma$ and $4\ell^\pm$ search channels
corresponding to a Higgs boson with a mass $M_H \approx 125$ GeV, cannot rule
out the fourth generation possibility if the $H \to \gamma \gamma$ decay rate
is evaluated when naively implementing the leading ${\cal O}(G_F m_{f'}^2)$
electroweak corrections. Including the exact next-to-leading order electroweak
corrections leads to a strong suppression of the $H \to \gamma \gamma$ rate and
makes this channel unobservable with present data. Finally, we point out that
the observation by the Tevatron collaborations of a $\gsim 2\sigma$ excess in
the mass range $M_H = 115$-135 GeV in the channel $q\bar q \to WH \to Wb\bar b$
can definitely not be accommodated by the fourth generation fermion scenario.
All in all, if the excesses observed at the LHC and the Tevatron are indeed due
to a Higgs boson, they unambiguously exclude the perturbative fermionic fourth
generation case. In passing, we also point out that the Tevatron excess
definitely rules out the fermiophobic Higgs scenario as well as scenarios in
which the Higgs couplings to gauge bosons and bottom quarks are significantly
reduced.

with the substrate is such that the system is unpinned at equilibrium, then the
scaling limit of the height profile is given by the solution of the heat
equation with Dirichlet boundary condition ; when the attraction to the
substrate is infinite, the scaling limit is given a free-boundary problem which

separation of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate is insufficient if
kinetic energy is taken into account, which competes against the intercomponent
interaction and favors phase mixing. Here g11, g22, and g12 are the intra- and
intercomponent interaction strengths, respectively. Taking a d-dimensional
infinitely deep square well potential of width L as an example, a simple
scaling analysis shows that if d=1 (d=3), phase separation will be suppressed
as L\rightarrow0 (L\rightarrow\infty) whether the condition g11g22<g122 is
satisfied or not. In the intermediate case of d=2, the width L is irrelevant
but again phase separation can be partially or even completely suppressed even
if g11g22<g122. Moreover, the miscibility-immiscibility transition is turned
from a first-order one into a second-order one by the kinetic energy. All these
results carry over to d-dimensional harmonic potentials, where the harmonic
oscillator length {\xi}ho plays the role of L. Our finding provides a scenario
of controlling the miscibility-immiscibility transition of a two-component
condensate by changing the confinement, instead of the conventional approach of
changing the values of the g's.

in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV has been measured with the LHCb detector. The
data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb-1. The psi(2S)
mesons are reconstructed in the decay channels psi(2S) -> mu+ mu- and psi(2S)
-> J/psi pi+ pi-, with the J/psi meson decaying into two muons. Results are
presented both for promptly produced psi(2S) mesons and for those originating
from b-hadron decays. In the kinematic range pT(psi(2S)) <= 16 GeV/c and 2 <
y(psi(2S)) <= 4.5 we measure 1.44 +- 0.01 +- 0.12+0.2-0.4 mub for prompt
psi(2S) production and 0.25 +- 0.01 +- 0.02 mub for psi(2S) from b-hadron
decays, where the last uncertainty on the prompt cross-section is due to the
unknown psi(2S) polarization. Recent QCD calculations are found to be in good
agreement with our measurements. Combining the present result with the LHCb
J/psi measurements we determine the inclusive branching fraction B(b -> psi(2S)
X) = (2.73 +- 0.06 +- 0.16 +- 0.24) x 10^(-3), where the last uncertainty is
due to the B(b -> J/psi X), B(J/psi -> mu+ mu-) and B(psi(2S) -> e+ e-)
branching fraction uncertainties. All above results are corrected by an erratum
included as an appendix.

user history is available but there are no ratings - is the most typical
setting in real-world applications, it is much less researched than the
explicit feedback case. State-of-the-art algorithms that are efficient on the
explicit case cannot be straightforwardly transformed to the implicit case if
scalability should be maintained. There are few if any implicit feedback
benchmark datasets, therefore new ideas are usually experimented on explicit
benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a generic context-aware implicit feedback
recommender algorithm, coined iTALS. iTALS apply a fast, ALS-based tensor
factorization learning method that scales linearly with the number of non-zero
elements in the tensor. The method also allows us to incorporate diverse
context information into the model while maintaining its computational
efficiency. In particular, we present two such context-aware implementation
variants of iTALS. The first incorporates seasonality and enables to
distinguish user behavior in different time intervals. The other views the user
history as sequential information and has the ability to recognize usage
pattern typical to certain group of items, e.g. to automatically tell apart
product types or categories that are typically purchased repetitively
(collectibles, grocery goods) or once (household appliances). Experiments
performed on three implicit datasets (two proprietary ones and an implicit
variant of the Netflix dataset) show that by integrating context-aware
information with our factorization framework into the state-of-the-art implicit
recommender algorithm the recommendation quality improves significantly.
