for enhancing wireless power transfer between two current carrying coils. The
negative permeability slab serves to focus the flux generated in the source
coil to the receiver coil, thereby increasing the mutual inductive coupling
between the coils. The numerical model is compared with an analytical theory
that treats the coils as point dipoles separated by an infinite planar layer of
magnetic material [Urzhumov et al., Phys. Rev. B, 19, 8312 (2011)]. In the
limit of vanishingly small radius of the coils, and large width of the
metamaterial slab, the numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with
the analytical model. Both the idealized analytical and realistic numerical
models predict similar trends with respect to metamaterial loss and anisotropy.
Applying the numerical models, we further analyze the impact of finite coil
size and finite width of the slab. We find that, even for these less idealized
geometries, the presence of the magnetic slab greatly enhances the coupling
between the two coils, including cases where significant loss is present in the
slab. We therefore conclude that the integration of a metamaterial slab into a
wireless power transfer system holds promise for increasing the overall system
performance.

profile of a galaxy is tested using a sample of 65 cosmological
zoom-simulations of individual galaxies. The method only requires information
on the optical surface brightness and the projected velocity dispersion
profiles and therefore can be applied even in case of poor observational data.
In the simulated sample massive galaxies ($\sigma \simeq 200-400$ $\kms$) at
redshift $z=0$ have almost isothermal rotation curves for broad range of radii
(RMS $\simeq 5%$ for the circular speed deviations from a constant value over
$0.5R_{\rm eff} < r < 3R_{\rm eff}$). For such galaxies the method recovers the
unbiased value of the circular speed. The sample averaged deviation from the
true circular speed is less than $\sim 1%$ with the scatter of $\simeq 5-8%$
(RMS) up to $R \simeq 5R_{\rm eff}$. Circular speed estimates of massive
non-rotating simulated galaxies at higher redshifts ($z=1$ and $z=2$) are also
almost unbiased and with the same scatter. For the least massive galaxies in
the sample ($\sigma < 150$ $\kms$) at $z=0$ the RMS deviation is $\simeq 7-9%$
and the mean deviation is biased low by about $1-2%$. We also derive the
circular velocity profile from the hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) equation for
hot gas in the simulated galaxies. The accuracy of this estimate is about RMS
$\simeq 4-5%$ for massive objects ($M > 6.5\times 10^{12} M_\odot$) and the HE
estimate is biased low by $\simeq 3-4%$, which can be traced to the presence of
gas motions. This implies that the simple mass estimate can be used to
determine the mass of observed massive elliptical galaxies to an accuracy of
$5-8 %$ and can be very useful for galaxy surveys.

of the LHC, by analyzing the channels where the Higgs is produced from the
decay of a heavy fermion. The Higgs production from a singly-produced heavy
bottom, in particular, proves to be a promising channel. For a value \lambda=3
of the Higgs coupling to a heavy bottom, for example, we find that, considering
a 125 GeV Higgs which decays into a pair of b-quarks, a discovery is possible
at the 8 TeV LHC with 30 fb^{-1} if the heavy bottom is lighter than roughly
530 GeV (while an observation is possible for heavy bottom masses up to 650
GeV). Such a relatively light heavy bottom is realistic in composite Higgs
models of the type considered and, up to now, experimentally allowed. At
\sqrt{s}=14 TeV the LHC sensitivity on the channel increases significantly.
With \lambda=3 a discovery can occur, with 100 fb^{-1}, for heavy bottom masses
up to 1040 GeV. In the case the heavy bottom was as light as 500 GeV, the 14
TeV LHC would be sensitive to the measure of the \lambda\ coupling in basically
the full range \lambda>1 predicted by the theory.

non-solar isotopic signatures pointing to origins in supernovae, giant stars,
and possibly other stellar sources. There have been suggestions that some of
these grains condensed in the ejecta of classical nova outbursts, but the
evidence is ambiguous. We report neon and helium compositions in particles
captured on stratospheric collectors flown to sample materials from comets
26P/Grigg-Skjellerup and 55P/Tempel-Tuttle that point to condensation of their
gas carriers in the ejecta of a neon (ONe) nova. The absence of detectable 3He
in these particles indicates space exposure to solar wind (SW) irradiation of a
few decades at most, consistent with origins in cometary dust streams. Measured
4He/20Ne, 20Ne/22Ne, 21Ne/22Ne and 20Ne/21Ne isotope ratios, and a low upper
limit on 3He/4He, are in accord with calculations of nucleosynthesis in neon
nova outbursts. Of these, the uniquely low 4He/20Ne and high 20Ne/22Ne ratios
are the most diagnostic, reflecting the large predicted 20Ne abundances in the
ejecta of such novae. The correspondence of measured Ne and He compositions in
cometary matter with theoretical predictions is evidence for the presence of
presolar grains from novae in the early solar system.

magnetically ordered phase above the QCP, scattering and pairing decrease in
parallel as the system moves away from the QCP. Here we argue that a similar

a dramatic enhancement of the spontaneous emission coupling efficiency (the

investigate the influence of NLTE on the formation of atomic iron and titanium
lines in the J-band. With their enormous brightness at J-band red supergiant
stars are ideal probes of cosmic abundances. Recent LTE studies have found that
metallicities accurate to 0.15 dex can be determined from medium resolution
spectroscopy of individual red supergiants in galaxies as distant as 10 Mpc.
The non-LTE results obtained in this investigation support these findings.
Non-LTE abundance corrections for iron are smaller than 0.05 dex for effective
temperatures between 3400K to 4200K and 0.1 dex at 4400K. For titanium the
non-LTE abundance corrections vary smoothly between -0.4 dex and +0.2 dex as a
function of effective temperature. For both elements, the corrections also
depend on stellar gravity and metallicity. The physical reasons behind the
non-LTE corrections and the consequences for extragalactic J-band abundance
studies are discussed.

simulations of rotating iron core collapse. We assume octant symmetry and focus
on axisymmetric collapse, bounce, the early postbounce evolution, and the
associated gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino signals. We employ a
finite-temperature nuclear equation of state, parameterized electron capture in
the collapse phase, and a multi-species neutrino leakage scheme after bounce.
The latter captures the important effects of deleptonization, neutrino cooling
and heating and enables approximate predictions for the neutrino luminosities
in the early evolution after core bounce. We consider 12-solar-mass and
40-solar-mass presupernova models and systematically study the effects of (i)
rotation, (ii) progenitor structure, and (iii) postbounce neutrino leakage on
dynamics, GW, and, neutrino signals. We demonstrate, that the GW signal of
rapidly rotating core collapse is practically independent of progenitor mass
and precollapse structure. Moreover, we show that the effects of neutrino
leakage on the GW signal are strong only in nonrotating or slowly rotating
models in which GW emission is not dominated by inner core dynamics. In rapidly
rotating cores, core bounce of the centrifugally-deformed inner core excites
the fundamental quadrupole pulsation mode of the nascent protoneutron star. The
ensuing global oscillations (f~700-800 Hz) lead to pronounced oscillations in
the GW signal and correlated strong variations in the rising luminosities of
antineutrino and heavy-lepton neutrinos. We find these features in cores that
collapse to protoneutron stars with spin periods <~ 2.5 ms and rotational
energies sufficient to drive hyper-energetic core-collapse supernova
explosions. Hence, joint GW + neutrino observations of a core collapse event
could deliver strong evidence for or against rapid core rotation. [abridged]

detection and identification of any dark matter particle candidate leave room
to the possibility that the dark sector of the Universe be actually more
complex than it is normally assumed. In particular, more than one new
fundamental particle could be responsible for the observed dark matter density
in the Universe, and possible new interactions between dark energy and dark
matter might characterize the dark sector. In the present work, we investigate
the possibility that two dark matter particles exist in nature, with identical
physical properties except for the sign of their coupling constant to dark
energy. Extending previous works on similar scenarios, we study the evolution
of the background cosmology as well as the growth of linear density
perturbations for a wide range of parameters of such model. Interestingly, our
results show how the simple assumption that dark matter particles carry a
""charge"" with respect to their interaction with the dark energy field allows
for new long-range scalar forces of gravitational strength in the dark sector
without conflicting with present observations both at the background and linear
levels. Our scenario does not introduce new parameters with respect to the case
of a single dark matter species for which such strong dark interactions have
been already ruled out.

of mass loss due to tidal stripping, in both the dark matter only and the

of mergers in the growth of bulges in central galaxies in the LCDM scenario. We
seed galaxies within the growing CDM haloes using semi-empirical relations to
assign stellar and gaseous masses, and an analytic treatment to estimate the
transfer of stellar mass to the bulge of the remnant after a galaxy merger. We
find that this model roughly reproduces the observed correlation between the
bulge-to-total (B/T) mass ratio and stellar mass in present-day central
galaxies as well as their observed demographics, although low-mass B/T<0.1
(bulgeless) galaxies might be scarce relative to the observed abundance. In our
merger-driven scenario, bulges have a composite population made of (i) stars
acquired from infalling satellites, (ii) stars transferred from the primary
disc due to merger-induced perturbations, and (iii) newly formed stars in
starbursts triggered by mergers. We find that (i) and (ii) are the main
channels of mass assembly, with the first being dominant for massive galaxies,
creating large bulges with different stellar populations than those of the
inner discs, while the second is dominant for intermediate/low-mass galaxies
creating small bulges with similar stellar populations to the inner discs. We
associate the dominion of the first (second) channel to classical (pseudo)
bulges, and compare the predicted fractions to observations. We remark that our
treatment does not include other mechanisms of bulge growth such as intrinsic
secular disc instabilities or misaligned gas accretion. We find that the
evolution of the stellar and gaseous contents of the satellite as it moves
towards the central galaxy is a key ingredient in setting the morphology of the
remnant, and that a good match to the observed bulge demographics occurs when
this evolution proceeds closely to that of the central galaxy.

code, CMFGEN, which allowed those studies to be undertaken. The changes allow
for time-dependent radiative transfer of SN ejecta in homologous expansion. In
the modeling we treat the entire SN ejecta, from the innermost layer that does
not fall back on the compact remnant out to the progenitor surface layers. From
our non-LTE time-dependent line-blanketed synthetic spectra, we compute the
bolometric and multi-band light curves: light curves and spectra are thus
calculated simultaneously using the same physical processes and numerics. These
upgrades, in conjunction with our previous modifications which allow the
solution of the time dependent rate equations, will improve the modeling of SN
spectra and light curves, and hence facilitate new insights into SN ejecta
properties, the SN progenitors and the explosion mechanism(s). CMFGEN can now
be applied to the modeling of all SN types

vacuum dark fluid, associated with a time-dependent and spatially inhomogeneous
cosmological term. The vacuum dark fluid is defined in a model-independent way
by the symmetry of its stress-energy tensor, i.e., its invariance under Lorentz
boosts in a distinguished spatial direction ($p_r=-\rho$ for spherical
symmetry), which makes the dark fluid essentially anisotropic and allows its
density to evolve. The related cosmological models belong to the Lemaitre class
of models with anisotropic fluids and describe a universe with several scales
of vacuum energy related to phase transitions during its evolution. The typical
behavior of solutions and the number of spacetime horizons are determined by
the number of vacuum scales. We study in detail a model with three vacuum
scales: GUT, QCD and that responsible for the present accelerated expansion.
The model parameters are fixed by the observational data and by analyticity and
causality conditions. We find that our Universe has three horizons. During the
first inflation the Universe enters a T-region which makes the expansion
irreversible. After the second phase transition at the QCD scale the Universe
enters an R-region, where for a long time its geometry remains almost
pseudo-Euclidean. After crossing the third horizon related to the present
vacuum density, the Universe should enter the next T-region with inevitable
expansion.

the improved dynamics of loop quantum cosmology. Deparemeterizing the system
using the scalar field as internal time, we first identify a complete set of
phase space observables whose Poisson algebra is isomorphic to the su(1,1) Lie
algebra. It is generated by the volume observable and the Hamiltonian. These
observables describe faithfully the regularized phase space underlying the loop
quantization: they account for the polymerization of the variable conjugate to
the volume and for the existence of a kinematical non-vanishing minimum volume.
Since the Hamiltonian is an element in the su(1,1) Lie algebra, the dynamics is
now implemented as SU(1,1) transformations. At the quantum level, the system is
quantized as a time-like irreducible representation of the group SU(1,1). These
representations are labeled by a half-integer spin, which gives the minimal
volume. They provide superselection sectors without quantization anomalies and
no factor ordering ambiguity arises when representing the Hamiltonian. We then
explicitly construct SU(1,1) coherent states to study the quantum evolution.
They not only provide semiclassical states but truly dynamical coherent states.
Their use further clarifies the nature of the bounce that resolves the big bang
singularity.

Gaussian random variable, the probability distribution on $(q_1(X),...,q_m(X))$
does not have too much mass in any small box.
  Using this result, we prove improved versions of a number of results about
polynomial threshold functions, including producing better pseudorandom
generators, obtaining a better invariance principle, and proving improved

unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV luminosity (L_X = 1.6+-0.1*10^34 erg/s) is suggestive of
a neutron star primary; however, Source B exhibits unusual variability for a
LMXB, varying by over an order of magnitude on timescales of ~ 100 s. Source
C's spectrum contains a strong low-energy component below 1 keV. Its spectrum
is well fit to a simplified magnetic cataclysmic variable (CV) model, thus the
soft component may be explained by a hot polar cap of a magnetic CV. Source D
has an average L_X (0.5-10 keV) ~ 9*10^32 erg/s, and its spectrum is well fit

star LXMB, suggesting Source D may be the third known LMXB in NGC 6652. Source

and of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bands as tracers of the

N and Enuc S). We estimated a photoelectric gas heating efficiency
([CII]158um+[OI]63um)/PAH in the ring about 50% lower than in Enuc N and S. The
average 11.3/7.7um PAH ratio is also lower in the ring, which may suggest a
larger fraction of ionized PAHs, but no clear correlation with
[CII]158{\mu}m/PAH(5.5 - 14um) is found. PAHs in the ring are responsible for a
factor of two more [CII]158um and [OI]63um emission per unit mass than PAHs in
the Enuc S. SED modeling indicates that at most 25% of the FIR power in the
ring and Enuc S can come from high intensity photodissociation regions (PDRs),
in which case G0 ~ 10^2.3 and nH ~ 10^3.5 cm^-3 in the ring. For these values
of G0 and nH PDR models cannot reproduce the observed H2 emission. Much of the
the H2 emission in the starburst ring could come from warm regions in the

relaxed version of the maximum likelihood decoding problem can be stated as a
linear program (LP). This LP decoder can be used to decode error-correcting
codes at bit-error-rates comparable to state-of-the-art belief propagation (BP)
decoders, but with significantly stronger theoretical guarantees. However, LP
decoding when implemented with standard LP solvers does not easily scale to the
block lengths of modern error correcting codes. In this paper we draw on
decomposition methods from optimization theory, specifically the Alternating
Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM), to develop efficient distributed
algorithms for LP decoding.
  The key enabling technical result is a ""two-slice"" characterization of the
geometry of the parity polytope, which is the convex hull of all codewords of a
single parity check code. This new characterization simplifies the
representation of points in the polytope. Using this simplification, we develop
an efficient algorithm for Euclidean norm projection onto the parity polytope.
This projection is required by ADMM and allows us to use LP decoding, with all
its theoretical guarantees, to decode large-scale error correcting codes
efficiently.
  We present numerical results for LDPC codes of lengths more than 1000. The
waterfall region of LP decoding is seen to initiate at a slightly higher
signal-to-noise ratio than for sum-product BP, however an error floor is not
observed for LP decoding, which is not the case for BP. Our implementation of
LP decoding using ADMM executes as fast as our baseline sum-product BP decoder,
is fully parallelizable, and can be seen to implement a type of message-passing
with a particularly simple schedule.

noticed toward the central ionized area, probably due to low grain alignment
efficiency caused by the turbulent environment and/or weak intensity of
magnetic fields. The distortion of magnetic field lines exhibit a dual
behavior, with the mean orientation outside the area approximately following
the borders of the star-forming region, and directed radially toward the

can be solved in polynomial time via semidefinite programming (SDP). We also
show that the SDP can be approximated by an l1-regularized least-squares

much larger problems. We compare both SDP and l1-based approaches with

non-parametric estimators approximating controllability and observability
energy functions for nonlinear systems, and study the ellipsoids they induce.
In all cases the relevant quantities are estimated from simulated or observed

faster than their classical counterparts, but some technical hurdles remain.
Here we consider methods to make proposed chemical simulation algorithms
computationally fast on fault-tolerant quantum computers in the circuit model.
Fault tolerance constrains the choice of available gates, so that arbitrary
gates required for a simulation algorithm must be constructed from sequences of
fundamental operations. We examine techniques for constructing arbitrary gates
which perform substantially faster than circuits based on the conventional
Solovay-Kitaev algorithm [C.M. Dawson and M.A. Nielsen, \emph{Quantum Inf.
Comput.}, \textbf{6}:81, 2006]. For a given approximation error $\epsilon$,
arbitrary single-qubit gates can be produced fault-tolerantly and using a
limited set of gates in time which is $O(\log \epsilon)$ or $O(\log \log
\epsilon)$; with sufficient parallel preparation of ancillas, constant average
depth is possible using a method we call programmable ancilla rotations.
Moreover, we construct and analyze efficient implementations of first- and
second-quantized simulation algorithms using the fault-tolerant arbitrary gates
and other techniques, such as implementing various subroutines in constant
time. A specific example we analyze is the ground-state energy calculation for
Lithium hydride.

artificial viscosity to nonlinear systems of conservation laws which propagate
shock waves, rarefactions, and contact discontinuities, which we call the
$C$-method. We shall focus our attention on the compressible Euler equations in
one space dimension. The novel feature of our approach involves the coupling of
a linear scalar reaction-diffusion equation to our system of conservation laws,
whose solution $C(x,t)$ is the coefficient to an additional (and artificial)
term added to the flux, which determines the location, localization, and
strength of the artificial viscosity. Near shock discontinuities, $C(x,t)$ is
large and localized, and transitions smoothly in space-time to zero away from
discontinuities. Our approach is a provably convergent, spacetime-regularized
variant of the original idea of Richtmeyer and Von Neumann, and is provided at
the level of the PDE, thus allowing a host of numerical discretization schemes
to be employed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the $C$-method with three
different numerical implementations and apply these to a collection of
classical problems: the Sod shock-tube, the Osher-Shu shock-tube, the
Woodward-Colella blast wave and the Leblanc shock-tube. First, we use a
classical continuous finite-element implementation using second-order
discretization in both space and time, FEM-C. Second, we use a simplified WENO
scheme within our $C$-method framework, WENO-C. Third, we use WENO with the
Lax-Friedrichs flux together with the $C$-equation, and call this WENO-LF-C.
All three schemes yield higher-order discretization strategies, which provide
sharp shock resolution with minimal overshoot and noise, and compare well with
higher-order WENO schemes that employ approximate Riemann solvers,
outperforming them for the difficult Leblanc shock tube experiment.

supernova (SN). Its lightcurves in both the prompt and afterglow phases are
similar to GRB 060614, a nearby long GRB without an associated SN. We analyze
the observational data of this event and discuss the possible origins of its
multi-wavelength emission. We show that its joint lightcurve at 1 keV derived
from Swift BAT and XRT observations is composed of two distinguished
components. The first component, whose spectrum is extremely soft (\Gamma =
4.32), ends with a steep decay segment, indicating the internal origin of this
component. The second component is a slowly-rising, broad bump which peaks at
~10^5 seconds post the BAT trigger. Assuming that the late bump is due to onset
of the afterglow, we derive the initial Lorentz factor (Gamma_0) of the GRB
fireball and find that it significantly deviates from the relation between the
Gamma_0 and Eiso of typical GRBs. We also check whether it follows the same
anti-correlation between X-ray luminosity and the break time observed in the
shallow decay phase of many typical GRBs, which is usually regarded as a signal
of late energy injection from the GRB central engine. However, we find that it
does not obey this correlation. We propose that the late bump could be
contributed by a two-component jet. We fit the second component with an
off-axis jet model for a constant medium density and find the late bump can be
represented by the model. The derived jet half-opening angle is 0.30 rad and
the viewing angle is 0.315 rad. The medium density is 0.05 cm^-3, possibly
suggesting that it may be from a merger of compact stars. The similarity
between GRBs 060614 and 100418A may indicate that the two GRBs are from the
same population and the late bump observed in the two GRBs may be a signal of a
two-component jet powered by the GRB central engine.

with FOCAS on Subaru 8.2m telescope under a photometric condition (seeing
0.3""-0.4"") on 2010 May 14 (UT). The date corresponds to 25.6 days after the
burst trigger (15.8 days in the restframe). We did imaging observations in V,
Rc, and Ic bands, and two hours of spectrophotometric observations. We got the
resolved host galaxy image which elongated 1.6"" (= 11 kpc) from north to south.
No point source was detected on the host galaxy. The time variation of Rc-band
magnitude shows that the afterglow of GRB 100418A has faded to Rc \sim > 24
without SN like rebrightening, when we compare our measurement to the reports
in GCN circulars. We could not identify any SN feature such as broad
emission-lines or bumps in our spectrum. Assuming the SN is fainter than the
3{\sigma} noise spectrum of our observation, we estimate the upper limit on the
SN absolute magnitude MIc,obs > -17.2 in observer frame Ic-band. This magnitude
is comparable to the faintest type Ic SNe. We also estimate host galaxy
properties from the spectrum. The host galaxy of GRB 100418A is relatively
massive (log M_{star}/M_{sun} = 9.54) compared to typical long GRB host
galaxies, and has 12+log(O/H) = 8.75.

kinematic formulas for invariant valuations and invariant curvature measures in
these spaces. In addition to new and more efficient framings of the tube

new formula expressing the volumes of the tubes about a totally real

of invariant angular curvature measures, suggesting the possibility that a
similar phenomenon holds for all Riemannian manifolds. We conclude with a
number of open questions and conjectures.

introduced via real random hopping terms for chO and chS, while complex random
phases generate the disorder in the chiral unitary model. In the latter case an
additional spatially constant, perpendicular magnetic field is also applied.
Using a transfer-matrix-method, we numerically calculate the smallest Lyapunov

the localization length at the quantum critical point at E=0 is obtained. We
always find for the critical exponent \kappa, which governs the energy

the exponent \kappa=1/2 found previously for a chiral unitary model in the

effectively restoring particle-hole symmetry even though a magnetic field

plane with a finite subgraph B of G; we call B a basis of G. We introduce a
two-parameter graph polynomial P_B(q,v) that depends on B and its embedding in
G. The algebraic curve P_B(q,v) = 0 is shown to provide an approximation to the
critical manifold of the q-state Potts model, with coupling v = exp(K)-1,
defined on G. This curve predicts the phase diagram both in the ferromagnetic
(v>0) and antiferromagnetic (v<0) regions. For larger bases B the
approximations become increasingly accurate, and we conjecture that P_B(q,v) =
0 provides the exact critical manifold in the limit of infinite B. Furthermore,
for some lattices G, or for the Ising model (q=2) on any G, P_B(q,v) factorises
for any choice of B: the zero set of the recurrent factor then provides the
exact critical manifold. In this sense, the computation of P_B(q,v) can be used
to detect exact solvability of the Potts model on G.
  We illustrate the method for the square lattice, where the Potts model has
been exactly solved, and the kagome lattice, where it has not. For the square
lattice we correctly reproduce the known phase diagram, including the
antiferromagnetic transition and the singularities in the Berker-Kadanoff
phase. For the kagome lattice, taking the smallest basis with six edges we
recover a well-known (but now refuted) conjecture of F.Y. Wu. Larger bases
provide successive improvements on this formula, giving a natural extension of
Wu's approach. The polynomial predictions are in excellent agreement with
numerical computations. For v>0 the accuracy of the predicted critical coupling
v_c is of the order 10^{-4} or 10^{-5} for the 6-edge basis, and improves to
10^{-6} or 10^{-7} for the largest basis studied (with 36 edges).

regions and displays a high level of massive star feedback. We used SPIRE and
PACS onboard of Herschel to map the full spatial extent of the clouds in the
Carina Nebula complex at wavelengths between 70 and 500 micrometer. We
determine color temperatures and column densities of the clouds in the complex.
Our Herschel maps show that the clouds have a very complex and filamentary
structure that is dominated by the radiation and wind feedback from the massive
stars. In most locations, the column density of the clouds is N_H < 2x10^22
cm^-2; denser cloud structures are restricted to just a few locations. We find
a clear large scale temperature gradient from 35-40 K in the central region to
<20 K at the periphery and in the densest parts of individual pillars. The
total mass of the clouds seen by Herschel in the central (1 deg radius) region
is ~656000 M_sun. A simple radiative transfer model for the global spectral
energy distribution suggests that the total mass of all the gas (including a
warmer component that is not well traced by Herschel) is <=890000 M_sun.
Despite the strong feedback from numerous massive stars that is going on since
several million years, there are still several 10000 M_sun of cool cloud
material present at column-densities sufficient for further star formation.
Comparison of our total gas mass estimates to molecular cloud masses derived
from CO line mapping suggests that as much as about 75% of all the gas is in
atomic rather than molecular form.

precisely those methods that use a discrepancy and a regularization functional.
While several sets of sufficient conditions are known to obtain a
regularization method, we start with an investigation of the converse question:
How could necessary conditions for a variational method to provide a
regularization method look like? To this end, we formalize the notion of a
variational scheme and start with comparison of three different instances of
variational methods. Then we focus on the data space model and investigate the
role and interplay of the topological structure, the convergence notion and the
discrepancy functional. Especially, we deduce necessary conditions for the
discrepancy functional to fulfill usual continuity assumptions. The results are
applied to discrepancy functionals given by Bregman distances and especially to
the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

epidemic dynamics in contact process. We first find that the variability
difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous networks is very narrow,
although the heterogeneous structures can induce the lighter prevalence.
Contrary to non-community networks, strong community structures can cause the
secondary outbreak of prevalence and two peaks of variability appeared.
Especially in the local community, the extraordinarily large variability in
early stage of the outbreak makes the prediction of epidemic spreading hard.
Importantly, the bridgeness plays a significant role in the predictability,
meaning the further distance of the initial seed to the bridgeness, the less
accurate the predictability is. Also, we investigate the effect of different
disease reaction mechanisms on variability, and find that the different
reaction mechanisms will result in the distinct variabilities at the end of
epidemic spreading.

in disordered Hubbard chains, contacted to semi-infinite leads. The chains are
described via the repulsive Anderson-Hubbard Hamiltonian, using static and
time-dependent lattice density-functional theory. The dynamical behavior of our
quantum transport system is performed via an integration scheme available in
the literature, which we modify via the recursive Lanczos method, to increase
its efficiency. To quantify the degree of localization due to disorder and
interactions, we adapt the definition of the inverse participation ratio to
obtain an indicator which is both suitable for quantum transport geometries and
which can be obtained within density-functional theory. Lattice density
functional theories are reviewed and, for contacted chains, we analyze the
merits and limits of the coherent-potential approximation in describing the
spectral properties, with interactions included via lattice density functional
theory. Our approach appears to able to capture complex features due to the
competition between disorder and interactions. Specifically, we find a
dynamical enhancement of delocalization in presence of a finite bias, and an
increase of the steady-state current induced by inter-particle interactions.
This behavior is corroborated by results for the time-dependent densities and
for the inverse participation ratio. Using short isolated chains with
interaction and disorder, a brief comparative analysis between time-dependent
density-functional theory and exact results is then given, followed by general
conclusive remarks.

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/751/2/88",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The development of multi-layer optics which allow to focus photons up to 100
keV and more promises an enormous jump in sensitivity in the hard X-ray energy
band. This technology is already planned to be exploited by future missions
dedicated to spectroscopy and imaging at energies >10 keV, e.g. Astro-H and
NuSTAR. Nevertheless, our understanding of the hard X-ray sky would greatly
benefit from carrying out contemporaneous polarimetric measurements, because
the study of hard spectral tails and of polarized emission often are two
complementary diagnostics of the same non-thermal and acceleration processes.
At energies above a few tens of keV, the preferred technique to detect
polarization involves the determination of photon directions after a Compton
scattering. Many authors have asserted that stacked detectors with imaging
capabilities can be exploited for this purpose. If it is possible to
discriminate those events which initially interact in the first detector by
Compton scattering and are subsequently absorbed by the second layer, the
direction of scattering is singled out from the hit pixels in the two
detectors. In this paper we give the first detailed discussion of the
sensitivity of such a generic design to the X-ray polarization. The efficiency
and the modulation factor are calculated analytically from the geometry of the
instruments and then compared with the performance as derived by means of
Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations.

  geometrodynamics","117 pages, 2 tables, 10 figures, PhD thesis",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this PhD thesis, we develop a new approach to classical gravity starting
from Mach's principles and the idea that the local shape of spatial
configurations is fundamental. This new theory, ""shape dynamics"", is equivalent
to general relativity but differs in an important respect: shape dynamics is a
theory of dynamic conformal 3-geometry, not a theory of spacetime. Equivalence
is achieved by trading foliation invariance for local conformal invariance (up
to a global scale). After the trading, what is left is a gauge theory invariant
under 3d diffeomorphisms and conformal transformations that preserve the volume
of space. The local canonical constraints are linear and the constraint algebra
closes with structure constants. Shape dynamics, thus, provides a novel new
starting point for quantum gravity.
  The procedure for the trading of symmetries was inspired by a technique
called ""best matching"". We explain best matching and its relation to Mach's
principles. The key features of best matching are illustrated through finite
dimensional toy models. A general picture is then established where relational
theories are treated as gauge theories on configuration space. Shape dynamics
is then constructed by applying best matching to conformal geometry. We then
study shape dynamics in more detail by computing its Hamiltonian and
Hamilton-Jacobi functional perturbatively.
  This thesis is intended as a pedagogical but complete introduction to shape
dynamics and the Machian ideas that led to its discovery. The reader is
encouraged to start with the introduction, which gives a conceptual outline and
links to the relevant sections in the text for a more rigorous exposition. When
full rigor is lacking, references to the literature are given. It is hoped that
this thesis may provide a starting point for anyone interested in learning
about shape dynamics.

approach for validating the complexity of nonlinear PCA models by using the
error in missing data estimation as a criterion for model selection. It is
motivated by the idea that only the model of optimal complexity is able to
predict missing values with the highest accuracy. While standard test set
validation usually favours over-fitted nonlinear PCA models, the proposed model
validation approach correctly selects the optimal model complexity.

confidence. More recently, we carefully examined energy spacings for these same

Solar System. Their physical properties provide constraints to the models of
formation and evolution of the various dynamical classes of objects in the
outer Solar System. Based on a sample of 19 classical TNOs we determine
radiometric sizes, geometric albedos and beaming parameters. Our sample is
composed of both dynamically hot and cold classicals. We study the correlations
of diameter and albedo of these two subsamples with each other and with orbital
parameters, spectral slopes and colors. We have done three-band photometric
observations with Herschel/PACS and we use a consistent method for data
reduction and aperture photometry of this sample to obtain monochromatic flux
densities at 70.0, 100.0 and 160.0 \mu m. Additionally, we use Spitzer/MIPS
flux densities at 23.68 and 71.42 \mu m when available, and we present new
Spitzer flux densities of eight targets. We derive diameters and albedos with
the near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM). As auxiliary data we use
reexamined absolute visual magnitudes from the literature and data bases, part
of which have been obtained by ground based programs in support of our Herschel
key program. We have determined for the first time radiometric sizes and
albedos of eight classical TNOs, and refined previous size and albedo estimates
or limits of 11 other classicals. The new size estimates of 2002 MS4 and 120347
Salacia indicate that they are among the 10 largest TNOs known. Our new results
confirm the recent findings that there are very diverse albedos among the
classical TNOs and that cold classicals possess a high average albedo (0.17 +/-
0.04). Diameters of classical TNOs strongly correlate with orbital inclination
in our sample. We also determine the bulk densities of six binary TNOs.

behaviors stem from the hierarchical geographical network structure. On this
view, we focus on epidemic spreading in the hierarchical geographical networks,
and study how two distinct contact patterns (i. e., homogeneous time delay
(HOTD) and heterogeneous time delay (HETD) associated with geographical
distance) influence the spreading speed and the variability of outbreaks. We
find that, compared with HOTD and null model, correlations between time delay
and network hierarchy in HETD remarkably slow down epidemic spreading, and
result in a upward cascading multi-modal phenomenon. Proportionately, the
variability of outbreaks in HETD has the lower value, but several comparable
peaks for a long time, which makes the long-term prediction of epidemic
spreading hard. When a seed (i. e., the initial infected node) is from the high
layers of networks, epidemic spreading is remarkably promoted. Interestingly,
distinct trends of variabilities in two contact patterns emerge: high-layer
seeds in HOTD result in the lower variabilities, the case of HETD is opposite.
More importantly, the variabilities of high-layer seeds in HETD are much
greater than that in HOTD, which implies the unpredictability of epidemic
spreading in hierarchical geographical networks.

The fact that important fractions of the orbits that arise in potentials

Alternatively, it has been difficult to build selfconsistent models of
elliptical galaxies that include significant fractions of chaotic orbits and,
at the same time, are stable. That is specially true for cuspy models of
elliptical galaxies which seem to best represent real galaxies. I argue here
that there is no physical impediment to build such models and that the
difficulty lies in the method of Schwarzschild, widely used to obtain such
models. Actually, I show that there is no problem in obtaining selfconsistent
models of elliptical galaxies, even cuspy ones, that contain very high
fractions of chaotic orbits and are, nevertheless, highly stable over time
intervals of the order of a Hubble time.

measurements the state of a quantum system, based on the a priori side
information that the true state is one of two given and completely known
states, rho or sigma. In general, it is not possible to decide the identity of
the true state with certainty, and the optimal measurement strategy depends on
whether the two possible errors (mistaking rho for sigma, or the other way
around) are treated as of equal importance or not. Results on the quantum
Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds and the quantum Stein's lemma show that, if
several copies of the system are available then the optimal error probabilities
decay exponentially in the number of copies, and the decay rate is given by a
certain statistical distance between rho and sigma (the Chernoff distance, the
Hoeffding distances, and the relative entropy, respectively). While these
results provide a complete solution to the asymptotic problem, they are not
completely satisfying from a practical point of view. Indeed, in realistic
scenarios one has access only to finitely many copies of a system, and
therefore it is desirable to have bounds on the error probabilities for finite
sample size. In this paper we provide finite-size bounds on the so-called Stein
errors, the Chernoff errors, the Hoeffding errors and the mixed error
probabilities related to the Chernoff and the Hoeffding errors.

a hard-to-soft evolution pattern was identified in the 2nd pulse of 2 GRBs

pulses tend to be more asymmetric than the intensity-tracking ones, with a
steeper rising wing than the falling wing. Short GRBs have $E_{\rm p}$ tracking
intensity exclusively with the 16ms time resolution analysis. We performed a
simulation analysis, and suggest that at least for some bursts, the late
intensity-tracking pulses could be a consequence of overlapping hard-to-soft

first pulse of multi-pulse long GRBs and some single-pulse GRBs suggest that
intensity tracking is an independent component, which may operate in some late

that the scatter of the correlation is comparable to that of the global

theoretical quantities, if the dihedral group D14 plays the role of a flavor
symmetry. We extend a supersymmetric D14 model to the lepton sector and show
that theta^nu_13 and the deviation of theta^nu_23 from maximal mixing in the
neutrino sector originate, similar to the Cabibbo angle in the quark sector,
from a mismatch of different subgroups of D14 and are of the size of the
Cabibbo angle. The mixing angles in the charged lepton sector are small. Thus,
the lepton mixing angle theta^l_13 is naturally in its experimentally preferred
range and theta^l_23 within its 3 sigma range. The solar mixing angle is of
order one and the charged lepton mass hierarchy is correctly reproduced.
Leading order results are only slightly perturbed, if next-to-leading order
corrections are taken into account.

dynamical and quenched configurations. We show that in the continuum limit both
the static and full quark propagator are multiplicatively renormalizable. From
the propagator we extract the quark renormalization function Z(|p|) and the
running mass M(|p|) and extrapolate the latter to the chiral limit. We find
that M(|p|) practically coincides with the corresponding Landau gauge function
for small momenta. The computation of M(|p|) can be however made more efficient
in Coulomb gauge; this can lead to a better determination of the chiral mass
and the quark anomalous dimension. Moreover from the structure of the full
propagator we can read off an expression for the dispersion relation of quarks,
compatible with an IR divergent effective energy. If confirmed on larger
volumes this finding would allow to extend the Gribov-Zwanziger confinement
mechanism to the fermionic sector of QCD.

a compact object moving through a uniform medium at Mach 3. Previous
three-dimensional simulations have shown that such accretion is not stable, and
that strong rotational 'disk-like' flows are generated and accreted on short
time scales. We re-address this problem using overset spherical grids that
provide a factor of seven improvement in spatial resolution over previous
simulations. With our higher spatial resolution we found these 3D accretion
flows remained remarkably axisymmetric. We examined two cases of accretion with
different sized accretors. The larger accretor produced very steady flow, with
the mass accretion rate varying by less than 0.02% over 30 flow times. The
smaller accretor exhibited an axisymmetric breathing mode that modulated the
mass accretion rate by a constant 20%. Nonetheless, the flow remained highly
axisymmetric with only negligible accretion of angular momentum in both cases.

determine that a wave packet effectively jumps ahead as it passes through a
soliton, emerging with a wavelength-dependent forward translation in comparison
to its motion in absence of the soliton. From this and from the full theory's
exact momentum conservation, we deduce that post-Bogoliubov back-reaction must
include a commensurate forward advance by the soliton itself. We quantify this
effect with a simple theory, and confirm that it agrees with full numerical
solution of the classical nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. We briefly discuss
the implications of this effect for quantum behavior of solitons in
quasi-condensed dilute gases at finite temperature.

(LAEs) can provide clues in the study of their high-redshift analogues. At $z
\sim 0.3$, LAEs are bright enough to be detected over almost the entire
electromagnetic spectrum and it is possible to carry out a more precise and
complete study than at higher redshifts. In this study, we examine the UV and
IR emission, dust attenuation, SFR and morphology of a sample of 23
GALEX-discovered star-forming (SF) LAEs at $z \sim 0.3$ with direct UV (GALEX),
optical (ACS) and FIR (PACS and MIPS) data. Using the same UV and IR limiting
luminosities, we find that LAEs at $z\sim 0.3$ tend to be less dusty, have
slightly higher total SFRs, have bluer UV continuum slopes, and are much
smaller than other galaxies that do not exhibit Ly$\alpha$ emission in their
spectrum (non-LAEs). These results suggest that at $z \sim 0.3$ Ly$\alpha$
photons tend to escape from small galaxies with low dust attenuation. Regarding
their morphology, LAEs belong to Irr/merger classes, unlike non-LAEs. Size and
morphology represent the most noticeable difference between LAEs and non-LAEs
at $z \sim 0.3$. Furthermore, the comparison of our results with those obtained
at higher redshifts indicates that either the Ly$\alpha$ technique picks up
different kind of galaxies at different redshifts or that the physical
properties of LAEs are evolving with redshift.

gravity theories separately, i.e., DGP Brane gravity and Loop Quantum gravity.
Two types of dark energy fluids, namely, Modified Chaplygin gas and Generalised
Cosmic Chaplygin gas are considered for each model. Graphs are drawn to
characterize the nature and the probable outcome of gravitational collapse. A
comparative study is done between the collapsing process in the two different
gravity theories. It is found that in case of dark matter, there is a great
possibility of collapse and consequent formation of Black hole. In case of dark
energy possibility of collapse is far lesser compared to the other cases, due
to the large negative pressure of dark energy component. There is an increase
in mass of the cloud in case of dark matter collapse due to matter
accumulation. The mass decreases considerably in case of dark energy due to
dark energy accretion on the cloud. In case of collapse with a combination of
dark energy and dark matter, it is found that in the absence of interaction
there is a far better possibility of formation of black hole in DGP brane model
compared to Loop quantum cosmology model.

by Caianiello 30 years ago based on the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. Many
consequences of this hypothesis have been studied, but until now, there has
been no evidence that boundedness of the acceleration may lead to quantum
behavior. In previous research, we predicted the existence of a universal
maximal acceleration and developed a new dynamics for which all admissible
solutions have an acceleration bounded by the maximal one. Based on W.
K\""{u}ndig's experiment, as reanalyzed by Kholmetskii et al, we estimated its
value to be of the order $10^{19}m/s^2$.
  We present here a solution of our dynamical equation for a classical
hydrogen-like atom and show that this dynamics leads to some aspects of quantum
behavior. We show that the position of an electron in a hydrogen-like atom can
be described only probabilistically. We also show that in this model, the
notion of ""center of mass"" must be modified. This modification supports the
non-existence of a magnetic moment in the atom and explains the relevance of
the conformal group in the quantum region.
