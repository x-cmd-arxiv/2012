the carbuncle phenomena in simulating high Mach number flow, and the inaccurate
pressure profile in simulating low Mach number flow. We introduced two simple
low-Mach-number modifications for the classical Roe flux to decrease the
difference between the acoustic and advection contributions of the numerical
dissipation. While the first modification increases the local numerical
dissipation, the second decreases it. The numerical tests on the double-Mach
reflection problem show that both modifications eliminate the kinked Mach stem
suffered by the original flux. These results suggest that, other than
insufficient numerical dissipation near the shock front, the carbuncle
phenomena is strongly relevant to the non-comparable acoustic and advection
contributions of the numerical dissipation produced by Godunov schemes due to
the low Mach number effect.

protons) at collisionless shocks predicted to exist in the vicinity of solar
flares. The existence of standing termination shocks has been examined by flare
models and numerical simulations e.g., Shibata,Forbes. We study electron
energization by numerically integrating the equations of motion of a large
number of test-particle electrons in the time-dependent two-dimensional
electric and magnetic fields generated from hybrid simulations (kinetic ions
and fluid electron) using parameters typical of the solar flare plasma
environment. The shock is produced by injecting plasma flow toward a rigid
piston. Large-scale magnetic fluctuations -- known to exist in plasmas and
known to have important effects on the nonthermal electron acceleration at
shocks -- are also included in our simulations. For the parameters
characteristic of the flaring region, our calculations suggest that the
termination shock formed in the reconnection outflow region (above post-flare
loops) could accelerate electrons to a kinetic energy of a few MeV within 100
ion cyclotron periods, which is of the order of a millisecond. Given a
sufficient turbulence amplitude level ($\delta B^2/B_0^2 \sim 0.3$), about 10%
of thermal test-particle electrons are accelerated to more than 15 keV. We find
that protons are also accelerated, but not to as high energy in the available
time and the energy spectra are considerably steeper than that of the electrons
for the parameters used in our simulations. Our results are qualitatively
consistent with the observed hard X-ray emissions in solar flares.

  Nature",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002785",,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Molecular clock (MC) is a central concept of molecular evolution according to
which each gene evolves at a characteristic, near constant rate. Numerous
evolutionary studies have demonstrated the validity of MC but also have shown
that MC is substantially overdispersed, i.e. lineage-specific deviations of the
evolutionary rate of the given gene from the clock greatly exceed the
expectation from the sampling error. A fundamental observation of comparative
genomics that appears to complement the MC is that the distribution of
evolution rates across orthologous genes in pairs of related genomes remains
virtually unchanged throughout the evolution of life, from bacteria to mammals.
The conservation of this distribution implies that the relative evolution rates
of all genes remain nearly constant, or in other words, that evolutionary rates
of different genes are strongly correlated within each evolving genome. We
hypothesized that this correlation is not a simple consequence of MC but could
be better explained by a model we dubbed Universal PaceMaker (UPM) of genome
evolution. The UPM model posits that the rate of evolution changes
synchronously across genome-wide sets of genes in all evolving lineages. We
sought to differentiate between the MC and UPM models by fitting thousands of
phylogenetic trees for bacterial and archaeal genes to supertrees that reflect
the dominant trend of vertical descent in the evolution of archaea and bacteria
and that were constrained according to the two models. The goodness of fit for
the UPM model was better than the fit for the MC model, with overwhelming
statistical significance. These results reveal a universal pacemaker of genome
evolution that could have been in operation throughout the history of life.

adatom exactly, indirect magnetic (RKKY) exchange is taken into account on an
approximate level only. Here, we consider a simplified model system consisting
of two magnetic Hubbard sites (""adatoms"") hybridizing with a non-interacting
tight-binding chain (""substrate surface""). This two-impurity Anderson model
incorporates the competition between the Kondo effect and indirect exchange but
is amenable to an exact numerical solution via the density-matrix

coupling between the two adatoms and for the magnetic properties induced in the

of an electron spin surrounded by a bath of nuclear spins in a non-Markovian
approach using a generalized master equation. Considering a general form of the
hyperfine interaction, we are able to extend the range of validity of our
results to other systems beyond graphene. For large external magnetic fields,
we find within Born approximation that the electron spin state is conserved up
to small corrections, which oscillate with a frequency determined by the
hyperfine interaction. The amplitude of these oscillations decays with a power
law, where its initial value depends on the specific form of the anisotropy.
Analyzing this in more detail, we identify two distinct classes of anisotropy,

performed with the code EvoL we produce twelve self-similar models of
early-type galaxies of different initial masses and over-densities, following
their evolution from z \geq 20 down to z \leq 1. The simulations include
radiative cooling, star formation, stellar energy feedback, a reionizing
photoheating background, and chemical enrichment of the ISM. We find a strong
correlation between the initial properties of the proto-haloes and their star
formation histories. Massive (10^13M\odot) haloes experience a single, intense
burst of star formation (with rates \geq 10^3M\odot/yr) at early epochs,
consistently with observations, with a less pronounced dependence on the
initial over-density; intermediate mass (10^11M\odot) haloes histories strongly
depend on their initial over-density, whereas small (10^9M\odot) haloes always
have fragmented histories, resulting in multiple stellar populations, due to
the ""galactic breathing"" phenomenon. The galaxy models have morphological,
structural and photometric properties comparable to real galaxies, often
closely matching the observed data; even though some disagreement is still
there, likely a consequence of some numerical choices. We conclude that
internal properties are essentially sufficient to explain many of the observed
features of early type galaxies, particularly the complicated and different
star formation histories shown by haloes of very different mass. In this
picture, nature seems to play the dominant role, whereas nurture has a
secondary importance.

verification-based (NB-VB) recovery algorithms over irregular graphs in the
context of compressed sensing. Verification-based algorithms are particularly
interesting due to their low complexity (linear in the signal dimension $n$).
The analysis predicts the average fraction of unverified signal elements at
each iteration $\ell$ where the average is taken over the ensembles of input
signals and sensing matrices. The analysis is asymptotic ($n \rightarrow
\infty$) and is similar in nature to the well-known density evolution technique
commonly used to analyze iterative decoding algorithms. Compared to the
existing technique for the analysis of NB-VB algorithms, which is based on
numerically solving a large system of coupled differential equations, the
proposed method is much simpler and more accurate. This allows us to design
irregular sensing graphs for such recovery algorithms. The designed irregular
graphs outperform the corresponding regular graphs substantially. For example,
for the same recovery complexity per iteration, we design irregular graphs that
can recover up to about 40% more non-zero signal elements compared to the
regular graphs. Simulation results are also provided which demonstrate that the
proposed asymptotic analysis matches the performance of recovery algorithms for
large but finite values of $n$.

Zelevinsky), one associates to each acyclic directed graph a family of
sequences of natural integers, one for each vertex; this construction is called
a {\em frieze}; these sequences are given by nonlinear recursions (with
division), and the fact that they are integers is a consequence of the Laurent
phenomenon of Fomin and Zelevinsky. If the sequences satisfy a linear recursion
with constant coefficients, then the graph must be a Dynkin diagram or an
extended Dynkin diagram, with an acyclic orientation. The converse also holds:
the sequences of the frieze associated to an oriented Dynkin or Euclidean
diagram satisfy linear recursions, and are even $\mathbb N$-rational. One uses
in the proof objects called $SL_2$-{\em tilings of the plane}, which are
fillings of the discrete plane such that each adjacent 2 by 2 minor is equal to
1. These objects, which have applications in the theory of cluster algebras,

brightness of the galaxies used to measure the ellipticity: In several studies,
the amplitude of the inferred shear falls sharply with decreasing source
significance. This dependence limits the overall ability of upcoming large
weak-lensing surveys to constrain cosmological parameters.
  We seek to provide a concise overview of the impact of pixel noise on
weak-lensing measurements, covering the entire path from noisy images to shear
estimates. We show that there are at least three distinct layers, where pixel
noise not only obscures but biases the outcome of the measurements: 1) the
propagation of pixel noise to the non-linear observable ellipticity; 2) the
response of the shape-measurement methods to limited amount of information
extractable from noisy images; and 3) the reaction of shear estimation
statistics to the presence of noise and outliers in the measured ellipticities.
  We identify and discuss several fundamental problems and show that each of
them is able to introduce biases in the range of a few tenths to a few percent
for galaxies with typical significance levels. Furthermore, all of these biases
do not only depend on the brightness of galaxies but also on their ellipticity,
with more elliptical galaxies often being harder to measure correctly. We also
discuss existing possibilities to mitigate and novel ideas to avoid the biases
induced by pixel noise. We present a new shear estimator that shows a more
robust performance for noisy ellipticity samples. Finally, we release the
open-source python code to predict and efficiently sample from the noisy
ellipticity distribution and the shear estimators used in this work at

extensive photometry from X-ray to radio bands. Together with our spectroscopic
information, this enables us to derive detailed SEDs for our extragalactic
sources. We fit a variety of templates to determine bolometric luminosities,
and to constrain AGN and starburst components where both are present. While
~58% of X-ray Seyferts require a starburst event to fit observed photometry
only 26% of the X-ray QSO population appear to have some kind of star formation
contribution. This is significantly lower than for the Seyferts, especially if
we take into account torus contamination at z>1 where the majority of our X-ray
QSOs lie. In addition, we observe a rapid drop of the percentage of starburst
contribution as X-ray luminosity increases. This is consistent with the
quenching of star formation by powerful QSOs, as predicted by the merger model,
or with a time lag between the peak of star formation and QSO activity. We have
tested the hypothesis that there should be a strong connection between X-ray
obscuration and star-formation but we do not find any association between X-ray
column density and star formation rate both in the general population or the
star-forming X-ray Seyferts. Our large compilation also allows us to report

exclusion of the contact resistance in the many-channel case; (b)
correspondence of the Landauer conductance with internal properties of the

two approaches: (1) self-consistent theory of localization by Vollhardt and
Woelfle, and (2) quantum mechanical analysis based on the shell model. Both
approaches lead to the same definition for the conductance of a finite system,
closely related to the Thouless definition. In the framework of the
self-consistent theory, the relations of finite-size scaling are derived and
the Gell-Mann - Low functions \beta(g) for space dimensions d=1,2,3 are
calculated. In contrast to the previous attempt by Vollhardt and Woelfle
(1982), the metallic and localized phase are considered from the same
standpoint, and the conductance of a finite system has no singularity at the
critical point. In the 2D case, the expansion of \beta(g) in 1/g coincides with
results of the \sigma-model approach on the two-loop level and depends on the
renormalization scheme in higher loops; the use of dimensional regularization
for transition to dimension d=2+\epsilon looks incompatible with the physical
essence of the problem. The obtained results are compared with numerical and

Way (MW) show a significant amount of phase-space correlation, they are
distributed in a highly inclined Disc of Satellites (DoS). We have extended the
previous studies on the DoS by analysing for the first time the orientations of
streams of stars and gas, and the distributions of globular clusters within the
halo of the MW. It is shown that the spatial distribution of MW globular
clusters classified as young halo clusters (YH GC) is very similar to the DoS,
while 7 of the 14 analysed streams align with the DoS. The probability to find
the observed clustering of streams is only 0.3 per cent when assuming isotropy.
The MW thus is surrounded by a vast polar structure (VPOS) of subsystems
(satellite galaxies, globular clusters and streams), spreading from
Galactocentric distances as small as 10 kpc out to 250 kpc. These findings
demonstrate that a near-isotropic infall of cosmological sub-structure
components onto the MW is essentially ruled out because a large number of
infalling objects would have had to be highly correlated, to a degree not
natural for dark matter sub-structures. The majority of satellites, streams and
YH GCs had to be formed as a correlated population. This is possible in tidal
tails consisting of material expelled from interacting galaxies. We discuss the
tidal scenario for the formation of the VPOS, including successes and possible
challenges. The potential consequences of the MW satellites being tidal dwarf
galaxies are severe. If all the satellite galaxies and YH GCs have been formed
in an encounter between the young MW and another gas-rich galaxy about 10-11
Gyr ago, then the MW does not have any luminous dark-matter substructures and
the missing satellites problem becomes a catastrophic failure of the standard
cosmological model.

Our results show that the high-\alpha\ thick disk population has a short scale
length (L_thick ~ 1.8 kpc) compared to the low-\alpha population, which is
typically associated with the thin disk. We find that the fraction of
high-\alpha\ stars in the inner disk increases at large |Z|, and that
high-\alpha\ stars lag in rotation compared to low-\alpha\ stars. In contrast,
the fraction of high-\alpha\ stars in the outer disk is low at all |Z|, and
high- and low-\alpha\ stars have similar rotational velocities up to 1.5 kpc
from the plane. We interpret these results to indicate that different processes
were responsible for the high-\alpha\ populations in the inner and outer disk.
The high-\alpha\ population in the inner disk has a short scale length and
large scale height, consistent with a scenario in which the thick disk forms
during an early gas-rich accretion phase. Stars far from the plane in the outer
disk may have reached their current locations through heating by minor mergers.
The lack of high-\alpha\ stars at large R and |Z| also places strict
constraints on the strength of radial migration via transient spiral structure.

errors and probabilities of membership. We introduce two parameter families of
probability distributions describing symmetric and asymmetric distortions of
the line profiles from Gaussianity. These are used as the basis of a maximum

that the method outperforms a Gauss-Hermite expansion for discrete data, with a
lower limit for the relative gain of approx 2 for sample sizes N approx 800. To
ensure that our methods can give reliable descriptions of the shape, we develop
an efficient test to assess the statistical quality of the obtained fit. As an
application, we turn our attention to the discrete velocity datasets of the
dwarf spheroidals of the Milky Way. In Sculptor, Carina and Sextans the
symmetric deviations are consistent with velocity distributions more peaked
than Gaussian. In Fornax, instead, there is an evolution in the symmetric
deviations of the line profile from a peakier to more flat-topped distribution
on moving outwards. These results suggest a radially biased orbital structure
for the outer parts of Sculptor, Carina and Sextans. On the other hand,
tangential anisotropy is favoured in Fornax. This is all consistent with a

the emergence of two types of fundamental excitations: massless Nambu-Goldstone
modes and a massive `Higgs' amplitude mode. An excitation of Higgs type is of
crucial importance in the standard model of elementary particles and also
appears as a fundamental collective mode in quantum many-body systems. Whether
such a mode exists in low-dimensional systems as a resonance-like feature or
becomes over-damped through coupling to Nambu-Goldstone modes has been a
subject of theoretical debate. Here we reveal and study a Higgs mode in a
two-dimensional neutral superfluid close to the transition to a Mott insulating
phase. We unambiguously identify the mode by observing the expected softening
of the onset of spectral response when approaching the quantum critical point.
In this regime, our system is described by an effective relativistic field
theory with a two-component quantum-field, constituting a minimal model for
spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Additionally, all microscopic
parameters of our system are known from first principles and the resolution of
our measurement allows us to detect excited states of the many-body system at

host star's nascent cluster would be greatly increased if gas giant planets
form in situ on wide orbits. In this paper, we explore the outcomes of
planet-planet scattering for a distribution of multiplanet systems that all
have one of the planets on an initial orbit of 100 AU. The scattering
experiments are run with and without stellar flybys. We convolve the outcomes
with distributions for protoplanetary disk and stellar cluster sizes to
generalize the results where possible. We find that the frequencies of large
mutual inclinations and high eccentricities are sensitive to the number of
planets in a system, but not strongly to stellar flybys. However, flybys do
play a role in changing the low and moderate portions of the mutual inclination
distributions, and erase dynamically cold initial conditions on average.
Wide-orbit planets can be mixed throughout the planetary system, and in some
cases, can potentially become hot Jupiters, which we demonstrate using
scattering experiments that include a tidal damping model. If planets form on
wide orbits in situ, then there will be discernible differences in the proper
motion distributions of a sample of wide-orbit planets compared with a pure
scattering formation mechanism. Stellar flybys can enhance the frequency of
ejections in planetary systems, but auto-ionization is likely to remain the
dominant source of free-floating planets.

cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. These simulations include efficient, but
energetically feasible supernova feedback, but have not been tuned in any way
to produce 'realistic' disc galaxies. Yet, they generate a large number of
discs, without requiring extremely high resolution. Over the wide galaxy
stellar mass range, 9.0 < log10[Mstar (Msun)] < 10.5, the simulations reproduce
the observed Tully-Fisher relation, the rotation curves of disc galaxies in
bins of stellar mass, the mass-size relation of disc galaxies, the optical
rotation to virial circular velocity ratio (Vopt/Vvir), and the SF efficiencies
of disc galaxies as inferred from stacked weak lensing and stacked satellite
kinematics observations. They also reproduce the specific star formation rates
of ~L* galaxies but predict too low levels of star formation for low-mass
galaxies, which is plausibly due to the finite resolution of the simulations.
At higher stellar masses, log10[Mstar (\Msun)] > 10.6, the simulated galaxies
are too concentrated and have too high SF efficiencies. We conjecture that this
shortcoming reflects the neglect of feedback from accreting supermassive black
holes in these simulations. We conclude that it is possible to generate a
representative population of disc galaxies that reproduces many of the observed
trends of local disc galaxies using standard numerical hydrodynamic techniques
and a plausible implementation of the ""subgrid"" astrophysical processes thought
to be relevant to galaxy formation.

successfully in computational systems biology. The Boolean functions that
appear in published models tend to have special properties, in particular the
property of being nested canalizing, a concept inspired by the concept of
canalization in evolutionary biology. It has been shown that networks comprised
of nested canalizing functions have dynamic properties that make them suitable
for modeling molecular regulatory networks, namely a small number of (large)
attractors, as well as relatively short limit cycles.
  This paper contains a detailed analysis of this class of functions, based on
a novel normal form as polynomial functions over the Boolean field. The concept
of layer is introduced that stratifies variables into different classes
depending on their level of dominance. Using this layer concept a closed form
formula is derived for the number of nested canalizing functions with a given
number of variables. Additional metrics considered include Hamming weight, the
activity number of any variable, and the average sensitivity of the function.
It is also shown that the average sensitivity of any nested canalizing function
is between 0 and 2. This provides a rationale for why nested canalizing
functions are stable, since a random Boolean function in n variables has
average sensitivity n/2. The paper also contains experimental evidence that the
layer number is an important factor in network stability.

degrees of freedom, in order to investigate and reveal the behavior of orbits
in a binary quasar system. The two quasars are hosted in a pair of interacting
disk galaxies. We study in detail the regular or chaotic character of motion,
in two different cases: the time independent model in both 2D and 3D dynamical
systems and the evolving 3D model. Our numerical calculations, indicate that a
large fraction of orbits in the 2D system are chaotic in the time independent
case. A careful analysis suggest that several Lindblad resonances are also
responsible for the chaotic motion of stars in both hosts galaxies. In the time
dependent system, we follow the evolution of 3D orbits in our dynamical model,
as the two interacting host galaxies develop dense and massive quasars in their
cores, by mass transportation from the disks to their nuclei. In this
interesting case, there are orbits that change their orbital character from
regular to chaotic and vise versa and also orbits that maintain their character
during the galactic evolution. These results strongly indicate that the ordered
or chaotic nature of 3D orbits depends, not only in the galactic interaction
but also in the presence of the quasars in the galactic cores of the host
galaxies. The outcomes derived from our dynamical model are compared with
observational data. Some theoretical arguments to support the numerically
derived outcomes are presented, both in 2D and 3D systems, while a comparison
with similar earlier work is also made.

microstructure originated from the martensitic phase transformation. In a cubic
to orthorhombic transition, a single variant of marten- site can have a
compatible (exact) interface with the austenite for some special lattice
parameters in contrast to conventional austenite/twinned martensite interface
with a transition layer. Experimentally, the phase compat- ibility results in a
dramatic drop in thermal hysteresis and gives rise to very stable functional
properties over cycling. Here, we investigate the microstructures observed in
Ti50Ni50-xPdx alloys that undergo a cubic to orthorhombic martensitic
transformation using a three dimensional phase field approach. We will show
that the simulation results are in very good agreement with transmission
electron microscopy observations. However, the understanding of the drop in

problem of finding a weighted voting game in which the power of the players is
as close as possible to a certain target distribution. Our goal is to find
algorithms that solve this problem exactly. Thereto, we study various
subclasses of simple games, and their associated representation methods. We
survey algorithms and impossibility results for the synthesis problem, i.e.,
converting a representation of a simple game into another representation.
  We contribute to the synthesis problem by showing that it is impossible to
compute in polynomial time the list of ceiling coalitions (also known as
shift-maximal losing coalitions) of a game from its list of roof coalitions
(also known as shift-minimal winning coalitions), and vice versa.
  Then, we proceed by studying the problem of enumerating the set of weighted
voting games. We present first a naive algorithm for this, running in doubly
exponential time. Using our knowledge of the synthesis problem, we then improve
on this naive algorithm, and we obtain an enumeration algorithm that runs in
quadratic exponential time (that is, O(2^(n^2) p(n)) for a polynomial p).
Moreover, we show that this algorithm runs in output-polynomial time, making it
the best possible enumeration algorithm up to a polynomial factor.
  Finally, we propose an exact anytime algorithm for the inverse power index
problem that runs in exponential time. This algorithm is straightforward and
general: it computes the error for each game enumerated, and outputs the game
that minimizes this error. By the genericity of our approach, our algorithm can
be used to find a weighted voting game that optimizes any exponential time
computable function. We implement our algorithm for the case of the normalized
Banzhaf index, and we perform experiments in order to study performance and
error convergence.

King models provide poor fits. We suggest that this is partly because
collisionless dynamics is also important and contribute to shaping the cluster
properties. We show using time-scale and length-scale arguments that except for
the very centers of clusters, collisionless dynamics should be more important
than collisional. We then fit 38 GCs analyzed by Noyola and Gebhardt (2006)
with (collisional) King and (collisionless) DARKexp models over the full
available radial range, and find that the latter provide a better fit to 29
GCs; for six of these the fit is at least ~5x better in term of rms. DARKexp
models are theoretically derived maximum entropy equilibrium states of
self-gravitating collisionless systems and have already been shown to fit the
results of dark matter N-body simulations. (We do not attempt fits with ad hoc

only possible asymptotics within perturbation theory is conformal field theory.

invariance, which are equivalent to theories with renormalization group
pseudocycles. Our arguments hold even for theories with gravitational

""Possibilist Transactional Interpretation"" or PTI, is extended to the
relativistic domain. The present interpretation clarifies the concept of
'absorption,' which plays a crucial role in TI (and in PTI). In particular, in
the relativistic domain, coupling amplitudes between fields are interpreted as
amplitudes for the generation of confirmation waves (CW) by a potential
absorber in response to offer waves (OW), whereas in the nonrelativistic
context CW are taken as generated with certainty. It is pointed out that
solving the measurement problem requires venturing into the relativistic domain
in which emissions and absorptions take place; nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics only applies to quanta considered as 'already in existence' (i.e.,
'free quanta'), and therefore cannot fully account for the phenomenon of
measurement, in which quanta are tied to sources and sinks.

  In-place Resilient Sorting","26 pages",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The selection problem, where one wishes to locate the $k^{th}$ smallest
element in an unsorted array of size $n$, is one of the basic problems studied
in computer science. The main focus of this work is designing algorithms for
solving the selection problem in the presence of memory faults. These can
happen as the result of cosmic rays, alpha particles, or hardware failures.
  Specifically, the computational model assumed here is a faulty variant of the
RAM model (abbreviated as FRAM), which was introduced by Finocchi and Italiano.
In this model, the content of memory cells might get corrupted adversarially
during the execution, and the algorithm is given an upper bound $\delta$ on the
number of corruptions that may occur.
  The main contribution of this work is a deterministic resilient selection
algorithm with optimal O(n) worst-case running time. Interestingly, the running
time does not depend on the number of faults, and the algorithm does not need
to know $\delta$.
  The aforementioned resilient selection algorithm can be used to improve the
complexity bounds for resilient $k$-d trees developed by Gieseke, Moruz and
Vahrenhold. Specifically, the time complexity for constructing a $k$-d tree is
improved from $O(n\log^2 n + \delta^2)$ to $O(n \log n)$.
  Besides the deterministic algorithm, a randomized resilient selection
algorithm is developed, which is simpler than the deterministic one, and has
$O(n + \alpha)$ expected time complexity and O(1) space complexity (i.e., is
in-place). This algorithm is used to develop the first resilient sorting
algorithm that is in-place and achieves optimal $O(n\log n + \alpha\delta)$
expected running time.

picture of quantum mechanics. It is common to introduce tomographic concepts
starting with the Schrodinger-Dirac picture of quantum mechanics on Hilbert
spaces. In this picture states are a primary concept and observables are
derived from them. On the other hand, the Heisenberg picture,which has evolved
in the $C^\star-$algebraic approach to quantum mechanics, starts with the
algebra of observables and introduce states as a derived concept. The
equivalence between these two pictures amounts essentially, to the
Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction. In this construction, the abstract $%
C^\star-$algebra is realized as an algebra of operators acting on a constructed
Hilbert space. The representation one defines may be reducible or irreducible,
but in either case it allows to identify an unitary group associated with the
$C^\star-$algebra by means of its invertible elements. In this picture both
states and observables are appropriate functions on the group, it follows that
also quantum tomograms are strictly related with appropriate functions
(positive-type)on the group. In this paper we present, by means of very simple
examples, the tomographic description emerging from the set of ideas connected
with the $C^\star-$algebra picture of quantum mechanics. In particular, the
tomographic probability distributions are introduced for finite and compact
groups and an autonomous criterion to recognize a given probability
distribution as a tomogram of quantum state is formulated.

by the blueshift and asymmetry index (BAI) of the CIV line (Wang et al. 2011),
with intensities and ratios of broad emission lines, based on composite quasar
spectra built from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that most of the line
ratios of other ions to CIV prominently increases with BAI. These behaviors can
be well understood in the context of increasing metallicity with BAI. The
strength of dominant coolant, CIV line, decreases and weak collisionally
excited lines increase with gas metallicity as a result of the competition
between different line coolants. Using SiIV+OIV]/CIV as an indicator of gas
metallicity, we present, for the first time, a strong correlation between the
metallicitiy and the outflow strength of quasars over a wide range of 1.7 to
6.9 times solar abundance. Our result implies that the metallicity plays an
important role in the formation of quasar outflows, likely via affecting
outflow acceleration. This effect may have a profound impact on galaxy
evolution via momentum feedback and chemical enrichment.

quantum field theory in 1 dimension, time, it was natural to extend this idea
to higher-dimensional field theory, and in fact an apparently viable version of
$\mathcal{PT}$-invariant quantum electrodynamics was proposed. However, it has
proved difficult to establish that the unitarity of the scattering matrix, for
example, the K\""all\'en spectral representation for the photon propagator, can
be maintained in this theory. This has led to questions of whether, in fact,
even quantum mechanical systems are consistent with probability conservation
when Green's functions are examined, since the latter have to possess physical
requirements of analyticity. The status of $\mathcal{PT}$QED will be reviewed
in this report, as well as the general issue of unitarity.

in the early stages of cosmological evolution. Because of the quasi-exponential
redshifting, which occurs during an inflationary period, the physical
wavelengths of comoving scales that correspond to the present large-scale
structure of the Universe were smaller than the Planck length in the early
stages of the inflationary period. This trans-Planckian effect was studied
before using toy models. The Horava-Lifshitz (HL) theory offers the chance to
study this problem in a candidate UV complete theory of gravity. In this paper
we study the evolution of cosmological perturbations according to HL gravity
assuming that matter gives rise to an inflationary background. As is usually
done in inflationary cosmology, we assume that the fluctuations originate in
their minimum energy state. In the trans-Planckian region the fluctuations obey
a non-linear dispersion relation of Corley-Jacobson type. In the ""healthy
extension"" of HL gravity there is an extra degree of freedom which plays an
important role in the UV region but decouples in the IR, and which influences
the cosmological perturbations. We find that in spite of these important
changes compared to the usual description, the overall scale-invariance of the
power spectrum of cosmological perturbations is recovered. However, we obtain
oscillations in the spectrum as a function of wavenumber with a relative
amplitude of order unity and with an effective frequency which scales
nonlinearly with wavenumber. Taking the usual inflationary parameters we find
that the frequency of the oscillations is so large as to render the effect
difficult to observe.

Tevatron of the $B_s^0-\bar B_s^0$ mixing, in this paper we revisit it in a
family non-universal $Z^{\prime}$ model, to check if a simultaneous explanation
for all the mixing observables, especially for the like-sign dimuon charge
asymmetry observed by the D0 collaboration, could be made in such a specific
model. In the first scenario where the $Z^\prime$ boson contributes only to the
off-diagonal element $M_{12}^s$, it is found that, once the combined
constraints from $\Delta M_s$, $\phi_s$ and $\Delta \Gamma_s$ are imposed, the
model could not explain the measured flavour-specific CP asymmetry $a_{fs}^s$,
at least within its $1\sigma$ ranges. In the second scenario where the NP
contributes also to the absorptive part $\Gamma_{12}^s$ via tree-level
$Z^\prime$-induced $b\to c\bar{c}s$ operators, we find that, with the
constraints from $\Delta M_s$, $\phi_s$ and the indirect CP asymmetry in
$\bar{B}_d\to J/\psi K_S$ taken into account, the present measured $1\sigma$
experimental ranges for $a_{fs}^s$ could not be reproduced too. Thus, such a
specific $Z^\prime$ model with our specific assumptions could not
simultaneously reconcile all the present data on $B_s^0-\bar B_s^0$ mixing.
Future improved measurements from the LHCb and the proposed superB experiments,
especially of the flavour-specific CP asymmetries, are expected to shed light
on the issue.

only with a power- law index of 0.28. Timescale for splitting is found to be
independent of parent flux content before splitting, which corresponds to \sim
33 minutes. It is also found that patches split into any flux contents with a
same probability. This splitting has a power-law distribution of flux content
with an index of -2 as a time independent solution. These results support that
the frequency distribution of flux content in the analyzed flux range is
rapidly maintained by merging and splitting, namely surface processes. We

anti-correlated hard and soft time lags of the order of a few tens to a few
hundred seconds and the corresponding intensity states were mostly the
horizontal branch (HB) and upper normal branch (NB). The model independent and
dependent spectral analysis showed that during these time lags the structure of
accretion disk significantly varied. Both eastern and western approaches were
used to unfold the X-ray continuum and systematic changes were observed in soft
and hard spectral components. These changes along with a systematic shift in
the frequency of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) made it substantially
evident that the geometry of the accretion disk is truncated. Simultaneous
energy spectral and power density spectral study shows that the production of
the horizontal branch oscillations (HBOs) are closely related to the
Comptonizing region rather than the disk component in the accretion disk. We
found that as the HBO frequency decreases from the hard apex to upper HB, the
disk temperature increases along with an increase in the coronal temperature
which is in sharp contrast with the changes found in black hole binaries where
the decrease in QPO frequency is accompanied by a decrease in the disk
temperature and a simultaneous increase in the coronal temperature. We discuss
the results in the context of re-condensation of coronal material in the inner

investigated. The Keller-Miksis-Parlitz equation is adopted, but modified to
account for the presence of the wall. This base model describes the time
evolution of the bubble surface, which is assumed to remain spherical, and
accounts for the effect of acoustic radiation losses owing to liquid
compressibility in the momentum conservation. Two situations are considered:
the base case of an isolated bubble in an unbounded medium; and a bubble near a
solid wall. In the latter case, the wall influence is modeled by including a
symmetrically oscillating image bubble. The bubble dynamics is traced using a
numerical solution of the model equation. Subsequently, Floquet theory is used
to accurately detect the bifurcation point where bubble oscillations stop
following the driving ultrasound frequency and undergo period-changing
bifurcations. Of particular interest is the detection of the subcritical period
tripling and quadrupling transition. The parametric bifurcation maps are
obtained as functions of non-dimensional parameters representing the bubble
radius, the frequency and pressure amplitude of the driving ultrasound field
and the distance from the wall. It is shown that the presence of the wall
generally stabilises the bubble dynamics, so that much larger values of the
pressure amplitude are needed to generate nonlinear responses.

electronic properties of poly(\emph{para}-phenylene) (PPP) on graphene.
Analysis of the charge density and the electrostatic potential shows that the
polymer-surface interaction gives rise to the formation of only weak surface
dipoles with no charge transfer between the polymer and the surface. In the
local-density approximation (LDA) of density-functional theory, the band
structure of the combined system appears as a superposition of the eigenstates
of its constituents. Consequently, the LDA band gap of PPP remains unchanged
upon adsorption onto graphene. $G_0W_0$ calculations, however, renormalize the
electronic levels of the weakly physisorbed polymer. Thereby, its band gap is
considerably reduced compared to that of the isolated PPP chain. This effect
can be understood in terms of image charges induced in the graphene layer,
which allows us to explain the quasi-particle gap of PPP versus
polymer-graphene distance by applying a classical image-potential model. For
distances below 4.5 {\AA}, however, deviations from this simple classical model
arise which we qualitatively explain by taking into account the polarizablity
of the adsorbate. For a quantitative description with predictive power,
however, we emphasize the need for an accurate ab-initio description of the
electronic structure for weakly coupled systems at equilibrium bonding
distances.

irrespective of applying the model to a specific astronomical system. The
transition zone between the two layers of the fluid is ignored. Then, we
perform a linear analysis and by imposing suitable boundary conditions and
considering a radiation field, we obtain appropriate dispersion relation.
Unstable modes are studied by solving the dispersion equation numerically, and
then growth rates of them are obtained. By analyzing our dispersion relation,
we show that for a wide range of the input parameters, the radiation field has
a destabilizing effect on KH instability. In eruptions of the galaxies or
supermassive stars, the radiation field is dynamically important and because of
the enhanced KH growth rates in the presence of the radiation; these eruptions
can inject more momentum and energy into their environment and excite more
turbulent motions.

evolution of atmospheres that connect to the ambient disk. We have found that
the atmospheric evolution has two distinctly different outcomes, depending on
the rocky body's mass: While the atmospheres on massive rocky bodies undergo
runaway disk-gas accretion, those on light rocky bodies undergo significant
erosion during disk dispersal. In the atmospheric erosion, the heat content of
the rocky body that was previously neglected plays an important role. We have
also realized that the atmospheric mass is rather sensitive to disk temperature
in the mass range of interest in this study. Our theory is applied to
recently-detected super-Earths orbiting Kepler-11 to examine the possibility
that the planets are rock-dominated ones with relatively thick H-He
atmospheres. The application suggests that the in-situ formation of the
relatively thick H-He atmospheres inferred by structure modeling is possible
only under restricted conditions; namely, relatively slow disk dissipation
and/or cool environments. This study demonstrates that low-density super-Earths
provide important clues to understanding of planetary accretion and disk

Finding an absolute minimum is hard, in fact we prove that the problem of

devise a polynomial time heuristic that compares favorably with the known
minimization tools. To this end we develop a further piece of theory starting
from the definition of the weight of a product p as a functions of the number
of fragments induced on other cubes by the selection of p, and show how product
weights can be exploited for building a class of minimization heuristics for
DSOP and partial DSOP synthesis. A set of experiments conducted on major

trusted nodes based on personalized trust in large scale distributed networks.
The problem of identifying trusted nodes, based on personalized trust, in a
large network setting stems from the huge computation and message overhead
involved in exhaustively calculating and propagating the trust estimates by the
remote nodes. However, in any practical scenario, nodes generally communicate
with a small subset of nodes and thus exhaustively estimating the trust of all
the nodes can lead to huge resource consumption. In contrast, our mechanism can
be tuned to locate a desired subset of trusted nodes, based on the allowable
overhead, with respect to a particular user. The mechanism is based on a simple
exchange of random walk messages and nodes counting the number of times they
are being hit by random walkers of nodes in their neighborhood. Simulation
results to analyze the effectiveness of the algorithm show that using the
proposed algorithm, nodes identify the top trusted nodes in the network with a
very high probability by exploring only around 45% of the total nodes, and in
turn generates nearly 90% less overhead as compared to an exhaustive trust
estimation mechanism, named TrustWebRank. Finally, we provide a measure of the
global trustworthiness of a node; simulation results indicate that the measures
generated using our mechanism differ by only around 0.6% as compared to
TrustWebRank.

  Check Codes","14 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rapidly improving performance of modern hardware renders convolutional
codes obsolete, and allows for the practical implementation of more
sophisticated correction codes such as low density parity check (LDPC) and
turbo codes (TC). Both are decoded by iterative algorithms, which require a
disproportional computational effort for low channel noise. They are also
unable to correct higher noise levels, still below the Shannon theoretical
limit. In this paper, we discuss an enhanced version of a convolutional-like
decoding paradigm which adopts very large spaces of possible system states, of
the order of $2^{64}$. Under such conditions, the traditional convolution
operation is rendered useless and needs to be replaced by a carefully designed
state transition procedure. The size of the system state space completely
changes the correction philosophy, as state collisions are virtually impossible
and the decoding procedure becomes a correction tree. The proposed decoding
algorithm is practically cost-free for low channel noise. As the channel noise
approaches the Shannon limit, it is still possible to perform correction,
although its cost increases to infinity. In many applications, the implemented
decoder can essentially outperform both LDPC and TC. This paper describes the
proposed correction paradigm and theoretically analyzes the asymptotic
correction performance. The considered encoder and decoder were verified
experimentally for the binary symmetric channel. The correction process remains
practically cost-free for channel error rates below 0.05 and 0.13 for the 1/2
and 1/4 rate codes, respectively. For the considered resource limit, the output
bit error rates reach the order of $10^{-3}$ for channel error rates 0.08 and
0.18. The proposed correction paradigm can be easily extended to other

human made processes and being subject to regulation because of their
radioactivity are known as NORM. We present a brief review of the main
categories of non-nuclear industries together with the levels of activity
concentration in feed raw materials, products and waste, including mechanisms
of radioisotope enrichments. The global management of NORM shows a high level
of complexity, mainly due to different degrees of radioactivity enhancement and
the huge amount of worldwide waste production. The future tendency of
guidelines concerning environmental protection will require both a systematic
monitoring based on the ever-increasing sampling and high performance of gamma
ray spectroscopy. On the ground of these requirements a new low background
fully automated high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer MCA_Rad has been
developed. The design of Pb and Cu shielding allowed to reach a background
reduction of two order of magnitude with respect to laboratory radioactivity. A
severe lowering of manpower cost is obtained through a fully automation system,
which enables up to 24 samples to be measured without any human attendance. Two
coupled HPGe detectors increase the detection efficiency, performing accurate
measurements on sample volume (180 cc) with a reduction of sample transport
cost of material. Details of the instrument calibration method are presented.
MCA_Rad system can measure in less than one hour a typical NORM sample enriched
in U and Th with some hundreds of Bq/kg, with an overall uncertainty less than
5%. Quality control of this method has been tested. Measurements of certified
reference materials RGK-1, RGU-2 and RGTh-1 containing concentrations of K, U
and Th comparable to NORM have been performed, resulting an overall relative
discrepancy of 5% among central values within the reported uncertainty.

without backtracking along their respective curves from one endpoint to the
other. The advantage of this measure on other measures such as the Hausdorff
distance is that it takes into account the ordering of the points along the

  The discrete Fr\'echet distance replaces the dog and its owner by a pair of
frogs that can only reside on $n$ and $m$ specific pebbles on the curves $A$

backtracking. The discrete Fr\'echet distance can be computed by a rather
straightforward quadratic dynamic programming algorithm. However, despite a
considerable amount of work on this problem and its variations, there is no
subquadratic algorithm known, even for approximation versions of the problem.

potentially useful for implementing molecular spintronics devices. The
calculations of the electronic properties of such molecules is a formidable
theoretical challenge as one has to describe the spin ground state of a
transition metal as the legand field changes. The problem is dominated by the
interplay between strong electron correlation at the transition metal site and
charge delocalization over the ligands, and thus it fits into a class of
problems where density functional theory may be inadequate. Furthermore, the
crossover activity is extremely sensitive to environmental conditions, which
are difficult to fully characterize. Here we discuss the phase transition of a
prototypical spin crossover molecule as obtained with diffusion Monte Carlo
simulations. We demonstrate that the ground state changes depending on whether
the molecule is in the gas or in the solid phase. As our calculation provides a
solid benchmark for the theory we then assess the performances of density
functional theory. We find that the low spin state is always over-stabilized,
not only by the (semi-)local functionals, but even by the most commonly used
hybrids (such as B3LYP and PBE0). We then propose that reliable results can be
obtained by using hybrid functionals containing about 50% of exact-exchange.

conclude that such non-Lagrangian currents are not necessarily more general
than the two-term currents emerging within the covariant projector method. We
compare our results with those of the conventional Proca-, and Rarita-Schwinger
frameworks. Finally, we test the representation dependence of the multipoles by
placing spin-1 and spin-3/2 in the respective (1,0)$\oplus$(0,1), and
(3/2,0)$\oplus$(0,3/2) single-spin representations. We observe representation
independence of the charge monopoles and the magnetic dipoles, in contrast to
the higher multipoles, which turn out to be representation dependent. In

electric quadrupole moment of opposite sign to the one found in $(1/2,1/2)$,

constant-speed propagation of waves along defined channels in an excitable

annihilation of colliding waves. What distinguishes this work from previous
work in this area is that regions where channels meet at a junction can
periodically alternate between permitting the propagation of waves and blocking
them. These valve-like areas are used to select waves based on the length of
time that it takes waves to propagate from one valve to another. In an
experimental implementation, the channels which make up the circuit layout are
projected by a digital projector connected to a computer. Excitable channels
are projected as dark areas, unexcitable regions as light areas. Valves
alternate between dark and light: every valve has the same period and phase,
with a 50% duty cycle. This scheme can be used to make logic gates based on
combinations of OR and AND-NOT operations, with few geometrical constraints.
Because there are few geometrical constraints, compact circuits can be
implemented. Experimental results from an implementation of a 4-bit input,
2-bit output integer square root circuit are given. This is the most complex

description of production of D mesons and non-photonic electrons in
relativistic collision of heavy nuclei at RHIC and LHC energies. Best results
are obtained when we approximate the momentum loss per collision $\Delta p_T
\propto \alpha \, p_T$, where $\alpha$ is a constant depending on the
centrality and the centre of mass energy. Comparing our results with those
obtained earlier for drag coefficients estimated using Langevin equation for
heavy quarks we find that up to half of the energy loss of charm quarks at top
RHIC energy could be due to collisions while that at LHC energy at 2760 GeV/A
the collisional energy loss could be about one third of the total. Estimates
are obtained for azimuthal anisotropy in momentum spectra of heavy mesons, due
to this energy loss. We further suggest that energy loss of charm quarks may
lead to an enhanced production of D-mesons and single electrons at low $p_T$ in

mechanical way of producing the cumulene. In this work, we study the structure
and conductance properties of the carbon wire suspended between carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) of different chiralities (zigzag and armchair), and
corresponding conductance variation upon stretching. We find the geometrical
structure of the carbon wire bridging CNTs similar to the experimentally
observed structures in the carbon wire obtained between graphene electrodes. We
show a capability to modulate the conductance by changing bridging sites
between the carbon wire and CNTs without breaking the wire. Observed current
modulation via cumulene wire stretching/elongation together with CNT junction
stability makes it a promising candidate for mechano-switching device for
molecular nanoelectronics.

generalization of the non-crossing approximation based on the Keldysh

strongly enhanced through the presence of a second orbital. We predict an
experimentally relevant optimal operating point which benefits from the
concomitant increase of the Kondo temperature in the two-orbital setup. An
approximation based on the transport coefficients and fulfilling the
thermodynamic balance is proven to remain appropriate even far beyond the

radiative transfer model and find evidence for the presence of a large gap. The
MIR images trace dust that emits at the onset of the strong rise in the
spectral energy distribution (SED) at 20\,$\mu$m, therefore are very sensitive
to the location and characteristics of the inner wall of the outer disk and its
dust. We determine the location of the wall to be 23$^{+3}_{-5}$\,AU from the
star. An extra component of hot dust must exist close to the star. We find that
a hydrostatic optically thick inner disk does not produce enough flux in the
NIR and an optically thin geometrically thick component is our solution to fit
the SED. Considering the recent findings of gaps and holes in a number of
Herbig Ae/Be group I disks, we suggest that such disk structures may be common
in group I sources. Classification as group I should be considered a support
for classification as a transitional disk, though improved imaging surveys are
needed to support this speculation.

desirable as many astrophysical phenomena are symmetric with respect to the
rotation axis or are such that curvilinear coordinates adapt better to their
geometry. However, the singularities associated with such coordinate systems
are known to lead to numerical instabilities unless special care is taken
(e.g., regularization at the origin). Cordero-Carrion will present a rigorous
derivation of partially implicit Runge-Kutta methods in forthcoming papers,
with the aim of treating numerically the stiff source terms in wave-like
equations that may appear as a result of the choice of the coordinate system.
We have developed a numerical code solving the BSSN equations in spherical
symmetry and the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations written in
flux-conservative form. A key feature of the code is that it uses a
second-order partially implicit Runge-Kutta method to integrate the evolution
equations. We perform and discuss a number of tests to assess the accuracy and
expected convergence of the code, namely a pure gauge wave, the evolution of a
single black hole, the evolution of a spherical relativistic star in
equilibrium, and the gravitational collapse of a spherical relativistic star
leading to the formation of a black hole. We obtain stable evolutions of
regular spacetimes without the need for any regularization algorithm at the

these localisations preserve properness and give a complete characterisation of

glass to magnetic Bose-Einstein condensation induced by a magnetic field in
NiCl2.4SC(NH2)2 (dichloro-tetrakis-thiourea-Nickel, or DTN), doped with Br
(Br-DTN) or site diluted. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the quantum phase
transition of the model Hamiltonian for Br-DTN, as well as for site-diluted
DTN, are consistent with conventional scaling at the quantum critical point and
with a critical exponent z verifying the prediction z=d; moreover the
correlation length exponent is found to be nu = 0.75(10) and the order
parameter exponent to be beta = 0.95(10). We investigate the low-temperature
thermodynamics at the quantum critical field of Br-DTN both numerically and
experimentally, and extract the power-law behavior of the magnetization and of
the specific heat. Our results for the exponents of the power laws, as well as
previous results for the scaling of the critical temperature to magnetic
ordering with the applied field, are incompatible with the conventional
crossover-scaling Ansatz proposed by Fisher et al., [Phys. Rev. B 40, 546
(1989)], but they can all be reconciled within a phenomenological Ansatz in the
presence of a dangerously irrelevant operator.

local-response approximation exhibit hyperbolic dispersion and an associated

microscopic hydrodynamic Drude theory we derive qualitatively different optical
properties of these metamaterials, due to the free-electron nonlocal optical
response of their metal constituents. We demonstrate that nonlocal response
gives rise to a large-wavevector cutoff in the dispersion that is inversely
proportional to the Fermi velocity of the electron gas, but also for small
wavevectors we find differences for the hyperbolic dispersion. Moreover, the
size of the unit cell influences effective parameters of the metamaterial even
in the deep sub-wavelength regime. Finally, instead of the broadband
super-singularity in the local density of states, we predict a large but finite
maximal enhancement proportional to the inverse cube of the Fermi velocity.

The index is shown to be equal to the expected return time to Gamma.

iron-based superconductors is a topic of great interest amongst the condensed
matter physics community as it is thought to be the key to understanding the
mechanisms responsible for high temperature superconductivity. Alkali metal
doped iron chalcogenide superconductors exhibit several unique characteristics
which are not found in other iron-based superconducting materials such as
antiferromagnetic ordering at room temperature, the presence of ordered iron
vacancies and high resistivity normal state properties. Detailed
microstructural analysis is essential in order to understand the origin of
these unusual properties. Here we have used a range of complementary scanning
electron microscope based techniques, including high-resolution electron
backscatter di raction mapping, to assess local variations in composition and
lattice parameter with high precision and sub-micron spatial resolution. Phase
separation is observed in the Csx Fe2-ySe2 crystals, with the minor phase
distributed in a plate-like morphology throughout the crystal. Our results are
consistent with superconductivity occurring only in the minority phase.

transaction is not connected to the simultaneously retarded and advanced
spacetime propagation of classical fields, as in the spirit of Wheeler-Feynman
electrodynamics. Instead, the transaction is seen as an archetypal structure
intrinsic within the quantum formalism. The present approach is advantageous in
that, while preserving the essential point of Cramer's theory, is also fully
consistent with the standard quantum formalism. In particular, it has the
advantage of avoiding the introduction of elements which are completely
extraneous to quantum formalism (such as the propagation of real physical waves
in four-dimensional spacetime, the phase difference between offer and
confirmation waves which is necessary for the elimination of ""tails"", the
echoing mechanism, etc.)
