Hierarchical clustering of title terms reveals three distinct time periods of
cognitive development of nano research: formative (1981-1990), early
(1991-1998), and current (after 1998). Early period is characterized by the
introduction of thin film deposition techniques, while the current period is
characterized by the increased focus on carbon nanotube and nanoparticle
research. We introduce a method to identify disciplinary components of
nanotechnology. It shows that the nano research is being carried out in a
number of diverse parent disciplines. Currently only 5% of articles are
published in dedicated nano-only journals. We find that some 85% of nano
research today is multidisciplinary. Hierarchical clustering of disciplinary
components reveals that the cognitive content of current nanoscience can be
divided into nine clusters. Some clusters account for a large fraction of nano
research and are identified with such parent disciplines as the condensed
matter and applied physics, materials science, and analytical chemistry. Other
clusters represent much smaller parts of nano research, but are as cognitively
distinct. In the decreasing order of size, these fields are: polymer science,
biotechnology, general chemistry, surface science, and pharmacology. Cognitive
content of research published in nano-only journals is closest to nano research

matter is believed to be unable to radiate, this implies that some of the
accreted dark matter particles must be ejected with high velocities. These
ejected particles may then later hit other cosmological structures and deposit
their momentum within these structures. This induces a pressure between the
cosmological structures which opposes the effect of gravity and may therefore
mimic a cosmological constant. We estimate the magnitude of this effect and
find that it may be as large as the observed accelerated expansion. Our
estimate is accurate only within a few orders of magnitude. It is therefore
important to make a much more careful calculation of this redshift dependent
effect, before beginning to interpret the observed accelerated expansion as a

linearly ordered parameterized systems, i.e., systems with arbitrary many
finite processes placed in an array. The relative positions in the array
capture the relative priorities of the processes. Configurations of such
systems are finite words of arbitrary lengths. The processes communicate using
global transitions constrained by their relative priorities. Intuitively, an
element of the symbolic representation has a base and a set of counters. It
denotes configurations that respect the constraints imposed by the counters and
that have the base as a sub word. We use the new representation in a uniform

measurement information is continuously included into the given prior estimate
(although we perform observations at discrete time steps). The key idea is to
derive a system of ordinary first-order differential equations (ODE) by
employing a new coupled density representation comprising a Gaussian density
and its Dirac Mixture approximation. The ODE is used for continuously tracking
the true non-Gaussian posterior by its best matching Gaussian approximation.
The performance of the new filter is evaluated in comparison with
state-of-the-art filters by means of a canonical benchmark example, the
discrete-time cubic sensor problem.

lexical database on the principles of lexical semantics. It has been accepted
and used extensively by computational linguists ever since it was released.
Inspired by WordNet's success, we propose as an alternative a similar resource,
based on the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and
Phrases.
  Peter Mark Roget published his first Thesaurus over 150 years ago. Countless
writers, orators and students of the English language have used it.
Computational linguists have employed Roget's for almost 50 years in Natural
Language Processing, however hesitated in accepting Roget's Thesaurus because a
proper machine tractable version was not available.
  This dissertation presents an implementation of a machine-tractable version
of the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget's Thesaurus - the first implementation of
its kind to use an entire current edition. It explains the steps necessary for
taking a machine-readable file and transforming it into a tractable system.
This involves converting the lexical material into a format that can be more
easily exploited, identifying data structures and designing classes to
computerize the Thesaurus. Roget's organization is studied in detail and
contrasted with WordNet's.
  We show two applications of the computerized Thesaurus: computing semantic
similarity between words and phrases, and building lexical chains in a text.
The experiments are performed using well-known benchmarks and the results are
compared to those of other systems that use Roget's, WordNet and statistical
techniques. Roget's has turned out to be an excellent resource for measuring
semantic similarity; lexical chains are easily built but more difficult to
evaluate. We also explain ways in which Roget's Thesaurus and WordNet can be
combined.

investigated using a combination of first principle calculations and effective
multi-orbital lattice models. The LDA band structure is well reproduced by a
tight-binding model for the Ni-$e_g$ orbitals defined on the buckled honeycomb
lattice. We highlight peculiar properties of this model which include almost
flat bands as well as linear and quadratic band crossing points. The effect of
local correlations is discussed within the LDA$+U$ scheme and within the
Hartree-Fock approximation for interacting multi-orbital lattice models. Over a
wide range of interaction parameters we find that a ferromagnetic phase is
energetically favored. We discuss the possibility of additional orbital order
which could stabilize a spontaneous Chern insulator with chiral edge modes or a
staggered orbital phase with a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ reconstruction of the
unit cell. By studying an interacting nickel-oxygen lattice model we find that
the stability of these orbitally ordered phases also depends on the value of
the charge-transfer energy. Controlling the charge-transfer energy might
therefore be an important step towards engineering exotic electronic phases in
certain classes of oxide heterostructures.

""Anti-inverted"" H2CO line ratios thus provide an accurate measurement of the H2
density in molecular clouds. Using a radiative transfer model, we demonstrate
that H2CO centimeter wavelength line excitation and detectability are nearly
independent of redshift or gas kinetic temperature. Since the H2CO K-doublet
lines absorb CMB light, and since the CMB lies behind every galaxy and provides
an exceptionally uniform extended illumination source, H2CO is a
distance-independent, extinction-free molecular gas mass-limited tracer of
dense gas in galaxies. A Formaldehyde Deep Field could map the history of
cosmic star formation in a uniquely unbiased fashion and may be possible with
large bandwidth wide-field radio interferometers whereby the silhouettes of
star-forming galaxies would be detected across the epoch of galaxy evolution.
We also examine the possibility that H2CO lines may provide a standardizable
galaxy ruler for cosmology similar to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in galaxy
clusters but applicable to much higher redshifts and larger samples. Finally,
we explore how anti-inverted meterwave H2CO lines in galaxies during the peak

to deliberate noise injected in ciphertexts. The main goal is to generate a
degraded wiretap channel in application layer over which Wyner-type secrecy
encoding is invoked to deliver additional secure information. More
specifically, we study secrecy enhancement of DES block cipher working in
cipher feedback model (CFB) when adjustable and intentional noise is introduced
into encrypted data in application layer. A verification strategy in exhaustive
search step of linear attack is designed to allow Eve to mount a successful
attack in the noisy environment. Thus, a controllable wiretap channel is
created over multiple frames by taking advantage of errors in Eve's
cryptanalysis, whose secrecy capacity is found for the case of known channel
states at receivers. As a result, additional secure information can be
delivered by performing Wyner type secrecy encoding over super-frames ahead of
encryption, namely, our proposed secrecy encoding-then-encryption scheme. These
secrecy bits could be taken as symmetric keys for upcoming frames. Numerical
results indicate that a sufficiently large secrecy rate can be achieved by
selective noise addition.

simulate the interaction of high-gyrofrequency test particles with fully

regime with beta ~ 1, where beta is the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure. We
use the simulation results to calibrate analytical expressions for test
particle velocity-space diffusion coefficients and provide simple fits that can
be used in other work.
  The test particle velocity diffusion in our simulations is due to a
combination of two processes: interactions between particles and magnetic
compressions in the turbulence (as in linear transit-time damping; TTD) and
what we refer to as Fermi Type-B (FTB) interactions, in which charged particles
moving on field lines may be thought of as beads spiralling around moving
wires. We show that test particle heating rates are consistent with a TTD
resonance which is broadened according to a decorrelation prescription that is
Gaussian in time. TTD dominates the heating for v_s >> v_A (e.g. electrons),
where v_s is the thermal speed of species s and v_A is the Alfven speed, while
FTB dominates for v_s << v_A (e.g. minor ions). Proton heating rates for beta ~
1 are comparable to the turbulent cascade rate. Finally, we show that velocity
diffusion of collisionless, large gyrofrequency particles due to large-scale
MHD turbulence does not produce a power-law distribution function.

two viewpoints that are both extremely widespread but almost opposite:
conformists think that what is popular is fashionable, while rebels believe

consists of the afore-mentioned two groups of people that are located on social
networks (a spatial cellular automata network and small-world networks). This
model captures two fundamental kinds of social interactions (coordination and
anti-coordination) simultaneously, and also has its own interest to game
theory: it is a hybrid model of pure competition and pure cooperation. This is
true because when a conformist meets a rebel, they play the zero sum matching
pennies game, which is pure competition. When two conformists (rebels) meet,
they play the (anti-) coordination game, which is pure cooperation. Simulation
shows that simple social interactions greatly promote cooperation: in most
cases people can reach an extraordinarily high level of cooperation, through a
selfish, myopic, naive, and local interacting dynamic (the best response
dynamic). We find that degree of synchronization also plays a critical role,
but mostly on the negative side. Four indices, namely cooperation degree,
average satisfaction degree, equilibrium ratio and complete ratio, are defined
and applied to measure people's cooperation levels from various angles. Phase
transition, as well as emergence of many interesting geographic patterns in the
cellular automata network, is also observed.

Generalization (FSG) is proposed to minimize the difference between N -sample
and large-sample classification error of the Nearest Neighbor classifier. The
proposed FSG employs a new hierarchical distance learning strategy to minimize
the error difference. For this purpose, we first construct an ensemble of
base-layer fuzzy k- Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers, each of which receives
a different feature set extracted from the same sample set. The fuzzy
membership values computed at the decision space of each fuzzy k-NN classifier
are concatenated to form the feature vectors of a fusion space. Finally, the
feature vectors are fed to a meta-layer classifier to learn the degree of
accuracy of the decisions of the base-layer classifiers for meta-layer
classification. Rather than the power of the individual base layer-classifiers,
diversity and cooperation of the classifiers become an important issue to
improve the overall performance of the proposed FSG. A weak base-layer
classifier may boost the overall performance more than a strong classifier, if
it is capable of recognizing the samples, which are not recognized by the rest
of the classifiers, in its own feature space. The experiments explore the type
of the collaboration among the individual classifiers required for an improved
performance of the suggested architecture. Experiments on multiple feature
real-world datasets show that the proposed FSG performs better than the state

Rotation Forest. On the other hand, compatible performances are observed in the
experiments on single feature multi-attribute datasets.

strong localization of the electric and magnetic energies of microwave fields
by MDM ferrite disks. For electromagnetic waves irradiating MDM disks, these
small ferrite samples appear as singular subwavelength regions with time and
space symmetry breakings. The fields scattered by a MDM disk are characterized
by topologically distinctive power-flow vortices and helicity structures. In
this paper we analyze twisted states of microwave fields scattered by MDM
ferrite disks. We show that in a structure of the fields scattered by MDM
particles, one can clearly distinguish rotating topological-phase dislocations.
Specific long-distance topological properties of the fields are exhibited
clearly in the effects of path-dependent interference with two coupled MDM
particles. Such double-twisted scattering is characterized by topologically
originated split-resonance states. Our studies of topological-phase effects and

revolutionizing as war fighting is changing into cyber, technology,

otherwise, misspellings would pass undetected. Unfortunately, traditional
dictionaries suffer from out-of-vocabulary and data sparseness problems as they
do not encompass large vocabulary of words indispensable to cover proper names,
domain-specific terms, technical jargons, special acronyms, and terminologies.
As a result, spell-checkers will incur low error detection and correction rate

parallel shared-memory spell-checking algorithm that uses rich real-world word
statistics from Yahoo! N-Grams Dataset to correct non-word and real-word errors

sub-algorithms that run in a parallel fashion: The error detection algorithm
that detects misspellings, the candidates generation algorithm that generates

contextual error correction. Experiments conducted on a set of text articles
containing misspellings, showed a remarkable spelling error correction rate

sites and this number is exponentially increasing every day. Fundamentally,
Information Retrieval (IR) is the science and practice of storing documents and
retrieving information from within these documents. Mathematically, IR systems
are at the core based on a feature vector model coupled with a term weighting
scheme that weights terms in a document according to their significance with
respect to the context in which they appear. Practically, Vector Space Model
(VSM), Term Frequency (TF), and Inverse Term Frequency (IDF) are among other
long-established techniques employed in mainstream IR systems. However, present
IR models only target generic-type text documents, in that, they do not
consider specific formats of files such as HTML web documents. This paper
proposes a new semantic-sensitive web information retrieval model for HTML
documents. It consists of a vector model called SWVM and a weighting scheme
called BTF-IDF, particularly designed to support the indexing and retrieval of
HTML web documents. The chief advantage of the proposed model is that it
assigns extra weights for terms that appear in certain pre-specified HTML tags
that are correlated to the semantics of the document. Additionally, the model
is semantic-sensitive as it generates synonyms for every term being indexed and
later weights them appropriately to increase the likelihood of retrieving
documents with similar context but different vocabulary terms. Experiments
conducted, revealed a momentous enhancement in the precision of web IR systems
and a radical increase in the number of relevant documents being retrieved. As
further research, the proposed model is to be upgraded so as to support the

we use in rare event simulations to identify some of the vacancy diffusion
paths in a 2D crystal. Our simulations reveal, in addition to the simple and
expected nearest neighbor hopping path, a collective migration mechanism of the
vacancy. This mechanism involves several lattice sites and produces a long
range migration of the vacancy. Finally, we also observed a vacancy induced
crystal reorientation process.

process to construct a single category $\Gr(X)$ by gluing categories in the

from a small category $I$ to the 2-category $\kCat$ of small $\k$-categories
for a fixed commutative ring $\k$. In our previous paper we defined derived
equivalences of those colax functors. Roughly speaking two colax functors $X,
X' \colon I \to \kCat$ are derived equivalent if there is a derived equivalence
from $X(i)$ to $X'(i)$ for all objects $i$ in $I$ satisfying some
""$I$-equivariance"" conditions. In this paper we glue the derived equivalences
between $X(i)$ and $X'(i)$ together to obtain a derived equivalence between
Grothendieck constructions $\Gr(X)$ and $\Gr(X')$, which shows that if colax
functors are derived equivalent, then so are their Grothendieck constructions.
This generalizes and well formulates the fact that if two $\k$-categories with
a $G$-action for a group $G$ are ""$G$-equivariantly"" derived equivalent, then
their orbit categories are derived equivalent. As an easy application we see by
a unified proof that if two $\Bbbk$-algebras $A$ and $A'$ are derived
equivalent, then so are the path categories $AQ$ and $A'Q$ for any quiver $Q$;
so are the incidence categories $AS$ and $A'S$ for any poset $S$; and so are
the monoid algebras $AG$ and $A'G$ for any monoid $G$. Also we will give
examples of gluing of many smaller derived equivalences together to have a

Discontinuous Transmission (BS-DTX) control and user scheduling for downlink
coordinated MIMO systems with energy harvesting capability. To reduce the
complexity and signaling overhead in practical systems, the BS-DTX control is
adaptive to both the energy state information (ESI) and the data queue state
information (QSI) over a longer timescale. The user scheduling is adaptive to
the ESI, the QSI and the channel state information (CSI) over a shorter
timescale. We show that the two-timescale delay-optimal control problem can be
modeled as an infinite horizon average cost Partially Observed Markov Decision
Problem (POMDP), which is well-known to be a difficult problem in general. By
using sample-path analysis and exploiting specific problem structure, we first
obtain some structural results on the optimal control policy and derive an
equivalent Bellman equation with reduced state space. To reduce the complexity
and facilitate distributed implementation, we obtain a delay-aware distributed
solution with the BS-DTX control at the BS controller (BSC) and the user
scheduling at each cluster manager (CM) using approximate dynamic programming
and distributed stochastic learning. We show that the proposed distributed
two-timescale algorithm converges almost surely. Furthermore, using queueing
theory, stochastic geometry and optimization techniques, we derive sufficient
conditions for the data queues to be stable in the coordinated MIMO network and
discuss various design insights.

  We start with a simple proof of a result of Vereshchagin saying that
$\limsup_n C(x|n)$ equals $C^{0'}(x)$. Then we use the same argument to prove
similar results for prefix complexity, a priori probability on binary tree, to
prove Conidis' theorem about limits of effectively open sets, and also to
improve the results of Muchnik about limit frequencies. As a by-product, we get
a criterion of 2-randomness proved by Miller: a sequence $X$ is 2-random if and
only if there exists $c$ such that any prefix $x$ of $X$ is a prefix of some
string $y$ such that $C(y)\ge |y|-c$. (In the 1960ies this property was
suggested in Kolmogorov as one of possible randomness definitions.) We also get
another 2-randomness criterion by Miller and Nies: $X$ is 2-random if and only
if $C(x)\ge |x|-c$ for some $c$ and infinitely many prefixes $x$ of $X$.
  This is a modified version of our old paper that contained a weaker (and
cumbersome) version of Conidis' result, and the proof used low basis theorem
(in quite a strange way). The full version was formulated there as a
conjecture. This conjecture was later proved by Conidis. Bruno Bauwens

modification of our original argument, and we reproduce Bauwens' argument with

model with a disk-halo and a spherical nucleus, in order to investigate the
transition from regular to chaotic motion for stars moving in the meridian
(r,z) plane. We study in detail the transition from regular to chaotic motion,
in two different cases: the time independent model and the time evolving model.
In the time dependent model, we follow the evolution of orbits as the galaxy
develops a dense and massive nucleus in its core, as mass is transported
exponentially from the disk to the galactic center. In addition, we construct
some numerical diagrams in which we present the correlations between the main
parameters of our galactic model. Our numerical calculations indicate, that
stars with values of angular momentum Lz less than or equal to a critical value
Lzc, moving near to the galactic plane, are scattered to the halo upon
encountering the nuclear region and subsequently display chaotic motion. A
linear relationship exists between the critical value of the angular momentum
Lzc and the mass of the nucleus Mn. Furthermore, the extent of the chaotic
region increases as the value of the mass of the nucleus increases. Moreover,
our simulations indicate that the degree of chaos increases linearly, as the
mass of the nucleus increases. These results strongly indicate that the ordered
or chaotic nature of orbits, depends on the presence of massive objects in the
galactic cores of the galaxies. Our results suggest, that for disk galaxies
with massive and prominent nuclei, the low angular momentum stars in the
associated central regions of the galaxy, must be in predominantly chaotic
orbits. Some theoretical arguments to support the numerically derived outcomes
are presented. Comparison with similar previous works is also made.

methods of algebraic topology and gave no information on the topology the
manifold which realises the homology class. We give a purely combinatorial
construction of a manifold that realises a multiple of a given homology class.
For every $n$, this construction yields a manifold $M^n_0$ with the following
universality property: For any $X$ and $z\in H_n(X,\mathbb{Z})$, a multiple of
$z$ can be realised by an image of a (non-ramified) finite-sheeted covering of

manifold glued in a special way out of $2^n$ permutahedra. (The permutahedron
is a special convex polytope with $(n+1)!$ vertices.) Among small covers over
other simple polytopes, we find a broad class of examples of URC-manifolds. In
particular, in dimension 4, we find a hyperbolic URC-manifold. Thus we obtain
that a multiple of every homology class can be realised by an image of a

searching solutions for the drift-diffusion equation coupled to the Poisson's
equation relating the effective electric field to the net charge density. The
effect of different ion mobilities on the immittance, i.e., situations with
equal and different diffusion coefficients for positive and negative ions, are

an additional external perturbation. Two different cases are investigated. In
the first case the external perturbation is fixed, while in the second case it
is varying with the time. Numerical experiments suggest, that responsible for
the chaotic phenomena is the external perturbation, combined with the dense
nucleus. Linear relationships are found to exist, between the critical value of
the angular momentum and the dynamical parameters of the galactic system that
is, the strength of the external perturbation, the flattening parameter and the
radius of the nucleus. Moreover, the extent of the chaotic regions in the phase
plane, increases linearly as the strength of the external perturbation and the
flattening parameter increases. On the contrary, we observe that the percentage
covered by chaotic orbits in the phase plane, decreases linearly, as the scale
length of the nucleus increases, becoming less dense. Theoretical arguments are
used to support and explain the numerically obtained outcomes. A comparison of
the present outcomes with earlier results is also presented.

mixed graph and a collection of source-target vertex pairs. The objective is to
orient the undirected edges of the graph so as to maximize the number of pairs
that admit a directed source-target path. This problem has recently arisen in
the study of biological networks, and it also has applications in communication
networks.
  In this paper, we identify an interesting local-to-global orientation
property. This property enables us to modify the best known algorithms for
maximum mixed graph orientation and some of its special structured instances,
due to Elberfeld et al. (CPM '11), and obtain improved approximation ratios. We
further proceed by developing an algorithm that achieves an even better
approximation guarantee for the general setting of the problem. Finally, we
study several well-motivated variants of this orientation problem.

  January 2010",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many emerging computer applications require the processing of large numbers,
larger than what a CPU can handle. In fact, the top of the line PCs can only
manipulate numbers not longer than 32 bits or 64 bits. This is due to the size
of the registers and the data-path inside the CPU. As a result, performing
arithmetic operations such as subtraction on big-integer numbers is to some
extend limited. Different algorithms were designed in an attempt to solve this
problem; they all operate on big-integer numbers by first converting them into
a binary representation then performing bitwise operations on single bits. Such
algorithms are of complexity O(n) where n is the total number of bits in each
operand. This paper proposes two new algorithms for performing arithmetic
subtraction on big-integer numbers. The two algorithms are different in that
one is sequential while the other is parallel. The similarity between them is
that both follow the same concept of dividing the big-integer inputs into
several blocks or tokens of 60 bits (18 digits) each; thus reducing the input
size n in O(n) by a factor of 60. Subtraction of corresponding tokens, one from
each operand, is performed as humans perform subtraction, using a pencil and a
paper in the decimal system. Both algorithms are to be implemented using MS
C#.NET 2005 and tested over a multiple processor system. Further studies can be
done on other arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication.

  Programming Language","WCECS 2008, October 22-24, 2008, San Francisco, USA",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern computer programming languages are governed by complex syntactic
rules. They are unlike natural languages; they require extensive manual work
and a significant amount of learning and practicing for an individual to become
skilled at and to write correct programs. Computer programming is a difficult,
complicated, unfamiliar, non-automated, and a challenging discipline for
everyone; especially, for students, new programmers and end-users. This paper
proposes a new programming language and an environment for writing computer
applications based on source-code generation. It is mainly a template-driven
automatic natural imperative programming language called MyProLang. It
harnesses GUI templates to generate proprietary natural language source-code,
instead of having computer programmers write the code manually. MyProLang is a
blend of five elements. A proprietary natural programming language with
unsophisticated grammatical rules and expressive syntax; automation templates
that automate the generation of instructions and thereby minimizing the
learning and training time; an NLG engine to generate natural instructions; a
source-to-source compiler that analyzes, parses, and build executables; and an
ergonomic IDE that houses diverse functions whose role is to simplify the
software development process. MyProLang is expected to make programming open to
everyone including students, programmers and end-users. In that sense, anyone
can start programming systematically, in an automated manner and in natural
language; without wasting time in learning how to formulate instructions and
arrange expressions, without putting up with unfamiliar structures and symbols,
and without being annoyed by syntax errors. In the long run, this increases the
productivity, quality and time-to-market in software development.
