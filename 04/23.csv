decomposed and managed in smaller components. Object-oriented (OO) paradigm has
facilitated software industry with more reliable and manageable software and
its design. The quality of the software design can be measured through
different metrics such as Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) design metrics, Mood
Metrics & Lorenz and Kidd metrics. CK metrics is one of the oldest and most
reliable metrics among all metrics available to software industry to evaluate
OO design. This paper presents an evaluation of CK metrics to propose an
improved CK design metrics values to reduce the defects during software design

effect of any CK design metrics exists on total number of defects per module or
not. This is achieved by conducting survey in two software development

extinct by stochastic fluctuations in sex determination, causing all their
members to become male or female in a generation. In this work we calculate the
time to extinction of isolated populations with fixed number $N$ of individuals
that are updated according to the Moran birth and death process. At each time
step, one individual is randomly selected and replaced by its offspring
resulting from mating with another individual of opposite sex; the offspring
can be male or female with equal probability. A set of $N$ time steps is called
a generation, the average time it takes for the entire population to be
replaced. The number k of females fluctuates in time, similarly to a random
walk, and extinction, which is the only asymptotic possibility, occurs when k=0

distribution of males and females to approach the binomial distribution. This
distribution, however, is unstable and the population eventually goes extinct
in 2^N/N generations. We also discuss the robustness of these results against
bias in the determination of the sex of the offspring, a characteristic
promoted by infection by the bacteria Wolbachia in some arthropod species or by

repositories of increasingly valuable information about patients' health
conditions and responses to treatment over time. Methods: We describe a case
study of 423 patients treated by Centerstone within Tennessee and Indiana in
which we utilized electronic health record data to generate predictive
algorithms of individual patient treatment response. Multiple models were
constructed using predictor variables derived from clinical, financial and
geographic data. Results: For the 423 patients, 101 deteriorated, 223 improved
and in 99 there was no change in clinical condition. Based on modeling of
various clinical indicators at baseline, the highest accuracy in predicting
individual patient response ranged from 70-72% within the models tested. In
terms of individual predictors, the Centerstone Assessment of Recovery Level -
Adult (CARLA) baseline score was most significant in predicting outcome over
time (odds ratio 4.1 + 2.27). Other variables with consistently significant
impact on outcome included payer, diagnostic category, location and provision
of case management services. Conclusions: This approach represents a promising
avenue toward reducing the current gap between research and practice across
healthcare, developing data-driven clinical decision support based on
real-world populations, and serving as a component of embedded clinical
artificial intelligences that ""learn"" over time.

many heterogeneous interacting parts; multiple scales; complicated transition
laws; unexpected or unpredicted emergence; sensitive dependence on initial
conditions; path-dependent dynamics; networked hierarchical connectivities;
interaction of autonomous agents; self-organisation; non-equilibrium dynamics;
combinatorial explosion; adaptivity to changing environments; co-evolving
subsystems; ill-defined boundaries; and multilevel dynamics. In this context,
science is seen as the process of abstracting the dynamics of systems from
data. This presents many challenges including: data gathering by large-scale
experiment, participatory sensing and social computation, managing huge
distributed dynamic and heterogeneous databases; moving from data to dynamical
models, going beyond correlations to cause-effect relationships, understanding
the relationship between simple and comprehensive models with appropriate
choices of variables, ensemble modeling and data assimilation, modeling systems
of systems of systems with many levels between micro and macro; and formulating
new approaches to prediction, forecasting, and risk, especially in systems that
can reflect on and change their behaviour in response to predictions, and
systems whose apparently predictable behaviour is disrupted by apparently
unpredictable rare or extreme events. These challenges are part of the FuturICT
agenda.

statistical measures of uncertainty, which may still be thermodynamically
significant. However, laboratory measurements of entropy continue to rely on
direct measurements of heat. New technologies that can map out myriads of
microscopic degrees of freedom suggest direct determination of configurational
entropy by counting in systems where it is thermodynamically inaccessible, such
as granular and colloidal materials, proteins and lithographically fabricated
nanometre-scale arrays. Here, we demonstrate a conditional-probability
technique to calculate entropy densities of translation-invariant states on
lattices using limited configuration data on small clusters, and apply it to
arrays of interacting nanometre-scale magnetic islands (artificial spin ice).
Models for statistically disordered systems can be assessed by applying the
method to relative entropy densities. For artificial spin ice, this analysis
shows that nearest-neighbour correlations drive longer-range ones.

parity quantum numbers, the LS method is a crucial technique used in
identifying quantum critical points of Gaussian and
Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type quantum phase transitions. These
transitions that occur in many one-dimensional systems are usually difficult to

Oshikawa's conjecture in 1992 on the presence of an intermediate phase in the

profiles of Ly-a haloes around high-z galaxies as a function of environment and
UV luminosity. We find that the slopes of the Ly-a radial profiles become
flatter as the Mpc-scale LAE surface densities increase, but they are almost
independent of the central UV luminosities. The characteristic exponential
scale lengths of the Ly-a haloes appear to be proportional to the square of the
LAE surface densities (r(Lya) \propto Sigma(LAE)^2). Including the diffuse,
extended Ly-a haloes, the rest-frame Ly-a equivalent width of the LAEs in the
densest regions approaches EW_0(Lya) ~ 200 A, the maximum value expected for
young (< 10^7 yr) galaxies. This suggests that Ly-a photons formed via shock
compression by gas outflows or cooling radiation by gravitational gas inflows
may partly contribute to illuminate the Ly-a haloes; however, most of their
Ly-a luminosity can be explained by photo-ionisation by ionising photons or
scattering of Ly-a photons produced in HII regions in and around the central
galaxies. Regardless of the source of Ly-a photons, if the Ly-a haloes trace
the overall gaseous structure following the dark matter distributions, it is
not surprising that the Ly-a spatial extents depend more strongly on the
surrounding Mpc-scale environment than on the activities of the central
galaxies.

indicated and numerically verified the generation of the helical wavefront of
optical beams using a conical-shape reflector. Because the optical reflection
is largely free from chromatic aberrations, the conical reflector has an
advantage of being able to manipulate the helical wavefront with broadband
light such as white light or short light pulses. In this study, we introduce
geometrical understanding of the function of the conical reflector using the
spatially-dependent geometric phase, or more specifically, the spin redirection
phase. We also present a theoretical analysis based on three-dimensional matrix
calculus and elucidate relationships of the spin, orbital, and total angular
momenta between input and output beams. These analyses are very useful when
designing other optical devices that utilize spatially-dependent spin
redirection phases. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of
helical beams from an ordinary Gaussian beam using a metallic conical-shape
reflector.

theoretical model. The metallicity and \alpha-elements distributions are
investigated for stars in the Sgr streams and for Galactic stars at the same
locations. We find that the Sgr stars have two peaks in the metallicity
distribution while the Galactic stars have a more prominent metal-poor peak.
Meanwhile, [\alpha/Fe] ratios of the Sgr stars are lower than those of the
Galactic stars. Among the Sgr stars, we find a difference in the metallicity
distribution between the leading and trailing arms of the Sgr tidal tails. The
metallicity and [\alpha/Fe] distribution of the leading arm is similar to that
of the Galaxy. The trailing arm is composed mainly of a metal rich component
and [\alpha/Fe] is obviously lower than that of the Galactic stars. The
metallicity gradient is -(1.8 \pm 0.3)\times10^{-3} dex degree^{-1} in the
first wrap of the trailing arm and -(1.5 \pm 0.4)\times10^{-3} dex degree^{-1}
in the first wrap of the leading arm. No significant gradient exists along the
second wraps of the leading or trailing arms. It seems that the Sgr dwarf
galaxy initially lost the metal poor component in the second wrap (older) arms
due to the tidal force of our Galaxy and then the metal rich component is
disrupted in the first wrap (younger) arms. Finally, we found that the velocity
dispersion of the trailing arm from 88^\circ<\Lambda_\odot<112^\circ is \sigma

bundle has a fundamental class ${\kappa_I}$ in the equivariant cohomology

Gr$ in the standard way and the last factor $C^*$ acts by multiplication on
fibers of the bundle. We express this fundamental class as a sum $Y_I$ of the
Yangian $Y(gl_2)$ weight functions $(W_J)_J$. We describe a relation of $Y_I$
with the double Schur polynomial $[S_I]$.
  A modified version of the $\kappa_I$ classes, named $\kappa'_I$, satisfy an
orthogonality relation with respect to an inner product induced by integration
on the non-compact manifold $T^* Gr$. This orthogonality is analogous to the
well known orthogonality satisfied by the classes of Schubert varieties with
respect to integration on $Gr$.
  The classes $(\kappa'_I)_I$ form a basis in the suitably localized
equivariant cohomology $H^*_{T}(T^* Gr)$. This basis depends on the choice of
the coordinate flag in $C^n$. We show that the bases corresponding to different
coordinate flags are related by the Yangian R-matrix.

SrCr$_{9p}$Ga$_{12-9p}$O$_{19}$ (SCGO), we study the classical Heisenberg model

This allows us to address generic aspects of the physics of non-magnetic
vacancies in a classical spin liquid. We explicitly demonstrate that the pure
($x=0$) system remains a spin-liquid down to the lowest temperatures, with an
unusual {\em non-monotonic} temperature dependence of the susceptibility, which
even turns diamagnetic for the apical spins between the two kagome layers. For
$x> 0$ but small, the low temperature magnetic response of the system is most
naturally described in terms of the properties of spatially extended spin
textures that cloak an ""orphan"" $S=3/2$ Cr$^{3+}$ spin in direct proximity to a
pair of missing sites belonging to the same triangular simplex. In the $T
\rightarrow 0$ limit, these orphan-texture complexes each carry a net
magnetization that is exactly half the magnetic moment of an individual spin of
the undiluted system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that they interact via an
entropic {\em temperature dependent} {\em pair-wise exchange interaction}
$J_{eff}(T,\vec{r}) \sim T {\mathcal J} (\vec{r} \sqrt{T})$ that has a
logarithmic form at short-distances and decays exponentially beyond a thermal
correlation length $\xi(T) \sim 1/\sqrt{T}$. The sign of $J_{eff}$ depends on
whether the two orphan spins belong to the same Kagome layer or not. We provide
a detailed analytical account of these properties using an effective field
theory approach specifically tailored for the problem at hand. These results
are in quantitative agreement with large-scale Monte Carlo numerics.

doublet is identified with extra component of the gauge field in higher
dimensions and its mass becomes finite and stable under quantum corrections due
to the higher dimensional gauge symmetry. On the other hand, Yukawa coupling is
provided by the gauge coupling, which seems to mean that the flavor mixing and
CP violation do not arise at it stands. In this talk, we discuss that the
flavor mixing is originated from simultaneously non-diagonalizable bulk and
brane mass matrices. Then, this mechanism is applied to various flavor changing
neutral current (FCNC) processes via Kaluza-Klein (KK) gauge boson exchange at
tree level and constraints for compactification scale are obtained.

atom indicates that spherical radiation from the dipole under coherent
interaction, i.e., Rayleigh scattering, has a power level comparable to that of
spontaneous emission resulting from an incoherent process. Whereas spontaneous
emission is nearly isotropic and has random polarization generally, Rayleigh
scattering is strongly anisotropic and polarized in association with incident
light. In the case where Rabi frequency is much larger than frequency detuning
and spontaneous emission rate, while the power of spontaneous emission varies
with time at the Rabi frequency, the power of Rayleigh scattering oscillates at
twice the Rabi frequency. Moreover, the radiation pressure force acting on an
atom due to Rayleigh scattering exceeds that caused by spontaneous emission
when frequency detuning is large.

spectrum of GX 301-2 suggest that the surface field of the neutron star is
B_CRSF ~ 4 x 10^{12}G. The same value has been derived in modelling the rapid
spin-up episodes in terms of the Keplerian disk accretion scenario. However,
the spin-down rate observed during the spin-down trends significantly exceeds
the value expected in currently used spin-evolution scenarios. This indicates
that either the surface field of the star exceeds 50 x B_CRSF, or a currently
used accretion scenario is incomplete. We show that the above discrepancy can
be avoided if the accreting material is magnetized. The magnetic pressure in
the accretion flow increases more rapidly than its ram pressure and, under
certain conditions, significantly affects the accretion picture. The spin-down
torque applied to the neutron star in this case is larger than that evaluated
within a non-magnetized accretion scenario. We find that the observed spin
evolution of the pulsar can be explained in terms of the magnetically
controlled accretion flow scenario provided the surface field of the neutron

identity associated with the T-duality. This indicates that a group of S-matrix
elements is invariant under the linear T-duality transformations on the
external states. If one evaluates one component of such T-dual multiplet, then
all other components may be found by the simple use of the linear T-duality.
The assumption that fields must be independent of the Killing coordinate,
however, may cause, in some cases, the T-dual multiplet not to be gauge
invariant. In those cases, the S-matrix elements contain more than one T-dual
multiplet which are intertwined by the gauge symmetry.
  In this paper, we apply the T-dual Ward identity on the S-matrix element of
one RR $(p-3)$-form and two NSNS states on the world volume of a D$_p$-brane to
find its corresponding T-dual multiplet. In the case that the RR potential has
two transverse indices, the T-dual multiplet is gauge invariant, however, in
the case that it has one transverse index the multiplet is not gauge invariant.
We find a new T-dual multiplet in this case by imposing the gauge symmetry.
  We show that the multiplets are reproduced by explicit calculation, and their
low energy contact terms at order $\alpha'^2$ are consistent with the existing
couplings in the literature.

motions are composed of semi-regular flows of convective rolling cells and the
fully developed turbulence. Although the convective rolling cells are crucial
for the properties of the stellar convection that transports heat and mixes
materials in the stellar interior, their contributions have not been included
in turbulent convection models proposed up to now. We simplify the structure of
the convective rolling cells as a cellular pattern moving circle by circle with
different angular velocities around the center, estimating their typical size
by solving approximately for the temperature difference over the stationary
temperature background and their average shear of velocity by evaluating
approximately their kinetic energy transformed by themselves working as thermal
engines from the heat involved in the convective rolling cells. We obtain a
steady state solution in the fully local equilibrium which is similar to what
is obtained in the standard mixing-length theory, by applying such model
assumptions to the standard $k$-$\varepsilon$ model and properly choosing the
model parameter $c_{\varepsilon 3}$. Accordingly, we propose a $k$-$\omega$
model to include the transport effect of turbulence in stars. Preliminary
results of their applications to the sun and other stars with different masses
and in different evolutionary stages show good agreements with results of the
standard mixing-length theory and results of numerical simulations for the

allows one to construct an algebraic equation whose power series expansion
provides the enumeration. Classical tools from complex analysis, such as
singularity analysis, can then be used to determine the asymptotic behavior of

often be described by several regular expressions, and we estimate the number
of distinct languages denoted by regular expressions of size n. We also give
asymptotic estimates for these quantities. For the first few values, we provide

ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor $J_1$ and antiferromagnetic
next-nearest-neighbor $J$ exchange interactions in strong magnetic field $H$.
It is well known that due to attraction between magnons quantum phase
transitions (QPTs) take place at $H=H_s$ from the fully polarized phase to
nematic ones if $J>|J_1|/4$. Such a transition at $J>0.368|J_1|$ is
characterized by softening of the two-magnon bound-state spectrum. Using a bond
operator formalism we propose a bosonic representation of the spin Hamiltonian
containing, aside from bosons describing one-magnon spin-1 excitations, a boson
describing spin-2 excitations which spectrum coincides at $H\ge H_s$ with the
two-magnon bound-state spectrum obtained before. The presence of the bosonic
mode in the theory that softens at $H=H_s$ makes substantially standard the QPT
consideration. In 1D case at $H<H_s$, we find an expression for the
magnetization which describes well existing numerical data. Expressions for
spin correlators are obtained which coincide with those derived before either
in the limiting case of $J\gg|J_1|$ or using a phenomenological theory. In
quasi-1D magnets, we find that the boundary in the $H$--$T$ plane between the
fully polarized and the nematic phases is given by $H_s(0)-H_s(T)\propto
T^{3/2}$. Simple expressions are obtained in the nematic phase for static spin
correlators, spectra of magnons and the soft mode, magnetization and the
nematic order parameter. All static two-spin correlation functions are short
ranged with the correlation length proportional to $1/\ln(1+|J_1|/J)$.
Dynamical spin susceptibilities are discussed and it is shown that the soft
mode can be observed experimentally in the longitudinal channel.

either the total number of bends, or the maximum number of bends per edge.
However, this neglects that in typical applications, edges have varying
importance. Moreover, as bend minimization over all planar embeddings is
NP-hard, most approaches focus on a fixed planar embedding.
  We consider the problem OptimalFlexDraw that is defined as follows. Given a
planar graph G on n vertices with maximum degree 4 and for each edge e a cost
function cost_e : N_0 --> R defining costs depending on the number of bends on
e, compute an orthogonal drawing of G of minimum cost. Note that this optimizes
over all planar embeddings of the input graphs, and the cost functions allow
fine-grained control on the bends of edges.
  In this generality OptimalFlexDraw is NP-hard. We show that it can be solved
efficiently if 1) the cost function of each edge is convex and 2) the first
bend on each edge does not cause any cost (which is a condition similar to the
positive flexibility for the decision problem FlexDraw). Moreover, we show the
existence of an optimal solution with at most three bends per edge except for a
single edge per block (maximal biconnected component) with up to four bends.
For biconnected graphs we obtain a running time of O(n T_flow(n)), where
T_flow(n) denotes the time necessary to compute a minimum-cost flow in a planar
flow network with multiple sources and sinks. For connected graphs that are not
biconnected we need an additional factor of O(n).

experimental results in the same setup and for the same Prandtl number, the
structure of the laminar boundary layers of the velocity and temperature fields
is found to deviate from the prediction of the Prandtl-Blasius-Pohlhausen
theory. Deviations decrease when a dynamical rescaling of the data with an
instantaneously defined boundary layer thickness is performed and the analysis
plane is aligned with the instantaneous direction of the large-scale
circulation in the closed cell. Our numerical results demonstrate that
important assumptions which enter existing classical laminar boundary layer
theories for forced and natural convection are violated, such as the strict
two-dimensionality of the dynamics or the steadiness of the fluid motion. The
boundary layer dynamics consists of two essential local dynamical building
blocks, a plume detachment and a post-plume phase. The former is associated
with larger variations of the instantaneous thickness of velocity and
temperature boundary layer and a fully three-dimensional local flow. The
post-plume dynamics is connected with the large-scale circulation in the cell
that penetrates the boundary region from above. The mean turbulence profiles
taken in localized sections of the boundary layer for both dynamical phases are
also compared with solutions of perturbation expansions of the boundary layer
equations of forced or natural convection towards mixed convection. Our
analysis of both boundary layers shows that the near-wall dynamics combines
elements of forced Blasius-type and natural convection.

semiclassical method is employed to reserve the expression for RKKY interaction
in clean graphene. Due to the pseudogap at Dirac point, the RKKY coupling in
undoped grapheme is found to be proportional to $1/R^3$. Next, we investigate
how the RKKY interaction depends on nonmagnetic disorder strength and gate
voltage by studying numerically the Anderson tight-binding model on a honeycomb
lattice. We observe that the RKKY interaction along the armchair direction is
more robust to nonmagnetic disorder than in other directions. This effect can
be explained semiclassically: The presence of multiple shortest paths between
two lattice sites in the armchair directions is found to be responsible for the
reduceddisorder sensitivity. We also present the distribution of the RKKY
interaction for the zigzag and armchair directions. We identify three different
shapes of the distributions which are repeated periodically along the zigzag
direction, while only one kind, and more narrow distribution, is observed along
the armchair direction. Moreover, we find that the distribution of amplitudes
of the RKKY interaction crosses over from a non-Gaussian shape with very long
tails to a completely log-normal distribution when increasing the nonmagnetic
disorder strength. The width of the log-normal distribution is found to
linearly increase with the strength of disorder, in agreement with analytical
predictions. At finite gate voltage near the Dirac point, Friedel oscillation
appears in addition to the oscillation from the interference between two Dirac
points. This results in a beating pattern. We study how these beating patterns
are effected by the nonmagnetic disorder in doped graphene.

environment around SV Psc using high-angular resolution interferometry
observations in the mid-IR with the Very Large Telescope MID-infrared
Interferometric instrument (VLTI/MIDI).
  Methods. Interferometric data in the N-band taken at different baseline
lengths (ranging from 32-64 m) and position angles (73- 142{\deg}) allow a
study of the morphology of the circumstellar environment close to the star. The
data are interpreted on the basis of 2-dimensional, chromatic geometrical
models using the fitting software tool GEM-FIND developed for this purpose.
  Results. The results favor two scenarios: (i) the presence of a highly
inclined, optically thin, dusty disk surrounding the central star; (ii) the
presence of an unresolved binary companion at a separation of 13.7 AU and a
position angle of 121.8{\deg} NE. The derived orbital period of the binary is
38.1 yr. This detection is in good agreement with hydrodynamic simulations
showing that a close companion could be responsible for the entrainment of the
gas and dust into a circumbinary structure.

intervals for experimental data from $p+\bar{p}$ non-singly diffractive

correlations are discussed as a function of rapidity window ($\Delta \eta$)
symmetric about the central rapidity as well as rapidity window separated by a
gap ($\eta_{gap}$) between forward and backward regions. While the correlations
are observed to be independent of $\Delta \eta$, it is found to decrease with
increase in $\eta_{gap}$. This reflects the role of short range correlations
and justifies the use of $\eta_{gap}$ to obtain the accurate information about
the physics of interest, the long range correlations. The experimental $b$
value shows a linear dependence on $\ln \sqrt{s}$ with the maximum value of
unity being reached at $\sqrt{s}$ = 16 TeV, beyond the top LHC energy. However
calculations from the PYTHIA and PHOJET models indicate a deviation from linear
dependence on $\ln \sqrt{s}$ and saturation in the $b$ values being reached
beyond $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.8 TeV. Such a saturation in correlation values could have
interesting physical interpretations related to clan structures in particle
production. Strong forward-backward correlations are associated with cluster
production in the collisions. The average number of charged particles to which
the clusters fragments, called the cluster size, are found to also increase
linearly with $\ln \sqrt{s}$ for both data and the models studied. The rate of
increase in cluster size vs. $\ln \sqrt{s}$ from models studied are larger
compared to those from the data and higher for PHOJET compared to PYTHIA. Our
study indicates that the forward-backward measurements will provide a clear
distinguishing observable for the models studied at LHC energies.

important for primordial non-Gaussianity studies and also parameter constraints
from the CMB lensing bispectrum signal. Because of cancellations individual
effects can appear larger or smaller than they are in total, so a full analysis
may be required to avoid biases. I relate angular scales on the sky to physical
scales at recombination using the optical equations, and give full-sky results
for the large-scale adiabatic temperature bispectrum from Ricci focussing
(expansion of the ray bundle), Weyl lensing (convergence and shear), and
temperature redshift modulations of small-scale power. The delta N expansion of
the beam is described by the constant temperature 3-curvature, and gives a
nearly-observable version of the consistency relation prediction from
single-field inflation. I give approximate arguments to quantify the likely
importance of dynamical effects, and argue that they can be neglected for
modulation scales l <~ 100, which is sufficient for lensing studies and also
allows robust tests of local primordial non-Gaussianity using only the
large-scale modulation modes. For accurate numerical results early and
late-time ISW effects must be accounted for, though I confirm that the

integer spin-S, the system will undergo $S$ first-order phase transitions with
the successive symmetry breaking with the magnetization $M=S,S-1,...0$. For the

with $M=S,S-1,...1/2$ stepwise structure, in addition, there is a continuous
phase transition due to the spin-flip $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. In the low
temperature regions, all first-order phase transitions are accompanied by the
successive disappearance of the optional spin-component pairs($s,-s$),

obstacles against planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. We reexamine
this problem by considering porosity evolution of dust aggregates. We apply a
porosity model based on recent N-body simulations of aggregate collisions,
which allows us to study the porosity change upon collision for a wide range of
impact energies. As a first step, we neglect collisional fragmentation and
instead focus on dust evolution outside the snow line, where the fragmentation
has been suggested to be less significant than inside the snow line because of
a high sticking efficiency of icy particles. We show that dust particles can
evolve into highly porous aggregates (with internal densities of much less than
0.1 g/cm^3) even if collisional compression is taken into account. We also show
that the high porosity triggers significant acceleration in collisional growth.
This acceleration is a natural consequence of particles' aerodynamical property
at low Knudsen numbers, i.e., at particle radii larger than the mean free path
of the gas molecules. Thanks to this rapid growth, the highly porous aggregates
are found to overcome the radial drift barrier at orbital radii less than 10 AU
(assuming the minimum-mass solar nebula model). This suggests that, if
collisional fragmentation is truly insignificant, formation of icy

groups) do not actively participate in transport, but exchange electrons with
the two main sites. These auxiliary sites allow for a variable number of

planetary system, interspersed with one or more belts of dusty debris. We
present far-infrared images obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory with
an angular resolution between 5.7 and 36.7 arcsec at wavelengths between 70 and
500 micrometer. The images show the main debris belt in great detail. Even at
high spatial resolution, the belt appears smooth. The region in between the
belt and the central star is not devoid of material; thermal emission is
observed here as well. Also at the location of the star, excess emission is
detected.
  We use a dynamical model together with radiative-transfer tools to derive the
parameters of the debris disk. We include detailed models of the interaction of
the dust grains with radiation, for both the radiation pressure and the
temperature determination. Comparing these models to the spatially resolved
temperature information contained in the images allows us to place strong
constraints on the presence of grains that will be blown out of the system by
radiation pressure. We use this to derive the dynamical parameters of the
system.
  The appearance of the belt points towards a remarkably active system in which
dust grains are produced at a very high rate by a collisional cascade in a
narrow region filled with dynamically excited planetesimals. Dust particles
with sizes below the blow-out size are abundantly present. The equivalent of
2000 one-km-sized comets are destroyed every day, out of a cometary reservoir
amounting to 110 Earth masses. From comparison of their scattering and thermal
properties, we find evidence that the dust grains are fluffy aggregates, which
indicates a cometary origin. The excess emission at the location of the star
may be produced by hot dust with a range of temperatures, but may also be due
to gaseous free-free emission from a stellar wind.

regular intervals of \sim 2-3 years in the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
era. After remaining in an almost quiescent state for 3 years, it again became
X-ray active in 2010 January, continuing to be so over the next \sim 14 months.
We study the timing and spectral properties of the black hole candidate (BHC)
during its recent outburst using RXTE PCA data, starting from 2010 January 12
to 2011 March 6.
  Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the mass accretion
processes and properties of the accretion disk of the black hole candidate. The
PCA spectra of 2.5-25 keV are mainly fitted with a combination of two
components, namely, a disk black body and a power-law. The entire outburst as
observed by RXTE, is divided into 4 spectral states, namely, hard,
hard-intermediate, soft-intermediate, and soft. Quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) were found in 3 out of the 4 states, namely hard, hard-intermediate, and
soft-intermediate. The QPO frequencies increase monotonically from 0.102 Hz to
5.692 Hz in the rising phase of the outburst, while during the declining phase
QPO frequencies decrease monotonically from 6.420 to 1.149 Hz.
  The recent outburst of GX 339-4 gives us an opportunity to understand the
evolution of the two-component accretion rates starting from the onset to the
end of the outburst phase. We found that the QPO frequency variation could be
explained by the propagating oscillatory shock model (POS) and the hardness
versus intensity variation can be reproduced if we assume that higher viscosity
causes the conversion of a low angular momentum disk component into a Keplerian
component during the outburst phase. The decline phase starts because of the
reduction in the viscosity.

able to gather channel state information, perform linear processing and forward
signals whereas the dumb relays is only able to serve as amplifiers. As the
dumb relays are oblivious to the source and destination nodes, the wireless
network can be modeled as a relay network with *smart instantaneous relay*
only: the signals of source-destination arrive at the same time as
source-relay-destination. Recently, instantaneous relaying is shown to improve
the degrees-of-freedom of the network as compared to classical cut-set bound.
In this paper, we study an achievable rate region and its boundary of the
instantaneous interference relay channel in the scenario of (a) uninformed
non-cooperative source-destination nodes (source and destination nodes are not
aware of the existence of the relay and are non-cooperative) and (b) informed
and cooperative source-destination nodes. Further, we examine the performance
of interference neutralization: a relay strategy which is able to cancel
interference signals at each destination node in the air. We observe that
interference neutralization, although promise to achieve desired
degrees-of-freedom, may not be feasible if relay has limited power. Simulation
results show that the optimal relay strategies improve the achievable rate
region and provide better user-fairness in both uninformed non-cooperative and
informed cooperative scenarios.

curves that arise in the study of large N dualities between supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories and string models on local Calabi-Yau manifolds. These
spectral curves are determined by a set of complex partial 't Hooft parameters
and a system of cuts given by projections on the spectral curve of minimal
supersymmetric cycles of the underlying Calabi-Yau manifold. Using a
combination of analytical and numerical methods we give a complete description
of the one-cut phase in the cubic model, determine the analytic condition
satisfied by critical one-cut spectral curves, and give an algorithm to
calculate the two-cut spectral curves of the cubic model for generic values of
the partial 't Hooft parameters.

  about predictive regressions added",,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a simple dynamical model of stock index returns which is grounded
on the ability of the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earning (CAPE) valuation ratio
devised by Robert Shiller to predict long-horizon performances of the market.
More precisely, we discuss a discrete time dynamics in which the return growth
depends on three components: i) a momentum component, naturally justified in
terms of agents' belief that expected returns are higher in bullish markets
than in bearish ones, ii) a fundamental component proportional to the
logarithmic CAPE at time zero. The initial value of the ratio determines the
reference growth level, from which the actual stock price may deviate as an
effect of random external disturbances, and iii) a driving component which
ensures the diffusive behaviour of stock prices. Under these assumptions, we
prove that for a sufficiently large horizon the expected rate of return and the
expected gross return are linear in the initial logarithmic CAPE, and their
variance goes to zero with a rate of convergence consistent with the diffusive
behaviour. Eventually this means that the momentum component may generate
bubbles and crashes in the short and medium run, nevertheless the valuation
ratio remains a good reference point of future long-run returns.

future networks and proposes a methodology to mitigate it. The starting concept
is modeling the network as a complex environment (e.g. ecosystem) of resources
and associated functional controllers in a continuous and dynamic game of
cooperation - competition. Methodology foresees defining and associating
utility functions to these controllers and elaborating a global utility
function (as a function of the controllers' utility functions) for the overall
network. It is conjectured that the optimization of the global utility function
ensures network stability and security evaluations. Paper concludes arguing
that self-governance (with limited human intervention) is possible provided
that proper local, global control rules are coded into these utility functions
optimization processes.

analysis of the continuous interior penalty finite element method (CIP-FEM) and
the FEM for the Helmholtz equation in two and three dimensions is continued.
While part I contained results on the linear CIP-FEM and FEM, the present part
deals with approximation spaces of order $p \ge 1$. By using a modified duality
argument, pre-asymptotic error estimates are derived for both methods under the
condition of $\frac{kh}{p}\le C_0\big(\frac{p}{k}\big)^{\frac{1}{p+1}}$, where
$k$ is the wave number, $h$ is the mesh size, and $C_0$ is a constant
independent of $k, h, p$, and the penalty parameters. It is shown that the
pollution errors of both methods in $H^1$-norm are $O(k^{2p+1}h^{2p})$ if
$p=O(1)$ and are $O\Big(\frac{k}{p^2}\big(\frac{kh}{\sigma p}\big)^{2p}\Big)$
if the exact solution $u\in H^2(\Om)$ which coincide with existent dispersion
analyses for the FEM on Cartesian grids. Here $\si$ is a constant independent
of $k, h, p$, and the penalty parameters. Moreover, it is proved that the
CIP-FEM is stable for any $k, h, p>0$ and penalty parameters with positive
imaginary parts. Besides the advantage of the absolute stability of the CIP-FEM
compared to the FEM, the penalty parameters may be tuned to reduce the
pollution effects.

of their correlations within more than a dozen specific BSM models have been
performed at the TUM. One of the goals of these analyses was to investigate
which model is capable of obtaining large mixing induced CP asymmetry in the
B_s system, S_{psi phi}, and to find out what this would imply for other
flavour observables. In this context also the rare decays B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^-
have been considered. In some models their branching ratios can be enhanced by
orders of magnitude above the SM expectations. The recent data on S_{psi phi}
and B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^- from the LHCb put an end to these very optimistic hopes
modifying significantly the allowed patterns of deviations from SM predictions
for flavour observables in concrete BSM models. We make a first
semi-quantitative assessment of the most important modifications in the
predictions of the BSM models in question including also recently analyzed
models and taking into account the most recent lattice input. For some BSM
models the LHCb data turned out to be a relief. On the other hand the SM,
models with CMFV and MFV models without flavour blind phases appear to have
significant difficulties in describing all Delta F=2 observables in B_{s,d} and
K^0 meson systems simultaneously. We propose to regard the stringent CMFV
relations between various observables as standard candels of flavour physics.
The pattern of deviations from these relations may help in identifying the
correct NP scenario.

are the observation of astrophysical sources and the indirect detection of dark
matter. The latter is possible through neutrinos produced after the
annihilation of WIMPs, which would accumulate in sources like the Sun, the
Earth or the Galactic Centre. The neutralino, which arises in Supersymmetry
models, is one of the most popular WIMP candidates. KK particles, which appear
in Universal Extra Dimension models, are another one. Though in most models
these annihilations would not directly produce neutrinos, they are expected
from the decay of secondary particles. An important advantage of neutrino
telescopes with respect to other indirect searches (like gamma rays or cosmic
rays) is that a potential signal (for instance from the Sun) would be very
clean, since no other astrophysical explanations could mimic it (like pulsars
for the case of the positron excess seen by PAMELA). Moreover, the Galactic
Centre is accessible for ANTARES, being in the Northern Hemisphere. In this

`local' modifications of the Erd{\H o}s--R\'enyi random graph process has
received considerable attention during the last decade, so far only rather
simple rules are well understood. Indeed, the main focus has been on
`bounded-size' rules, where all component sizes larger than some constant $B$
are treated the same way, and for more complex rules very few rigorous results
are known.
  In this paper we study Achlioptas processes given by (unbounded) size rules
such as the sum and product rules. Using a variant of the neighbourhood
exploration process and branching process arguments we show that certain key
statistics are tightly concentrated at least until the susceptibility (the
expected size of the component containing a randomly chosen vertex) diverges.
Our convergence result is most likely best possible for certain rules: in the
later evolution the number of vertices in small components may not be
concentrated. Furthermore, we believe that for a large class of rules the
critical time where the susceptibility `blows up' coincides with the
percolation threshold.

0.3, which is the parameter regime where Landau damping is expected to be

the velocities retrieved from Doppler shifts measured at the chromosphere and
the photosphere in the AR filament area. Various inversion methods with
different numbers of atmospheric components and different weighting schemes of
the Stokes profiles were used. The velocities were calibrated on an absolute
scale. A ubiquitous chromospheric downflow is found in the faculae surrounding
the filament, with an average velocity of 1.6 km/s. The filament region,
however, displays upflows in the photosphere on both days, when the linear
polarization (which samples the transverse component of the fields) is given
more weight in the inversions. The upflow speeds of the transverse fields in
the filament region average -0.15 km/s. In the chromosphere, the situation is
different for the two days of observation. On July 3, the chromospheric portion
of the filament is moving upwards as a whole with a mean speed of -0.24 km/s.
However, on July 5 only the section above an orphan penumbra shows localized
upflow patches, while the rest of the filament is dominated by the same
downflows observed elsewhere in the facular region. Photospheric supersonic
downflows that last for tens of minutes are detected below the filament, close
to the PIL.
  The observed velocity pattern in this AR filament strongly suggests a
scenario where the transverse fields are mostly dominated by upflows. The
filament flux rope is seen to be emerging at all places and both heights, with
a few exceptions in the chromosphere. This happens within a surrounding facular
region that displays a generalized downflow in the chromosphere and localized
downflows of supersonic character at the photosphere. No large scale downflow
of transverse field lines is observed at the photosphere.

model are described. It is found that it can adequately explain the dynamics of
two dense ink drops simultaneously evolving in a container filled with water.
The experiment shows that molecular crowding results in the formation of a
dynamical barrier that prevents the mixing of the drops. This phenomenon is
successfully captured by the model. This suggests that the proposed model can
be justifiably viewed as a generalization of standard diffusion to a
multispecies setting, where crowding and steric interferences are taken into
