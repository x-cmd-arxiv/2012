we precisely investigate the effect of weak Josephson tunneling between 2D
superfluid or superconducting layers. In the clean case, the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition immediately turns into 3DXY, with phase
coherence and superflow in all spatial directions, and a strong enhancement of
the critical temperature. However, when disorder is present, rare regions
fluctuations can lead to an intermediate finite temperature phase --- the so
called sliding regime --- where only 2D superflow occurs within the layers
without any transverse superfluid coherence, while a true 3D Bose-Einstein
condensate exists. Critical properties of such an unconventional regime are
carefully investigated.

by the emerging magnetic flux from the deep convection zone. In previous
numerical simulations, we found that the horizontal divergent flow (HDF) occurs
before the flux emergence at the photospheric height. This Paper reports the
HDF detection prior to the flux emergence of NOAA AR 11081, which is located
away from the disk center. We use SDO/HMI data to study the temporal changes of
the Doppler and magnetic patterns from those of the reference quiet Sun. As a
result, the HDF appearance is found to come before the flux emergence by about
100 minutes. Also, the horizontal speed of the HDF during this time gap is
estimated to be 0.6 to 1.5 km s^-1, up to 2.3 km s^-1. The HDF is caused by the
plasma escaping horizontally from the rising magnetic flux. And the interval
between the HDF and the flux emergence may reflect the latency during which the
magnetic flux beneath the solar surface is waiting for the instability onset to
the further emergence. Moreover, SMART Halpha images show that the
chromospheric plages appear about 14 min later, located co-spatial with the
photospheric pores. This indicates that the plages are caused by plasma flowing
down along the magnetic fields that connect the pores at their footpoints. One
importance of observing the HDF may be the possibility to predict the sunspot
appearances that occur in several hours.

possibility to test directly the most conservative version of left-right
symmetric models at so far not reachable energy scales. If we take into account
precise limits on the model which come from low energy processes, like the muon
decay, possible LHC signals are strongly limited through the correlations of
parameters among heavy neutrinos, heavy gauge bosons and heavy Higgs particles.
To illustrate the situation in the context of LHC, we consider the ""golden""
process $pp \to e^+ N$. For instance, in a case of degenerate heavy neutrinos
and heavy Higgs masses at 15 TeV (in agreement with FCNC bounds) we get
$\sigma(pp \to e^+ N)>10$ fb at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV which is consistent with muon
decay data for a very limited $W_2$ masses in the range (3008 GeV, 3040 GeV).
Without restrictions coming from the muon data, $W_2$ masses would be in the
range (1.0 TeV, 3.5 TeV). Influence of heavy Higgs particles themselves on the
considered LHC process is negligible (the same is true for the light, SM
neutral Higgs scalar analog). In the paper decay modes of the right-handed
heavy gauge bosons and heavy neutrinos are also discussed. Both scenarios with
typical see-saw light-heavy neutrino mixings and the mixings which are
independent of heavy neutrino masses are considered. In the second case heavy
neutrino decays to the heavy charged gauge bosons not necessarily dominate over
decay modes which include only light, SM-like particles.

have established that large (~ 3000 km radius) planetary embryos existed in the
solar nebula at the same time that chondrules - millimeter-sized igneous
inclusions found in meteorites - were forming. We model the formation of
chondrules by passage through bow shocks around such a planetary embryo on an
eccentric orbit. We numerically model the hydrodynamics of the flow, and find
that such large bodies retain an atmosphere, with Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities allowing mixing of this atmosphere with the gas and particles
flowing past the embryo. We calculate the trajectories of chondrules flowing
past the body, and find that they are not accreted by the protoplanet, but may
instead flow through volatiles outgassed from the planet's magma ocean. In
contrast, chondrules are accreted onto smaller planetesimals. We calculate the
thermal histories of chondrules passing through the bow shock. We find that
peak temperatures and cooling rates are consistent with the formation of the
dominant, porphyritic texture of most chondrules, assuming a modest enhancement
above the likely solar nebula average value of chondrule densities (by a factor
of 10), attributable to settling of chondrule precursors to the midplane of the
disk or turbulent concentration. We calculate the rate at which a planetary
embryo's eccentricity is damped and conclude that a single planetary embryo
scattered into an eccentric orbit can, over ~ 10e5 years, produce ~ 10e24 g of
chondrules. In principle, a small number (1-10) of eccentric planetary embryos
can melt the observed mass of chondrules in a manner consistent with all known

mesons, lead to intricate relations between the \gamma \gamma -decay widths or
the \gamma* \gamma -transition form factors for (pseudo-) scalar, axial-vector
and tensor mesons. We discuss the phenomenological implications of these
results for mesons in both the light-quark sector and the charm-quark sector.

sensing algorithms, the first variable is used to solve the Least Absolute

variable participates in the regularization term of the Lasso (l1 norm) that
gradually detects the non-zero elements. The presence of the second variable
enables us to extend the corresponding vector of the first variable to matrix
form. This makes possible use of the correlation matrix for a heuristic search
in the case that there are correlations among the samples of signal. We compare

of sharp field gradients as well as in presence of well developed
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. For this reason in such conditions the magnetic
moment $\mu$ is no longer expected to be constant. This can influence particle
acceleration and have considerable implications in many astrophysical problems.
  Starting with the resonant interaction between ions and a single parallel
propagating electromagnetic wave, we derive expressions for the magnetic moment
trapping width $\Delta \mu$ (defined as the half peak-to-peak difference in the
particle magnetic moment) and the bounce frequency $\omega_b$. We perform
test-particle simulations to investigate magnetic moment behavior when
resonances overlapping occurs and during the interaction of a ring-beam
particle distribution with a broad-band slab spectrum.
  We find that magnetic moment dynamics is strictly related to pitch angle
$\alpha$ for a low level of magnetic fluctuation, $\delta B/B_0 = (10^{-3}, \,
10^{-2})$, where $B_0$ is the constant and uniform background magnetic field.
Stochasticity arises for intermediate fluctuation values and its effect on
pitch angle is the isotropization of the distribution function $f(\alpha)$.
This is a transient regime during which magnetic moment distribution $f(\mu)$
exhibits a characteristic one-sided long tail and starts to be influenced by
the onset of spatial parallel diffusion, i.e., the variance $<(\Delta z)^2 >$
grows linearly in time as in normal diffusion. With strong fluctuations
$f(\alpha)$ isotropizes completely, spatial diffusion sets in and $f(\mu)$
behavior is closely related to the sampling of the varying magnetic field
associated with that spatial diffusion.

the sensitivities of the mode periods to mass-loading. In the case of helium
studies in Vycor, one can compare the period shift signals seen for a

occurs for all topologies we tested, even when the distribution of avalanche

how careers evolve over time. Since knowledge spillovers, cumulative advantage,

profession, both the employment relationship and the procedures for assigning
recognition and allocating funding should be designed to account for these
factors. We study the annual production n_{i}(t) of a given scientist i by
analyzing longitudinal career data for 200 leading scientists and 100 assistant
professors from the physics community. We compare our results with 21,156
sports careers. Our empirical analysis of individual productivity dynamics
shows that (i) there are increasing returns for the top individuals within the
competitive cohort, and that (ii) the distribution of production growth is a
leptokurtic ""tent-shaped"" distribution that is remarkably symmetric. Our
methodology is general, and we speculate that similar features appear in other
disciplines where academic publication is essential and collaboration is a key
feature. We introduce a model of proportional growth which reproduces these two
observations, and additionally accounts for the significantly right-skewed
distributions of career longevity and achievement in science. Using this
theoretical model, we show that short-term contracts can amplify the effects of
competition and uncertainty making careers more vulnerable to early
termination, not necessarily due to lack of individual talent and persistence,
but because of random negative production shocks. We show that fluctuations in
scientific production are quantitatively related to a scientist's collaboration
radius and team efficiency.

perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations. Modification of
heavy-flavor production in heavy-ion collisions relative to binary-collision
scaling from p+p results, quantified with the nuclear-modification factor
(R_AA), provides information on both cold- and hot-nuclear-matter effects.
  Purpose: Determine transverse-momentum, pt, spectra and the corresponding
R_AA for muons from heavy-flavor mesons decay in p+p and Cu+Cu collisions at
sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and y=1.65.
  Method: Results are obtained using the semi-leptonic decay of heavy-flavor
mesons into negative muons. The PHENIX muon-arm spectrometers measure the p_T
spectra of inclusive muon candidates. Backgrounds, primarily due to light
hadrons, are determined with a Monte-Carlo calculation using a set of input
hadron distributions tuned to match measured-hadron distributions in the same
detector and statistically subtracted.
  Results: The charm-production cross section in p+p collisions at sqrt{s}=200
GeV, integrated over pt and in the rapidity range 1.4<y<1.9 is found to be
dsigma_ccbar/dy = 0.139 +/- 0.029 (stat) ^{+0.051}_{-0.058} (syst) mb. This
result is consistent with calculations and with expectations based on the
corresponding midrapidity charm-production cross section measured earlier by
PHENIX. The R_AA for heavy-flavor muons in Cu+Cu collisions is measured in
three centrality intervals for 1<pt<4 GeV/c. Suppression relative to
binary-collision scaling (R_AA<1) increases with centrality.
  Conclusions: Within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the measured
heavy-flavor yield in p+p collisions is consistent with state-of-the-art pQCD
calculations. Suppression in central Cu+Cu collisions suggests the presence of
significant cold-nuclear-matter effects and final-state energy loss.

the channel fading and the PU occupancy, by casting the problem as a partially

the scheduled channel only, achieves a performance very close to the
genie-aided system. Further, as expected, the optimal policy in the original
system significantly outperforms randomized scheduling, pointing to the merit
of exploiting the temporal correlation structure in both channel fading and PU

structures in H2D+ in the vicinity of, but distinctly offset from embedded
protostars. More surprisingly, the H2D+ peak is not associated with either a
dust continuum or N2D+ peak. We have therefore uncovered extended massive cold
dense gas that was undetected with previous molecular line and dust continuum
surveys of the region. This work also shows that our picture of the structure
of cores is too simplistic for cluster forming cores and needs to be refined:
neither dust continuum with existing capabilities, nor emission in tracers like
N2D+ can provide a complete census of the total prestellar gas in such regions.
Sensitive H2D+ mapping of the entire DR21 filament is likely to discover more

that a variable dust-emissivity index (beta) is required to fit the data. We
find no significant long-wavelength excess above this model suggesting there is
no cold dust component. We show that the gas-to-dust ratio varies radially,
increasing from ~20 in the center to ~70 in the star-forming ring at 10kpc,
consistent with the metallicity gradient. In the 10kpc ring the average beta is
~1.9, in good agreement with values determined for the Milky Way (MW). However,
in contrast to the MW, we find significant radial variations in beta, which
increases from 1.9 at 10kpc to ~2.5 at a radius of 3.1kpc and then decreases to
1.7 in the center. The dust temperature is fairly constant in the 10kpc ring
(ranging from 17-20K), but increases strongly in the bulge to ~30K. Within
3.1kpc we find the dust temperature is highly correlated with the 3.6 micron
flux, suggesting the general stellar population in the bulge is the dominant
source of dust heating there. At larger radii, there is a weak correlation
between the star formation rate and dust temperature. We find no evidence for
'dark gas' in M31 in contrast to recent results for the MW. Finally, we
obtained an estimate of the CO X-factor by minimising the dispersion in the

constrain cosmological parameters and the galaxy-dark matter connection (aka
halo occupation statistics). The latter describes how galaxies are distributed
over dark matter haloes, and is an imprint of the poorly understood physics of
galaxy formation. A generic problem of using galaxies to constrain cosmology is
that galaxies are a biased tracer of the mass distribution, and this bias is
generally unknown. The great advantage of simultaneously constraining cosmology
and halo occupation statistics is that this effectively allows cosmological
constraints marginalized over the uncertainties regarding galaxy bias. Not only
that, it also yields constraints on the galaxy-dark matter connection, this
time properly marginalized over cosmology, which is of great value to inform
theoretical models of galaxy formation. We use a combination of the analytical
halo model and the conditional luminosity function to describe the galaxy-dark
matter connection, which we use to model the abundance, clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing properties of the galaxy population. We use a Fisher
matrix analysis to gauge the complementarity of these different observables,
and present some preliminary results from an analysis based on data from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our results are complementary to and perfectly
consistent with the results from the 7 year data release of the WMAP mission,

standard methods to spectra ranging from 380 to 680 nm. The stars in this
analysis range from -2.9 < [Fe/H] < -1.3, and adopting the ages determined by
Lemasle et al. (2012), we are able to examine the chemical evolution of
Carina's old and intermediate-aged populations. One of the main results from
this work is the evidence for inhomogeneous mixing in Carina; a large
dispersion in [Mg/Fe] indicates poor mixing in the old population, an offset in
the [alpha/Fe] ratios between the old and intermediate-aged populations (when
examined with previously published results) suggests that the second star
formation event occurred in alpha-enriched gas, and one star, Car-612, seems to
have formed in a pocket enhanced in SN Ia/II products. This latter star
provides the first direct link between the formation of stars with enhanced SN
Ia/II ratios in dwarf galaxies to those found in the outer Galactic halo (Ivans
et al. 2003). Another important result is the potential evidence for SN II
driven winds. We show that the very metal-poor stars in Carina have not been
enhanced in AGB or SN Ia products, and therefore their very low ratios of
[Sr/Ba] suggests the loss of contributions from the early SNe II. Low ratios of
[Na/Fe], [Mn/Fe], and [Cr/Fe] in two of these stars support this scenario, with
additional evidence from the low [Zn/Fe] upper limit for one star. It is
interesting that the chemistry of the metal-poor stars in Carina is not similar
to those in the Galaxy, most of the other dSphs, or the UFDs, and suggests that
Carina may be at the critical mass where some chemical enrichment events are
lost through SN II driven winds.

Nine new detections of OHMs are reported, all at redshifts z<0.25. For the
remainder of the galaxies, observations constrain the upper limit on OH
emission; this rules out OHMs of moderate brightness (L_OH > 10^3 L_sun) for
26% of the sample, and extremely bright OHM emission (L_OH > 10^4 L_sun) for
73% of the sample. Losses from RFI result in the OHM detection fraction being
significantly lower than expected for galaxies with L_IR >10^12 L_sun. The new
OHM detections are used to calculate an updated OH luminosity function, with
\Phi[L]\simL_OH^{-0.66}; this slope is in agreement with previous results.
Non-detections of OHMs in the COSMOS field constrain the predicted sky density
of OHMs; the results are consistent with a galaxy merger rate evolving as

We then construct the corresponding Sturm's chain algorithm to calculate the

the numerical scheme. This work can further be generalized to analytically
calculate the maximal number of equilibrium points certain autonomous dynamical
system can have in general. We also demonstrate how the transition from a

realized through the saddle-centre bifurcation phenomena using certain

of blazars is a long-standing question, and one that is difficult to answer
confidently because of various observational biases which may either dilute or
apparently enhance any intrinsic correlation between radio and gamma-ray
luminosities. We introduce a novel method of data randomization to evaluate
quantitatively the effect of these biases and to assess the intrinsic
significance of an apparent correlation between radio and gamma-ray flux
densities of blazars. The novelty of the method lies in a combination of data
randomization in luminosity space (to ensure that the randomized data are
intrinsically, and not just apparently, uncorrelated) and significance
assessment in flux space (to explicitly avoid Malmquist bias and automatically
account for the limited dynamical range in both frequencies). The method is
applicable even to small samples that are not selected with strict statistical
criteria. For larger samples we describe a variation of the method in which the
sample is split in redshift bins, and the randomization is applied in each bin
individually; this variation is designed to yield the equivalent to
luminosity-function sampling of the underlying population in the limit of very
large, statistically complete samples. We show that for a smaller number of
redshift bins, the method yields a worse significance, and in this way it is
conservative in that it does not assign a stronger, artificially enhanced
significance. We demonstrate how our test performs as a function of number of
sources, strength of correlation, and number of redshift bins used, and we show
that while our test is robust against common-distance biases and associated
false positives for uncorrelated data, it retains the power of other methods in
rejecting the null hypothesis of no correlation for correlated data.

thermodynamic equilibrium. Indeed, while AGN feedback regulates the growth of
massive galaxies, its origins can be understood as the spontaneous
thermodynamic process which ensures that the (Gibbs) free energy of the system
always decreases, enabling the galaxy to reach a more energetically favourable
state. In particular, it is shown that feedback heating processes will be
favoured whenever the hot atmosphere of a galaxy would effectively gain energy
as a result of cooling. For example, as the hot atmosphere of a galaxy cools
and contracts, the work done by gravity will be thermalised, with a fraction of
the gas also being captured by stars and the supermassive black hole at the
centre of the galaxy. If this gain of energy exceeds the loss of energy that
occurs when cooling gas drops out of the atmosphere, the Gibbs free energy of
the system would increase overall. Since this is energetically unfavourable,
feedback heating is initiated which acts to reduce the net cooling rate of the
atmosphere, thereby preventing any build-up of energy. The Gibbs free energy
can also decrease in the absence of feedback heating, but only if the loss of
energy due to mass dropping out of the atmosphere exceeds the gains of energy
described above. Therefore, to ensure that the Gibbs free energy always
decreases, a galaxy will necessarily flip between these two states,
experiencing episodes of heating and cooling. Due to the close long-term
balance between heating and cooling, the gas in a galaxy will evolve
quasi-statically towards thermodynamic equilibrium, which has the observable
appearance of galaxy growth being regulated by AGN feedback. The same mechanism
also provides an explanation for why strong AGN feedback occurs more frequently
in cool-core galaxy clusters than in non cool-core clusters.

massive close-in planet (a `hot Jupiter') and its host star, events with an
estimated Galactic rate of ~0.1-1/yr. Depending on the ratio of the mean
density of the planet rho_p to that of the star rho_star, a merger results in
three possible outcomes. If rho_p/rho_star > 5, then the planet directly
plunges below the stellar atmosphere before being disrupted by tidal forces.
Dissipation of orbital energy creates a hot wake behind the planet, producing a
EUV/soft X-ray transient as the planet sinks below the stellar surface. The
peak luminosity L_X ~ 1e36 erg/s is achieved weeks-months prior to merger,
after which the stellar surface is enshrouded by an outflow. The final inspiral
is accompanied by an optical transient powered by the recombination of hydrogen
in the outflow, which peaks at L~1e37-38 erg/s on a timescale ~days. If instead
rho_planet/rho_star < 5, then Roche Lobe overflow occurs above the stellar
surface. For rho_p/rho_star < 1, mass transfer is stable, resulting the planet
being accreted on a relatively slow timescale. However, for 1 < rho_p/rho_star
< 5, mass transfer may instead be unstable, resulting in the planet being
dynamically disrupted into an accretion disk around the star. Super-Eddington
outflows from the disk power an optical transient with L~1e37-38 erg/s and
characteristic duration ~week-months. The disk itself becomes visible once the
accretion rate become sub-Eddington, resulting in a bolometric brightening and
spectral shift to the UV. Optical transients from planet merger events may
resemble classical novae, but are distinguished by lower ejecta mass and
velocity ~100s km/s, and by hard pre- and post-cursor emission, respectively.
Promising search strategies include combined optical, UV, and X-ray surveys of
nearby massive galaxies with cadences from days to months.

and magnetic fields to launch and collimate supersonic flows from a central
source. Near the source, magnetic field strengths must be large enough to
collimate the jet requiring that the Poynting flux exceeds the kinetic-energy
flux. The extent to which the Poynting flux dominates kinetic energy flux at
large distances from the engine distinguishes two classes of models. In
magneto-centrifugal launch (MCL) models, magnetic fields dominate only at
scales $\lesssim 100$ engine radii, after which the jets become
hydrodynamically dominated (HD). By contrast, in Poynting flux dominated (PFD)
magnetic tower models, the field dominates even out to much larger scales. To
compare the large distance propagation differences of these two paradigms, we
perform 3-D ideal MHD AMR simulations of both HD and PFD stellar jets formed
via the same energy flux. We also compare how thermal energy losses and
rotation of the jet base affects the stability in these jets. For the
conditions described, we show that PFD and HD exhibit observationally
distinguishable features: PFD jets are lighter, slower, and less stable than HD
jets. Unlike HD jets, PFD jets develop current-driven instabilities that are
exacerbated as cooling and rotation increase, resulting in jets that are
clumpier than those in the HD limit. Our PFD jet simulations also resemble the
magnetic towers that have been recently created in laboratory astrophysical jet
experiments.

effects of defining the subhalo mass at the time of accretion (m_acc) vs. at
the time of observation (m_obs). We test the standard assumption that centrals
and satellites follow the same MRs, showing that this assumption leads to
predictions in disagreement with observations, specially for m_obs. Instead,
when the satellite-subhalo MRs are constrained following our AMT, they are
always different from the central-halo MR: the smaller the stellar mass (Ms),
the less massive is the subhalo of satellites as compared to the halo of
centrals of the same Ms. On average, for Ms<2x10^11Msol, the dark mass of
satellites decreased by 60-65% with respect to their masses at accretion time.
The resulting MRs for both definitions of subhalo mass yield satellite CMFs in
agreement with observations. Also, when these MRs are used in a HOD model, the
predicted correlation functions agree with observations. We show that the use
of m_obs leads to less uncertain MRs than m_acc, and discuss implications of
the obtained satellite-subhalo MR. For example, we show that the tension

for a maximally symmetric spacetime, the alpha'-corrected 4D scalar potential
has no effect on the cosmological constant. The only relevant terms are instead
higher order products of 4D Riemann tensors, which, however, are found to
vanish in the usual perturbative regime of the alpha'-expansion. The heterotic

time-to-depth conversion, (ii) optimizing ion beam current density profiles,
the shapes of sputtered craters, and multiple ion beam superposition and (iii)
quantitative characterization of surfaces processed with ions. In particular,
for sputter depth profiling experiments of 25Mg, 44Ca and 53Cr ion implants in

requirements of reduced cost, low power consumption, high pressure withstanding

signals for emission and the capacity of acquiring and processing received
signals. Secondly, a compact acoustic transmitter array has been developed for
the calibration of acoustic neutrino detection systems. The array is able to
mimic the signature of ultra-high-energy neutrino interaction in emission

been used to achieve the proposed aim. The developed compact array has

ratio spectra. UBV and (RI)c data for 46 and 76 of these stars, respectively,
are published for the first time. Combining our data with those from the
literature, colors in the UBV(RI)c system, with ~0.01 mag precision, are now
available for 112 solar analogs. Multiple linear regression is used to derive
the solar colors from these photometric data and the spectroscopically derived
Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] values. To minimize the impact of systematic errors in
the model-dependent atmospheric parameters, we use only the data for the ten
stars that most closely resemble our Sun, i.e., the solar twins, and derive the
following solar colors: (B-V)=0.653+/-0.005, (U-B)=0.166+/-0.022,
(V-R)=0.352+/-0.007, and (V-I)=0.702+/-0.010. These colors are consistent,
within the 1 sigma errors, with those derived using the entire sample of 112
solar analogs. We also derive the solar colors using the relation between
spectral line-depth ratios and observed stellar colors, i.e., with a completely
model-independent approach, and without restricting the analysis to solar
twins. We find: (B-V)=0.653+/-0.003, (U-B)=0.158+/-0.009, (V-R)=0.356+/-0.003,

  category settings","Nicer and more extensive introduction, improved structure and
  exposition, a number of typos corrected",,,,"math.LO math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a continuous action of a countable discrete group $G$ on a Polish space
$X$, a countable Borel partition $P$ of $X$ is called a generator if $G \cdot P
:= \{ gC : g \in G, C \in P \}$ generates the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of $X$.
For $G = Z$, the Kolmogorov--Sinai theorem gives a measure-theoretic
obstruction to the existence of finite generators: they do not exist in the
presence of an invariant probability measure with infinite entropy. It was
asked by Benjamin Weiss in the late 80s whether the nonexistence of any
invariant probability measure guarantees the existence of a finite generator.
We show that the answer is positive (in fact, there is a 32-generator) for an
arbitrary countable group $G$ and $\sigma$-compact $X$ (in particular, for
locally compact $X$). We also show that any continuous aperiodic action of $G$
on an arbitrary Polish space admits a 4-generator on a comeager set, thus
giving a positive answer to a question of Alexander Kechris asked in the
mid-90s.
  Furthermore, assuming a positive answer to Weiss's question for arbitrary
Polish spaces and $G = Z$, we prove the following dichotomy: every aperiodic
Borel action of $Z$ on a Polish space $X$ admits either an invariant
probability measure of infinite entropy or a finite generator. As an auxiliary
lemma, we prove the following statement, which may be of independent interest:
every aperiodic Borel action of a countable group $G$ on a Polish space $X$
admits a $G$-equivariant Borel map to the aperiodic part of the shift action of
$G$ on $2^G$.
  We also obtain a number of other related results, among which is a criterion
for the nonexistence of non-meager weakly wandering sets for continuous actions
of $Z$. A consequence of this is a negative answer to a question asked by
Eigen--Hajian--Nadkarni, which was also independently answered by Benjamin
Miller.

some cases, as signal parameters vary, eigenvalues collide and change their

of continuous phenotypes. It is based on invasion fitness functions, which
determine selection gradients and the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics.
Even though the derivation of the adaptive dynamics from a given invasion
fitness function is general and model-independent, the derivation of the
invasion fitness function itself requires specification of an underlying
ecological model. Therefore, evolutionary insights gained from adaptive
dynamics models are generally model-dependent. Logistic models for symmetric,
frequency-dependent competition are widely used in this context. Such models
have the property that the selection gradients derived from them are gradients
of scalar functions, which reflects a certain gradient property of the
corresponding invasion fitness function. We show that any adaptive dynamics
model that is based on an invasion fitness functions with this gradient
property can be transformed into a generalized symmetric competition model.
This provides a precise delineation of the generality of results derived from
competition models. Roughly speaking, to understand the adaptive dynamics of
the class of models satisfying a certain gradient condition, one only needs a
complete understanding of the adaptive dynamics of symmetric,
frequency-dependent competition. We show how this result can be applied to
number of basic issues in evolutionary theory.

examined. First, the Cartesian code VORPAL using a perfect-dispersion
electromagnetic solver precisely describes the laser pulse and bubble dynamics,
taking advantage of coarser resolution in the propagation direction, with a
proportionally larger time step. Using third-order splines for macroparticles
helps suppress the sampling noise while keeping the usage of computational
resources modest. The second way to reduce the simulation load is using
reduced-geometry codes. In our case, the quasi-cylindrical code CALDER-CIRC
uses decomposition of fields and currents into a set of poloidal modes, while
the macroparticles move in the Cartesian 3D space. Cylindrical symmetry of the
interaction allows using just two modes, reducing the computational load to
roughly that of a planar Cartesian simulation while preserving the 3D nature of
the interaction. This significant economy of resources allows using fine
resolution in the direction of propagation and a small time step, making
numerical dispersion vanishingly small, together with a large number of
particles per cell, enabling good particle statistics. Quantitative agreement
of the two simulations indicates that they are free of numerical artefacts.
Both approaches thus retrieve physically correct evolution of the plasma
bubble, recovering the intrinsic connection of electron self-injection to the
nonlinear optical evolution of the driver.

shown that the Friedmann equations can be expressed in the form of first law of
thermodynamics $T_hdS'_h+T_hd_{\jmath}S'=-dE'+W'dV$, where $d_{\jmath}S'$ is
the entropy production term. Finally, we conclude that the second law of
thermodynamics holds both in phantom and non-phantom phases.

  and hypergrids","Cleaner proof and much better presentation",,,,"cs.DM cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of monotonicity testing over the hypergrid and its special case,
the hypercube, is a classic, well-studied, yet unsolved question in property
testing. We are given query access to $f:[k]^n \mapsto \R$ (for some ordered
range $\R$). The hypergrid/cube has a natural partial order given by
coordinate-wise ordering, denoted by $\prec$. A function is \emph{monotone} if
for all pairs $x \prec y$, $f(x) \leq f(y)$. The distance to monotonicity,
$\eps_f$, is the minimum fraction of values of $f$ that need to be changed to
make $f$ monotone.
  For $k=2$ (the boolean hypercube), the usual tester is the \emph{edge
tester}, which checks monotonicity on adjacent pairs of domain points. It is
known that the edge tester using $O(\eps^{-1}n\log|\R|)$ samples can
distinguish a monotone function from one where $\eps_f > \eps$. On the other
hand, the best lower bound for monotonicity testing over the hypercube is
$\min(|\R|^2,n)$. This leaves a quadratic gap in our knowledge, since $|\R|$
can be $2^n$. We resolve this long standing open problem and prove that
$O(n/\eps)$ samples suffice for the edge tester. For hypergrids, known testers
require $O(\eps^{-1}n\log k\log |\R|)$ samples, while the best known
(non-adaptive) lower bound is $\Omega(\eps^{-1} n\log k)$. We give a
(non-adaptive) monotonicity tester for hypergrids running in $O(\eps^{-1} n\log
k)$ time.
  Our techniques lead to optimal property testers (with the same running time)
for the natural \emph{Lipschitz property} on hypercubes and hypergrids. (A
$c$-Lipschitz function is one where $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq c\|x-y\|_1$.) In fact,
we give a general unified proof for $O(\eps^{-1}n\log k)$-query testers for a
class of ""bounded-derivative"" properties, a class containing both monotonicity
and Lipschitz.

scattering and a sharp peak at 0.6 meV. With increasing temperature, a broad
peak comes up around 2.1 meV, whereas quasielastic response gets broader and
the peak at 0.6 meV becomes unclear. By applying magnetic field, the
quasielastic response exhibits significant broadening above 1 T, and the peak

(GRBs) with IceCube observations has reached the level that could put useful
constraints on the fireball properties. We first present a revised analytic
calculation of the neutrino flux, which predicts a flux an order of magnitude
lower than that obtained by the IceCube collaboration. For benchmark model
parameters (e.g. the bulk Lorentz factor is \Gamma=10^{2.5}, the observed
variability time for long GRBs is t_v=0.01 s and the ratio between the energy
in accelerated protons and in radiation is \eta_p=10 for every burst) in the
standard internal shock scenario, the predicted neutrino flux from 215 bursts
during the period of the 40-string and 59-string configurations is found to be
a factor of ~3 below the IceCube sensitivity. However, if we accept the
recently found inherent relation between the bulk Lorentz factor and burst
energy, the expected neutrino flux increases significantly and the spectral
peak shifts to lower energy. In this case, the non-detection then implies that
the baryon loading ratio should be \eta_p<10 if the variability time of long
GRBs is fixed to t_v=0.01 s. Instead, if we relax the standard internal shock
scenario but keep to assume \eta_p=10, the non-detection constrains the
dissipation radius to be R>4x10^{12} cm assuming the same dissipation radius
for every burst and benchmark parameters for fireballs. We also calculate the
diffuse neutrino flux from GRBs for different luminosity functions existing in
the literature. The expected flux exceeds the current IceCube limit for some
luminosity functions, and thus the non-detection constrains \eta_p<10 in such
cases when the variability time of long GRBs is fixed to t_v=0.01 s.

distribution of the observed redshift respect to the background value,
obtaining that its dispersion around the central value is proportional the
square root of the comoving distance. This implies that data analysis should
include a contribution to the total error budget which depends on the distance
of the source. Assuming large scale inhomogeneities with a power spectrum given
by primordial curvature perturbations the effect is expected to be small at low
red-shift, and to become important only at very high redshift. We then consider
what are the general implications for the estimation of background cosmological
parameters, giving some example for the case of quantities related to the
luminosity distance such as the Hubble parameter and the cosmological constant.
  The model correctly reproduces the expected stochastic properties of the

tight-binding approach. We consider non-interacting particles moving on a
hexagonal lattice with an additional one-dimensional superlattice made up of
periodic square potential barriers, which are oriented along the zig-zag or
along the arm-chair directions of graphene. In the presence of a perpendicular
magnetic field, such systems can be described by a set of one-dimensional
tight-binding equations, the Harper equations. The qualitative behavior of the
energy spectrum with respect to the strength of the superlattice potential
depends on the relation between the superlattice period and the magnetic
length. When the potential barriers are oriented along the arm-chair direction
of graphene, we find for strong magnetic fields that the zeroth Landau level of
graphene splits into two well separated sublevels, if the width of the barriers
is smaller than the magnetic length. In this situation, which persists even in
the presence of disorder, a plateau with zero Hall conductivity can be observed
around the Dirac point. This Landau level splitting is a true lattice effect
that cannot be obtained from the generally used continuum Dirac-fermion model.

an electrons gas in free space close to the absolute zero of temperature.

description of the corresponding phase transition is often controversial, and
remains an open field of research for fundamental physics. Here, we photoinduce
the melting of the charge ordering in a complex three-dimensional solid and
monitor the consequent charge redistribution by probing the optical response
over a broad spectral range with ultrashort laser pulses. Although the
photoinduced electronic temperature far exceeds the critical value, the
charge-density wave is preserved until the lattice is sufficiently distorted to
induce the phase transition. Combining this result with it ab initio}

for the possible origin of an effective four dimensional cosmological constant

and the modulus field that can either be a constant or dependent on extra
dimensional co-ordinate $y$ or a time dependent quantity. In case of constant
or $y$ dependent modulus field, the induced $\Omega_{vis}$ leads to an
exponentially expanding Universe. For such modulus fields the presence of
vacuum energy densities on either of the 3-branes as well as a non-vanishing
bulk curvature $l$ ($l \sim {\Lambda_5}^{-1}$) are essential to generate an
effective $\Omega_{vis}$. In particular for constant modulus field the Hubble
constant turns out to be equal to the visible brane cosmological constant which
agrees with the present result. In an alternative scenario, a time dependent
modulus field is found to be capable of accelerating the Universe. The Hubble

(PAH) molecules anthracene, phenanthrene, and pyrene carrying either an ethynyl
(-C2H) or a butadiynyl (-C4H) group. Measurements were carried out in the mid
infrared at room temperature on grains embedded in CsI pellets and in the near
ultraviolet at cryogenic temperature on molecules isolated in Ne matrices. The
infrared measurements show that interstellar populations of
polyynyl-substituted PAHs would give rise to collective features in the same
way non-substituted PAHs give rise to the aromatic infrared bands. The main
features characteristic of the substituted molecules correspond to the
acetylenic CH stretching mode near 3.05 mum and to the almost isoenergetic
acetylenic CCH in- and out-of-plane bending modes near 15.9 mum.
Sub-populations defined by the length of the polyynyl side group cause
collective features which correspond to the various acetylenic CC stretching
modes. The ultraviolet spectra reveal that the addition of an ethynyl group to
a non-substituted PAH molecule results in all its electronic transitions being
redshifted. Due to fast internal energy conversion, the bands at shorter
wavelengths are significantly broadened. Those at longer wavelengths are only
barely affected in this respect. As a consequence, their relative peak
absorption increases. The substitution with the longer butadiynyl chain causes
the same effects with a larger magnitude, resulting in the spectra to show a
prominent if not dominating pi-pi* transition at long wavelength. After
discussing the relevance of polyynyl-substituted PAHs to astrophysics, we
conclude that this class of highly conjugated, unsaturated molecules are valid
candidates for the carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands.

both the orbital migration of the satellites and the heating of their
interiors. Therefore constraining the tidal dissipation of Saturn (here the
ratio k2/Q) opens the door to the past evolution of the whole system. If
Saturn's tidal ratio can be determined at different frequencies, it may also be
possible to constrain the giant planet's interior structure, which is still
uncertain. Here, we try to determine Saturn's tidal ratio through its current
effect on the orbits of the main moons, using astrometric data spanning more
than a century. We find an intense tidal dissipation (k2/Q= (2.3 \pm 0.7)
\times 10-4), which is about ten times higher than the usual value estimated
from theoretical arguments. As a consequence, eccentricity equilibrium for
Enceladus can now account for the huge heat emitted from Enceladus' south pole.
Moreover, the measured k2/Q is found to be poorly sensitive to the tidal
frequency, on the short frequency interval considered. This suggests that
Saturn's dissipation may not be controlled by turbulent friction in the fluid
envelope as commonly believed. If correct, the large tidal expansion of the
moon orbits due to this strong Saturnian dissipation would be inconsistent with
the moon formations 4.5 Byr ago above the synchronous orbit in the Saturnian
subnebulae. But it would be compatible with a new model of satellite formation
in which the Saturnian satellites formed possibly over longer time scale at the
outer edge of the main rings. In an attempt to take into account for possible
significant torques exerted by the rings on Mimas, we fitted a constant rate
da/dt on Mimas semi-major axis, also. We obtained an unexpected large
acceleration related to a negative value of da/dt= -(15.7 \pm 4.4) \times 10-15

qubit, can be fully controlled using one ultrafast step. We show that the spin
state of an optically excited electron, an exciton, confined in a quantum dot,
can be rotated by any desired angle, about any desired axis, during such a
step. For this we use a single, resonantly tuned, picosecond long, polarized
optical pulse. The polarization of the pulse defines the rotation axis, while
the pulse detuning from a non-degenerate absorption resonance, defines the
magnitude of the rotation angle. We thereby achieve a high fidelity, universal
gate operation, applicable to other spin systems, using only one short optical
pulse. The operation duration equals the pulse temporal width, orders of
magnitude shorter than the qubit evolution life and coherence times.

Dressler-Shectman test, and the peculiar velocity of cluster main galaxies as
signatures of multimodality of clusters. We calculate the luminosity density
field to study the environmental densities around clusters, and to find
superclusters where clusters reside. We determine the morphology of
superclusters with the Minkowski functionals and compare the properties of
clusters in superclusters of different morphology. We apply principal component
analysis to study the relations between the multimodality parametres of
clusters and their environment simultaneously. We find that multimodal clusters
reside in higher density environment than unimodal clusters. Clusters in
superclusters have higher probability to have substructure than isolated
clusters. The superclusters can be divided into two main morphological types,
spiders and filaments. Clusters in superclusters of spider morphology have
higher probabilities to have substructure and larger peculiar velocities of
their main galaxies than clusters in superclusters of filament morphology. The
most luminous clusters are located in the high-density cores of rich
superclusters. Five of seven most luminous clusters, and five of seven most
multimodal clusters reside in spider-type superclusters; four of seven most
unimodal clusters reside in filament-type superclusters. Our study shows the

theory in the Bethe ansatz local-density approximation to the Hubbard model

regular current oscillations. This is a manifestation of a recently proposed
dynamical picture of Coulomb blockade. Furthermore, we investigate how the
various approximations to the electron-electron interaction affect the
line-shapes of the Coulomb peaks and the I-V characteristics. We show that the
presence of the derivative discontinuity in the approximate
exchange-correlation potential leads to significantly different results
compared to those obtained at the simpler Hartree level of description. In
particular, a negative differential conductance (NDC) in the I-V

interaction strengths. We demonstrate that such NDC originates from the
combined effect of electron-electron interaction in the dot and the finite
bandwidth of the electrodes.

explain this rebrightening with two different scenarios - refreshed shocks or a
density clump in the circumburst medium - and two models for the origin of the
afterglow, the standard one where it comes from the forward shock, and an
alternative one where it results from a long-lived reverse shock. We computed
afterglow light curves either using a single-zone approximation for the shocked
region or a detailed multizone method that more accurately accounts for the
compression of the material. We find that in several of the considered cases
the detailed model must be used to obtain a reliable description of the shock
dynamics. The density clump scenario is not favored. We confirm previous
results that the presence of the clump has little effect on the forward shock
emission, except if the microphysics parameters evolve when the shock enters
the clump. Moreover, we find that the rebrightening from the reverse shock is
also too weak when it is calculated with the multi-zone method. On the other
hand, in the refreshed-shock scenario both the forward and reverse shock models
provide satisfactory fits of the data under some additional conditions on the
distribution of the Lorentz factor in the ejecta and the beaming angle of the

broad lines.
  The Suzaku XIS and HXD/PIN spectra of the source were analysed in detail. The
line complex is composed of at least two unresolved lines, one at about 6.45
keV and the other one at about 7 keV, most likely identified with Fe XVII/XIX,
the former, and Fe XXVI, the latter. The high-ionization line can originate
either in a photoionized matter or in an optically thin thermal plasma. In the
latter case, an unusually high temperature is implied. In the photoionized
model case, the large equivalent width can be explained either by an extreme
iron overabundance or by assuming that the source is Compton-thick. In the
Compton-thick hypothesis, however, the emission above 2 keV is mostly due to a
highly ionized reflector, contrary to what is usually found in Compton-thick
Seyfert 2s, where reflection from low ionized matter dominates. Moreover, the
source flux varied between the XMM-Newton and the Suzaku observations, taken
3.5 years apart, confirming previous findings and indicating that the size of
the emitting region must be smaller than a parsec.
  The hard X-ray spectrum is also inconclusive on the Compton-thick hypothesis.
Weighting the various arguments, a ""true"" Seyfert 2 nature of NGC 3147 seems to
be still the most likely explanation, even if the ""highly ionized reflector""
Compton-thick hypothesis cannot at present be formally rejected.

potential, which implies the existence of two possible condensate phases. Using
the variational method, we discuss the quantum phase transition of the mixed
gas and obtain the critical coupling line analytically. Moreover, we also find
that the phase transition of the photon gas can be interpreted as second
harmonic generation. We then discuss the entanglement between photons and
photon pairs. Additionally, we also illustrate how the entanglement between
photons and photon pairs can be associated with the phase transition of the
system.

After performing a selection of events with one isolated lepton, at least four

reconstruct the top-antitop event topology. The charge asymmetry was determined
using the differential distribution of the difference of absolute reconstructed
rapidities of the top and antitop quark. An unfolding procedure was applied to
correct for detector acceptance and resolution effects and to obtain the
corresponding distribution at parton level. The total charge asymmetry after
unfolding was measured to be A_C = -0.018 +/- 0.028 (stat.) +/- 0.023 (syst.)
in agreement with the Standard Model prediction. In addition, a simultaneous
unfolding in the difference of absolute reconstructed rapidities of the top and

star (CTTS) binary in which both components are actively accreting. V4046 Sgr
is a strong X-ray source, with the X-rays mainly arising from high-density (n_e
~ 10^(11-12) cm^(-3)) plasma at temperatures of 3-4 MK. Our multiwavelength
campaign aims to simultaneously constrain the properties of this X-ray emitting
plasma, the large scale magnetic field, and the accretion geometry. In this
paper, we present key results obtained via time-resolved X-ray grating spectra,
gathered in a 360 ks XMM-Newton observation that covered 2.2 system rotations.
We find that the emission lines produced by this high-density plasma display
periodic flux variations with a measured period, 1.22+/-0.01 d, that is
precisely half that of the binary star system (2.42 d). The observed rotational
modulation can be explained assuming that the high-density plasma occupies
small portions of the stellar surfaces, corotating with the stars, and that the
high-density plasma is not azimuthally symmetrically distributed with respect
to the rotational axis of each star. These results strongly support models in
which high-density, X-ray-emitting CTTS plasma is material heated in accretion
shocks, located at the base of accretion flows tied to the system by magnetic
field lines.

envelope, producing a small ""neutrino halo"" with a much broader angle
distribution than the primary flux originating directly from the core. Cherry
et al. (2012) have recently pointed out that, during the accretion phase, the
halo actually dominates neutrino-neutrino refraction at distances exceeding
some 100 km. However, the multiangle matter effect (which increases if the
angle distribution is broader) still appears to suppress self-induced flavor
conversion during the accretion phase.

the so called continuous dual q-Hahn (c2h) polynomials. Moreover we are able to
relate in this way some other 'ordinary ' orthogonal polynomials such as e.g.
Hermite, Chebyshev or Laguerre. These equalities give new interpretation of the
polynomials involved and moreover can give rise to a simple method of
generating more and more general (i.e. involving more and more parameters)
families of orthogonal polynomials. We pose some conjectures concerning
Askey--Wilson polynomials and their possible generalizations. We prove that
these conjectures are true for the cases q = 1 (classical case) and q = 0 (free
case) thus paving the way to generalization of AW polynomials at least in these
two cases.

compact dimensions are warped, using the Klebanov-Strassler solution as a
prototypical throat geometry. We find that there is no dynamical mechanism
which localises the string at the tip of the throat, but rather that the motion
seems to explore both internal and external degrees of freedom democratically.
This indicates that cosmic (super)strings formed by inflationary
brane-antibrane annihilation will have sufficient internal motion for the
gravitational wave signals from the string network to be suppressed relative to
the signal from a `standard' cosmic string network.

found by radial velocity surveys. These planets are gas giants and the systems
are only stable when protected by a resonance. Additionally the Kepler mission
has detected at least 4 strong candidate planetary systems with a period ratio
close to 4:3.
  This paper investigates traditional dynamical scenarios for the formation of
these systems. We systematically study migration scenarios with both N-body and
hydro-dynamic simulations. We investigate scenarios involving the in-situ
formation of two planets in resonance. We look at the results from finely tuned
planet-planet scattering simulations with gas disk damping. Finally, we
investigate a formation scenario involving isolation-mass embryos.
  Although the combined planet-planet scattering and damping scenario seems
promising, none of the above scenarios is successful in forming enough systems
in 4:3 resonance with planetary masses similar to the observed ones. This is a
negative result but it has important implications for planet formation.
Previous studies were successful in forming 2:1 and 3:2 resonances. This is
generally believed to be evidence of planet migration. We highlight the main
differences between those studies and our failure in forming a 4:3 resonance.
We also speculate on more exotic and complicated ideas. These results will
guide future investigators toward exploring the above scenarios and alternative
mechanisms in a more general framework.

wavelengths closely depends on a low vertical content of water vapor as well as
on high atmospheric emission stability. Although Concordia station at Dome C
(Antarctica) enjoys good observing conditions in this atmospheric spectral
windows, as shown by preliminary site-testing campaigns at different bands and
in, not always, time overlapped periods, a dedicated instrument able to
continuously determine atmospheric performance for a wide spectral range is not
yet planned. In the absence of such measurements, in this paper we suggest a
semi-empirical approach to perform an analysis of atmospheric transmission and
emission at Dome C to compare the performance for 7 photometric bands ranging
from 100 GHz to 2 THz. Radiosoundings data provided by the Routine
Meteorological Observations (RMO) Research Project at Concordia station are
corrected by temperature and humidity errors and dry biases and then employed
to feed ATM (Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves) code to generate synthetic
spectra in the wide spectral range from 100 GHz to 2 THz. To quantify the
atmospheric contribution in millimeter and sub-millimeter observations we are
considering several photometric bands in which atmospheric quantities are
integrated. The observational capabilities of this site at all the selected
spectral bands are analyzed considering monthly averaged transmissions joined
to the corresponding fluctuations. Transmission and pwv statistics at Dome C
derived by our semi-empirical approach are consistent with previous works. It
is evident the decreasing of the performance at high frequencies. We propose to
introduce a new parameter to compare the quality of a site at different
spectral bands, in terms of high transmission and emission stability, the Site
Photometric Quality Factor.

primordial satellites, which have an array of distinguishing characteristics,

system's protostellar nebula, as well as the location of its snow line, can be
constrained by knowing which of its planets possess primordial satellites and
which do not. Second, all satellites around terrestrial planets form by
impacts. If true, this greatly enhances the constraints that can be placed on
the history of terrestrial planets by their satellites' compositions, sizes,
and dynamics.
