computed. For two neurons coupled by a gap junction we have analyzed the roles
of the membrane and synapse in the contribution of the energy that is required

identical and nonidentical neurons coupled by unidirectional and bidirectional
gap junctions. One relevant result is that there are values of the coupling

ratio of mutual information to energy consumption is relatively high.
Therefore, communicating at these coupling values could be energetically the

to study the low-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). We compare these

Na I {\lambda}8190 features for lower-mass (\sim {\sigma}\ast) early-type

mismatching NaD EWs. The TiO2 {\lambda}6230 and the Na I {\lambda}8190 features
together appear to be a powerful IMF diagnostic, with age and metallicity
effects orthogonal to the effect of IMF. We find that both features correlate
strongly with galaxy velocity dispersion. The XLENS ETG (SDSSJ0912+0029) and an
SDSS ETG (SDSSJ0041-0914) appear to require both an extreme dwarf-rich IMF and
a high sodium enhancement ([Na/Fe] = +0.4). In addition, lensing constraints on
the total mass of the XLENS system within its Einstein radius limit a
bottom-heavy IMF with a power-law slope to x \leq 3.0 at the 90% C.L. We
conclude that NaI and TiO features, in comparison with state-of-the-art SSP

MJW Hall showed that the statistics of singlet state can be generated by
sacrificing measurement independence where underlying distribution of hidden

diffusion and adsorption in porous materials is proposed. The model considers
the coupled dynamics of the diffusive phase, described by a diffusion type
equation, and the adsorbed phase governed by a generalized Langmuir equation.
It is shown that the combination of diffusion and adsorption can be treated as
diffusion in an effective medium, with an effective diffusion coefficient
depending on the characteristics of the adsorption kinetics. The interplay
between these effects leads to the appearance of different regimes in which the
effective diffusion coefficient exhibits peculiar behaviours such as a decrease
due to the presence of the adsorption process and a non-monotonous behavior
resulting from particle interactions. We outline applications of the model
developed to diffusion in porous materials such as zeolites and bentonites, and
to engineered highly porous materials.

observationally derived surface magnetic field maps, we simulate the magnetic
stellar wind of Tau Boo by means of three-dimensional MHD numerical
simulations. As the properties of the stellar wind depend on the particular
characteristics of the stellar magnetic field, we show that the wind varies
during the observed epochs of the cycle. Although the mass loss-rates we find
(~2.7e-12 Msun/yr) vary less than 3 per cent during the observed epochs of the

spin-down times associated to magnetic braking range between 39 and 78Gyr. We
also compute the emission measure from the (quiescent) closed corona and show
that it remains approximately constant through these epochs at a value of
~10^{50.6} cm^{-3}. This suggests that a magnetic cycle of Tau Boo may not be
detected by X-ray observations. We further investigate the interaction between
the stellar wind and the planet by estimating radio emission from the
hot-Jupiter that orbits at 0.0462 au from Tau Boo. By adopting reasonable
hypotheses, we show that, for a planet with a magnetic field similar to Jupiter
(~14G at the pole), the radio flux is estimated to be about 0.5-1 mJy,
occurring at a frequency of 34MHz. If the planet is less magnetised (field
strengths roughly <4G), detection of radio emission from the ground is
unfeasible due to the Earth's ionospheric cutoff. According to our estimates,
if the planet is more magnetised than that and provided the emission beam
crosses the observer line-of-sight, detection of radio emission from Tau Boo b
is only possible by ground-based instruments with a noise level of < 1 mJy,
operating at low frequencies.

  Includes changes after peer review",,,,"q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the stochastic dynamics of evolutionary games, and focus on the
so-called `stochastic slowdown' effect, previously observed in (Altrock et. al,
2010) for simple evolutionary dynamics. Slowdown here refers to the fact that a
beneficial mutation may take longer to fixate than a neutral one. More
precisely, the fixation time conditioned on the mutant taking over can show a
maximum at intermediate selection strength. We show that this phenomenon is
present in the prisoner's dilemma, and also discuss counterintuitive slowdown
and speedup in coexistence games. In order to establish the microscopic origins
of these phenomena, we calculate the average sojourn times. This allows us to
identify the transient states which contribute most to the slowdown effect, and
enables us to provide an understanding of slowdown in the takeover of a small
group of cooperators by defectors: Defection spreads quickly initially, but the
final steps to takeover can be delayed substantially. The analysis of
coexistence games reveals even more intricate behavior. In small populations,
the conditional average fixation time can show multiple extrema as a function
of the selection strength, e.g., slowdown, speedup, and slowdown again. We
classify two-player games with respect to the possibility to observe

a simple relationship, which has been used to predict the time delay of
dispersed radio pulses since the late 1960s. We performed wide-band
simultaneous observations of four pulsars with LOFAR (at 40-190 MHz), the 76-m
Lovell Telescope (at 1400 MHz) and the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope (at 8000 MHz)
to test the accuracy of the dispersion law over a broad frequency range. In
this paper we present the results of these observations which show that the
dispersion law is accurate to better than 1 part in 100000 across our observing
band. We use this fact to constrain some of the properties of the ISM along the
line-of-sight and use the lack of any aberration or retardation effects to
determine upper limits on emission heights in the pulsar magnetosphere. We also
discuss the effect of pulse profile evolution on our observations, and the
implications that it could have for precision pulsar timing projects such as
the detection of gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays.

this is a striking result, since the dominant ""culture"" in these dynamical

nonperturbative modifications caused to the infrared finite gluon propagator
(in the Landau gauge) by the inclusion of a small number of quark families. Our
basic operating assumption is that the main bulk of the effect stems from the
""one-loop dressed"" quark loop contributing to the full gluon self-energy. This
quark loop is then calculated, using as basic ingredients the full quark
propagator and quark-gluon vertex; for the quark propagator we use the solution
obtained from the quark gap equation, while for the vertex we employ suitable
Ans\""atze, which guarantee the transversality of the answer. The resulting
effect is included as a correction to the quenched gluon propagator, obtained
in recent lattice simulations. Our main finding is that the unquenched
propagator displays a considerable suppression in the intermediate momentum
region, which becomes more pronounced as we increase the number of active quark
families. The influence of the quarks on the saturation point of the propagator
cannot be reliably computed within the present scheme; the general tendency
appears to be to decrease it, suggesting a corresponding increase in the
effective gluon mass. The renormalization properties of our results, and the
uncertainties induced by the unspecified transverse part of the quark-gluon
vertex, are discussed. Finally, the dressing function of the gluon propagator
is compared with the available unquenched lattice data, showing rather good
agreement.

Komatsu and Siegal-Gaskins (CKS) are not generally valid. The results in CKS

not apply to many physical models of the blazar population. Physical blazar
population models that match the measured source counts above the observational
threshold can account for 60% of the diffuse gamma-ray background intensity
between 1-10 GeV, while the assumptions in CKS limit the intensity to <30%. The
shortcomings of the model considered in CKS arise from an over-simplified
blazar source model. A number of the simplifying assumptions are unjustified,
including: first, the adoption of an assumed power-law source-count
distribution, dN/dS, to arbitrary low source fluxes, which is not exhibited in
physical models of the blazar population; and, second, the lack of blazar
spectral information in calculating the anisotropy of unresolved gamma-ray
blazar emission. We also show that the calculation of the unresolved blazars'
anisotropy is very sensitive to the spectral distribution of the unresolved
blazars through the adopted source resolution threshold value, and must be
taken into account in an accurate anisotropy calculation.

gravitational interaction or merger, this suggests that these galaxies have
either undergone minor merging events so that the overall structural properties
of the galaxies are not significantly altered, or they have undergone a major

results obtained using different techniques disagree. What it worse, they
disagree consistently. There have been numerous attempts to explain these
discrepancies, but none has provided a satisfactory solution to the problem. In
this paper, we explore the possibility that electrons in H ii regions and PNe
depart from a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium energy distribution. We adopt a
""kappa-distribution"" for the electron energies. Such distributions are widely
found in Solar System plasmas, where they can be directly measured. This simple
assumption is able to explain the temperature and metallicity discrepancies in
H ii regions and PNe arising from the different measurement techniques. We find
that the energy distribution does not need to depart dramatically from an
equilibrium distribution. From an examination of data from Hii regions and PNe
it appears that kappa ~ 10 is sufficient to encompass nearly all objects. We
argue that the kappa-distribution offers an important new insight into the
physics of gaseous nebulae, both in the Milky Way and elsewhere, and one that
promises significantly more accurate estimates of temperature and metallicity
in these regions.

the three point functions of the theories to leading order in N. We show that
there are two families of solutions. One family can be realized as a theory of
N fermions with an O(N) Chern-Simons gauge field, the other as a N bosons plus
the Chern-Simons gauge field. The family of solutions is parametrized by the 't
Hooft coupling. At special parity preserving points we get the critical O(N)

fixes the on shell three point functions of Vasiliev's theory on AdS_4 or dS_4.

then moderately enriched by a factor of $\sim$2 $\times$ solar (instead of
$\sim$7 $\times$ solar) and is found to be consistent with values predicted by
thermochemical models of the atmosphere. That Jupiter formed in a disk with C/O

cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the MaxBCG cluster catalog with data from FIRST and
NVSS. We have compared the radio luminosities and projected lengths of these FR
IIs to the projected length distribution of a range of mock catalogs generated
by an FR II model and estimate the FR II lifetime to be 1.9 x 10^8 yr. The
uncertainty in the lifetime calculation is a factor of two, due primarily to
uncertainties in the ICM density and the FR II axial ratio. We furthermore
measure the jet power distribution of FR IIs in BCGs and find that it is well
described by a log-normal distribution with a median power of 1.1 x 10^37 W and
a coefficient of variation of 2.2. These jet powers are nearly linearly related
to the observed luminosities, and this relation is steeper than many other
estimates, although it is dependent on the jet model. We investigate
correlations between FR II and cluster properties and find that galaxy
luminosity is correlated with jet power. This implies that jet power is also
correlated with black hole mass, as the stellar luminosity of a BCG should be a
good proxy for its spheroid mass and therefore the black hole mass. Jet power,
however, is not correlated with cluster richness, nor is FR II lifetime
strongly correlated with any cluster properties. We calculate the enthalpy of
the lobes to examine the impact of the FR IIs on the ICM and find that heating
due to adiabatic expansion is too small to offset radiative cooling by a factor
of at least six. In contrast, the jet power is approximately an order of
magnitude larger than required to counteract cooling. We conclude that if
feedback from FR IIs offsets cooling of the ICM, then heating must be primarily
due to another mechanism associated with FR II expansion.

line emission is not detected in either DOG. We calculate 3-sigma upper limits
to the CO J=2-1 line luminosities, L'_CO < 6.08x10^9 and < 6.63x10^9 K km/s

galaxies in the local Universe, this translates to limits on the cold molecular
gas mass of M_H_2 < 4.86x10^9 Msun and M_H_2 < 5.30x10^9 Msun. Both DOGs
exhibit mid-infrared continuum emission that follows a power-law, suggesting
that an AGN contributes to the dust heating. As such, estimates of the star
formation efficiencies in these DOGs are uncertain. A third cluster member with
an infrared luminosity, L_IR < 7.4x10^11 Lsun, is serendipitously detected in
CO J=2-1 line emission in the field of one of the DOGs located roughly two
virial radii away from the cluster center. The optical spectrum of this object
suggests that it is likely an obscured AGN, and the measured CO line luminosity
is L'_CO = (1.94 +/- 0.35)x10^10 K km/s pc^2, which leads to an estimated cold
molecular gas mass M_H_2 = (1.55+/-0.28)x10^10 Msun. A significant reservoir of

that the fuel can exist to drive an increase in star-formation and AGN activity

physical models for the internal structure of planets and host stars. The
resulting strength of the stellar tide produces a coupling that is strong
enough to reorient the spins of some host stars without causing catastrophic
orbital evolution, thereby potentially explaining the observed trend in
alignment between stellar spin and planetary orbital angular momentum. By
isolating the sample whose spins should not have been altered in this model, we
also show evidence for two different processes that contribute to the
population of planets with short orbital periods.
  We apply our results to estimate the remaining lifetimes for short period
planets, examine the survival of planets around evolving stars, and determine
the limits for circularisation of planets with highly eccentric orbits. Our
analysis suggests that the survival of circularised planets is strongly
affected by the amount of heat dissipated, which is often large enough to lead

contains 1, where T maps x\mapsto x/2 for x even and x\mapsto (3x+1)/2 for x
odd. A set S of positive integers is sufficient if the orbit of each positive
integer intersects the orbit of some member of S. In a previous paper it was
shown that every arithmetic sequence is sufficient.
  In this paper we further investigate the concept of sufficiency. We construct
sufficient sets of arbitrarily low asymptotic density in the natural numbers.
We determine the structure of the groups generated by the maps x\mapsto x/2 and
x\mapsto (3x+1)/2 modulo b for b relatively prime to 6, and study the action of
these groups on the directed graph associated to the 3x+1 dynamical system.
From this we obtain information about the distribution of arithmetic sequences

example, we show that the forward T-orbit of every positive integer contains an
element congruent to 2 mod 9, and every non-trivial cycle and divergent orbit
contains an element congruent to 20 mod 27. We generalize these results to find

  We carried out molecular observations of the 12CO(J=1-0) and (J=2-1) lines
with angular resolution of 44 arcsec and 22 arcsec using the SEST telescope.
Complementary NANTEN data of the 12CO(1-0) line were also used. The dust

at 3.4, 4.6, and 12.0 microns.
  The SEST data allowed us to identify a molecular component (Cloud 3) having
velocities in the interval from ~ +30 to +36 km/s which is most probably linked
to the nebula. Morphological and kinematical properties suggest that Cloud 3
constitute a wind-blown molecular half-shell, which expands around WR113. The
ratio R_(2-1/1-0) and excitation temperatures indicate that the molecular gas
is being irradiated by strong UV radiation. The location of the inner optical
ring in the outer edge of Cloud 3 suggests that the stars SerOB2-1, -2, -3,
-63, and -64 are responsables for the ionization of Cloud 3 and the inner ring

the PAH emission at 8 $\mu$m indicates the existence of a PDR between the
ionized and the molecular gas.
  A search for candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region around

surface density, Sigma_SFR, is closely correlated with the surface density of
molecular hydrogen, Sigma_H2. This empirical relation holds both for
galaxy-wide averages and for individual >=kpc sized patches of the interstellar
medium (ISM), but appears to degrade substantially at a sub-kpc scale.
Identifying the physical mechanisms that determine the scale-dependent
properties of the observed Sigma_H2-Sigma_SFR relation remains a challenge from
a theoretical perspective. To address this question, we analyze the slope and
scatter of the Sigma_H2-Sigma_SFR relation using a set of cosmological, galaxy
formation simulations with a peak resolution of ~100 pc. These simulations
include a chemical network for molecular hydrogen, a model for the CO emission,
and a simple, stochastic prescription for star formation that operates on ~100
pc scales. Specifically, star formation is modeled as a Poisson process in
which the average SFR is directly proportional to the present mass of H2. The
predictions of our numerical model are in good agreement with the observed
Kennicutt-Schmidt and Sigma_H2-Sigma_SFR relations. We show that observations
based on CO emission are ill suited to reliably measure the slope of the latter
relation at low (<20 M_sun pc^-2) H2 surface densities on sub-kpc scales. Our
models also predict that the inferred Sigma_H2-Sigma_SFR relation steepens at
high H2 surface densities as a result of the surface density dependence of the
CO/H2 conversion factor. Finally, we show that on sub-kpc scales most of the
scatter in the relation is a consequence of discreteness effects in the star
formation process. In contrast, variations of the CO/H2 conversion factor are
responsible for most of the scatter measured on super-kpc scales.

close to the central pulsars. However, observations of well-studied young
nebulae like the Crab Nebula, 3C 58, and G21.5--0.9 do not show the toroidal
magnetic field on a larger scale that might be expected in the MHD flow model;
in addition, the radial variation of spectral index due to synchrotron losses
is smoother than expected in the MHD flow model. We find that pure diffusion
models can reproduce the basic data on nebular size and spectral index
variation for the Crab, 3C 58, and G21.5--0.9. Most of our models use an energy
independent diffusion coefficient; power law variations of the coefficient with
energy are degenerate with variation in the input particle energy distribution
index in the steady state, transmitting boundary case. Energy dependent
diffusion is a possible reason for the smaller diffusion coefficient inferred
for the Crab. Monte Carlo simulations of the particle transport allowing for
advection and diffusion of particles suggest that diffusion dominates over much
of the total nebular volume of the Crab. Advection dominates close to the
pulsar and is likely to play a role in the X-ray half-light radius. The source
of diffusion and mixing of particles is uncertain, but may be related to the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the outer boundary of a young PWN or to
instabilities in the toroidal magnetic field structure.

MISSION has motivated the development of the present work, whose goal is to
characterize regions of stability and instability of the triple system (153591)
2001 SN263. The method adopted consisted in dividing the region around the
system into four distinct regions. We have performed numerical integrations of
systems composed by seven bodies: Sun, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and the three
components of the system, and by thousands of particles randomly distributed
within the demarcated regions, for the planar and inclined prograde cases. The
results are diagrams of semi-major axis versus eccentricity, where it is shown
the percentage of particles that survive for each set of initial conditions.
The regions where 100% of the particles survive is defined as stable regions.
We found that the stable regions are in the neighborhood of Alpha and Beta, and
in the external region. It was identified resonant motion of the particles with
Beta and Gamma in the internal regions, which lead to instability. For
particles with I>45{\deg} in the internal region, where I is the inclination
with respect to Alpha's equator, there is no stable region, except for the
particles placed really close to Alpha. The stability in the external region is
not affected by the variation of inclination. We also present a discussion on
the long-term stability in the internal region, for the planar and circular
cases, with comparisons with the short-term stability.

a period of 12.50995 \pm 0.00036 days and a semimajor axis of 2777 \pm 19 km. A
multi-year season of mutual events, in which the two near-equal brightness
bodies alternate in passing in front of one another as seen from Earth, is in
progress right now, and on 2011 Feb. 1 UT, one such event was observed from two
different telescopes. The mutual event season offers a rich opportunity to
learn much more about this barely-resolvable binary system, potentially
including component sizes, colors, shapes, and albedo patterns. The low
eccentricity of the orbit and a photometric lightcurve that appears to coincide
with the orbital period are consistent with a system that is tidally locked and
synchronized, like the Pluto-Charon system. The orbital period and semimajor
axis imply a system mass of (10.84 \pm 0.22) \times 10^18 kg, which can be
combined with a size estimate based on Spitzer and Herschel thermal infrared

between Z=1.5 and 4 kpc from the Galactic plane, as inferred from the
kinematics of thick disk stars. The formulation is exact within the limit of
validity of a few basic assumptions. The resulting trend of Sigma(Z) matches
the expectations of visible mass alone, and no dark component is required to
account for the observations. We extrapolate a dark matter (DM) density in the
solar neighborhood of 0+-1 mM_sun pc^-3, and all the current models of a
spherical DM halo are excluded at a confidence level higher than 4sigma. A
detailed analysis reveals that a small amount of DM is allowed in the volume
under study by the change of some input parameter or hypothesis, but not enough
to match the expectations of the models, except under an exotic combination of
non-standard assumptions. Identical results are obtained when repeating the
calculation with kinematical measurements available in the literature. We
demonstrate that a DM halo would be detected by our method, and therefore the
results have no straightforward interpretation. Only the presence of a highly
prolate (flattening q>2) DM halo can be reconciled with the observations, but
this is highly unlikely in LambdaCDM models. The results challenge the current
understanding of the spatial distribution and nature of the Galactic DM. In
particular, our results may indicate that any direct DM detection experiment is
doomed to fail, if the local density of the target particles is negligible.

interstellar medium (ISM), either due to disruption of a binary system or
ejection from their parent star cluster. The interaction of their wind with the
ISM produces a bow shock. In late evolutionary stages these stars may undergo
rapid transitions from red to blue and vice versa on the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram, with accompanying rapid changes to their stellar winds and bow shocks.
Recent 3D simulations of the bow shock produced by the nearby runaway red
supergiant (RSG) Betelgeuse, under the assumption of a constant wind, indicate
that the bow shock is very young (<30000 years old), hence Betelgeuse may have
only recently become a RSG. To test this possibility, we have calculated
stellar evolution models for single stars which match the observed properties
of Betelgeuse in the RSG phase. The resulting evolving stellar wind is
incorporated into 2D hydrodynamic simulations in which we model a runaway blue
supergiant (BSG) as it undergoes the transition to a RSG near the end of its
life. We find that the collapsing BSG wind bubble induces a bow shock-shaped
inner shell around the RSG wind that resembles Betelgeuse's bow shock, and has
a similar mass. Surrounding this is the larger-scale retreating bow shock
generated by the now defunct BSG wind's interaction with the ISM. We suggest
that this outer shell could explain the bar feature located (at least in
projection) just in front of Betelgeuse's bow shock.

uniform $L^{\frac{2n}{n+2}}\to L^{\frac{2n}{n-2}}$ resolvent estimates for
$\Delta_g+\zeta$, $\zeta \in {\mathcal R}_g$, where $\Delta_g$ is the
Laplace-Beltrami operator with metric $g$ on a given compact boundaryless
Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\ge3$. This is related to earlier work of
Kenig, Ruiz and the third author for the Euclidean Laplacian, in which case the
region is the entire complex plane minus any disc centered at the origin.
Presently, we show that for the round metric on the sphere, $S^n$, the
resolvent estimates in Ferreira et al, involving a much smaller region, are
essentially optimal. We do this by establishing sharp bounds based on the
distance from $\zeta$ to the spectrum of $\Delta_{S^n}$.
  In the other direction, we also show that the bounds in \cite{Kenig} can be
sharpened logarithmically for manifolds with nonpositive curvature, and by
powers in the case of the torus, ${\mathbb T}^n={\mathbb R}^n/{\mathbb Z}^n$,
with the flat metric. The latter improves earlier bounds of Shen.
  Further improvements for the torus are obtained using recent techniques of
the first author and his work with Guth based on the multilinear estimates of
Bennett, Carbery and Tao. Our approach also allows us to give a natural
necessary condition for favorable resolvent estimates that is based on a
measurement of the density of the spectrum of $\sqrt{-\Delta_g}$, and,
moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition based on natural improved
spectral projection estimates for shrinking intervals.

qualitatively with synaptogenesis, and both often exhibit bimodal temporal
profiles. Despite these non-monotonic dependencies, it is found based on
empirical data for different mammals that regional metabolic rate per synapse
is approximately conserved from birth to adulthood for a given species (with a
slight deviation from this constancy for human visual and temporal cortices
during adolescence). A typical synapse uses about $(7\pm 2)\cdot 10^{3}$
glucose molecules per second in primate cerebral cortex, and about 5 times of
that amount in cat and rat visual cortices. A theoretical model for brain
metabolic expenditure is used to estimate synaptic signaling and neural spiking
activity during development. It is found that synaptic efficacy is generally
inversely correlated with average firing rate, and additionally, synapses
consume a bulk of metabolic energy, roughly $50-90 %$ during most of the
developmental process (except human temporal cortex $ < 50%$). Overall, these
results suggest a tight regulation of brain electrical and chemical activities
during the formation and consolidation of neural connections. This presumably
reflects strong energetic constraints on brain development.

conditions, causes and consequences of the interruption in the calculations of
massive AGB stars in the late thermally-pulsing AGB phase. We have thoroughly
analysed the physical structure of a solar metallicity 8.5 solar mass star and
described the physical conditions at the base of the convective envelope (BCE)
just prior to divergence.
  We find that the local opacity maximum caused by M-shell electrons of
Fe-group elements lead to the accumulation of an energy excess, to the
departure of thermal equilibrium conditions at the base of the convective
envelope and, eventually, to the divergence of the computed models. For the 8.5
solar mass case we present in this work the divergence occurs when the envelope
mass is about 2 solar mass. The remaining envelope masses range between
somewhat less than 1 and more than 2 solar mass for stars with initial masses
between 7 and 10 solar mass and, therefore, our results are relevant for the
evolution and yields of super-AGB stars. If the envelope is ejected as a
consequence of the instability we are considering, the occurrence of
electron-capture supernovae would be avoided at solar metallicity.

We identify two regimes in the (N,D) parameter plane, where N is the size of

MPS can be used to perform finite size scaling (FSS). In the complementary
regime the MPS simulations show instead the clear signature of finite

MPS in the FSS regime maintain a finite overlap with the exact ground state.
This observation has implications on how to correctly perform FSS with MPS, as

In Ch3, by using a self-heating 3-Omega method, the specific heat, thermal
diffusivity and thermal conductivity of MWNTs are measured. MWNTs of 20-40 nm
diameter show a linear specific heat over a temperature range of 10-300 K,
suggesting that inter-wall coupling in MWNTs is rather weak compared with that
of graphite. The thermal conductivity shows a crossover from linear temperature
dependence to a square law at ~120K, with a rather low room-temperature
amplitude which may have resulted from structural defects. In Ch4, four-wire
tunneling spectroscopy of junctions between MWNTs and a normal metal is
measured. The Coulomb interactions in the MWNTs give rise to a strong zero-bias
suppression of tunneling density of states that can be fitted numerically with
the environmental quantum-fluctuation theory. At low temperatures, an
asymmetric conductance anomaly near zero bias is observed, which is interpreted
as Fano resonance in the strong tunneling regime. In Ch5, the thermoelectric
power (TEP) and longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) of MWNTs are measured. A
moderate positive TEP with metallic-like linear temperature dependence is
found, suggesting that the electron-hole symmetry in metallic MWNTs is broken.
Periodic oscillations in MR are observed at 20 mK when a longitudinal magnetic
field is applied. The period of oscillation agrees well with the period h/2e of
Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak (AAS) effect if only the outermost graphene wall

hydrodynamic equations coupled with the Poisson equation in a warm plasma
consisting of adiabatic ions and superthermal (Kappa distributed) electrons in
presence of an electron-beam component. In the linear limit, the dispersion
relation for ion-acoustic (IA) waves is obtained by linearizing of basic
equations. On the other hand, in the nonlinear analysis, an energy-balance like
equation involving Sagdeev's pseudo-potential is derived in order to
investigate arbitrary amplitude IA solitons. The Mach number range is
determined in which, propagation and characteristics of IA solitons are
analyzed both parametrically and numerically. The variation of amplitude and
width of electrostatic (ES) excitations as a result of superthermality (via)
and also the physical parameters (ion temperature, soliton speed, electron-beam
density and electron-beam velocity) are examined. A typical interaction between
IASWs and the electron-beam in plasma is confirmed. It is also found that ES
solitons with both negative polarity (rarefactive solitons) and positive
polarity (compressive solitons) can coexist in plasma. Furthermore, the small
but finite amplitude limit of IASWs is investigated and it is showed that this
limit is restricted to negative potential pulses.

generalized source term for the Poisson equation that takes into account
relativistic effects. The code was designed to treat moderately relativistic
systems such as rapidly rotating neutron stars. The hydrodynamic equations are
solved using a finite volume method with High Resolution Shock Capturing (HRSC)
techniques. We implement several different slope limiters for second order
reconstruction schemes and also investigate higher order reconstructions. We
use the method of lines (MoL) to convert the mixed spatial-time partial
differential equations into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that depend
only on time. These ODEs are solved using 2nd and 3rd order Runge-Kutta
methods. The Poisson equation for the gravitational potential is solved with a
multigrid method. In order to confirm the validity of our code, we carry out
four different tests including one and two dimensional shock tube tests,
stationary star tests of both non-rotating and rotating models and radial
oscillation mode tests for spherical stars. In the shock tube tests, the code
shows good agreement with analytic solutions which include shocks, rarefaction
waves and contact discontinuities. The code is found to be stable and accurate:
for example, when solving a stationary stellar model the fractional changes in
the maximum density, total mass, and total angular momentum per dynamical time
are found to be $3 \times 10^{-6}$, $5 \times 10^{-7}$ and $2 \times 10^{-6}$,
respectively. We also find that the frequencies of the radial modes obtained by
the numerical simulation of the steady state star agree very well with those

photometric study of the white dwarf companion and infer its radial velocity
curve, effective temperature, surface gravity and luminosity. We find that the
white dwarf has properties consistent with those of low-mass white dwarfs with
thick hydrogen envelopes, and use the corresponding mass-radius relation to
infer its mass; M_WD = 0.181 +/- +0.007/-0.005 solar masses. Combined with the
mass ratio q=8.1 +/- 0.2 inferred from the radial velocities and the precise
pulsar timing ephemeris, the neutron star mass is constrained to M_PSR = 1.47
+/- +0.07/-0.06 solar masses. Contrary to expectations, the latter is only
slightly above the Chandrasekhar limit. We find that, even if the birth mass of
the neutron star was only 1.20 solar masses, more than 60% of the matter that
left the surface of the white dwarf progenitor escaped the system. The accurate
determination of the component masses transforms this system in a laboratory
for fundamental physics by constraining the orbital decay predicted by general
relativity. Currently, the agreement is within 1 sigma of the observed decay.
Further radio timing observations will allow precise tests of white dwarf

It is founded on a Newtonian creep instead of the classical delaying approach
of the standard viscoelastic theories and the results of the theory derive
mainly from the solution of a non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation.
Lags appear in the solution but as quantities determined from the solution of
the equation and are not arbitrary external quantities plugged in an elastic
model. The resulting lags of the tide components are increasing functions of
their frequencies (as in Darwin's theory), but not small quantities. The
amplitudes of the tide components depend on the viscosity of the body and on
their frequencies; they are not constants. The resulting stationary rotations
(pseudo-synchronous) have an excess velocity roughly proportional to
$6ne^2/(\chi^2+1/\chi^2)$ ($\chi$ is the mean-motion in units of one critical
frequency - the relaxation factor - inversely proportional to the viscosity)
instead of the exact $6ne^2$ of standard theories. The dissipation in the
pseudo-synchronous solution is inversely proportional to $(\chi+1/\chi)$. In
the inviscid limit it is roughly proportional to the frequency (as in standard
theories), but that behavior is inverted when the viscosity is high and the
tide frequency larger than the critical frequency. For free rotating bodies,
the dissipation is given by the same law, but now $\chi$ is the frequency of
the semi-diurnal tide in units of the critical frequency. This approach fails
to reproduce the actual tidal lags on Earth. In this case, to reconcile theory
and observations, we need to assume the existence of an elastic tide superposed
to the creeping tide. The theory is applied to several Solar System and
extrasolar bodies and currently available data are used to estimate the
relaxation factor $\gamma$ (i.e. the critical frequency) of these bodies.

which is considered as an important problem in the community of machine
learning. In the standard supervised learning, only the labeled data is
observed. The classification and regression problems are formalized as the
supervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, unlabeled data is also
obtained in addition to labeled data. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data is
important to improve the prediction accuracy in semi-supervised learning. This
problems is regarded as a semiparametric estimation problem with missing data.
Under the the discriminative probabilistic models, it had been considered that
the unlabeled data is useless to improve the estimation accuracy. Recently, it
was revealed that the weighted estimator using the unlabeled data achieves
better prediction accuracy in comparison to the learning method using only
labeled data, especially when the discriminative probabilistic model is
misspecified. That is, the improvement under the semiparametric model with
missing data is possible, when the semiparametric model is misspecified. In
this paper, we apply the density-ratio estimator to obtain the weight function

proposed estimator does not require well-specified probabilistic models for the
probability of the unlabeled data. Based on the statistical asymptotic theory,
we prove that the estimation accuracy of our method outperforms the supervised

understand the selection of traits with frequency-dependent fitness. Recently,
a simple but fundamental law of evolutionary dynamics, which we call {\sigma}
law, describes how to determine the selection between two competing strategies:
in most evolutionary processes with two strategies, A and B, strategy A is
favored over B in weak selection if and only if {\sigma}R + S > T + {\sigma}P.
This relationship holds for a wide variety of structured populations with
mutation rate and weak selection under certain assumptions. In this paper, we
propose a model of games based on a community-structured population and revisit
this law under the Moran process. By calculating the average payoffs of A and B
individuals with the method of effective sojourn time, we find that {\sigma}
features not only the structured population characteristics but also the
reaction rate between individuals. That's to say, an interaction between two
individuals are not uniform, and we can take {\sigma} as a reaction rate
between any two individuals with the same strategy. We verify this viewpoint by
the modified replicator equation with non-uniform interaction rates in a
simplified version of the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG).

symmetry from a particular way of hopping between two silicenes. It is a
topologically trivial insulator since it carries a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$

those of a topological insulator than those of a band insulator. Indeed, a
bilayer silicene nanoribbon has edge modes which are almost gapless and

is that the band structure is controllable by applying the electric field to a
bilayer silicene sheet. We investigate the energy spectrum of bilayer silicene
under electric field. Just as monolayer silicene undergoes a phase transition
from a topological insulator to a band insulator at a certain electric field,
bilayer silicene makes a transition from a quasi-topological insulator to a

However, classical GP inference suffers from high computational cost and it is

dependent eigenfunctions and select these eigenfunctions by evidence
maximization. This selection reduces the number of eigenfunctions in our model

likelihoods, we develop an efficient expectation propagation (EP) inference
algorithm, and couple it with expectation maximization for eigenfunction
selection. Because the eigenfunctions of a Gaussian kernel are associated with
clusters of samples - including both the labeled and unlabeled - selecting
relevant eigenfunctions enables EigenGP to conduct semi-supervised learning.
Our experimental results demonstrate improved predictive performance of EigenGP
over alternative state-of-the-art sparse GP and semisupervised learning methods

evaluated to be respectively about 70% and 30% at the saturation density almost

absorption ratios [Lambda p]/[Sigma^0 p] and [Lambda n]/[Sigma^0 n] are about
unity while [Sigma^+ n]/[Sigma^0 p] and [Sigma^- p]/[Sigma^0 n] are about two
due to the Lambda(1405) dominance in absorption. Taking into account the kaon

downward shift of the initial K^-N two-body energy, but this does not
drastirally change the nonmesonic fraction. The Sigma(1385) contribution in the

that can dramatically improve the convergence rate of accelerated gradient
schemes. The analysis of the technique relies on the observation that these
schemes exhibit two modes of behavior depending on how much momentum is
applied. In what we refer to as the 'high momentum' regime the iterates
generated by an accelerated gradient scheme exhibit a periodic behavior, where
the period is proportional to the square root of the local condition number of
the objective function. This suggests a restart technique whereby we reset the
momentum whenever we observe periodic behavior. We provide analysis to show
that in many cases adaptively restarting allows us to recover the optimal rate
of convergence with no prior knowledge of function parameters.

is assumed that state of computational process has two components: a control
unit state and a memory state. Then authors modify the class of models by
substituting the deterministic evolutionary mechanism for a stochastic
evolutionary mechanism. This approach can be generalized to the quantum case:
one can replace transformations of a classical memory with quantum operations
on a quantum memory. Hence the authors come to the need to construct a
mathematical model of an operation on the quantum memory. It leads them to the
notion of an abstract quantum automaton. Further the authors demonstrate that a
quantum teleportation process is described as evolutionary process for some

apparitions. Dust loss rates, ejection velocities, and power-law size
distribution functions are derived as functions of the heliocentric distance
using pre- and post-perihelion imaging observations during both apparitions.
The 2009 post-perihelion images can be accurately fitted by an isotropic
ejection model. On the other hand, strong dust ejection anisotropies are
required to fit the near-coma regions at large heliocentric distances (both
inbound at $r_h$=2.5 AU and outbound at $r_h$=2.6 AU) for the 2002 apparition.
These asymmetries are compatible with a scenario where dust ejection is mostly
seasonally-driven, coming mainly from regions near subsolar latitudes at far
heliocentric distances inbound and outbound. At intermediate to near-perihelion
heliocentric distances, the outgassing would affect much more extended latitude
regions, the emission becoming almost isotropic near perihelion. We derived a
maximum dust production rate of 260 kg s$^{-1}$ at perihelion, and an averaged
production rate over one orbit of 40 kg s$^{-1}$. An enhanced emission rate,
accompanied also by a large ejection velocity, is predicted at $r_h>$2.5
pre-perihelion.
  The model has also been extended to the thermal infrared in order to be
applied to available trail observations with IRAS and ISO spacecrafts of this
comet. The modeled trail intensities are in good agreement with those
observations, which is remarkable taking into account that those data are
sensitive to dust ejection patterns corresponding to several orbits before the

stars measured in Baade's window, for which we adopt E(B-V)=0.55. This allows
us to construct a reddening map sensitive to small scale variations minimizing
the problems arising from differential extinction. The significant reddening
variations are clearly observed on spatial scales as small as 2'. We find a
good agreement between our extinction measurements and Schlegel maps in the
outer bulge, but, as already stated in the literature the Schlegel maps are not
reliable for regions within |b| < 6. In the inner regions we compare our
results with maps derived from DENIS and Spitzer surveys. While we find good
agreement with other studies in the corresponding overlapping regions, our
extinction map has better quality due to both higher resolution and a more
complete spatial coverage in the Bulge. We investigate the importance of
differential reddening and demonstrate the need for high resolution extinction
maps for detailed studies of Bulge stellar populations and structure. The
extinction variations on scales of up to 2'-6', must be taken into account when
analysing the stellar populations of the Bulge.

counterintuitive solutions that evolve along both attracting and repelling
invariant manifolds. In two dimensions, canards result in periodic oscillations
whose amplitude and period grow in a highly nonlinear way: they are slowly
varying with respect to a control parameter, except for an exponentially small
range of values where they grow extremely rapidly. This sudden growth, called a
canard explosion, has been encountered in many applications ranging from
chemistry to neuronal dynamics, aerospace engineering and ecology. Canards were
initially studied using nonstandard analysis, and later the same results were
proved by standard techniques such as matched asymptotics, invariant manifold
theory and parameter blow-up. More recently, canard-like behaviour has been
linked to surfaces of discontinuity in piecewise-smooth dynamical systems. This
paper provides a new perspective on the canard phenomenon by showing that the
nonstandard analysis of canard explosions can be recast into the framework of
piecewise-smooth dynamical systems. An exponential coordinate scaling is
applied to a singularly perturbed system of ordinary differential equations.
The scaling acts as a lens that resolves dynamics across all time-scales. The
changes of local curvature that are responsible for canard explosions are then
analysed. Regions where different time-scales dominate are separated by
hypersurfaces, and these are pinched together to obtain a piecewise-smooth
system, in which curvature changes manifest as discontinuity-induced
bifurcations. The method is used to classify canards in arbitrary dimensions,
and to derive the parameter values over which canards form either small cycles
(canards without head) or large cycles (canards with head).

  Intersection Graphs",,,,,"cs.DM math.CO math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we relate the problem of finding a maximum clique to the
intersection number of the input graph (i.e. the minimum number of cliques
needed to edge cover the graph). In particular, we consider the maximum clique
problem for graphs with small intersection number and random intersection
graphs (a model in which each one of $m$ labels is chosen independently with
probability $p$ by each one of $n$ vertices, and there are edges between any
vertices with overlaps in the labels chosen).
  We first present a simple algorithm which, on input $G$ finds a maximum
clique in $O(2^{2^m + O(m)} + n^2 \min\{2^m, n\})$ time steps, where $m$ is an
upper bound on the intersection number and $n$ is the number of vertices.
Consequently, when $m \leq \ln{\ln{n}}$ the running time of this algorithm is
polynomial.
  We then consider random instances of the random intersection graphs model as
input graphs. As our main contribution, we prove that, when the number of
labels is not too large ($m=n^{\alpha}, 0< \alpha <1$), we can use the label
choices of the vertices to find a maximum clique in polynomial time whp. The
proof of correctness for this algorithm relies on our Single Label Clique
Theorem, which roughly states that whp a ""large enough"" clique cannot be formed
by more than one label. This theorem generalizes and strengthens other related
results in the state of the art, but also broadens the range of values
considered.
  As an important consequence of our Single Label Clique Theorem, we prove that
the problem of inferring the complete information of label choices for each
vertex from the resulting random intersection graph (i.e. the \emph{label
representation of the graph}) is \emph{solvable} whp. Finding efficient
algorithms for constructing such a label representation is left as an
interesting open problem for future research.

of a recently discovered new form of quantum matter, the three-dimensional
topological insulator (TI) [1-4]. These compounds host a single spin-helical
surface state which is guaranteed to be metallic due to time reversal symmetry,
and should be ideal materials with which to realize spintronic and quantum
computing applications of TIs [5]. However, the vast majority of such compounds
synthesized to date are not insulators at all, but rather have detrimental
metallic bulk conductivity [2, 3]. This is generally accepted to result from
unintentional doping by defects, although the nature of the defects responsible
across different compounds, as well as strategies to minimize their detrimental
role, are surprisingly poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive
survey of the defect landscape of Bi-chalchogenide TIs from first-principles
calculations. We find that fundamental differences in the energetics of native
defect formation in Te- and Se-containing TIs enables precise control of the
conductivity across the ternary Bi-Te-Se alloy system. From a systematic
angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) investigation of such ternary alloys,
combined with bulk transport measurements, we demonstrate that this method can
be utilized to achieve true topological insulators, with only a single Dirac
cone surface state intersecting the chemical potential. Our microscopic
calculations reveal the key role of anti-site defects for achieving this, and
predict optimal growth conditions to realize maximally-resistive ternary TIs.

may depend on the total particle number, but does not depend on the

energy of the system without the interaction energy, also provides a good

  If the total interaction energy of the system, being a complicated function
of the particle populations, is temperature dependent, then the Landau's
quasiparticle gas cannot describe accurately the thermodynamics of the system.
  A general solution to this problem is presented in this paper, in which the
quasiparticle energies are redefined in such a way that the total energy of the

implies also that the thermodynamic properties of the system and those of the

changes of the electron population within several 100 meV above and below the
Fermi level, which we explain as combination of (i) coherent lattice
vibrations, (ii) a hot electron and hole distribution, and (iii) transient
modifications of the chemical potential. The response of the three different
materials is very similar. In the Fourier transformation of the time-dependent
photoemission intensity we identify three modes at 5.6, 3.3, and 2.6 THz. While
the highest frequency mode is safely assigned to the A_{1g} mode, the other two
modes require a discussion in comparison to literature. The time-dependent
evolution of the hot electron distribution follows a simplified description of
a transient three temperature model which considers two heat baths of lattice
vibrations, which are more weakly and strongly coupled to transiently excited
electron population. Still the energy transfer from electrons to the strongly
coupled phonons results in a rather weak, momentum-averaged electron-phonon
coupling quantified by values for \lambda<\omega^2> between 30 and 70 meV^2.
The chemical potential is found to present a transient modulation induced by
the coherent phonons. This change in the chemical potential is particularly
strong in a two band system like in the 122 Fe-pnictide compounds investigated

algebraic multilevel preconditioner based on piecewise constant coarse vector
spaces applied to the graph Laplacian. A bound is derived on the energy norm of
the projection operator onto any piecewise constant vector space, which results
in an estimate of the two-level convergence rate where the coarse level graph
is obtained by matching. The two-level convergence of the method is then used
to establish the convergence of an Algebraic Multilevel Iteration that uses the
two-level scheme recursively. On structured grids, the method is proven to have
convergence rate $\approx (1-1/\log n)$ and $O(n\log n)$ complexity for each
cycle, where $n$ denotes the number of unknowns in the given problem. Numerical
results of the algorithm applied to various graph Laplacians are reported. It
is also shown that all the theoretical estimates derived for matching can be

dynamical research. Recent studies have shown that these stellar systems are
not as simple as previously assumed. With multiple stellar populations as well
as outer rotation and mass segregation they turn out to exhibit high
complexity. This includes intermediate-mass black holes which are proposed to
sit at the centers of some massive globular clusters. Today's high angular
resolution ground based spectrographs allow velocity-dispersion measurements at
a spatial resolution comparable to the radius of influence for plausible IMBH
masses, and to detect changes in the inner velocity-dispersion profile.
Together with high quality photometric data from HST, it is possible to
constrain black-hole masses by their kinematic signatures. We determine the
central velocity-dispersion profile of the globular cluster NGC 2808 using
VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy. In combination with HST/ACS data our goal is to probe
whether this massive cluster hosts an intermediate-mass black hole at its
center and constrain the cluster mass to light ratio as well as its total mass.
We derive a velocity-dispersion profile from integral field spectroscopy in the
center and Fabry Perot data for larger radii. High resolution HST data are used
to obtain the surface brightness profile. Together, these data sets are
compared to dynamical models with varying parameters such as mass to light
ratio profiles and black-hole masses. Using analytical Jeans models in
combination with variable M/L profiles from N-body simulations we find that the
best fit model is a no black hole solution. After applying various Monte Carlo
simulations to estimate the uncertainties, we derive an upper limit of the back
hole mass of M_BH < 1 x 10^4 M_SUN (with 95 % confidence limits) and a global
mass-to-light ratio of M/L_V = (2.1 +- 0.2) M_SUN/L_SUN.

data in a live EHR system deployed in a large, multi-state outpatient
behavioral healthcare provider in the United States serving over 75,000
distinct patients each year across 130 clinical locations. This tool
incorporated auto-complete search functionality for medications and proper
dosage identification assistance. The overarching goal was to understand if and
how standardized terminologies like RxNorm can be used to support practical
computing applications in live EHR systems. We describe the stages of
implementation, approaches used to adapt RxNorm's data structure for the
intended EHR application, and the challenges faced. We evaluate the
implementation using a four-factor framework addressing flexibility, speed,
data integrity, and medication coverage. RxNorm proved to be functional for the
intended application, given appropriate adaptations to address high-speed
input/output (I/O) requirements of a live EHR and the flexibility required for
data entry in multiple potential clinical scenarios. Future research around
search optimization for medication entry, user profiling, and linking RxNorm to
drug classification schemes holds great potential for improving the user
experience and utility of medication data in EHRs.

  liquids are considered to be incompressible. - The Sheludko experiment (1967)
  based on the concept of disjoining pressure in DLVO theory (1948) that
  highlights a strong difference between liquid bulk and thin layer pressures.
  The theoretical results allow us to obtain: - The computation of tallest
  trees' level that fits with real facts - The interpretation of the motion in
  xylem microtubes by using the shallow water approximation and the slippage on
  walls at the nanometric scale. arXiv admin note: text overlap with

eucalyptus, and a 135 meter-tall sequoia. However, the explanation of the
maximum altitude of the crude sap ascent and consequently the main reason of
the maximum size that trees can reach is not well understood. According to tree
species, the crude sap is driven in xylem microtubes with diameters ranging
between 50 and 400 micrometers. The sap contains diluted salts but its physical
properties are roughly those of water; consequently, hydrodynamic, capillarity
and osmotic pressure yield a crude sap ascent of a few tens of meters only.
Today, we can propound a new understanding of the ascent of sap to the top of
very tall trees thanks to a new comparison between experiments associated with
the cohesion-tension theory and the disjoining pressure concept. Here we show
that the pressure in the water-storing tracheids of leaves can be strongly
negative whereas the pressure in the xylem microtubes of stems may remain
positive when, at high level, inhomogeneous liquid nanolayers wet the xylem
walls of microtubes. The nanofluidic model of crude sap in tall trees discloses
a stable sap layer up to an altitude where the pancake layer thickness coexists
with the dry xylem wall and corresponds to the maximum size of tallest trees.
In very thin layers, sap flows are widely more significant than those obtained
with classical Navier-Stokes models and consequently are able to refill
stomatic cells when phloem embolisms supervene. These results drop an inkling
that the disjoining pressure is an efficient tool to study biological liquids
in contact with substrates at a nanoscale range.

behaviors, particularly when confined in potential traps. It has previously
been predicted that triangular lattices of vortices of the same sign will form
spontaneously as the result of surface instabilities in a harmonic trap.
However, natural disorder, deviation of the external potential from circular
symmetry, or higher-order terms modifying the dynamical equations may all have
detrimental effects and destabilize the circular trajectories of vortices. Here
we address these issues, by characterizing the robustness of the vortex lattice
against disorder and deformations of the trapping potential. Since most
experiments use time integrated measurements it would be hard to observe
directly the rotating vortex lattices or distinguish them from vortex-free
states. We suggest how these difficulties can be overcome and present an
experimentally viable interference-imaging scheme that would allow the
detection of rotating vortex lattices.

observations at the Parkes radio telescope. The radio emission is found to have
a complex modulation dominated by a periodicity of ~20 times its rotational
period P (0.197s), whose phase and strength depends on pulse longitude. This
periodicity exhibits a phase-locked delay of about 2.5P between the main pulse
(MP) and interpulse (IP), presumed to be the opposite poles of the pulsar. This
delay corresponds to a light travel distance of many times the light cylinder
radius. More complex modulations are found within the MP on timescales down to
about 9P, and both these and the principal modulation vary strongly across the
(at least) 7 components which the MP and IP exhibit. The nature of the single
pulse emission, which ranges from smooth and longitudinally extended to
`spiky', is also component-dependent. Despite these disparities, the total
pulse intensity distributions at the MP and IP are virtually identical in
shape, suggesting a common emission mechanism. In an attempt to account for the
complex modulations we examine a number of physical models, both intrinsic
(which presuppose the pulsar to be an isolated neutron star) and extrinsic
(appealing to the presence of circumstellar material to modulate the emission).
Significant objections can be made to each model, so this pulsar's behaviour
patterns remain a crucial challenge to theorists.

resource set E (e.g., machines, edges, or nodes in a digraph). The cost of a
resource e depends on the number (or load) of players using e, and has to be
paid completely by the players before it becomes available. Each player i needs
at least one set of a predefined family S_i in 2^E to be available. Thus,
resource buying games can be seen as a variant of congestion games in which the
load-dependent costs of the resources can be shared arbitrarily among the
players. A strategy of player i in resource buying games is a tuple consisting
of one of i's desired configurations S_i together with a payment vector p_i in
R^E_+ indicating how much i is willing to contribute towards the purchase of
the chosen resources. In this paper, we study the existence and computational
complexity of pure Nash equilibria (PNE, for short) of resource buying games.
In contrast to classical congestion games for which equilibria are guaranteed
to exist, the existence of equilibria in resource buying games strongly depends
on the underlying structure of the S_i's and the behavior of the cost
functions. We show that for marginally non-increasing cost functions, matroids
are exactly the right structure to consider, and that resource buying games
with marginally non-decreasing cost functions always admit a PNE.

interact with its interstellar medium leading to ejection or heating of the
gas. This can terminate star formation in the galaxy and stifle accretion onto
the black hole. Such Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback can account for the
observed proportionality between central black hole and host galaxy mass.
Direct observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback,
which occurs when the AGN is very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is
accumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio
mode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when
the AGN is operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical
galaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the
central galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot
surrounding medium. The energy flow, which is roughly continuous, heats the hot
intracluster gas and reduces radiative cooling and subsequent star formation by
an order of magnitude. Feedback appears to maintain a long-lived
heating/cooling balance. Powerful, jetted radio outbursts may represent a
further mode of energy feedback which affect the cores of groups and
subclusters. New telescopes and instruments from the radio to X-ray bands will
come into operation over the next few years and lead to a rapid expansion in
observational data on all modes of AGN feedback.

supergiants. However, its strength also depends on other atmospheric
parameters. In this study, we present the luminosity calibrations, where, for
the first time, the effects of the effective temperature, microturbulent
velocity, surface gravity, and the abundance have been disentangled. The
calibrations are derived on the basis of a dataset of high-dispersion spectra
of 60 yellow supergiants with highly reliable luminosities and accurate
atmospheric parameters. This allowed to bring the uncertainty of the
triplet-based absolute magnitudes down to 0.26 mag. The calibrations are
suitable for spectral types F0-K0 and luminosity classes I-II, covering
absolute magnitudes Mv from -1.0 to -10 mag.

been a central topic in atomic physics for decades. Thus, one finds that many
concepts developed to describe cavity optomechanical systems with solid-state
mechanical oscillators have also been developed in parallel in relation to cold
atomic physics. I describe several of these ideas from atomic physics,
including optical methods for detecting quantum states of single cold atoms and
atomic ensembles, motional effects within single-atom cavity quantum
electrodynamics, and collective optical effects such as superradiant Rayleigh
scattering and cavity cooling of atomic ensembles. I present several
experimental realizations of cavity optomechanics in which an atomic ensemble
serves as the mechanical element. These are divided between systems driven
either by sending light onto the cavity input mirrors (""cavity pumped""), or by
sending light onto the atomic ensemble (""side pumped""). The cavity-pumped
systems clearly exhibit the key phenomena of cavity optomechanical systems,
including cavity-aided position sensing, coherent back action effects such as
the optical spring and cavity cooling, and optomechanical bistability; several
of these effects have been detected not only for linear but also for quadratic
optomechanical coupling. The extreme isolation of the atomic ensemble from
mechanical disturbances, and its strong polarizability near the atomic
resonance frequency, allow these optomechanical systems to be highly sensitive
to quantum radiation pressure fluctuations. I describe several ways in which
these fluctuations are observed experimentally. I conclude by considering the
side-pumped cavity experiments in terms of cavity optomechanics, complementing
recent treatments of these systems in terms of condensed-matter physics
concepts such as quantum phase transitions and supersolidity.

the mathematical formalism used in the case of the quantum systems with
finite-dimensional Hilbert space. The rate of return is a discrete variable
corresponding to the coordinate in the case of quantum systems, and the
operator of the conjugate variable describing the trend of the stock return is
defined in terms of the finite Fourier transform. The stock return in
equilibrium is described by a finite Gaussian function, and the time evolution
of the stock price, directly related to the rate of return, is obtained by
numerically solving a Schrodinger type equation.
