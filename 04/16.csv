gravity (TMG) and its higher spin generalization, in the first order
formulation. The action of higher spin TMG has been proposed in arXiv:1110.5113
to be of a Chern-Simons-like form. The equations of motion are more complicated
than the ones in pure higher spin AdS$_3$ gravity, but are still tractable. As
all the solutions in higher spin gravity are automatically the solutions of
higher spin TMG, we focus on other solutions. We manage to find the AdS pp-wave
solutions with higher spin hair, and find that the nonvanishing higher spin
fields may or may not modify the pp-wave geometry. In order to discuss the
warped spacetime, we introduce the notion of special Killing vector, which is
defined to be the symmetry on the frame-like fields. We reproduce various
warped spacetimes of TMG in our framework, with the help of special Killing
vectors.

we discuss recent developments of that approach for systems that must ensure
Boolean behaviors (e.g., reachability, liveness) along with quantitative

emission, where the phenomenological Band's function is usually applied to
describe the GRB prompt emission. We suggest that the GRB prompt emission is
mainly a result of two upscattering processes. The first process is the
Comptonization of relatively cold soft photons of the star off electrons of a
hot shell of plasma of temperature T_e of the order of 10^{9} K (or kT_e~100
keV) that moves sub-relativistically with the bulk velocity V_b substantially
less than the speed of light c. In this phase, the Comptonization parameter Y
is high and the interaction between a blackbody-like soft seed photon
population and hot electrons leads to formation of a saturated Comptonization
spectrum modified by the sub-relativistic bulk outflow. The second process is
an upscattering of the previously Comptonized spectrum by the plasma outflow
once it becomes relativistic. This process gives rise to the high-energy
power-law component above the peak in the EF(E)-diagram where F(E) is the
energy flux. The latter process can be described by a convolution of the
Comptonized spectrum with a broken-power-law Green function. Possible physical
scenarios for this second upscattering process are discussed. In the framework
of our model, we give an interpretation of the Amati relation between the
intrinsic spectral peak photon energy and radiated energy or luminosity, and we
propose a possible explanation of the GRB temporal variability.

explain the close timing of the mass loss and supernova events, we explore the
possibility that the mass loss is driven by common envelope evolution of a

and the supernova is triggered by the inspiral of the compact object to the
central core of the companion star. The expected rate of such events is smaller

the uncertainties. The mass loss velocity is related to the escape velocity
from the common envelope system and is comparable to the observed velocity of
100's of km s$^{-1}$ in Type IIn events. The mass loss is expected to be denser
near the equatorial plane of the binary system and there is good evidence that
the circumstellar media in Type IIn supernovae are asymmetric. Some of these
supernova types show evidence for energies in excess of the canonical $10^{51}$

that for a given SFR both 70 um and 1.4 GHz fluxes are low compared to the

agrees within errorbars with that seen for large galaxies. The radio-FIR
correlation thus appears to be the result of a 'conspiracy'. We use the SFR to
estimate the non-thermal fraction of the 1.4 GHz radio emission and find it to
be around 50%, much smaller than the 90% typical for spirals. We also estimate
the equipartition magnetic field and find it to be ~ 2 microgauss, about five

Way's satellite galaxy companions. UV photoionisation, supernova feedback and
interactions with the larger host halo are all thought to play a role in
shaping the population of satellites that we observe today, but there is still
no consensus as to which of these effects, if any, dominates. In this paper, we
revisit the issue by re-simulating a Milky Way class dark matter (DM) halo with
unprecedented resolution. Our set of cosmological hydrodynamic Adaptive Mesh
Refinement (AMR) simulations, called the Nut suite, allows us to investigate
the effect of supernova feedback and UV photoionisation at high redshift with
sub-parsec resolution. We subsequently follow the effect of interactions with
the Milky Way-like halo using a lower spatial resolution (50pc) version of the
simulation down to z=0. This latter produces a population of simulated
satellites that we compare to the observed satellites of the Milky Way and M31.
We find that supernova feedback reduces star formation in the least massive
satellites but enhances it in the more massive ones. Photoionisation appears to
play a very minor role in suppressing star and galaxy formation in all
progenitors of satellite halos. By far the largest effect on the satellite
population is found to be the mass of the host and whether gas cooling is
included in the simulation or not. Indeed, inclusion of gas cooling
dramatically reduces the number of satellites captured at high redshift which
survive down to z=0.

to allow users to roam seamlessly from indoor to outdoor environments. Such a

direction finding between indoor locations, enhancing first responders' safety
by providing anywhere localization and floor plans, and providing a richer
environment for location-aware social networking applications.
  We describe an architecture for the ubiquitous indoor positioning system
(IPS) and the challenges that have to be addressed to materialize it. We then
focus on the feasibility of automating the construction of a worldwide indoor
floor plan and fingerprint database which, as we believe, is one of the main
challenges that limit the existence of a ubiquitous IPS system. Our proof of
concept uses a crowd-sourcing approach that leverages the embedded sensors in
today's cell phones as a worldwide distributed floor plan generation tool. This
includes constructing the floor plans and determining the areas of interest
(corridors, offices, meeting rooms, elevators, etc). The cloud computing
concepts are also adopted for the processing and storage of the huge amount of
data generated and requested by the system's users. Our results show the
ability of the system to construct an accurate floor plan and identify the
areas of interest with more than 90% accuracy. We also identify different

For instance, in two-dimensional digital imaging, flow cytometry, and
electroencephalography, matrix type covariates frequently arise when
measurements are obtained for each combination of two underlying variables. To
address scientific questions arising from those data, new regression methods
that take matrices as covariates are needed, and sparsity or other forms of
regularization are crucial due to the ultrahigh dimensionality and complex
structure of the matrix data. The popular lasso and related regularization
methods hinge upon the sparsity of the true signal in terms of the number of
its nonzero coefficients. However, for the matrix data, the true signal is
often of, or can be well approximated by, a low rank structure. As such, the
sparsity is frequently in the form of low rank of the matrix parameters, which
may seriously violate the assumption of the classical lasso. In this article,
we propose a class of regularized matrix regression methods based on spectral
regularization. Highly efficient and scalable estimation algorithm is
developed, and a degrees of freedom formula is derived to facilitate model
selection along the regularization path. Superior performance of the proposed
method is demonstrated on both synthetic and real examples.

of 16 Cha targets, which have been suggested, but not confirmed as binaries or

astrometric measurements, as well as differential photometry in the J, H, and K
band. On the basis of known proper motions and these observations, we analyse
the astrometric results in our ""Proper Motion Diagram"" (PMD: angular separation
/ position angle versus time), to eliminate possible (non-moving) background
stars, establish co-moving binaries and multiples, and search for curvature as
indications for orbital motion. All previously suggested close components are
co-moving and no background stars are found. The angular separations range
between 0.07 and 9 arcseconds, corresponding to projected distances between the
components of 6-845 AU. Thirteen stars are at least binaries and the remaining
three (RX J0919.4-7738, RX J0952.7-7933, VW Cha) are confirmed high-order
multiple systems with up to four components. In 13 cases, we found significant
slopes in the PMDs, which are compatible with orbital motion whose periods
range from 60 to 550 years. However, in only four cases there are indications
of a curved orbit, the ultimate proof of a gravitational bond. Massive primary
components appear to avoid the simultaneous formation of equal-mass secondary

is an open question whether or not the widely accepted peaked solitary waves
can be derived from the fully nonlinear wave equations. In this paper, a
unified wave model (UWM) based on the symmetry and the fully nonlinear wave
equations is put forward for progressive waves with permanent form in finite
water depth. Different from traditional wave models, the flows described by the
UWM are not necessarily irrotational at crest, so that it is more general. The
unified wave model admits not only the traditional progressive waves with
smooth crest, but also a new kind of solitary waves with peaked crest that
include the famous peaked solitary waves given by the Camassa-Holm equation.
Besides, it is proved that Kelvin's theorem still holds everywhere for the
newly found peaked solitary waves. Thus, the UWM unifies, for the first time,
both of the traditional smooth waves and the peaked solitary waves. In other
words, the peaked solitary waves are consistent with the traditional smooth
ones. So, in the frame of inviscid fluid, the peaked solitary waves are as
acceptable and reasonable as the traditional smooth ones. It is found that the
peaked solitary waves have some unusual and unique characteristics. First of
all, they have a peaked crest with a discontinuous vertical velocity at crest.
Especially, the phase speed of the peaked solitary waves has nothing to do with
wave height. In addition, the kinetic energy of the peaked solitary waves
either increases or almost keeps the same from free surface to bottom. All of
these unusual properties show the novelty of the peaked solitary waves,
although it is still an open question whether or not they are reasonable in
physics if the viscosity of fluid and surface tension are considered.

XMM-Newton RGS spectra of nearby non-AGN galaxies (including starforming ones:

the K{\alpha} triplet of O VII shows that the resonance line is typically
weaker than the forbidden and/or inter-combination lines. This suggests that a
substantial fraction of the emission may not arise directly from optically thin
thermal plasma, as commonly assumed, and may instead originate at its interface
with neutral gas via charge exchange. This latter origin naturally explains the
observed spatial correlation of the emission with various tracers of cool gas
in some of the galaxies. However, alternative scenarios, such as the resonance
scattering by the plasma and the relic photo-ionization by AGNs in the recent
past, cannot be ruled out, at least in some cases, and are being examined. Such
X-ray spectroscopic studies are important to the understanding of the
relationship of the emission to various high-energy feedback processes in

this problem real time search engines have recently received increased
attention. They take into account the continuous flow of information
differently than traditional web search by incorporating temporal and social
features, that describe the context of the information during its creation.
Standard approaches where data first get stored and then is processed from a
peristent storage suffer from latency. We want to address the fluent and rapid
nature of text stream by providing an event based approach that analyses
directly the stream of information. In a first step we want to define the
difference between real time search and traditional search to clarify the
demands in modern text filtering. In a second step we want to show how event

Using the example of Twitter we present in this paper a way how to combine an
event based approach with text mining and information filtering concepts in
order to classify incoming information based on stream features. We calculate
stream dependant features and feed them into a neural network in order to
classify the text streams. We show the separative capabilities of event based

bound states. If we consider the heavier scalar and vector meson exchanges as
well as the pion exchange, some loosely bound spin-singlet S-wave states appear
while results of the spin-triplet $A_QB_Q$ system does not change
significantly, which implies the pion exchange plays an dominant role in
forming the spin-triplet molecules. Moreover, we perform an extensive coupled

such a system decays via weak interaction with a very long lifetime around
$10^{-13}\sim10^{-12}$s.

particles is initially in the ground state within hard-wall or harmonic traps,
then it expands after dropping the trap. We compute the time dependence of the
von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies and the particle fluctuations of
spatial intervals around the original trap, in the limit of a large number N of
particles. The results for these observables apply to one-dimensional gases of
impenetrable bosons as well.
  We identify different dynamical regimes at small and large times, depending
also on the initial condition, whether it is that of a hard-wall or harmonic
trap. In particular, we analytically show that the expansion from hard-wall
traps is characterized by the asymptotic small-time behavior $S \approx
(1/3)\ln(1/t)$ of the von Neumann entanglement entropy, and the relation
$S\approx \pi^2 V/3$ where V is the particle variance, which are analogous to
the equilibrium behaviors whose leading logarithms are essentially determined
by the corresponding conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$. The time
dependence of the entanglement entropy of extended regions during the expansion
from harmonic traps shows the remarkable property that it can be expressed as a
global time-dependent rescaling of the space dependence of the initial

few decades (Ilgen, 1999), and many organizations use teams for many activities
done by individuals in the past (Boyett & Conn, 1992 ; Katzenbach & Smith,
1993). In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in computer-mediated
groups because of the increases in globalization of business operations leading
to geographically dispersed executives and decision makers. However, what seems
to be lacking is some focus in terms of problem settings and corresponding
tools to support collaborative decision making. The research question of this
study deals with the dynamics of virtual teams' members. A model, suggesting
that team dynamics can increase the teams' output, is presented, and a
methodology to examine the model is illustrated. An experiment was performed,
in which subjects, who were grouped into teams, had to share information in
order to complete a task. The findings indicate that the social aspect of the
virtual team's discussion is negative than the social aspect of the
face-to-face team's discussion, and that the virtual team's output is inferior
to the face-to-face team's output. The virtual team is a common way of working
nowadays, and with the growing use of Internet applications and firms'
globalization it will expand in the future. Thus, the importance of the
theoretical and practical implementation of the research will be discussed.

Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi (1960) conjectured that the limit

and is a constant strictly between 0 and 1. \L uczak, Pittel and Wierman (1994)
proved this conjecture and Janson, \L uczak, Knuth and Pittel (1993) gave lower
and upper bounds for this probability.
  In this paper we determine the exact probability of a random graph being
planar near the critical point $M=n/2$. For each $\lambda$, we find an exact
analytic expression for
  $$ p(\lambda) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \Pr{G(n,\textstyle{n\over 2}(1+\lambda

  In particular, we obtain $p(0) \approx 0.99780$.
  We extend these results to classes of graphs closed under taking minors. As
an example, we show that the probability of $G(n,\textstyle{n\over 2})$ being
series-parallel converges to 0.98003.
  For the sake of completeness and exposition we reprove in a concise way
several basic properties we need of a random graph near the critical point.

possible explanations of this paradox: 1) galaxy groups and clusters are
surrounded by extended dark halos, the major part of the mass of which is
located outside their virial radii; 2) the considered local volume of the

complexity among Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs). However, the rate of square
COD codes decreases exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. The
Quasi-Orthogonal Design (QOD) codes emerged to provide a compromise between
rate and complexity as they offer higher rates compared to COD codes at the
expense of an increase of decoding complexity through partially relaxing the
orthogonality conditions. The QOD codes were then generalized with the so
called g-symbol and g-group decodable STBCs where the number of orthogonal
groups of symbols is no longer restricted to two as in the QOD case. However,
the adopted approach for the construction of such codes is based on sufficient
but not necessary conditions which may limit the achievable rates for any
number of orthogonal groups. In this paper, we limit ourselves to the case of
Unitary Weight (UW)-g-group decodable STBCs for 2^a transmit antennas where the
weight matrices are required to be single thread matrices with non-zero entries
in {1,-1,j,-j} and address the problem of finding the highest achievable rate
for any number of orthogonal groups. This special type of weight matrices
guarantees full symbol-wise diversity and subsumes a wide range of existing
codes in the literature. We show that in this case an exhaustive search can be
applied to find the maximum achievable rates for UW-g-group decodable STBCs
with g>1. For this purpose, we extend our previously proposed approach for
constructing UW-2-group decodable STBCs based on necessary and sufficient
conditions to the case of UW-g-group decodable STBCs in a recursive manner.

of graphene flakes consisting of 50 - 400 atoms with and without Ni clusters
attached. Free fullerenes, fullerenes with Ni clusters attached from outside
and fullerenes encapsulating Ni clusters (Ni endofullerenes) are observed to
form in the presence of Ni clusters consisting of 5 - 80 atoms. Moreover, a new
type of heterofullerenes with a patch made of a Ni cluster is found to form as
an intermediate structure during the transformation. The Ni clusters are shown
to reduce the activation energy for the graphene-fullerene transformation from
4.0 eV to 1.5 - 1.9 eV, providing the decrease of the minimal temperature at
which such a transformation can be observed experimentally from about 1400 K
for free graphene flakes to about 700 - 800 K. While the transformation of free
graphene flakes is found to occur through formation of chains of
two-coordinated carbon atoms at the flake edges, the mechanism of the

transfer of carbon atoms from the graphene flake to the Ni cluster and back.
The way of controlled synthesis of endofullerenes with a transition metal

his theory of immobile ether and electrons. This derivation did not explicitly
involve electromagnetic theory at all. According to the 1922 Kyoto lecture
notes, before 1905 Einstein tried to discuss Fizeau's experiment ""as originally
discussed by Lorentz"" (in 1895). At this time he was still under the impression
that the ordinary Newtonian law of addition of velocities was unproblematic. In
1907 Max Laue showed that the Fresnel dragging coefficient would follow from a
straightforward application of the relativistic addition theorem of velocities.
This derivation is mathematically equivalent to Lorentz's derivation of 1895.
From 1907 onwards Einstein adopted Laue's derivation. When Robert Shankland
asked Einstein how he had learned of the Michelson-Morley experiment, Einstein
told him that he had become aware of it through the writings of Lorentz, but
only after 1905 had it come to his attention. ""Otherwise"", he said, ""I would
have mentioned it in my paper"". He continued to say that the experimental
results which had influenced him most were stellar aberration and Fizeau's
water tube experiment. ""They were enough"". Indeed the famous Michelson-Morley
experiment is not mentioned in the 1905 relativity paper; but curiously
Einstein did not mention Fizeau's experimental result either, and this is
puzzling in light of the importance of the experiment in Einstein's pathway to
his theory. In this paper I try to discuss this question.

overtaking a blast wave on the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics of the
projectile is hardly affected by the projectile configurations. However, it is
noticed that the projectile configurations do affect the unsteady flow

considerable variation from that of the cylindrical projectile. The projectile
aerodynamic characteristics, when it interacts with the secondary shock wave,
are analyzed in detail. It is also observed that the change in the
characteristics of the secondary shock wave during the interaction is different
for different projectile configurations. Both inviscid and viscous simulations
were done to study the projectile aerodynamics. It is found that the effect of

and to arbitrary initial angular velocity. In the paper a parametrization of
the rotation by three complex numbers is used. In particular, the rows of the
rotation matrix are seen as elements of the unit sphere and projected, by
stereographic projection, onto points on the complex plane. In this
representation, the kinematic differential equation reduces to an equation of
Riccati type, which is solved through appropriate choices of substitutions,
thereby yielding an analytic solution in terms of confluent hypergeometric
functions. The rotation matrix is recovered from the three complex rotation
variables by inverse stereographic map. The results of a numerical experiment
confirming the exactness of the analytic solution are reported. The newly found
analytic solution is valid for any motion time length and rotation amplitude.
The present paper adds a further element to the small set of special cases for
which an exact solution of the rotational motion of a rigid body exists.

magnetic fields give rise to existence of temperature fluctuations in stellar

time and surface averaged radiation fluxes from these objects. These fluxes
depend on both the mean temperature and averaged temperature fluctuations. The
usual photosphere models do not take into account the temperature fluctuations
and use only the distribution of the mean temperature into surface layers of
stars. We investigate how the temperature fluctuations change the spectra in
continuum assuming that the degree of fluctuations (the ratio of mean
temperature fluctuation to the mean temperature) is small. We suggest the
procedure of calculation of continuum spectra, which takes into account the
temperature fluctuations. As a first step one uses the usual model of a
photosphere without fluctuations. The observed spectrum is presented as a part
depending on mean temperature and the additional part proportional to quadratic
value of fluctuation degree. It is shown that for some forms of absorption
factor the additional part in Wien's region of spectrum can be evaluated
directly from observed spectrum. This part depends on the first and second
wavelength derivatives, which can be calculated numerically from the observed
spectrum. Our estimates show that the temperature dependence of absorption
factors is very important by calculation of continuum spectra corrections. As
the examples we present the estimates for a few stars from Pulkovo

~90(+/-10) km s^{-1}. The expansion timescale of the outflow is 3.3-6.8 Myr,
and the molecular gas mass flow rate is 4.1-8.5 M_sun yr^{-1}. It requires
mechanical energy of (1.8-2.8)x10^{54} erg to create this sub-kpc scale

outflow, we compare the physical properties between the molecular outflow
observed from our NMA CO(1-0) data and the plasma gas from the soft X-ray
emission of the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) archival data. We found that
the distribution between the molecular outflow and the strong plasma outflow
seems to be in a similar region. In this region, the ram pressure and the
thermal pressure of the plasma outflow are 10^{-(8-10)} dyne cm^{-2}, and the
thermal pressure of molecular outflow is 10^{-(11-13)} dyne cm^{-2}. This
implies the molecular outflow is still expanding outward. The molecular gas
consumption timescale is estimated as 17-27 Myr, and the total starburst
timescale is 20-34 Myr. The evolutionary parameter is 0.11-0.25, suggesting

rigid body having two equal principal moments of inertia and subjected to an
external torque which is constant in magnitude. In particular, the solutions
are obtained for the following cases: (1) Torque parallel to the symmetry axis
and arbitrary initial angular velocity; (2) Torque perpendicular to the
symmetry axis and such that the torque is rotating at a constant rate about the
symmetry axis, and arbitrary initial angular velocity; (3) Torque and initial
angular velocity perpendicular to the symmetry axis, with the torque being
fixed with the body. In addition to the solutions for these three forced cases,
an original solution is introduced for the case of torque-free motion, which is
simpler than the classical solution as regards its derivation and uses the
rotation matrix in order to describe the body orientation. This paper builds
upon the recently discovered exact solution for the motion of a rigid body with
a spherical ellipsoid of inertia. In particular, by following Hestenes' theory,
the rotational motion of an axially symmetric rigid body is seen at any instant
in time as the combination of the motion of a ""virtual"" spherical body with
respect to the inertial frame and the motion of the axially symmetric body with
respect to this ""virtual"" body. The kinematic solutions are presented in terms
of the rotation matrix. The newly found exact analytic solutions are valid for
any motion time length and rotation amplitude. The present paper adds further
elements to the small set of special cases for which an exact solution of the
rotational motion of a rigid body exists.

energy dependent and that it decreases as a power-law function with increasing
photon energy. In this work we have investigated the relation between the
energy dependence of pulse and the so-called Band spectrum by using a sample
including 51 well-separated fast rise and exponential decay long-duration GRB
pulses observed by BATSE (Burst and Transient Source Experiment on the Compton
Gamma Ray Observatory). We first decompose these pulses into rise, and decay
phases and find the rise widths, and the decay widths also behavior as a
power-law function with photon energy. Then we investigate statistically the
relations between the three power-law indices of the rise, decay and total
width of pulse (denoted as $\delta_r$, $\delta_d$ and $\delta_w$, respectively)
and the three Band spectral parameters, high-energy index ($\alpha$),
low-energy index ($\beta$) and peak energy ($E_p$). It is found that
(1)$\alpha$ is strongly correlated with $\delta_w$ and $\delta_d$ but seems
uncorrelated with $\delta_r$; (2)$\beta$ is weakly correlated with the three
power-law indices and (3)$E_p$ does not show evident correlations with the
three power-law indices. We further investigate the origin of $\delta_d-\alpha$
and $\delta_w-\alpha$. We show that the curvature effect and the intrinsic Band
spectrum could naturally lead to the energy dependence of GRB pulse width and
also the $\delta_d-\alpha$ and $\delta_w-\alpha$ correlations. Our results
would hold so long as the shell emitting gamma rays has a curve surface and the
intrinsic spectrum is a Band spectrum or broken power law. The strong
$\delta_d-\alpha$ correlation and inapparent correlations between $\delta_r$
and three Band spectral parameters also suggest that the rise and decay phases
of GRB pulses have different origins.

exponential law may additionally apply. There is an ""inheritance of

rates (SFR~20 M_sun/yr; Himiko at z=6.6 and IOK-1 at z=7.0) and a Gamma Ray
Burst (GRB) host galaxy (GRB 090423 at z~8.2). Based on our 3 sigma rest-frame
FIR continuum limits, previous (rest-frame) UV continuum measurements and
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we rule out SED shapes similar to
highly obscured galaxies (e.g. Arp220, M82) and less extreme dust-rich nearby
spiral galaxies (e.g. M51) for the LAEs. Conservatively assuming a SED shape
typical of local spiral galaxies we derive upper limits for the FIR-based star
formation rates (SFRs) of ~70 M_sun/yr, ~50 M_sun/yr and ~40 M_sun/yr for
Himiko, IOK-1 and GRB 090423, respectively. For the LAEs these limits are only
a factor ~3 higher than the published UV-based SFRs (uncorrected for
extinction). This indicates that the dust obscuration in the z>6 LAEs studied
here is lower by a factor of a few than what has recently been found in some
LAEs at lower redshift (2<z<3.5) with similar UV-based SFRs. A low obscuration
in our z>6 LAE sample is consistent with recent rest-frame UV studies of z~7

genetic algorithms with uniform crossover (UGAs). Hyperclimbing is an
intuitive, general-purpose, non-local search heuristic applicable to discrete
product spaces with rugged or stochastic cost functions. The strength of this
heuristic lie in its insusceptibility to local optima when the cost function is
deterministic, and its tolerance for noise when the cost function is
stochastic. Hyperclimbing works by decimating a search space, i.e. by
iteratively fixing the values of small numbers of variables. The hyperclimbing
hypothesis holds that UGAs work by implementing efficient hyperclimbing. Proof
of concept for this hypothesis comes from the use of a novel analytic technique
involving the exploitation of algorithmic symmetry. We have also obtained
experimental results that show that a simple tweak inspired by the
hyperclimbing hypothesis dramatically improves the performance of a UGA on
large, random instances of MAX-3SAT and the Sherrington Kirkpatrick Spin
Glasses problem.

Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) gives $|<B>|\leq 2\sqrt{2}$ or $|<B>|\leq 2$

b}-{\bf b}^{\prime})\cdot{\bf \sigma} $ depending on two different ways of
evaluation, when it is applied to a $d=4$ system of two spin-1/2 particles.
This is due to the failure of linearity, and it shows that the conventional
CHSH inequality $|<B>|\leq 2$ does not provide a reliable test of the $d=4$
local non-contextual hidden variables model. To achieve $|<B>|\leq 2$ uniquely,
one needs to impose a linearity requirement on the hidden variables model,
which in turn adds a von Neumann-type stricture. It is then shown that the
local model is converted to a factored product of two non-contextual $d=2$
hidden variables models. This factored product implies pure separable quantum
states and satisfies $|<B>|\leq 2$, but no more a proper hidden variables model
in $d=4$. The conventional CHSH inequality $|<B>|\leq 2$ thus characterizes the
pure separable quantum mechanical states but does not test the model of local
hidden variables in $d=4$, to be consistent with Gleason's theorem which
excludes non-contextual models in $d=4$. This observation is also consistent
with an application of the CHSH inequality to quantum cryptography by Ekert,
which is based on mixed separable states without referring to hidden variables.

However, the designing sequence for the diamond lattice walk depends on the

calculated the temperature-dependent specific heat for these designed sequences

that the energy scheme $(-7,-3,-1)$ is preferable to the other three for both

to address this gap by proposing a random waypoint (RWP) mobility model defined

parameters: handover rate and sojourn time. We first analyze the stochastic
properties of the proposed model and compare it to two other models: the
classical RWP mobility model and a synthetic truncated Levy walk model which is
constructed from real mobility trajectories. The comparison shows that the
proposed RWP mobility model is more appropriate for the mobility simulation in
emerging cellular networks, which have ever-smaller cells. Then we apply the
proposed model to cellular networks under both deterministic (hexagonal) and
random (Poisson) base station (BS) models. We present analytic expressions for
both handover rate and sojourn time, which have the expected property that the
handover rate is proportional to the square root of BS density. Compared to an
actual BS distribution, we find that the Poisson-Voronoi model is about as

a suitable clustering technique in order to obtain accurate information about

deposition. Fuzzy clustering techniques have high potential in this regard, as
they assign data points to more than one cluster,thereby acting as a tool to
distinguish between overlapping clusters. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is one such
clustering technique that can be applied to calorimetric data reconstruction.
However, it has a drawback: it cannot easily identify and distinguish clusters
that are not uniformly spread. A version of the FCM algorithm called dynamic
fuzzy c-means (dFCM) allows clusters to be generated and eliminated as
required, with the ability to resolve non-uniformly distributed clusters. Both
the FCM and dFCM algorithms have been studied and successfully applied to
simulated data of a sampling tungsten-silicon calorimeter. It is seen that the
FCM technique works reasonably well, and at the same time, the use of the dFCM

present a mid-infrared spectral atlas containing observations of 68 low- and
intermediate mass young stellar objects. The atlas consists of 2.5-11.6 um
low-resolution spectra obtained with the ISOPHOT-S instrument on-board the
Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) between 1996 and 1998, as well as 5.2-14.5 um
low-resolution spectra obtained with the IRS instrument on-board the Spitzer
Space Telescope between 2004 and 2007. The observations were retrieved from the
ISO and Spitzer archives and were post-processed interactively by our own
routines. For those 47 objects where multi-epoch spectra were available, we
analyze mid-infrared spectral variability on annual and/or decadal timescales.
We identify 37 variable candidate sources. Many stars show
wavelength-independent flux changes, possibly due to variable accretion rate.
In several systems, all exhibiting 10 um silicate emission, the variability of
the 6-8 um continuum and the silicate feature exhibit different amplitudes. A
possible explanation is variable shadowing of the silicate emitting region by
an inner disk structure of changing height or extra silicate emission from dust
clouds in the disk atmosphere. Our results suggest that mid-infrared
variability, in particular the wavelength-dependent changes, are more
ubiquitous than was known before. Interpreting this variability is a new
possibility to explore the structure of the disk and its dynamical processes.

Fr\'echet differentiable non--linear functional of the solution. We further
improve the performance of the multilevel estimator by introducing level

experienced time delay when passing through small apertures is different. In
the case of a small slit (or a circular aperture), we report a significantly
stronger dispersion for the TE (or azimuthal) mode as compared to that for the
TM (or radial) mode, creating a noticeable time delay between the two
orthogonal polarization states, even for very thin apertures. The birefringent
effect of small apertures is caused by waveguide mode dispersion. In essence,
the propagation constant of the excited modes varies with wavelength
differently for othogonal polarization states: it increases with the incoming
wavelength for TE (or azimuthal) and remains constant for TM (or radial) mode.
A fundamental understanding of this phenomenon helps to explain, for example,
the use of small apertures as wave plates. Furthermore, this effect can be
exploited by tailoring the width and thickness of the aperture to obtain the
desired pulse-shape and delay.

after the touchdown point, the blackbody radius increases again quickly after
about 1 second, and from then on the radius decreases slightly or it remains
more or less constant. In the other 52 PRE bursts, after touchdown, the radius
of the blackbody stays more or less constant for $\sim 2 - 8$ seconds, and
after that it increases slowly. Interestingly, those PRE bursts in which the
blackbody radius remains more or less constant for $\simmore 2$ seconds show
coherent oscillations in the tail of the burst, whereas those PRE bursts in
which the blackbody radius changes rapidly after touchdown show no coherent
oscillations in the tail of the burst. We found that the distribution of
durations of the post touchdown phase between these two groups of PRE bursts is
significantly different; the Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability that the two groups
of PRE bursts come from the same parent populations is only $3.5 \times

tail of X-ray bursts is associated with a systematic behaviour of the spectral

predictions of models that associate the oscillations in the tail of X-ray
bursts with the propagation of a cooling wake in the material on the
neutron-star surface during the decay of the bursts.

been proposed in the literature, including some PTAS. However, since the
proposal of a linear-time 5-approximation algorithm in 1995, the lack of

attention. We introduce a linear-time O(n+m) approximation algorithm that takes
the usual adjacency representation of the graph as input and outputs a
44/9-approximation. This approximation factor is also attained by a second
algorithm, which takes the geometric representation of the graph as input and
runs in O(n log n) time regardless of the number of edges. Additionally, we
propose a 43/9-approximation which can be obtained in O(n^2 m) time given only
the graph's adjacency representation. It is noteworthy that the dominating sets
obtained by our algorithms are also independent sets.

different techniques within the framework of an important multiscale approach
known as the equation free method (EFM), which ""bridges the multiscale gap"" by
building microscopic configurations using macroscopic-level information only.
We hereby considered two simple reactive processes on a one-dimensional
lattice, the simplicity of which allowed for an in-depth understanding of the
parameters controlling the efficiency of this approach. We demonstrate in
particular that it is not enough to base the EFM on the time evolution of the
average concentrations of particles on the lattice, but that the time evolution
of clusters of particles has to be included as well. We also show how important
it is for the accuracy of this method to carefully choose the procedure with
which microscopic states are constructed, starting from the measured
macroscopic quantities. As we also demonstrate that some errors cannot be
corrected by increasing the number of observed macroscopic variables, this work
points towards which procedures should be used in order to generate efficient

sources in approximately 5000 deg^2 in the direction of Orion. We examine the
astrophysical properties of a sub-sample of ~100 optical counterparts, using
optical spectroscopy. This sub-sample is used to investigate the space density
of the RASS young star candidates by comparing X-ray number counts with
Galactic model predictions. We characterize the observed sub-sample in terms of
spectral type, lithium content, radial and rotational velocities, as well as
iron abundance. A population synthesis model is then applied to analyze the
stellar content of the RASS in the studied area. We find that stars associated
with the Orion star-forming region do show a high lithium content. A population
of late-type stars with lithium equivalent widths larger than Pleiades stars of
the same spectral type (hence younger than ~70-100 Myr) is found widely spread
over the studied area. Two new young stellar aggregates, namely ""X-ray Clump
0534+22"" (age~2-10 Myr) and ""X-ray Clump 0430-08"" (age~2-20 Myr), are also
identified. The spectroscopic follow-up and comparison with Galactic model
predictions reveal that the X-ray selected stellar population in the direction
of Orion is characterized by three distinct components, namely the clustered,
the young dispersed, and the widespread field populations. The clustered
population is mainly associated with regions of recent or ongoing star
formation and correlates spatially with molecular clouds. The dispersed young
population follows a broad lane apparently coinciding spatially with the Gould
Belt, while the widespread population consists primarily of active field stars
older than 100 Myr. We expect the ""bi-dimensional"" picture emerging from this
study to grow in depth as soon as the distance and the kinematics of the
studied sources will become available from the future Gaia mission.

combined with three archival data sets from as early as 1999 December, provide
a baseline of 3886 days (more than 10 1/2 years) to perform the measurement.
Correlating the four positions of RX J0822-4300 measured in each data set
implies a projected proper motion of mu 71 \pm 12 masy. For a distance of 2 kpc
this proper motion is equivalent to a recoil velocity of 672 \pm 115 km/s. The
position angle is found to be 244 \pm 11 degrees. Both the magnitude and
direction of the proper motion are in agreement with RX J0822-4300 originating

age of (5.2 \pm 1.0) 10^3 yrs for RX J0822-4300. The age inferred from the
neutron star proper motion and filament motions can be considered as two
independent measurements of the same quantity. They average to 4450 \pm 750 yrs

SMT problems over the real numbers, with the aim of handling a wide range of
nonlinear functions including transcendental functions and solutions of
Lipschitz-continuous ODEs. Given an SMT problem \varphi and a positive rational
number \delta, a \delta-complete decision procedure determines either that
\varphi is unsatisfiable, or that the ""\delta-weakening"" of \varphi is
satisfiable. Here, the \delta-weakening of \varphi is a variant of \varphi that
allows \delta-bounded numerical perturbations on \varphi. We prove the
existence of \delta-complete decision procedures for bounded SMT over reals
with functions mentioned above. For functions in Type 2 complexity class C,
under mild assumptions, the bounded \delta-SMT problem is in NP^C.
\delta-Complete decision procedures can exploit scalable numerical methods for
handling nonlinearity, and we propose to use this notion as an ideal
requirement for numerically-driven decision procedures. As a concrete example,
we formally analyze the DPLL<ICP> framework, which integrates Interval
Constraint Propagation (ICP) in DPLL(T), and establish necessary and sufficient
conditions for its \delta-completeness. We discuss practical applications of

was then identified by the missing-mass peak and the production threshold
determined. The individual beam momenta were fixed with a relative precision of
3 x 10^-5 for values around 3 GeV/c by using a polarized deuteron beam and
inducing an artificial depolarizing spin resonance, which occurs at a
well-defined frequency. The final-state momenta in the two-body d+p -> 3He+eta

ellipse with the forward detection system of the ANKE spectrometer. Final
alignment of the spectrometer for this high precision experiment was achieved
through a comprehensive study of the 3He final-state momenta as a function of
the center-of-mass angles, taking advantage of the full geometrical acceptance.
The value obtained for the mass, m(eta)=(547.873 +- 0.005(stat) +- 0.027(syst))

distributed across multiple nodes with minimal (expensive) communication. Prior
work (Daume III et al., 2012) proposes a general model that bounds the
communication required for learning classifiers while allowing for $\eps$
training error on linearly separable data adversarially distributed across
nodes.
  In this work, we develop key improvements and extensions to this basic model.
Our first result is a two-party multiplicative-weight-update based protocol
that uses $O(d^2 \log{1/\eps})$ words of communication to classify distributed
data in arbitrary dimension $d$, $\eps$-optimally. This readily extends to
classification over $k$ nodes with $O(kd^2 \log{1/\eps})$ words of
communication. Our proposed protocol is simple to implement and is considerably
more efficient than baselines compared, as demonstrated by our empirical
results.
  In addition, we illustrate general algorithm design paradigms for doing
efficient learning over distributed data. We show how to solve
fixed-dimensional and high dimensional linear programming efficiently in a
distributed setting where constraints may be distributed across nodes. Since
many learning problems can be viewed as convex optimization problems where
constraints are generated by individual points, this models many typical
distributed learning scenarios. Our techniques make use of a novel connection
from multipass streaming, as well as adapting the multiplicative-weight-update
framework more generally to a distributed setting. As a consequence, our
methods extend to the wide range of problems solvable using these techniques.

Earth-sized planet to be undergoing plate tectonics. Generally, viscosity and
thermal conductivity increase with pressure while thermal expansivity
decreases, resulting in lower convective vigor in the deep mantle. According to
conventional thinking, this might result in no convection in a super-Earth's
deep mantle. Here we evaluate this. First, we here extend the density
functional theory (DFT) calculations of post-perovskite activation enthalpy of
to a pressure of 1 TPa. The activation volume for diffusion creep becomes very
low at very high pressure, but nevertheless for the largest super-Earths the
viscosity along an adiabat may approach 1030 Pa s in the deep mantle. Second,
we use these calculated values in numerical simulations of mantle convection
and lithosphere dynamics of planets with up to ten Earth masses. The models
assume a compressible mantle including depth-dependence of material properties
and plastic yielding induced plate tectonics. Results confirm the likelihood of
plate tectonics and show a novel self-regulation of deep mantle temperature.
The deep mantle is not adiabatic; instead internal heating raises the
temperature until the viscosity is low enough to facilitate convective loss of
the radiogenic heat, which results in a super-adiabatic temperature profile and
a viscosity increase with depth of no more than ~3 orders of magnitude,
regardless of the viscosity increase that is calculated for an adiabat.
Convection in large super-Earths is characterised by large upwellings and
small, time-dependent downwellings. If a super-Earth was extremely hot/molten
after its formation, it is thus likely that even after billions of years its
deep interior is still extremely hot and possibly substantially molten with a
""super basal magma ocean"" - a larger version of (Labrosse et al., 2007).

the waterfall regime, provided kappa << M^2/M_P^2, where kappa is the
superpotential coupling, M the scale of symmetry breaking and M_P the reduced

larger than N_e\approx60 can occur in the waterfall regime and the scalar
spectral index is then given by the expression found by Kodama et.al.
n_s=1-4/N_e. This value may be increased up to unity, if only about N_e e-folds
occur during the waterfall regime, such that the largest observable scale
leaves the horizon close to the critical point of hybrid inflation, what can be
achieved for kappa\approx10^(-13) and M\approx5x10^(12) GeV in F-term
inflation. Imposing the normalization of the power spectrum leads to a lower

comparison of various series expansions and numerical integrations. In
particular, we study the analyticity conditions required because of the
presence of fixed singularities in the equation, and we develop an expansion of

scale $l^*\sim 1/\omega^*$ characterizes the effect of pinning boundaries on
elasticity. We discuss the implications of our findings for suspensions flows,
and the correspondence between floppy materials and amorphous solids near
unjamming, where $l_c$ and $l^*$ have also been identified but where their
roles are not fully understood.

  Human Security with State Security",,"Human Security Perspectives 1, 2012 (1):38--66",,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent reports reveal that violent extremists are trying to obtain insider
positions that may increase the impact of any attack on critical infrastructure
and could potentially endanger state services, people's lives and even
democracy. It is of utmost importance to be able to adopt extreme security
measures in certain high-risk situations in order to secure critical
infrastructure and thus lower the level of terrorist threats while preserving
the rights of citizens. To counter these threats, our research is aiming for
extreme measures to analyse and evaluate human threats related assessment
methods for employee screening and evaluations using cognitive analysis
technology, in particular functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The
development of fMRI has led some researchers to conclude that this technology
has forensic potential and may be useful in investing personality traits,
mental illness, psychopathology, racial prejudice and religious extremism.
However, critics claim that this technology may present many new human rights
and ethical dilemmas and could result in potentially disastrous outcomes. The
main thrust of the research is to counter above concerns and harmful
consequences by presenting a set of ethical and professional guidelines that
will substantially reduce the risk of unethical use of this technology. The
significance of this research is to ensure the limits of the
state/organisation's right to peer into an individual's thought process with
and without consent, to define the parameters of a person's right to ensure
that fMRI scans do not pose more than an appropriate threat to cognitive
liberty, and the proper use of such information in civil, forensic and security
settings.

interacting quantum systems with minimal back action. Joint weak measurements
of single-particle operators with pointer states characterized by a

about quantum correlations which can be of relevance for quantum information
applications. Here we demonstrate that by employing two-dimensional pointer
states endowed with orbital angular momentum (OAM), it is possible to extract
weak values of the higher order moments of single-particle operators, an
inaccessible quantity with Gaussian pointer states only. We provide a specific
example that illustrates the advantages of our method both, in terms of signal
enhancement, and information retrieval.

perpendicular to the layers vanishes in the thermodynamic limit while the

campaign of high-frequency SiO maser emission toward evolved stars obtained
with the APEX telescope, which also serves as a precursor of ALMA images of the

in the extended molecular atmosphere may be the physical reason for observed
deviations from point symmetry of atmospheric molecular layers, and for the
observed erratic variability of high-frequency SiO maser emission

to current accelerating phase with viscous fluid and time dependent
cosmological constant $(\Lambda)$ as source of matter in Bianchi-V space-time.
To study the transit behaviour of universe, we have assumed the scale factor as
increasing function of time which generates a time dependent deceleration
parameter (DP). The study reveals that the cosmological term does not change
its fundamental nature for $\xi$ = constant and $\xi=\xi(t)$, where $\xi$ is
the coefficient of bulk viscosity. The $\Lambda(t)$ is found to be positive and
is decreasing function of time. The same is observed by recent supernovae
observations. The physical behaviour of universe has been discussed in detail.

charged point particle dynamics using the developed field theory concepts.
There is also described a new approach to the classical Maxwell theory based on
the derived and newly interpreted basic equations making use of the vacuum
field theory approach. In particular, there are obtained the main classical
special relativity theory relations and their new explanations. The well known
Feynman approach to Maxwell electromagnetic equations and the Lorentz type
force derivation is also discussed in detail. A related charged point particle
dynamics and a hadronic string model analysis is also presented. We also
revisited and reanalyzed the classical Lorentz force expression in arbitrary
non-inertial reference frames and present some new interpretations of the
relations between special relativity theory and its quantum mechanical aspects.
Some results related with the charge particle radiation problem and the
magnetic potential topological aspects are discussed. The electromagnetic
Dirac-Fock-Podolsky problem of the Maxwell and Yang-Mills type dynamical
systems is analyzed within the classical Dirac-Marsden-Weinstein symplectic
reduction theory. The problem of constructing Fock type representations and
retrieving their creation-annihilation operator structure is analyzed. An
application of the suitable current algebra representation to describing the
non-relativistic Aharonov-Bohm paradox is presented. The current algebra
coherent functional representations are constructed and their importance
subject to the linearization problem of nonlinear dynamical systems in Hilbert
spaces is demonstrated.
