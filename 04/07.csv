complexity are also lower bounds for the information complexity. In particular,
we define a relaxed version of the partition bound of Jain and Klauck and prove
that it lower bounds the information complexity of any function. Our relaxed
partition bound subsumes all norm based methods (e.g. the factorization norm
method) and rectangle-based methods (e.g. the rectangle/corruption bound, the
smooth rectangle bound, and the discrepancy bound), except the partition bound.
Our result uses a new connection between rectangles and zero-communication
protocols where the players can either output a value or abort. We prove the
following compression lemma: given a protocol for a function f with information
complexity I, one can construct a zero-communication protocol that has
non-abort probability at least 2^{-O(I)} and that computes f correctly with
high probability conditioned on not aborting. Then, we show how such a
zero-communication protocol relates to the relaxed partition bound. We use our
main theorem to resolve three of the open questions raised by Braverman. First,
we show that the information complexity of the Vector in Subspace Problem is
{\Omega}(n^{1/3}), which, in turn, implies that there exists an exponential
separation between quantum communication complexity and classical information
complexity. Moreover, we provide an {\Omega}(n) lower bound on the information
complexity of the Gap Hamming Distance Problem.

Q-factors for graphene with intrinsic grain boundaries are 1-2 orders of

Q-factor degradation is strongly influenced by both the symmetry and structure

unstable manifolds intersect transversally, we consider several tools and
techniques to detect trajectories with prescribed itineraries: the scattering
map, the transition map, the method of correctly aligned windows, and the
shadowing lemma. We provide an user's guide on how to apply these tools and
techniques to detect unstable orbits in Hamiltonian systems. This consists in
the following steps: (i) computation of the scattering map and of the
transition map for a flow, (ii) reduction to the scattering map and to the
transition map, respectively, for the return map to some surface of section,
(iii) construction of sequences of windows within the surface of section, with
the successive pairs of windows correctly aligned, alternately, under the
transition map, and under some power of the inner map, (iv) detection of
trajectories which follow closely those windows. We illustrate this strategy
with two models: the large gap problem for nearly integrable Hamiltonian
systems, and the the spatial circular restricted three-body problem.

method, we study the effect of MDDI on the statics and dynamics of atomic BECs

previously observed MDDI effects in $^{52}$Cr with excellent agreement, and
predict new effects that should be promising to observe experimentally. A

simplicity of expression and ease of interpretation. Those same applications
attract widespread criticism by dropping the second component of evolutionary

nothing to do with the Price equation itself, which is simply a mathematical
equivalence relation for total evolutionary change expressed in an alternative

relative valuation of abstract versus concrete analyses. The Price equation's

the generalized (gravitational) uncertainty principle (GUP). This form of GUP
is consistent with various theories of quantum gravity such as string theory,
loop quantum gravity, and black-hole physics and implies a minimal measurable
length. Using a recently proposed formally self-adjoint representation, we find
the GUP-corrected Hamiltonian as a generator of the generalized Heisenberg
algebra. Then following Klauder's approach, we construct exact coherent states
and obtain the corresponding normalization coefficients, weight functions, and
probability distributions. We find the entropy of the system and show that it
decreases in the presence of the minimal length. These results could shed light
on possible detectable Planck-scale effects within recent experimental tests.

Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a common quantum field initially in the
Minkowski vacuum. An unknown coherent state of an Unruh-DeWitt detector is
teleported from one inertial agent (Alice) to an almost uniformly accelerated
agent (Rob, for relativistic motion), using a detector pair initially entangled
and shared by these two agents. The averaged physical fidelity of quantum
teleportation, which is independent of the observer's frame, always drops below
the best fidelity value from classical teleportation before the detector pair
becomes disentangled with the measure of entanglement evaluated around the
future lightcone of the joint measurement event by Alice. The distortion of the
quantum state of the entangled detector pair from the initial state can
suppress the fidelity significantly even when the detectors are still strongly
entangled around the lightcone. We point out that the dynamics of entanglement
of the detector pair observed in Minkowski frame or in quasi-Rindler frame are
not directly related to the physical fidelity of quantum teleportation in our
setup. These results are useful as a guide to making judicious choices of
states and parameter ranges and estimation of the efficiency of quantum
teleportation in relativistic quantum systems under environmental influences.

at 200 GeV in the 1<p_T<10 GeV/c transverse-momentum (p_T) range. The high-p_T
tail is well described by a power law in all cases and the powers decrease
significantly with decreasing center-of-mass energy. The change of powers is
very similar to that observed in the corresponding p+p-collision spectra. The
nuclear-modification factors (R_AA) show significant suppression and a distinct
energy dependence at moderate p_T in central collisions. At high p_T, R_AA is
similar for 62.4 and 200 GeV at all centralities.
Perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics calculations that describe R_AA well at 200
GeV, fail to describe the 39 GeV data, raising the possibility that the
relative importance of initial-state effects and soft processes increases at
lower energies. A conclusion that the region where hard processes are dominant
is reached only at higher p_T, is also supported by the x_T dependence of the
x_T-scaling power-law exponent.

Efficiently extracting user preferences from these data to determine what

well as the frequency of updates. Traditional recommender systems focus on the
interplay between users and items, but ignore contextual parameters such as
location. In this paper we take a geospatial approach to determine locational

geographic context of user preferences for items using a relational graph,
through which we are able to derive many new and state-of-the-art
recommendation algorithms, including combinations of them, requiring changes
only in the definition of the edge weights. Furthermore, we discuss several
solutions for cold-start scenarios. Finally, we conduct experiments using two
real-world datasets and provide empirical evidence that many of the proposed

for first- and second-order systems of partial differential equations. The
scheme is based on fully unstructured meshes of quadrilateral or hexahedral
elements, and it is closely related to the standard nodal DG scheme as well as
several of its variants such as the collocation-based DG spectral element
method (DGSEM) or the spectral difference (SD) method. However, our motivation
is to maximize the sparsity of the Jacobian matrices, since this directly
translates into higher performance in particular for implicit solvers, while
maintaining many of the good properties of the DG scheme. To achieve this, our
scheme is based on applying one-dimensional DG solvers along each coordinate
direction in a reference element. This reduces the number of connectivities
drastically, since the scheme only connects each node to a line of nodes along
each direction, as opposed to the standard DG method which connects all nodes
inside the element and many nodes in the neighboring ones. The resulting scheme
is similar to a collocation scheme, but it uses fully consistent integration
along each 1-D coordinate direction which results in different properties for
nonlinear problems and curved elements. Also, the scheme uses solution points
along each element face, which further reduces the number of connections with
the neighboring elements. Second-order terms are handled by an LDG-type
approach, with an upwind/downwind flux function based on a switch function at
each element face. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method and compare it to
the standard nodal DG method for problems including Poisson's equation, Euler's
equations of gas dynamics, and both the steady-state and the transient
compressible Navier-Stokes equations.

clouds within 1 kpc: Serpens, Perseus, Ophiuchus, Chamaeleon, Lupus, Taurus,
Orion, Cep OB3, and Mon R2, which combined host over 700 protostar candidates.
Our diverse cloud sample allows us to compare protostar luminosity functions in
these varied environments. We combine photometry from 2MASS J, H, and Ks bands
and Spitzer IRAC and MIPS 24 micron bands to create 1 - 24 micron spectral
energy distributions (SEDs). Using protostars from the c2d survey with
well-determined bolometric luminosities (Lbol), we derive a relationship
between Lbol, L_MIR (integrated from 1 - 24 microns), and SED slope.
Estimations of Lbol for protostar candidates are combined to create luminosity
functions for each cloud. Contamination due to edge-on disks, reddened Class II
sources, and galaxies is estimated and removed from the luminosity functions.
We find that luminosity functions for high mass star forming clouds peak near 1
Lsun and show a tail extending toward luminosities above 100 Lsun. The
luminosity functions of the low mass star forming clouds do not exhibit a
common peak, however the combined luminosity function of these regions peaks
below 1 Lsun. Finally, we examine the luminosity functions as a function of the
local surface density of YSOs. In the Orion molecular cloud, we find a
significant difference between the luminosity functions of protostars in
regions of high and low stellar density, the former of which is biased toward
more luminous sources. This may be the result of primordial mass segregation,
although this interpretation is not unique. We compare our luminosity functions
to those predicted by models and find that our observed luminosity functions
are best matched by models which invoke competitive accretion, although we do
not find strong agreement of the high mass star forming clouds with any of the
models.

equations describing the motion of particles which reproduces the results of
quantum mechanics. The system generalizes the Hamilton equations of classical
mechanics to the quantum domain, and turns into them in the classical limit
$\hbar\rightarrow 0$. The particles' motions are completely determined by the
initial conditions. In this theory, the wave function $\psi$ of quantum
mechanics is equal to the exponent of an action function, obtained by
integrating some Lagrangian function along particle trajectories, described by
equations of motion. Consequently, the equation for the logarithm of a wave
function is related to the equations of motion in the same way as the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation is related to the Hamilton equations in classical
mechanics. We demonstrate that the probability density of particles, moving
according to these equations, should be given by a standard quantum-mechanical
relation, $\rho=|\psi|^2$. The theory of quantum measurements is presented, and
the mechanism of nonlocal correlations between results of distant measurements
with entangled particles is revealed. In the last section, we extend the theory

framework that self-consistently treats reflection and thermal emission. We
find that a silicate surface on an exoplanet is spectroscopically detectable
via prominent Si-O features in the thermal emission bands of 7 - 13 \mu m and
15 - 25 \mu m. The variation of brightness temperature due to the silicate
features can be up to 20 K for an airless Earth analog, and the silicate
features are wide enough to be distinguished from atmospheric features with
relatively high-resolution spectra. The surface characterization thus provides
a method to unambiguously identify a rocky exoplanet. Furthermore,
identification of specific rocky surface types is possible with the planet's
reflectance spectrum in near-infrared broad bands. A key parameter to observe
is the difference between K band and J band geometric albedos (A_g (K)-A_g
(J)): A_g (K)-A_g (J) > 0.2 indicates that more than half of the planet's
surface has abundant mafic minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene, in other
words primary crust from a magma ocean or high-temperature lavas; A_g (K)-A_g
(J) < -0.09 indicates that more than half of the planet's surface is covered or
partially covered by water ice or hydrated silicates, implying extant or past
water on its surface. Also, surface water ice can be specifically distinguished
by an H-band geometric albedo lower than the J-band geometric albedo. The
surface features can be distinguished from possible atmospheric features with
molecule identification of atmospheric species by transmission spectroscopy. We
therefore propose that mid-infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets may detect rocky
surfaces, and near-infrared spectrophotometry may identify ultramafic surfaces,
hydrated surfaces and water ice.

derived from Spitzer IRAC observations. We specifically investigate the
efficiency of star formation as a function of circular velocity (v_circ).
Previous work found that the vertical dust structure and disk stability of
edge-on, bulgeless disk galaxies transition from diffuse dust lanes with large
scale heights and gravitationally-stable disks at v_circ < 120 km/s (M_star <~
10^10 M_sun) to narrow dust lanes with small scale heights and
gravitationally-unstable disks at v_circ > 120 km/s. We find no transition in
star formation efficiency (Sigma_SFR/Sigma_HI+H2) at v_circ = 120 km/s, or at
any other circular velocity probed by our sample (v_circ = 46 - 190 km/s).
Contrary to previous work, we find no transition in disk stability at any
circular velocity in our sample. Assuming our sample has the same dust
structure transition as the edge-on sample, our results demonstrate that scale
height differences in the cold interstellar medium of bulgeless disk galaxies
do not significantly affect the molecular fraction or star formation
efficiency. This may indicate that star formation is primarily affected by
physical processes that act on smaller scales than the dust scale height, which
lends support to local star formation models.

criterion to analyze statistical tests in this setting. A suitable model for
analysis is the high-dimensional model in which both $n$ and $m$ increase to
infinity, and $n=o(m)$. A new performance criterion based on large deviations
analysis is proposed and it generalizes the classical error exponent applicable
for large sample problems (in which $m=O(n)$). This generalized error exponent
criterion provides insights that are not available from asymptotic consistency
or central limit theorem analysis. The following results are established for
the uniform null distribution:
  (i) The best achievable probability of error $P_e$ decays as
$P_e=\exp\{-(n^2/m) J (1+o(1))\}$ for some $J>0$.
  (ii) A class of tests based on separable statistics, including the
coincidence-based test, attains the optimal generalized error exponents.
  (iii) Pearson's chi-square test has a zero generalized error exponent and
thus its probability of error is asymptotically larger than the optimal test.

learning in a cross-situational scenario. Here we present analytical results of
the performance of a simple associative learning algorithm for acquiring a
one-to-one mapping between $N$ objects and $N$ words based solely on the
co-occurrence between objects and words. In particular, a learning trial in our
learning scenario consists of the presentation of $C + 1 < N$ objects together
with a target word, which refers to one of the objects in the context. We find
that the learning times are distributed exponentially and the learning rates
are given by $\ln{[\frac{N(N-1)}{C + (N-1)^{2}}]}$ in the case the $N$ target
words are sampled randomly and by $\frac{1}{N} \ln [\frac{N-1}{C}] $ in the
case they follow a deterministic presentation sequence. This learning
performance is much superior to those exhibited by humans and more realistic
learning algorithms in cross-situational experiments. We show that introduction
of discrimination limitations using Weber's law and forgetting reduce the
performance of the associative algorithm to the human level.

addressed by multiwavelength measurements. As scatters in measured cluster
masses are often sourced by properties of or around the clusters themselves,
correlations between mass scatters are frequent and can be significant, with
consequences for errors on mass estimates obtained both directly and via
stacking. Using a high resolution 250 Mpc/h side N-body simulation, combined
with proxies for observational cluster mass measurements, we obtain mass
scatter correlations and covariances for 243 individual clusters along ~96
lines of sight each, both separately and together. Many of these scatters are
quite large and highly correlated. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to
characterize scatter trends and variations between clusters. PCA identifies
combinations of scatters, or variations more generally, which are uncorrelated
or non-covariant. The PCA combination of mass measurement techniques which
dominates the mass scatter is similar for many clusters, and this combination
is often present in a large amount when viewing the cluster along its long
axis. We also correlate cluster mass scatter, environmental and intrinsic
properties, and use PCA to find shared trends between these. For example, if
the average measured richness, velocity dispersion and Compton decrement mass
for a cluster along many lines of sight are high relative to its true mass, in
our simulation the cluster's mass measurement scatters around this average are
also high, its sphericity is high, and its triaxiality is low.
  Our analysis is based upon estimated mass distributions for fixed true mass.
Extensions to observational data would require further calibration from
numerical simulations, tuned to specific observational survey selection
functions and systematics.

increases in the star-formation rate density associated with spiral-arm

the increase in the inner Sagittarius arm is due to an enhancement in the
simple star-formation efficiency, i.e. in the number of RMS sources per unit
molecular gas mass. In the inner Perseus arm, the residual increase is due to a
higher than average mean source luminosity, which implies a top-heavy IMF, and
this is entirely due to the presence, in the GRS region, of the W49
star-forming complex, which appears to be exceptional in its nature. The
results also suggest that there is little or no increase in the star-formation
efficiency on kiloparsec scales in the Scutum tangent region which includes

equal regions. In one region the diffusion coefficient is twice the value of
the diffusion coefficient in the other region. Will the particle spend equal
proportions of time in the two regions in the long term? Statistical mechanics
would suggest yes, since the number of accessible states in each region is
presumably the same. However, another line of reasoning suggests that the
particle should spend less time in the region with faster diffusion, since it
will exit that region more quickly. We demonstrate with a simple microscopic
model system that both predictions are consistent with the information given.
Thus, specifying the diffusion rate as a function of position is not enough to
characterize the behaviour of a system, even assuming the absence of external
forces. We propose an alternative framework for modelling diffusive dynamics in
which both the diffusion rate and equilibrium probability density for the
position of the particle are specified by the modeller. We introduce a
numerical method for simulating dynamics in our framework that samples from the
equilibrium probability density exactly and is suitable for discontinuous
diffusion coefficients.

and the magnetization function. A numerical method, based on this formulation,
makes it possible to accurately compute all variables of interest, including
the electric field, for any value of the power in the power law current-voltage
relation characterizing the superconducting material. For high power values we
obtain a good approximation to the critical state model solution. Numerical
simulation results are presented for simply and multiply connected films, and
also for an inhomogeneous film.

  Interaction and Dust Formation","Accepted to MNRAS on May 16 2012",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21325.x",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report late-time spectroscopic observations of the Type IIn SN 1998S,
taken 14 years after explosion using the Large Binocular Telescope. The optical
spectrum exhibits broad emission features of [O I], [O II], [O III], H-alpha,
H-beta, and [Fe II]. The last decade of evolution has exhibited a strengthening
of the oxygen transitions, evidence that the late-time emission is powered by
increasingly metal-rich SN ejecta crossing the reverse shock. The H-alpha
luminosity requires that SN 1998S is still interacting with dense circumstellar
material (CSM), probably produced by the strong wind of a red supergiant
progenitor at least ~1000 years before explosion. The emission lines exhibit
asymmetric blueshifted profiles, which implies that the receding hemisphere of
the SN is obscured by dust. The [O III] line, in particular, exhibits a
complete suppression of its red wing. This could be the result of the expected
wavelength dependence for dust extinction or a smaller radial distribution for
[O III]. In the latter case, the red wing of [O III] could be absorbed by core
dust, while both the blue and red wings are absorbed by dust within the cool
dense shell between the forward and reverse shocks; this interpretation could
explain why late-time [O III] emission from SNe is often weaker than models
predict. The [O I] line exhibits double-peaked structure on top of the broader
underlying profile, possibly due to emission from individual clumps of ejecta
or ring-like structures of metal-rich debris. The centroids of the peaks are
blueshifted and lack a red counterpart. However, an archival spectrum obtained
on day 1093 exhibits a third, redshifted peak, which we suspect has become
extinguished by dust that formed over the last decade. This implies that the
""missing"" red components of multi-peaked oxygen profiles observed in other SNe
might be obscured by varying degrees of dust extinction.

to dynamically select the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) at the PHY layer
for WiMAX Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) networks. The QoS information
parameter includes New Connection Blocking Probability (NCBP), Hand off
Connection Dropping Probability (HCDP) and Connection Outage Probability (COP).
In addition, a Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) based Call
Admission Control (CAC) algorithm and Queue based Scheduling algorithm are
integrated for the cross layer design. An analytical model using the Continuous
Time Markov Chain (CTMC) is developed for performance evaluation of the
algorithms under various MCS. The effect of Eb/No is observed for QoS
information parameters in order to determine its optimum range. Simulation
results show that the integrated CAC and packet Scheduling model maximizes the
bandwidth utilization and fair allocation of the system resources for all types
of MCS and guarantees the QoS to the connections.

  Diameter and Matchings","To appear in FOCS 2012",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a directed or an undirected graph with integral edge weights from
the set [-W, W], that does not contain negative weight cycles. In this paper,
we introduce a general framework for solving problems on such graphs using
matrix multiplication. The framework is based on the usage of Baur-Strassen's
theorem and of Strojohann's determinant algorithm. It allows us to give new and
simple solutions to the following problems:
  * Finding Shortest Cycles -- We give a simple \tilde{O}(Wn^{\omega}) time
algorithm for finding shortest cycles in undirected and directed graphs. For
directed graphs (and undirected graphs with non-negative weights) this matches
the time bounds obtained in 2011 by Roditty and Vassilevska-Williams. On the
other hand, no algorithm working in \tilde{O}(Wn^{\omega}) time was previously
known for undirected graphs with negative weights. Furthermore our algorithm
for a given directed or undirected graph detects whether it contains a negative
weight cycle within the same running time.
  * Computing Diameter and Radius -- We give a simple \tilde{O}(Wn^{\omega})
time algorithm for computing a diameter and radius of an undirected or directed
graphs. To the best of our knowledge no algorithm with this running time was
known for undirected graphs with negative weights.
  * Finding Minimum Weight Perfect Matchings -- We present an
\tilde{O}(Wn^{\omega}) time algorithm for finding minimum weight perfect
matchings in undirected graphs. This resolves an open problem posted by
Sankowski in 2006, who presented such an algorithm but only in the case of
bipartite graphs.
  In order to solve minimum weight perfect matching problem we develop a novel
combinatorial interpretation of the dual solution which sheds new light on this
problem. Such a combinatorial interpretation was not know previously, and is of
independent interest.

Cosmology was among the sciences that became heavily politicized and forced to

entirely differently in the Communist countries than in the West, in large
measure because of political pressure. Certain cosmological models, in
particular of the big bang type, were declared pseudo-scientific and idealistic

cosmology in the Soviet Union began to flourish. The paper examines the

sample of 16 candidate Extremely Metal-Poor (EMP) dwarf stars, extracted from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). There are two main purposes: in the first
place to verify the reliability of the metallicity estimates derived from the
SDSS spectra; in the second place to see if the abundance trends found for the
brighter nearer stars studied previously also hold for this sample of fainter,
more distant stars. Methods: We used the UVES at the VLT to obtain
high-resolution spectra of the programme stars. The abundances were determined
by an automatic analysis with the MyGIsFOS code, with the exception of lithium,
for which the abundances were determined from the measured equivalent widths of
the Li I resonance doublet. Results: All candidates are confirmed to be EMP
stars, with [Fe/H]<= -3.0. The chemical composition of the sample of stars is
similar to that of brighter and nearer samples. We measured the lithium
abundance for 12 stars and provide stringent upper limits for three other
stars, for a fourth star the upper limit is not significant, owing to the low
signal-to noise ratio of the spectrum. The ""meltdown"" of the Spite plateau is
confirmed, but some of the lowest metallicity stars of the sample lie on the
plateau. Conclusions: The concordance of the metallicities derived from
high-resolution spectra and those estimated from the SDSS spectra suggests that
the latter may be used to study the metallicity distribution of the halo. The
abundance pattern suggests that the halo was well mixed for all probed
metallicities and distances. The fact that at the lowest metallicities we find
stars on the Spite plateau suggests that the meltdown depends on at least
another parameter, besides metallicity. (abridged)

exchange of the documents will be between two parties. The protocol is based on
the verifiable and recoverable encryption of a document's key. This verifiable
and recoverable encryption of the document's key will allow one party to verify
the encrypted key. It will also ensure this party that the Semi Trusted Third
Party will be able to recover the key if the other party misbehaves. The
protocol also incorporates the concept of enforcing the honesty of one party.
The proposed protocol consists of only three messages and is more efficient
than related protocols.

differential equations (SDEs) with highly nonlinear coefficients. Our work is
motivated by the need to justify multi-level Monte Carlo simulations for
mean-reverting financial models with polynomial growth in the diffusion term.
We introduce a double implicit Milstein scheme and show that it possesses
desirable properties. It converges strongly and preserves non-negativity for a
rich family of financial models and can reproduce linear and nonlinear
stability behaviour of the underlying SDE without severe restriction on the
time step. Although the scheme is implicit, we point out examples of financial
models where an explicit formula for the solution to the scheme can be found.

includes a coupling between a compositional scalar field and a two-dimensional
vectorial order-parameter. Such a coupling yields an effective two-dimensional
microemulsion free-energy for the lipid monolayer, and its characteristic
length of compositional modulations can be considered as the origin of
finite-size domains in biological membranes. Next, we consider a coupled
bilayer composed of two modulated monolayers, and discuss the static and
dynamic properties of concentration fluctuations above the transition
temperature. We also investigate the micro-phase separation below the
transition temperature, and compare the micro-phase separated structures with
statics and dynamics of concentration fluctuations above the transition.

information technology services are built. They provide the capabilities of
centralized repository for storage, management, networking and dissemination of
data. With the rapid increase in the capacity and size of data centers, there
is a continuous increase in the demand for energy consumption. These data
centers not only consume a tremendous amount of energy but are riddled with IT
inefficiencies. Data center are plagued with thousands of servers as major
components. These servers consume huge energy without performing useful work.
In an average server environment, 30% of the servers are ""dead"" only consuming
energy, without being properly utilized. This paper proposes a five step model
using an emerging technology called virtualization to achieve energy efficient
data centers. The proposed model helps Data Center managers to properly
implement virtualization technology in their data centers to make them green
and energy efficient so as to ensure that IT infrastructure contributes as
little as possible to the emission of greenhouse gases, and helps to regain
power and cooling capacity, recapture resilience and dramatically reducing
energy costs and total cost of ownership.

presents a leading research for the opinion holder extraction in Arabic news
independent from any lexical parsers. We investigate constructing a
comprehensive feature set to compensate the lack of parsing structural
