information by their spatio-temporal structure. An inevitable source of
correlation in finite neural networks is common presynaptic input to pairs of
neurons. Recent theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that spike
correlations in recurrent neural networks are considerably smaller than
expected based on the amount of shared presynaptic input. By means of a linear
network model and simulations of networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons,
we show that shared-input correlations are efficiently suppressed by inhibitory
feedback. To elucidate the effect of feedback, we compare the responses of the
intact recurrent network and systems where the statistics of the feedback
channel is perturbed. The suppression of spike-train correlations and
population-rate fluctuations by inhibitory feedback can be observed both in
purely inhibitory and in excitatory-inhibitory networks. The effect is fully
understood by a linear theory and becomes already apparent at the macroscopic
level of the population averaged activity. At the microscopic level,
shared-input correlations are suppressed by spike-train correlations: In purely
inhibitory networks, they are canceled by negative spike-train correlations. In
excitatory-inhibitory networks, spike-train correlations are typically
positive. Here, the suppression of input correlations is not a result of the
mere existence of correlations between excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I)
neurons, but a consequence of a particular structure of correlations among the
three possible pairings (EE, EI, II).

functional integral techniques. Based on a consideration of the relevant length
scales, we derive the universal effective low energy Hamiltonian describing
ultracold alkali atoms. We then introduce the concept of the effective action,
which generalizes the classical action principle to full quantum status and
provides an intuitive and versatile tool for practical calculations. This
framework is applied to weakly interacting degenerate bosons and fermions in
the spatial continuum. In particular, we discuss the related BEC and BCS
quantum condensation mechanisms. We then turn to the BCS-BEC crossover, which
interpolates between both phenomena, and which is realized experimentally in
the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance. For its description, we introduce the
Functional Renormalization Group approach. After a general discussion of the
method in the cold atoms context, we present a detailed and pedagogical
application to the crossover problem. This not only provides the physical
mechanism underlying this phenomenon. More generally, it also reveals how the
renormalization group can be used as a tool to capture physics at all scales,
from few-body scattering on microscopic scales, through the finite temperature
phase diagram governed by many-body length scales, up to critical phenomena
dictating long distance physics at the phase transition. The presentation aims
to equip students at the beginning PhD level with knowledge on key physical
phenomena and flexible tools for their description, and should enable to embark

many-body fermionic system in terms of its reduced density matrices (at all
orders). We provide an exhaustive study of the challenges and open problems
linked to the truncation of such hierarchy of equations to make them
practically applicable. We restrict our analysis to the coupled evolution of
the one- and two-body reduced density matrices, where higher order correlation
effects are embodied into the approximation used to close the equations. We
prove that within this approach, the number of electrons and total energy are
conserved, regardless of the employed approximation. Further, we demonstrate
that although most of the truncation schemes available in the literature give
acceptable ground state energy, when applied to describe driven electron
dynamics exhibit undesirable and unphysical behavior, e.g., violation and even
divergence in local electronic density, both in weakly- and strongly-correlated
regimes. We illustrate and analyze these problems within the few-site Hubbard
model. The model can be solved exactly and provides a unique reference for our
detailed study of electron dynamics for different values of interaction,
different initial conditions, and large set of approximations considered here.
Moreover, we study the role of compatibility between two hierarchical
equations, and positive- semidefiniteness of reduced density matrices in
instability of electron dynamics. We show that even if the used approximation
holds the compatibility, electron dynamics can still diverge when positive-
definitiveness is violated. We propose some partial solutions of such problem
and point the main paths for future work in order to make this approach
applicable for the description of the correlated electron dynamics in complex
systems.

usually regarded, from the point of view of charge transport, as imperfections.
Here we present a first study of the behavior of graphene plasmons in a strong
magnetic field that provides a different perspective. We show that the plasmon
resonance in micron size graphene disks in a strong magnetic field splits into
edge and bulk plasmon modes with opposite dispersion relations, and that the
edge plasmons at terahertz frequencies develop increasingly longer lifetimes
with increasing magnetic field, in spite of potentially more defects close to
the graphene edges. This unintuitive behavior is attributed to increasing
quasi-one dimensional field-induced confinement and the resulting suppression
of the back-scattering. Due to the linear band structure of graphene, the
splitting rate of the edge and bulk modes develops a strong doping dependence,
which differs from the behavior of traditional semiconductor two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG) systems. We also observe the appearance of a higher order
mode indicating an anharmonic confinement potential even in these well-defined
circular disks. Our work not only opens an avenue for studying the physics of
graphene edges, but also supports the great potential of graphene for tunable
terahertz magneto-optical devices.

The two types of ribbons possess remarkably different magnetic properties.
While the low temperature ferromagnet-like feature is observed in both types of
ribbons, such room temperature feature persists only in potassium-split
ribbons. The GNRs show negative exchange bias, but the CCGNRs exhibit a
'positive exchange bias'. Electron spin resonance measurements infer that the
carbon related defects may responsible for the observed magnetic behaviour in
both types of ribbons. Furthermore, proton hyperfine coupling strength has been
obtained from hyperfine sublevel correlation experiments performed on the GNRs.
Electron spin resonance provides no indications for the presence of potassium
(cluster) related signals, emphasizing the intrinsic magnetic nature of the
ribbons. Our combined experimental results may infer the coexistence of
ferromagnetic clusters with anti-ferromagnetic regions leading to disordered
magnetic phase. We discuss the origin of the observed contrast in the magnetic
behaviours of these two types of ribbons.

thermostat over previous ones is that it contains kinetic energy terms that are

follow up study to our previous investigation of star-formation in the cluster
centre, extending our analysis out to a projected cluster radius of 1.5 Mpc.
Using the Near InfraRed Imager and Spectrograph (NIRI) on Gemini North we
obtained deep H narrow-band imaging corresponding to the rest-frame wavelength
of H{\alpha} at the cluster's redshift. We identify a total of 163 potential
cluster members in both pointings, excluding stars based on their near-IR
colours derived from VLT/HAWK-I imaging. Of these 163 objects 14 are
spectroscopically confirmed cluster members, and 20% are excess line-emitters.
We find no evidence of star formation activity within a radius of 200 kpc of
the brightest cluster galaxy in the cluster core. Dust-corrected star formation
rates (SFR) of excess emitters outside this cluster quenching radius, RQ \sim
200 kpc, are on average <SFR> = 2.7 \pm 1.0 M\odot yr-1, but do not show
evidence of increasing star-formation rates toward the extreme 1.5 Mpc radius
of the cluster. No individual cluster galaxy exceeds an SFR of 6 M\odot yr-1 .
Massive galaxies (log M\ast /M\odot > 10.75) all have low specific SFRs (SSFRs,
i.e. SFR per unit stellar mass). At fixed stellar mass, galaxies in the cluster
centre have lower SSFRs than the rest of the cluster galaxies, which in turn
have lower SSFRs than field galaxies at the same redshift by a factor of a few
to 10. For the first time we can demonstrate through measurements of individual
SFRs that already at very early epochs (at an age of the Universe of \sim4.5
Gyr) the suppression of star-formation is an effect of the cluster environment
which persists at fixed galaxy stellar mass. [Erratum added after the original

optimization of power flows in tree networks. The injection region is the set
of all vectors of bus power injections that satisfy the network and operation
constraints. The geometrical object of interest is the set of Pareto-optimal
points of the injection region. If the voltage magnitudes are fixed, the
injection region of a tree network can be written as a linear transformation of
the product of two-bus injection regions, one for each line in the network.
Using this decomposition, we show that under the practical condition that the
angle difference across each line is not too large, the set of Pareto-optimal
points of the injection region remains unchanged by taking the convex hull.
Moreover, the resulting convexified optimal power flow problem can be
efficiently solved via }{ semi-definite programming or second order cone
relaxations. These results improve upon earlier works by removing the
assumptions on active power lower bounds. It is also shown that our practical
angle assumption guarantees two other properties: (i) the uniqueness of the
solution of the power flow problem, and (ii) the non-negativity of the
locational marginal prices. Partial results are presented for the case when the

used, maintaining the favorable performance guarantees: with stash size $s$ the
probability of a rehash is $O(1/n^{s+1})$, and the evaluation time is $O(s)$.
Instead of the full randomness needed for the analysis of Kirsch et al. and of
Kutzelnigg (2010) (resp. $\Theta(\log n)$-wise independence for standard cuckoo
hashing) the new approach even works with 2-wise independent hash families as
building blocks. Both construction and analysis build upon the work of
Dietzfelbinger and Woelfel (2003). The analysis, which can also be applied to
the fully random case, utilizes a graph counting argument and is much simpler

of the proof of the Lempert Theorem in the case of non-planar stronlgy linearly

presented only in proceedings of a conference with a very limited access and at
some places it was quite sketchy. We were encouraged by some colleagues to
prepare an extended version of the proof in which all doubts could be removed
and some of details of the proofs could be simplified. We hope to have done it
below. Certainly the idea of the proof belongs entirely to Lempert.
  Additional motivation for presenting the proof is the fact shown recently,
that the so-called symmetrized bidisc may be exhausted by stronlgy linearly
convex domains. On the other hand it cannot be exhausted by domains
biholomorphic to convex ones. Therefore, the equality of the Lempert function
and the Carath\'eodory distance for strongly linearly convex domains does not
follow directly from the convex case.

$D_s$=$c\bar{s}$ which couples the well-known strangeness enhancement with the
collective-flow pattern of primordially produced charm quarks. We employ a
consistent strong-coupling treatment with hydrodynamic bulk evolution and
nonperturbative $T$-matrix interactions for both heavy-quark diffusion and
hadronization in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). A large enhancement of the $D_s$
nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) at RHIC is predicted, with a remarkable
maximum of $\sim$1.5-1.8 at transverse momenta around 2 GeV/$c$. We show this
to be a direct consequence of the strong coupling of the heavy quarks to the
QGP and their hadronization via coalescence with strange quarks. We furthermore
introduce the effects of diffusion in the hadronic phase and suggest that an
increase of the $D$-meson elliptic flow compared to the $D_s$ can disentangle
the transport properties of hadronic and QGP liquids.

its syntactic monoid. Given a picture language L, such a word language measure
may be applied to each of its height fragments, so that the complexity of the
picture language is a function that maps each m to the complexity of the

bounded based on the structure of a monadic second-order formula that defines

one of the most fundamental questions in paleoclimatology, the `faint young Sun
problem'. For the early Earth, models of stellar evolution predict a solar
energy input to the climate system which is about 25% lower than today. This
would result in a completely frozen world over the first two billion years in
the history of our planet, if all other parameters controlling Earth's climate
had been the same. Yet there is ample evidence for the presence of liquid
surface water and even life in the Archean (3.8 to 2.5 billion years before
present), so some effect (or effects) must have been compensating for the faint
young Sun. A wide range of possible solutions have been suggested and explored
during the last four decades, with most studies focusing on higher
concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane or
ammonia. All of these solutions present considerable difficulties, however, so
the faint young Sun problem cannot be regarded as solved. Here I review
research on the subject, including the latest suggestions for solutions of the
faint young Sun problem and recent geochemical constraints on the composition
of Earth's early atmosphere. Furthermore, I will outline the most promising
directions for future research. In particular I would argue that both improved
geochemical constraints on the state of the Archean climate system and
numerical experiments with state-of-the-art climate models are required to
finally assess what kept the oceans on the Archean Earth from freezing over

it is also possible that the bulk configurations embeddable within the STU

(GCM) dynamical core, in conjunction with a Newtonian relaxation scheme that
relaxes to a gray, analytical solution of the radiative transfer equation, to
simulate a tidally locked, synchronously orbiting super-Earth exoplanet. This
hypothetical exoplanet is simulated under the following main assumptions: (1)
the size, mass, and orbital characteristics of GJ 1214b (Charbonneau et al.,
2009), (2) a greenhouse-gas dominated atmosphere, (3), the gas properties of
water vapor, and (4) a surface. We have performed a parameter sweep over global
mean surface pressure (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 bar) and global mean surface albedo
(0.1, 0.4, and 0.7). Given assumption (1) above, the period of rotation of this
exoplanet is 1.58 Earth-days, which we classify as the rapidly rotating regime.
Our parameter sweep differs from Heng and Vogt (2011), who performed their
study in the slowly rotating regime and using Held and Suarez (1994) thermal
forcing. This type of thermal forcing is a prescribed function, not related to
any radiative transfer, used to benchmark Earth's atmosphere. An equatorial,
westerly, superrotating jet is a robust feature in our GCM results. This
equatorial jet is westerly at all longitudes. At high latitudes, the flow is
easterly. The zonal winds do show a change with global mean surface pressure.
As global mean surface pressure increases, the speed of the equatorial jet

Galactic centre black hole candidate, Sgr A*, allow for a direct test of
contemporary accretion theory. To date, all models have assumed alignment
between the accretion disc and black hole angular momentum axes, but this is
unjustified for geometrically thick accretion flows like that onto Sgr A*.
Instead, we calculate images and spectra from a set of simulations of accretion
flows misaligned ('tilted') by 15 degrees from the black hole spin axis and
compare them with millimetre (mm) to near-infrared (NIR) observations.
Non-axisymmetric standing shocks from eccentric fluid orbits dominate the
emission, leading to a wide range of possible image morphologies. These effects
invalidate previous parameter estimates from model fitting, including estimates
of the dimensionless black hole spin, except possibly at low values of spin or
tilt. At 1.3mm, the images have crescent morphologies, and the black hole
shadow may still be accessible to future mm-VLBI observations. Shock heating
leads to high energy electrons (T > 10^12 K), which can naturally produce the
observed NIR flux, spectral index, and rapid variability ('flaring'). This NIR
emission is uncorrelated with that in the mm, which also agrees with
observations.
  These are the first models to self-consistently explain the time-variable mm
to NIR emission of Sgr A*. Predictions of the model include significant
structural changes observable with mm-VLBI on both the dynamical (hour) and
Lense-Thirring precession (day-year) timescales; and ~30-50 microarcsecond
changes in centroid position from extreme gravitational lensing events during
NIR flares, detectable with the future VLT instrument GRAVITY. If the observed
NIR emission is caused by shock heating in a tilted accretion disc, then the
Galactic centre black hole has a positive, non-zero spin parameter (a > 0).

employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of resolved stellar
kinematics from Keck/DEIMOS spectra of 5651 red giant branch stars to
disentangle M31's inner spheroid from its stellar disk. We measure the mean
velocity and dispersion of the spheroid in each of five spatial bins after
accounting for a locally cold stellar disk as well as the Giant Southern Stream
and associated tidal debris. For the first time, we detect significant spheroid
rotation (v_rot ~ 50 km/s) beyond R_proj ~ 5 kpc. The velocity dispersion
decreases from about 140 km/s at R_proj = 7 kpc to 120 km/s at R_proj = 14 kpc,
consistent to 2 sigma with existing measurements and models. We calculate the
probability that a given star is a member of the spheroid and find that the
spheroid has a significant presence throughout the spatial extent of our
sample. Lastly, we show that the flattening of the spheroid is due to velocity
anisotropy in addition to rotation. Though this suggests that the inner
spheroid of M31 more closely resembles an elliptical galaxy than a typical
spiral galaxy bulge, it should be cautioned that our measurements are much
farther out (2 - 14 r_eff) than for the comparison samples.

wireless access in indoor scenarios where conventional cellular system coverage
can be poor. Femtocell access points (FAP) are normally randomly deployed by
the end user, so only post deployment network planning is possible.
Furthermore, this uncoordinated deployment creates the potential for severe
interference to co-located femtocells, especially in dense deployments. This
paper presents a new femtocell network architecture using a generalized virtual
cluster femtocell (GVCF) paradigm, which groups together FAP, which are
allocated to the same femtocell gateway (FGW), into logical clusters. This
guarantees severely interfering and overlapping femtocells are assigned to
different clusters, and since each cluster operates on a different band of
frequencies, the corresponding virtual cluster controller only has to manage
its own FAP members, so the overall system complexity is low. The performance
of the GVCF algorithm is analysed from both a resource availability and cluster
number perspective, and a novel strategy is proposed for dynamically adapting
these to network environment changes, while upholding quality-of-service
requirements. Simulation results conclusively corroborate the superior
performance of the GVCF model in interference mitigation, particularly in high

local appearance and motion changes as a function of time. This class of
objects includes dynamic textures such as steam, fire, smoke, water, etc., as
well as articulated objects such as humans performing various actions. We model
the temporal evolution of the object's appearance/motion using a Linear
Dynamical System (LDS). We learn such models from sample videos and use them as
dynamic templates for tracking objects in novel videos. We pose the problem of
tracking a dynamic non-rigid object in the current frame as a maximum
a-posteriori estimate of the location of the object and the latent state of the
dynamical system, given the current image features and the best estimate of the
state in the previous frame. The advantage of our approach is that we can
specify a-priori the type of texture to be tracked in the scene by using
previously trained models for the dynamics of these textures. Our framework
naturally generalizes common tracking methods such as SSD and kernel-based
tracking from static templates to dynamic templates. We test our algorithm on
synthetic as well as real examples of dynamic textures and show that our simple
dynamics-based trackers perform at par if not better than the state-of-the-art.
Since our approach is general and applicable to any image feature, we also
apply it to the problem of human action tracking and build action-specific
optical flow trackers that perform better than the state-of-the-art when
tracking a human performing a particular action. Finally, since our approach is
generative, we can use a-priori trained trackers for different texture or
action classes to simultaneously track and recognize the texture or action in
the video.

intermittent, exponentially distributed angular discontinuities in the magnetic
field. In this Letter, we study whether such discontinuities can be produced by
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We detect the discontinuities by
measuring the fluctuations of the magnetic field direction, Delta theta, across
fixed spatial increments Delta x in direct numerical simulations of MHD
turbulence with an imposed uniform guide field B_0. A large region of the
probability density function (pdf) for Delta theta is found to follow an
exponential decay, proportional to exp(-Delta theta/theta_*), with
characteristic angle theta_* ~ (14 deg) (b_rms/B_0)^0.65 for a broad range of
guide-field strengths. We find that discontinuities observed in the solar wind
can be reproduced by MHD turbulence with reasonable ratios of b_rms/B_0. We
also observe an excess of small angular discontinuities when Delta x becomes
small, possibly indicating an increasing statistical significance of
dissipation-scale structures. The structure of the pdf in this case closely
resembles the two-population pdf seen in the solar wind. We thus propose that
strong discontinuities are associated with inertial-range MHD turbulence, while
weak discontinuities emerge from near-dissipation-range turbulence. In
addition, we find that the structure functions of the magnetic field direction
exhibit anomalous scaling exponents, which indicates the existence of
intermittent structures.

light curves of the images of RX J1131-1231. We detect significant microlensing
in the X-ray light-curves of images A and D, and energy-dependent microlensing
of image D. The magnification of the soft band appears to be larger than that
in the hard band by a factor of ~ 1.3 when image D becomes more magnified. This
can be explained by the difference between a compact, softer-spectrum corona
that is producing a more extended, harder spectrum reflection component off the
disk. This is supported by the evolution of the fluorescent iron line in image
D over three consecutive time-averaged phases of the light curve. In the first
period, a Fe line at E = 6.36(-0.16,+0.13) keV is detected (at > 99%
confidence). In the second period, two Fe lines are detected, one at E =
5.47(-0.08,+0.06) keV (detected at > 99% confidence) and another at E =

event is consistent with the line distortion expected when a caustic passes
over the inner disk where the shape of the fluorescent Fe line is distorted by
General Relativistic and Doppler effects.

study the X-ray properties of the resulting samples. We build on a sample of
galaxies selected at 1.4 GHz in the VLA-COSMOS survey, classified by Smolcic et
al. (2008) according to their optical colours and observed with Chandra. A
similarly selected control sample of AGN is also used for comparison. We review
some X-ray based classification criteria and check how they affect the sample
composition. The efficiency of the classification scheme devised by Smolcic et
al. (2008) is such that ~30% of composite/misclassified objects are expected
because of the higher X-ray brightness of AGN with respect to galaxies. The
latter fraction is actually 50% in the X-ray detected sources, while it is
expected to be much lower among X-ray undetected sources. Indeed, the analysis
of the stacked spectrum of undetected sources shows, consistently, strongly
different properties between the AGN and galaxy samples. X-ray based selection
criteria are then used to refine both samples. The radio/X-ray luminosity
correlation for star forming galaxies is found to hold with the same
X-ray/radio ratio valid for nearby galaxies. Some evolution of the ratio may be
possible for sources at high redshift or high luminosity, tough it is likely
explained by a bias arising from the radio selection. Finally, we discuss the
X-ray number counts of star forming galaxies from the VLA- and C-COSMOS surveys
according to different selection criteria, and compare them to the similar
determination from the Chandra Deep Fields. The classification scheme proposed

influence maximization (BIM) problem concerns selecting a set of seed nodes to
disseminate some information that maximizes the total number of nodes
influenced (termed as influence spread) in social networks at a total cost no
more than the budget. Our proposed seed selection algorithm for the BIM problem
guarantees an approximation ratio of (1 - 1/sqrt(e)). The seed selection
algorithm needs to calculate the influence spread of candidate seed sets, which
is known to be #P-complex. Identifying the linkage between the computation of
marginal probabilities in Bayesian networks and the influence spread, we devise
efficient heuristic algorithms for the latter problem. Experiments using both
large-scale social networks and synthetically generated networks demonstrate
superior performance of the proposed algorithm with moderate computation costs.
Moreover, synthetic datasets allow us to vary the network parameters and gain
important insights on the impact of graph structures on the performance of
different algorithms.

that the diffusion coefficient is not separable into energy and space variables

allows for adaptive sampling. Using Markov chain theory, we evaluate the
covariance structure and the integrated squared error [ISE] of the related
Horvitz-Thompson estimator. Our sampling designs decrease the mean ISE by
suitably reallocating the sample across population strata during replacements.
They also reduce the variance of the ISE by increasing the frequency or the
intensity of replacements. To investigate the benefits of using both current
and past measurements in the estimation, we develop a new composite estimator.
In an application to electricity usage data, our rotation method outperforms
fixed panels and conventional rotation samples. Because of the weak temporal
dependence of the data, the composite estimator only slightly improves upon the

subspace X of some B(H) that we provide implies that the \v{S}ilov ideal is the
intersection of C*(X) with any maximal boundary operator subsystem in B(H). As
an immediate consequence we deduce that the \v{S}ilov ideal is the biggest
boundary operator subsystem for X in C*(X).
  The new proof of the existence of the \v{S}ilov ideal that we give does not
use the existence of maximal dilations, provided by Dritschel and McCullough,
and so it is independent of the one given by Arveson. As a countereffect, the
\v{S}ilov ideal can be seen as the set that contains the abnormalities in a
C*-cover (C,\iota) of X for all the extensions of the identity map on \iota(X).
The interpretation of our results in terms of ucp maps characterizes the
maximal boundary subsystems of X in B(H) as kernels of X-projections that
induce completely minimal X-seminorms; equivalently, X-minimal projections with

  Its spectral energy distribution or spectrum shows two main peaks, the low
energy peak, at an energy of $10^{-2}$ eV, and the high energy peak, at about
150 keV.
  There is also a faint very high energy (E $\geq$ 100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray
emission fully detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System experiment. In
this work we describe the entire spectrum, the two main peaks with a
Synchrotron/Self-Synchrotron Compton model and, the Very High Energy emission
with a hadronic model. We consider p$\gamma$ and $pp$ interactions. For the
p$\gamma$ interaction, we assume that the target photons are those produced at
150 keV in the leptonic processes. On the other hand, for the pp interaction we
consider as targets the thermal particle densities in the lobes. Requiring a
satisfactory description of the spectra at very high energies with p$\gamma$
interaction we obtain an excessive luminosity in ultra high energy cosmic rays
(even exceeding the Eddington luminosity). However, when considering pp
interaction to describe the $\gamma$-spectrum, the obtained number of ultra
high energy cosmic rays are in agreement with Pierre Auger observations.
Moreover, we calculate the possible neutrino signal from pp interactions on a

star-forming regions can affect the quantification of the star formation rate

the SFR estimates using the far ultraviolet (FUV) and the Halpha emission. We
find that leakage could decrease the SFR(Ha)/SFR(FUV) ratio by up to a 25 per
cent. The evidence is based on the observation that the SFR(Ha)/SFR(FUV) ratio
is lower for objects showing a shell Halpha structure than for regions
exhibiting a much more compact morphology. The study has been performed on
three object samples: low luminosity dwarf galaxies from the Local Volume
Legacy survey and star-forming regions in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the
nearby Local Group galaxy M33. For the three samples we find differences
(1.1-1.4sigma) between the SFR(Ha)/SFR(FUV) for compact and shell objects.
Although leakage cannot entirely explain the observed trend of SFR(Ha)/SFR(FUV)
ratios for systems with low SFR, we show the mechanism can lead to different
SFR estimates when using Halpha and FUV luminosities. Therefore, further study
is needed to constrain the contribution of leakage to the low SFR(Ha)/SFR(FUV)
ratios observed in dwarf galaxies and its impact on the Halpha flux as a SFR
indicator in such objects.

of extracting sources in the observed images, the new method analyzes fine
spatial decompositions of original images across a wide range of scales and
across all wavebands. It cleans those single-scale images of noise and
background, and constructs wavelength-independent single-scale detection images
that preserve information in both spatial and wavelength dimensions. Sources
are detected in the combined detection images by following the evolution of
their segmentation masks across all spatial scales. Measurements of the source
properties are done in the original background-subtracted images at each

footprints and overlapping sources are deblended in an iterative procedure. In
addition to the main catalog of sources, various catalogs and images are
produced that aid scientific exploitation of the extraction results. We

prediction of the theory, the coherent quantum phase slip (CQPS), has not been
observed. CQPS is a phenomenon exactly dual to the Josephson effect: whilst the
latter is a coherent transfer of charges between superconducting contacts, the
former is a coherent transfer of vortices or fluxes across a superconducting
wire. In contrast to previously reported observations of incoherent phase slip,
the CQPS has been only a subject of theoretical study. Its experimental
demonstration is made difficult by quasiparticle dissipation due to gapless
excitations in nanowires or in vortex cores. This difficulty might be overcome
by using certain strongly disordered superconductors in the vicinity of the
superconductor-insulator transition (SIT). Here we report the first direct
observation of the CQPS in a strongly disordered indium-oxide (InOx)
superconducting wire inserted in a loop, which is manifested by the
superposition of the quantum states with different number of fluxes. Similarly
to the Josephson effect, our observation is expected to lead to novel
applications in superconducting electronics and quantum metrology.

can acquire a scalar charge in scalar Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) theory under the small
coupling approximation. This leads to the fact that scalar radiation is emitted
from a binary containing at least one BH. In this letter, we find the
constraints on this theory from BH low-mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXBs). The main
result of this letter is that from the orbital decay rate of A0620-00, we
obtained a conservative bound that is six orders of magnitude stronger than the
solar system bound. In addition to this, we look at XTE J1118+480, whose
orbital decay rate has been recently measured with an excess compared to the
theoretical prediction in GR due to the radiation reaction. The cause of this
excess is currently unknown. Although it is likely that the cause is of
astrophysical origin, here we investigate the possibility of explaining this
excess with the additional scalar radiation in sGB theory. We find that there
still remains a parameter range where the excess can be explained while also
satisfying the constraint obtained from A0620-00. The interesting point is that
for most of other alternative theories of gravity, it seems difficult to
explain this excess with the additional radiation. This is because it would be
difficult to evade the constraints from binary pulsars or they have already
been constrained rather strongly from other observations such as solar system
experiments. We propose several ways to determine whether the excess is caused
by the scalar radiation in sGB gravity including future gravitational wave
observations with space-borne interferometers, which can give a constraint
three orders of magnitude stronger than that from A0620-00.

monotone submodular optimization over a matroid constraint. Compared to the
continuous greedy algorithm (Calinescu, Chekuri, Pal and Vondrak, 2008), our
algorithm is extremely simple and requires no rounding. It consists of the
greedy algorithm followed by local search. Both phases are run not on the
actual objective function, but on a related non-oblivious potential function,
which is also monotone submodular. Our algorithm runs in randomized time
O(n^8u), where n is the rank of the given matroid and u is the size of its
ground set. We additionally obtain a 1-1/e-eps approximation algorithm running
in randomized time O (eps^-3n^4u). For matroids in which n = o(u), this
improves on the runtime of the continuous greedy algorithm. The improvement is
due primarily to the time required by the pipage rounding phase, which we avoid
altogether. Furthermore, the independence of our algorithm from pipage rounding
techniques suggests that our general approach may be helpful in contexts such
as monotone submodular maximization subject to multiple matroid constraints.
  Our approach generalizes to the case where the monotone submodular function
has restricted curvature. For any curvature c, we adapt our algorithm to
produce a (1-e^-c)/c approximation. This result complements results of Vondrak
(2008), who has shown that the continuous greedy algorithm produces a
(1-e^-c)/c approximation when the objective function has curvature c. He has
also proved that achieving any better approximation ratio is impossible in the
value oracle model.

information diffusion: a push type model known as Independent Cascade (IC)
model and a pull type model known as Linear Threshold (LT) model. We extend
these two models (called AsIC and AsLT in this paper) to incorporate
asynchronous time delay and investigate 1) how they differ from or similar to
each other in terms of information diffusion, 2) whether the model itself is
learnable or not from the observed information diffusion data, and 3) which
model is more appropriate to explain for a particular topic (information) to
diffuse/propagate. We first show there can be variations with respect to how
the time delay is modeled, and derive the likelihood of the observed data being
generated for each model. Using one particular time delay model, we show the
model parameters are learnable from a limited amount of observation. We then
propose a method based on predictive accuracy by which to select a model which
better explains the observed data. Extensive evaluations were performed. We
first show using synthetic data with the network structures taken from real
networks that there are considerable behavioral differences between the AsIC
and the AsLT models, the proposed methods accurately and stably learn the model
parameters, and identify the correct diffusion model from a limited amount of
observation data. We next apply these methods to behavioral analysis of topic
propagation using the real blog propagation data, and show there is a clear

around fiducial values: the non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL, the matter density
parameter Omega_m, the amplitude of the matter power spectrum sigma_8, the
spectral index of the primordial power spectrum n_s, and the dark-energy
equation-of-state parameter w_0. We assess the sensitivity of the cosmic shear
correlation functions, the third-order aperture mass statistics, and the
abundance of shear peaks to these parameters. We find that each of the
considered probes provides unmarginalized constraints of Delta f_NL ~ 20 on
f_NL. Marginalized constraints from any individual WL probe are much weaker due
to strong correlations between parameters. However, the parameter errors can be
substantially reduced by combining information from different WL probes.
Combining all WL probes yields the following marginal (68% confidence level)
uncertainties: Delta f_NL ~ 50, Delta Omega_m ~ 0.002, Delta sigma_8 ~ 0.004,
Delta n_s ~ 0.007, and Delta w_0 ~ 0.03. We examine the bias induced by
neglecting f_NL on the constraints on the other parameters. We find sigma_8 and
w_0 to be the most affected. Moreover, neglecting non-Gaussianity leads to a
severe underestimation of the uncertainties in the other cosmological

  - the cohomology of the configuration space of n distinct ordered points on
an arbitrary (connected, oriented) manifold
  - the diagonal coinvariant algebra on r sets of n variables
  - the cohomology and tautological ring of the moduli space of n-pointed
curves
  - the space of polynomials on rank varieties of n x n matrices
  - the subalgebra of the cohomology of the genus n Torelli group generated by
H^1 and more.
  The symmetric group S_n acts on each of these vector spaces. In most cases
almost nothing is known about the characters of these representations, or even
their dimensions. We prove that in each fixed degree the character is given,
for n large enough, by a polynomial in the cycle-counting functions that is
independent of n. In particular, the dimension is eventually a polynomial in n.
In this framework, representation stability (in the sense of Church-Farb) for a
sequence of S_n-representations is converted to a finite generation property
for a single FI-module.

graph, such as gene expressions in a gene network. In this context, it is of
much interest to automatically select a subgraph with few connected components;
by exploiting prior knowledge, one can indeed improve the prediction
performance or obtain results that are easier to interpret. Regularization or
penalty functions for selecting features in graphs have recently been proposed,
but they raise new algorithmic challenges. For example, they typically require
solving a combinatorially hard selection problem among all connected subgraphs.
In this paper, we propose computationally feasible strategies to select a
sparse and well-connected subset of features sitting on a directed acyclic
graph (DAG). We introduce structured sparsity penalties over paths on a DAG
called ""path coding"" penalties. Unlike existing regularization functions that
model long-range interactions between features in a graph, path coding
penalties are tractable. The penalties and their proximal operators involve
path selection problems, which we efficiently solve by leveraging network flow
optimization. We experimentally show on synthetic, image, and genomic data that
our approach is scalable and leads to more connected subgraphs than other
regularization functions for graphs.

shifted Dirac cones in which the resonance decay of a phonon satisfying $q >

suppressed when $\mu < (vq-\omega)/2$. We highlight the fact that the decay of
an intervalley (and intravalley longitudinal optical) phonon with $q=\omega/v$

feature is in contrast to the divergent behavior of an intravalley transverse
optical phonon, which bears a close similarity to the polarization function

is nested in a more general unconstrained one, with same number of mixture

Expectation-Maximisation, symmetry is tested against skewness through a

is illustrated through a Monte Carlo simulation study, where we compare two

mixture components, with the traditional one based on the third standardised
moment. An illustrative example is also given that focuses on real data.

elucidated using an energy balance of the electromagnetic field. From a
classical point of view it is trivial to show that the field scattered back
from any body should alter the emission of the source. But it is not at all
apparent that the total radiative and non-radiative decay in an arbitrary body
can add to the vacuum decay rate of the emitter (i.e.) an increase of emission
that is just as much as the body absorbs and radiates in all directions. This
gives us an opportunity to revisit two other elegant classical ideas of the
past, the optical theorem and the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory of radiation.
It also provides us alternative perspectives of Purcell effect and generalizes
many of its manifestations, both enhancement and inhibition of emission. When
the optical density of states of a body or a material is difficult to resolve
(in a complex geometry or a highly inhomogeneous volume) such a generalization
offers new directions to solutions.

Sommerfeld integral relations to explain the effect of the substrates as a
function of the parameters of incident radiation. The radiative coupling can
both quench and enhance the resonance and its dependence on the angle and
polarization of incident radiation with respect to the surface is shown.
Non-radiative interaction with the substrate enhances the plasmon resonance of
the particles and can shift the resonances from their free-space energies
significantly. The non-radiative interaction of the substrate is sensitive to
the shape of particles and polarization of incident radiation with respect to
substrate. Our results show that plasmon resonances in coupled and single

interpretation for square roots of -1 in the form of blades that square to
minus 1. This extends to a geometric interpretation of quaternions as the side
face bivectors of a unit cube. Systematic research has been done [32] on the
biquaternion roots of -1, abandoning the restriction to blades. Biquaternions
are isomorphic to the Clifford (geometric) algebra $Cl(3,0)$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Further research on general algebras $Cl(p,q)$ has explicitly derived the
geometric roots of -1 for $p+q \leq 4$ [17]. The current research abandons this
dimension limit and uses the Clifford algebra to matrix algebra isomorphisms in
order to algebraically characterize the continuous manifolds of square roots of
-1 found in the different types of Clifford algebras, depending on the type of
associated ring ($\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\mathbb{H}^2$, or
$\mathbb{C}$). At the end of the paper explicit computer generated tables of
representative square roots of -1 are given for all Clifford algebras with
$n=5,7$, and $s=3 \, (mod 4)$ with the associated ring $\mathbb{C}$. This
includes, e.g., $Cl(0,5)$ important in Clifford analysis, and $Cl(4,1)$ which
in applications is at the foundation of conformal geometric algebra. All these

\{\infty\}}$) endowed with two operations: $\oplus$, which is just usual
minimum, and $\odot$, which is usual addition. In tropical algebra the vector
$x$ is a solution to a polynomial $g_1(x) \oplus g_2(x) \oplus...\oplus
g_k(x)$, where $g_i(x)$'s are tropical monomials, if the minimum in
$\min_i(g_{i}(x))$ is attained at least twice. In min-plus algebra solutions of
systems of equations of the form $g_1(x)\oplus...\oplus g_k(x) =
h_1(x)\oplus...\oplus h_l(x)$ are studied.
  In this paper we consider computational problems related to tropical linear
system. We show that the solvability problem (both over $\mathbb{Z}$ and
$\mathbb{Z} \cup \{\infty\}$) and the problem of deciding the equivalence of
two linear systems (both over $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z} \cup \{\infty\}$)
are equivalent under polynomial-time reduction to mean payoff games and are
also equivalent to analogous problems in min-plus algebra. In particular, all
these problems belong to $\mathsf{NP} \cap \mathsf{coNP}$. Thus we provide a
tight connection of computational aspects of tropical linear algebra with mean
payoff games and min-plus linear algebra. On the other hand we show that
computing the dimension of the solution space of a tropical linear system and
of a min-plus linear system are $\mathsf{NP}$-complete.
  We also extend some of our results to the systems of min-plus linear
inequalities.

networks is a major goal in many fields, especially in genomics and proteomics.
We have shown in several works that iterative hierarchical clustering, as
implemented in the UVCluster program, is a powerful tool to analyze many of
those networks. However, the amount of computation time required to perform
UVCluster analyses imposed significant limitations to its use.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe the suite Jerarca, designed to
efficiently convert networks of interacting units into dendrograms by means of
iterative hierarchical clustering. Jerarca is divided into three main sections.
First, weighted distances among units are computed using up to three different
approaches: a more efficient version of UVCluster and two new, related
algorithms called RCluster and SCluster. Second, Jerarca builds dendrograms
based on those distances, using well-known phylogenetic algorithms, such as
UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining. Finally, Jerarca provides optimal partitions of the
trees using statistical criteria based on the distribution of intra- and
intercluster connections. Outputs compatible with the phylogenetic software
MEGA and the Cytoscape package are generated, allowing the results to be easily
visualized.
  Conclusions/Significance: The four main advantages of Jerarca in respect to
UVCluster are: 1) Improved speed of a novel UVCluster algorithm; 2) Additional,
alternative strategies to perform iterative hierarchical clustering; 3)
Automatic evaluation of the hierarchical trees to obtain optimal partitions;
and, 4) Outputs compatible with popular software such as MEGA and Cytoscape.

agreement. Our optimized LVS framework provides a defence against location

For sufficiently large environmental noise, there exists a transition between a

delayed communication creates a bifurcation pattern dependent on the coupling
amplitude between particles. Using a mean field model in the large number

screening via plasmon-mediated drag enhances the drag resistivity and results
in an upturn in its behavior at large inter-layer separations. In a range of
inter-layer separations, corresponding to the strong-to-weak crossover coupling

quadratically with the inter-layer spacing. This dependence weakens with a
decrease of the inter-layer spacing while for larger separations we recover the

display PT-symmetry. To do so, simple arguments that use the WKB approximation
are employed, and these imply that the eigenvalues are real. However,
definitive results are in most cases presently only obtainable numerically, and
not all eigenvalues in each family may be real. Within the approximations used,
it is illustrated that the difference between the quantum-mechanical and the

numerically observed along shock Hugoniots and isothermal compression curves in

however, it transforms gradually to a smooth cross-over, and becomes less

of transition are encoded in the Gibbs free energy, and are elucidated clearly
by analyzing the correlation with the variation of defect populations as a
function of pressure and temperature. The opportunities and challenges for a
possible experimental observation of this phase change are also discussed.

LeCam's theory for statistical experiments which is the theory of the behaviour

allows two spatially separated parties, Alice and Bob, to exhibit stronger than
quantum correlations. If the generated correlations are weak, they can
sometimes be distilled into a stronger correlation by repeated applications of
the \textsf{NLB}. Motivated by the limited distillability of \textsf{NLB}s, we
initiate here a study of the distillation of correlations for nonlocal boxes
that output quantum states rather than classical bits (\textsf{qNLB}s). We
propose a new protocol for distillation and show that it asymptotically
distills a class of correlated quantum nonlocal boxes to the value $1/2
(3\sqrt{3}+1) \approx 3.098076$, whereas in contrast, the optimal non-adaptive
parity protocol for classical nonlocal boxes asymptotically distills only to
the value 3.0. We show that our protocol is an optimal non-adaptive protocol
for 1, 2 and 3 \textsf{qNLB} copies by constructing a matching dual solution
for the associated primal semidefinite program (SDP). We conclude that
\textsf{qNLB}s are a stronger resource for nonlocality than \textsf{NLB}s. The
main premise that develops from this conclusion is that the \textsf{NLB} model
is not the strongest resource to investigate the fundamental principles that
limit quantum nonlocality. As such, our work provides strong motivation to
reconsider the status quo of the principles that are known to limit nonlocal
correlations under the framework of \textsf{qNLB}s rather than \textsf{NLB}s.

receiving antennas and uniformly probed in the frequency domain. This scenario
fits most of the modern outdoor communication protocols for mobile access or
digital broadcasting among others.
  Such channels verify a Sparse Common Support property (SCS) which was used in
a previous paper to propose a Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) based sampling
and estimation algorithm. In this contribution we improve the robustness and
computational complexity aspects of this algorithm. The method is based on
projection in Krylov subspaces to improve complexity and a new criterion called
the Partial Effective Rank (PER) to estimate the level of sparsity to gain
robustness.
  If P antennas measure a K-multipath channel with N uniformly sampled
measurements per channel, the algorithm possesses an O(KPNlogN) complexity and
an O(KPN) memory footprint instead of O(PN^3) and O(PN^2) for the direct
implementation, making it suitable for K << N. The sparsity is estimated online
based on the PER, and the algorithm therefore has a sense of introspection
being able to relinquish sparsity if it is lacking. The estimation performances
are tested on field measurements with synthetic AWGN, and the proposed
algorithm outperforms non-sparse reconstruction in the medium to low SNR range
(< 0dB), increasing the rate of successful symbol decodings by 1/10th in
average, and 1/3rd in the best case. The experiments also show that the
algorithm does not perform worse than a non-sparse estimation algorithm in
non-sparse operating conditions, since it may fall-back to it if the PER
criterion does not detect a sufficient level of sparsity.
  The algorithm is also tested against a method assuming a ""discrete"" sparsity
model as in Compressed Sensing (CS). The conducted test indicates a trade-off
between speed and accuracy.

Survey (HeViCS), and the integrated HI and CO brightness, we infer the dust and

in Virgo. The CO flux correlates tightly and linearly with far-infrared fluxes
observed by Herschel. Molecules in these galaxies are more closely related to
cold dust rather than to dust heated by star formation or to optical/NIR
brightness. We show that dust mass establishes a stronger correlation with the
total gas mass than with the atomic or molecular component alone. The
dust-to-gas ratio increases as the HI deficiency increases, but in highly HI
deficient galaxies it stays constant. Dust is in fact less affected than atomic
gas by weak cluster interactions, which remove most of the HI gas from outer
and high latitudes regions. Highly disturbed galaxies, in a dense cluster
environment, can instead loose a considerable fraction of gas and dust from the
inner regions of the disk keeping constant the dust-to-gas ratio. There is
evidence that the molecular phase is also quenched. This quencing becomes
evident by considering the molecular gas mass per unit stellar mass. Its
amplitude, if confirmed by future studies, highlights that molecules are
missing in Virgo HI deficient spirals, but to a somewhat lesser extent than
dust.

simultaneous reliable measure of the hardness ratio by the All Sky Monitor,
shows that the sample covers nearly all the spectral shapes of Cyg X-1. The
relative strength, width of the Iron line and the reflection parameter are in
general correlated with the high energy photon spectral index $\Gamma$. This is
broadly consistent with a geometry where for the hard state (low $\Gamma \sim
1.7$) there is a hot inner Comptonizing region surrounded by a truncated cold
disk. The inner edge of the disk moves inwards as the source becomes softer
till finally in the soft state (high $\Gamma > 2.2$) the disk fills the inner
region and active regions above the disk produce the Comptonized component.
However, the reflection parameter shows non-monotonic behaviour near the
transition region ($\Gamma \sim 2$), suggestive of a more complex geometry or
physical state of the reflector. Additionally, the inner disk temperature,
during the hard state, is on the average higher than in the soft one, albeit
with large scatter. These inconsistencies could be due to limitations in the
data and the empirical model used to fit them. The flux of each spectral
component is well correlated with $\Gamma$ which shows that unlike some other
black hole systems, Cyg X-1 does not show any hysteresis behaviour. In the soft
state, the flux of the Comptonized component is always similar to the disk one,
which confirms that the ultra-soft state (seen in other brighter black hole
systems) is not exhibited by Cyg X-1. The rapid variation of the Compton
Amplification factor with $\Gamma$, naturally explains the absence of spectra
with $\Gamma < 1.6$, despite a large number having $\Gamma \sim 1.65$.

other, and also in the CRF, to within 1-sigma upper limits of 15 and 30
micro-arcsec/yr in RA and decl., respectively. The core of 3C 454.3 appears to
jitter in its position along the jet direction over ~0.2 mas, likely due to
activity close to the putative supermassive black hole nearby, but on average
is stationary in the CRF within 1-sigma upper limits on its proper motion of 39
micro-arcsec/yr (1.0c) and 30 micro-arcsec/yr (0.8c) in RA and decl.,
respectively, for the period 2002 - 2005. Our corresponding limit over the
longer interval, 1998 - 2005, of more importance to GP-B, is 46 and 56
micro-arcsec/yr in RA and decl., respectively. Some of 3C 454.3's jet
components show significantly superluminal motion with speeds of up to ~200
micro-arcsec/yr or 5c in the CRF. The core of 3C 454.3 thus provides for
Gravity Probe B a sufficiently stable reference in the distant universe.

accounted for by invoking a massive baryonic disc with no need for non-baryonic
dark matter or a massive halo. There are 5 primary reasons for suggesting this:
1. there are well known disc surface mass density distributions that naturally
produce the observed rotation curves of galaxies. 2. there are a number of
rotation curve `puzzles' that cannot be explained by a massive dark matter halo
i.e. the success of maximum disc fitting, HI gas scaling to the observed
rotation, the disc/halo conspiracy and the interpretation of the Tully-Fisher
relation. 3. recent 21cm observations show an almost constant HI surface
density and a distinct `cut-off' or edge to galactic discs. We explain this
constant surface density in terms of either an optical depth effect or the
onset of molecular gas formation and hence the possibility of considerably more
gas existing in galaxies. We suggest that the HI cut-off does indeed mark the
edge of the galactic disc. 4. there have been an increasing number of recent
observations that imply that X_CO may be ten times higher in the outer Galaxy.
This `dark' gas may provide adequate mass to account for galaxy rotation. 5. we
show that the additional baryonic mass required to account for the rotation of
galaxies is just that required to reconcile observed baryons with those
predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis. Mestel discs can be used to straight
forwardly explain the scaling laws of galaxies, particularly the observed
relation between rotation velocity and radius and the oft used Tully-Fisher
relation. We discuss observations of the baryonic content of galactic discs and
where sufficient `hidden' baryons might be found to account for the rotation.

transformation elasticity correspond to the density and moduli of

recovery. Though many of the Greedy Pursuits possess elegant theoretical
guarantees for performance, it is well known that their performance depends on
the statistical distribution of the non-zero elements in the sparse signal. In
practice, the distribution of the sparse signal may not be known a priori. It
is also observed that performance of Greedy Pursuits degrades as the number of
available measurements decreases from a threshold value which is method
dependent. To improve the performance in these situations, we introduce a novel
fusion framework for Greedy Pursuits and also propose two algorithms for sparse
recovery. Through Monte Carlo simulations we show that the proposed schemes
improve sparse signal recovery in clean as well as noisy measurement cases.

our construction, the player can reveal a boolean circuit in polynomial time,
after guessing an initial square with no surrounding mines, a guess that has 99
percent probability of success. Subsequently, the mines must be located with a
maximum probability of success.
  Furthermore, we show that determining the solvability of a partially
uncovered Minesweeper board is NP-complete with hexagonal and triangular grids
as well as a square grid, extending a similar result for square grids only by
R. Kaye. Actually finding the mines with a maximum probability of success is
again PP-hard or PSPACE-complete respectively.
  Our constructions are in such a way that the number of mines can be computed

  Cancer Radiotherapy",,,"10.1088/0031-9155/57/24/8201",,"physics.med-ph math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using fiducial markers on patient's body surface to predict the tumor
location is a widely used approach in lung cancer radiotherapy. The purpose of
this work is to propose an algorithm that automatically identifies a sparse set
of locations on the patient's surface with the optimal prediction power for the
tumor motion. The sparse selection of markers on the external surface and the
assumed linear relationship between the marker motion and the internal tumor
motion are represented by a prediction matrix. Such a matrix is determined by
solving an optimization problem, where the objective function contains a
sparsity term that penalizes the number of markers chosen on the patient's
surface. The performance of our algorithm has been tested on realistic clinical
data of four lung cancer patients. Thoracic 4DCT scans with 10 phases are used
for the study. On a reference phase, a grid of points are casted on the
patient's surface (except for patient's back) and propagated to other phases
via deformable image registration of the corresponding CT images. Tumor
locations at each phase are also manually delineated. We use 9 out of 10 phases
of the 4DCT images to identify a small group of surface markers that are most
correlated with the motion of the tumor, and find the prediction matrix at the
same time. The 10th phase is then used to test the accuracy of the prediction.
It is found that on average 6 to 7 surface markers are necessary to predict
tumor locations with a 3D error of about 1mm. In addition, the selected marker
locations lie closely in those areas where surface point motion has a high
correlation with the tumor motion. Our method can automatically select sparse
locations on patient's external surface and estimate a correlation matrix based
on 4DCT, so that the selected surface locations can be used to place fiducial
markers to optimally predict internal tumor motions.

NaCN have been carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope in the 80-357.5 GHz
frequency range. A large number of rotational transitions covering a wide range
of energy levels, including highly excited vibrational states, are detected in
emission and serve to trace different regions of the envelope. Radiative
transfer calculations based on the LVG formalism have been performed to derive
molecular abundances from the innermost out to the outer layers. The excitation
calculations include infrared pumping to excited vibrational states and
inelastic collisions, for which up-to-date rate coefficients for rotational
and, in some cases, ro-vibrational transitions are used. We find that in the
inner layers CS, SiO, and SiS have abundances relative to H$_2$ of 4e-6,
1.8e-7, and 3e-6, respectively, and that CS and SiS have significant lower
abundances in the outer envelope, which implies that they actively contribute
to the formation of dust. Moreover, in the inner layers, the amount of sulfur
and silicon in gas phase molecules is only 27 % for S and 5.6 % for Si,
implying that these elements have already condensed onto grains, most likely in
the form of MgS and SiC. Metal-bearing molecules lock up a relatively small
fraction of metals, although our results indicate that NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF,
and NaCN, despite their refractory character, are not significantly depleted in
the cold outer layers. In these regions a few percent of the metals Na, K, and
Al survive in the gas phase, either in atomic or molecular form, and are
therefore available to participate in the gas phase chemistry in the outer
envelope.

mechanism is activated to give birth to a flat inflationary Universe. For the
second time, it is turned on to complete the cosmological evolution after the
energy density of matter drops below the threshold (the energy density of

scale factor exceeds this threshold, which marks the birth of dark energy at a

possibly complete its evolution by tunneling back to ""nothing"". After that, the

phenomena in switching converters. In past studies, their prediction has been
mainly tackled by explicitly deriving a discrete time model and then
linearizing it in the vicinity of the operating point. However, the results
obtained from such an approach cannot be applied for design purpose.
Alternatively, in this paper, the subharmonic oscillations in voltage mode
controlled DC-DC buck converters are predicted by using a formal symbolic
approach. This approach is based on expressing the subharmonic oscillation
conditions in the frequency domain and then converting the results to
generalized hypergeometric functions. The obtained expressions depend
explicitly on the system parameters and the operating duty cycle making the
results directly applicable for design purpose. Under certain practical
conditions concerning these parameters, the hypergeometric functions can be
approximated by polylogarithm and standard functions. The new approach is
demonstrated using an example of voltage-mode-controlled buck converters. It is
found that the stability of the converter is strongly dependent upon a
polynomial function of the duty cycle.
