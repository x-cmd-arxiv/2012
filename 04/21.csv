geometries such as a straight pipe or channel are linearly stable. Here we
present experimental evidence that such flows can be nonlinearly unstable and
can exhibit a subcritical bifurcation. Velocimetry measurements are performed
in a long, straight micro-channel; flow disturbances are introduced at the
entrance of the channel system by placing a variable number of obstacles. Above
a critical flow rate and a critical size of the perturbation, a sudden onset of
large velocity fluctuations indicates presence of a nonlinear subcritical
instability. Together with the previous observations of hydrodynamic
instabilities in curved geometries, our results suggest that any flow of
polymer solutions becomes unstable at sufficiently high flow rates.

Hydrocarbons (PAHs) could be produced by evaporation of Very Small Grains

investigate quantitatively the transition zone between evaporating Very Small
Grains (eVSGs) and PAHs in several PDRs. Methods. We study the relative
contribution of PAHs and eVSGs to the mid-IR emission in a wide range of
excitation conditions. We fit the observed mid-IR emission of PDRs by using a
set of template band emission spectra of PAHs, eVSGs and gas lines. The fitting
tool PAHTAT (PAH Toulouse Astronomical Templates) is made available to the
community as an IDL routine. From the results of the fit, we derive the
fraction of carbon f_eVSG locked in eVSGs and compare it to the intensity of
the local UV radiation field. Results. We show a clear decrease of f_eVSG with
increasing intensity of the local UV radiation field, which supports the
scenario of photo-destruction of eVSGs. Conversely, this dependence can be used
to quantify the intensity of the UV radiation field for different PDRs,
including non resolved ones. Conclusions. PAHTAT can be used to trace the
intensity of the local UV radiation field in regions where eVSGs evaporate,
which correspond to relatively dense (nH = [100, 10^5 ] cm-3) and UV irradiated

characterizations, ranging from two-variable first-order logic FO^2 to
unambiguous polynomials. In order to study the structure of the subvarieties of
DA, Trotter and Weil considered the intersection of varieties of finite monoids
with bands, i.e., with idempotent monoids. The varieties of idempotent monoids
are very well understood and fully classified. Trotter and Weil showed that for
every band variety V there exists a unique maximal variety W inside DA such
that the intersection with bands yields the given band variety V. These maximal
varieties W define the Trotter-Weil hierarchy. This hierarchy is infinite and
it exhausts DA; induced by band varieties, it naturally has a zigzag shape. In
their paper, Trotter and Weil have shown that the corners and the intersection
levels of this hierarchy are decidable.
  In this paper, we give a single identity of omega-terms for every join level
of the Trotter-Weil hierarchy; this yields decidability. Moreover, we show that
the join levels and the subsequent intersection levels do not coincide. Almeida

via the long-range Coulomb potential, taking as a starting point the ladder
approximation to different vertex functions. We test in this way the low-energy
behavior of the electron system beyond the simple logarithmic dependence of
electronic correlators on the high-energy cutoff, which is characteristic of
the large-N approximation. We show that the graphene many-body theory is
perfectly renormalizable in the ladder approximation, as all higher powers in
the cutoff dependence can be absorbed into the redefinition of a finite number
of parameters (namely, the Fermi velocity and the weight of the fields) that
remain free of infrared divergences even at the charge neutrality point. We
illustrate this fact in the case of the vertex for the current density, where a
complete cancellation between the cutoff dependences of vertex and electron
self-energy corrections becomes crucial for the preservation of the gauge
invariance of the theory. The other potentially divergent vertex corresponds to
the staggered (sublattice odd) charge density, which is made cutoff independent
by a redefinition in the scale of the density operator. This allows to compute
a well-defined, scale invariant anomalous dimension to all orders in the ladder
series, which becomes singular at a value of the interaction strength marking
the onset of chiral symmetry breaking (and gap opening) in the Dirac field
theory. The critical coupling we obtain in this way matches with great accuracy
the value found with a quite different method, based on the resolution of the
gap equation, thus reassuring the predictability of our renormalization
approach.

noted that cavity searches for interactions between photons and exotic fields
may also result in bifurcation[1]. This paper builds on previous simulations of
bifurcation of an optical beam in the presence of periodic focusing [2]. Here,
however, the focus is on predicting a shifting of the beam's position, defined

different segments of the transmitted data over other. The result is that
segments are decoded in stages during the rateless transmission, where higher
prioritized segments are decoded at lower overhead. Our analysis focuses on
quantifying the expected amount of received symbols, which are redundant
already upon arrival, i.e. all input symbols contained in the received symbols
have already been decoded. This analysis gives novel insights into the
probabilistic mechanisms of LT codes with unequal recovery time, which has not
yet been available in the literature. We show that while these rateless codes
successfully provide the unequal recovery time, they do so at a significant
price in terms of redundancy in the lower prioritized segments. We propose and
analyze a modification where a single intermediate feedback is transmitted,
when the first segment is decoded in a code with two segments. Our analysis
shows that this modification provides a dramatic improvement on the decoding
performance of the lower prioritized segment.

problem of reconstructing an unknown string from its substrings in a certain
query model. More concretely, the goal of the problem is to identify an unknown
string $S$ by making queries of the following form: ""Is $s$ a substring of
$S$?"", where $s$ is a query string over the given alphabet. The number of
queries required to identify the string $S$ is the query complexity of this
problem.
  First we show a quantum algorithm that exactly identifies the string $S$ with
at most $3/4N + o(N)$ queries, where $N$ is the length of $S$. This contrasts
sharply with the classical query complexity $N$. Our algorithm uses Skiena and
Sundaram's classical algorithm and the Grover search as subroutines. To make
them effectively work, we develop another subroutine that finds a string
appearing only once in $S$, which may have an independent interest. We also
prove two lower bounds. The first one is a general lower bound of
$\Omega(\frac{N}{\log^2{N}})$, which means we cannot achieve a query complexity
of $O(N^{1-\epsilon})$ for any constant $\epsilon$. The other one claims that
if we cannot use queries of length roughly between $\log N$ and $3 \log N$,
then we cannot achieve a query complexity of any sublinear function in $N$.

implementation of radio astronomy digital signal processing (DSP) systems. Such
tools, for example, those from the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal
Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER), are usually platform-specific,
and lack high-level, platform-independent, portable, scalable application
specifications. This limits the designer's ability to experiment with designs
at a high-level of abstraction and early in the development cycle.
  We address some of these issues using a model-based design approach employing
dataflow models. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to the design of a
tunable digital downconverter (TDD) used for narrow-bandwidth spectroscopy. Our
design is targeted toward an FPGA platform, called the Interconnect Break-out
Board (IBOB), that is available from the CASPER. We use the term TDD to refer
to a digital downconverter for which the decmation factor and center frequency
can be reconfigured without the need for regenerating the hardware code. Such a
design is currently not available in the CASPER DSP library.
  The work presented in this paper focuses on two aspects. Firstly, we
introduce and demonstrate a dataflow-based design approach using the dataflow
interchange format (DIF) tool for high-level application specification, and we
integrate this approach with the CASPER tool flow. Secondly, we explore the
trade-off between the flexibility of TDD designs and the low hardware cost of
fixed-configuration digital downconverter (FDD) designs that use the available
CASPER DSP library. We further explore this trade-off in the context of a
two-stage downconversion scheme employing a combination of TDD or FDD designs.

vortex states were recently observed in transmission electron microscopy
experiments, and they introduce new degrees of freedom into the probing of
matter with electron beams. We associate a rotation of a vortex superposition
with the fact that different phases are acquired by oppositely handed vortices

Faraday effect, the rotation of the electron beam occurs in vacuum and arises
from the intrinsic chirality of the constituent vortex states.

of the CO measurements are new redshift determinations, substantially adding to
the number of detections of galaxies with rest-frame peak submillimeter
emission near 100um. The CO detections confirm the existence of massive gas
reservoirs within these luminous dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). The CO
redshift distribution of the 350um-selected galaxies is strikingly similar to
the optical redshifts of 850um-selected submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in 2.1 <
z < 3.5. Spectroscopic redshifts break a temperature-redshift degeneracy;
optically thin dust models fit to the far-infrared photometry indicate
characteristic dust temperatures near 34 K for most of the galaxies we detect
in CO. Detections of two warmer galaxies and statistically significant
nondetections hint at warmer or molecule-poor DSFGs with redshifts difficult

galaxies identified by H-ATLAS photometry are expected to be amplified by
foreground gravitational lenses. Analysis of CO linewidths and luminosities
provides a method for finding approximate gravitational lens magnifications mu
from spectroscopic data alone, yielding mu ~ 3--20. Corrected for

power spectra or two-point functions of Gaussian fields in order to comment on
the assumption of Gaussian estimators and the use of parameter-dependent
covariance matrices for parameter inference in the context of precision
cosmology. Even though the assumption of a Gaussian likelihood is motivated by
the central limit theorem, we discuss that it leads to Fisher information
content that violates the Cram\'er-Rao bound if used consistently, owing to
independent but artificial information from the parameter-dependent covariance
matrix. At any fixed multipole, this artificial term is shown to become
dominant in the case of a large number of correlated fields. While the
distribution of the estimators does indeed tend to a Gaussian with a large
number of modes, it is shown, however, that its Fisher information content does
not, in the sense that their covariance matrix never carries independent
information content, precisely because of the non-Gaussian shape of the
distribution. In this light, we discuss the use of parameter-dependent
covariance matrices with Gaussian likelihoods for parameter inference from
two-point statistics. As a rule of thumb, Gaussian likelihoods should always be
used with a covariance matrix fixed in parameter space, since only this
guarantees that conservative information content is assigned to the
observables, and at the same time prevents biases appearing.

sub-sample which we employ in this study contains 81971 galaxies distributed
over 17000deg^2 with an effective redshift z = 0.067. By modelling the 2D
galaxy correlation function, xi(r_p,pi), we measure the parameter combination
f(z)sigma_8(z) = 0.423 +/- 0.055. Alternatively, by assuming standard gravity
we can break the degeneracy between sigma_8 and the galaxy bias parameter, b.
Combining our data with the Hubble constant prior from Riess et al (2011), we
measure sigma_8 = 0.76 +/- 0.11 and Omega_m = 0.250 +/- 0.022, consistent with
constraints from other galaxy surveys and the Cosmic Microwave Background data
from WMAP7. Combining our measurement of fsigma_8 with WMAP7 allows us to test
the relationship between matter and gravity on cosmic scales by constraining
the growth index of density fluctuations, gamma. Using only 6dFGS and WMAP7
data we find gamma = 0.547 +/- 0.088, consistent with the prediction of General
Relativity. We note that because of the low effective redshift of 6dFGS our
measurement of the growth rate is independent of the fiducial cosmological
model (Alcock-Paczynski effect). We also show that our conclusions are not
sensitive to the model adopted for non-linear redshift-space distortions. Using
a Fisher matrix analysis we report predictions for constraints on fsigma_8 for
the WALLABY survey and the proposed TAIPAN survey. The WALLABY survey will be
able to measure fsigma_8 with a precision of 4-10%, depending on the modelling
of non-linear structure formation. This is comparable to the predicted
precision for the best redshift bins of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS), demonstrating that low-redshift surveys have a significant role
to play in future tests of dark energy and modified gravity.

star-forming galaxy (SFG) ZC406690 using the VLT/SINFONI with AO (in K-band)
and in seeing-limited mode (in H- and J-band). Our data includes all of the
main strong optical emission lines: [OII], [OIII], Ha, Hb, [NII] and [SII]. We
find broad, blueshifted Ha and [OIII] emission line wings in the spectra of the
galaxy's massive, star-forming clumps (sigma \sim 85 km s^-1) and even broader
wings (up to 70% of the total Ha flux, with sigma \sim 290 km s^-1) in regions
spatially offset from the clumps by \sim 2 kpc. The broad emission likely
originates from large-scale outflows with mass outflow rates from individual
clumps that are 1-8x the SFR of the clumps. Based on emission line ratio
diagnostics ([NII]/Ha and [SII]/Ha) and photoionization and shock models, we
find that the emission from the clumps is due to a combination of
photoionization from the star-forming regions and shocks generated in the
outflowing component, with 5-30% of the emission deriving from shocks. In terms
of the ionization parameter (6x10^7-10^8 cm/s, based on both the SFR and the
O32 ratio), density (local electron densities of 300-1800 cm^-3 in and around
the clumps, and ionized gas column densities of 1200-8000 Msol/pc^2), and SFR
(10-40 Msol/yr), these clumps more closely resemble nuclear starburst regions
of local ULIRGs and dwarf irregulars than HII regions in local galaxies.
However, the star-forming clumps are not located in the nucleus as in local
starburst galaxies but instead are situated in a ring several kpc from the
center of their high-redshift host galaxy, and have an overall disk-like
morphology. The two brightest clumps are quite different in terms of their
internal properties, energetics and relative ages, and thus we are given a
glimpse at two different stages in the formation and evolution of rapidly
star-forming giant clumps at high-z.

AdS${}_5$ and a class of asymptotically AdS spaces are considered. Without
tuning, the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs is peaked towards the
IR tip of the space and hence such a scenario still offers a potential
resolution to the gauge-hierarchy problem. When the exponent of the Higgs VEV
is approximately two and one assumes order one Yukawa couplings, then the
fermion Dirac mass term is found to range from $\sim 10^{-5}$ eV to $\sim 200$
GeV in approximate agreement with the observed fermion masses. However, this
result is sensitive to the exponent of the Higgs VEV, which is a free
parameter. This paper offers a number of phenomenological and theoretical
motivations for considering an exponent of two to be the optimal value. In
particular, the exponent is bounded from below by the Breitenlohner-Freedman
bound and the requirement that the dual theory resolves the gauge hierarchy
problem. While, in the model considered, if the exponent is too large,
electroweak symmetry may not be broken. In addition, the holographic method is
used to demonstrate, in generality, that the flatter the Higgs VEV, the smaller
the contribution to the electroweak $T$ parameter. In addition, the constraints
from a large class of gauge mediated and scalar mediated flavour changing
neutral currents, will be at minimal values for flatter Higgs VEVs. Some
initial steps are taken to investigate the physical scalar degrees of freedom
that arise from a mixing between the $W_5/Z_5$ components and the Higgs
components.

cosmic reionization is compensating for the frequency dependence of an
interferometer's sampling pattern, which can cause smooth-spectrum foregrounds
to appear unsmooth and degrade the separation between foregrounds and the
target signal. In this paper, we present an approach to foreground removal that
explicitly accounts for this frequency dependence. We apply the delay
transformation introduced in Parsons & Backer (2009) to each baseline of an
interferometer to concentrate smooth-spectrum foregrounds within the bounds of
the maximum geometric delays physically realizable on that baseline. By
focusing on delay-modes that correspond to image-domain regions beyond the
horizon, we show that it is possible to avoid the bulk of smooth-spectrum
foregrounds. We map the point-spread function of delay-modes to k-space,
showing that delay-modes that are uncorrupted by foregrounds also represent
samples of the three-dimensional power spectrum, and can be used to constrain
cosmic reionization. Because it uses only spectral smoothness to differentiate
foregrounds from the targeted 21cm signature, this per-baseline analysis
approach relies on spectrally- and spatially-smooth instrumental responses for
foreground removal. For sufficient levels of instrumental smoothness relative
to interfering foregrounds, this technique substantially reduces the level of
calibration previously thought necessary to detect 21cm reionization. As a
result, this approach places fewer constraints on antenna configuration within
an array, facilitating the adoption of configurations optimized for
power-spectrum sensitivity. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate the
potential for PAPER to detect 21cm reionization at an amplitude of 10 mK^2 near
k~0.2h Mpc^-1 with 132 dipoles in 7 months of observing.

This operation can be seen as a thresholding of the tree, seen as a graph whose
nodes are weighted by the attribute. Rather than being satisfied with a mere
thresholding, we propose to expand on this idea, and to apply connected filters
on this latest graph. Consequently, the filtering is done not in the space of
the image, but on the space of shapes build from the image. Such a processing
is a generalization of the existing tree-based connected operators. Indeed, the
framework includes classical existing connected operators by attributes. It
also allows us to propose a class of novel connected operators from the

well compared to standard approaches when there are changes in base-composition

should be confounded by data generated with invariant sites or with
rate-variation across sites. Here we implement the squangles in a least-squares

of exciton-photon wavefunction though suppressing spin flip processes. Detailed
calculations presented here demonstrate how strain-induced potentials
manipulate the symmetry characters, intrinsic oscillator strength and
electron-hole dipole in NWQDs. An orbital-dependent kinetic energy is defined
based on single particle dispersion and orbital spreadout in k-space. It is
shown the exchange occurring between this kinetic energy and strain-induced
potentials is responsible for orbital distortions, and thus the energy
reordering of different direct and correlation terms. Various structures have
been examined to elaborate on the influence of size and orientation together
with axial and lateral symmetry of NWQDs. Our many-body calculations suggest
that binding energies of s-shell few particle resonances XX0 and trions are
suppressed when axial and lateral localizations become comparable. Then
exerting an external perturbation may renormalize the binding energies,
realizing a transition from anti-binding to binding regime or reverse. In this
regard, we specifically show that kinetic energy of single particles, and thus
correlation energies of associated complexes, exposed to an electric field
remain relatively unaffected and the interplay between direct Coulomb terms
reorders the multiexcitonic resonances. Sub-micro-eV fine structure splitting
along with the tunable XX0 binding energy offers NWQDs promising for generating
entangled photons in both regular and time reordering schemes.

covalent systems. As a result of that, the nonmagnetic B33-CaC is the
energetically preferred system, while the more ionic structures prefer a

observed ferromagnetism in the more ionic systems is attributed to the sharp

computed and the observed dynamical instabilities of the NA* and B2 structures
are explained in terms of the covalent bonds between carbon atoms. The

of the B33 structure in a wide range of temperatures and pressures. Among the

  Central Perturbations of High-Magnification Gravitational Microlensing Events","8 pages, 8 figures",,"10.1088/0004-637X/756/1/48",,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detect
planets. Perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can be
produced either by a planet or a binary companion. It is known that central
perturbations induced by both types of companions can be generally
distinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern around
caustics. In this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for which
it is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. The
peak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be blunt
and flat. For a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the source
trajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of an
arrowhead-shaped central caustic. For a binary case, a similar perturbation
occurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation region
between two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. We demonstrate the degeneracy
for 2 high-magnification events of OGLE-2011-BLG-0526 and
OGLE-2011-BLG-0950/MOA-2011-BLG-336. For OGLE-2011-BLG-0526, the $\chi^2$
difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying that
the degeneracy is very severe. For OGLE-2011-BLG-0950/MOA-2011-BLG-336, the
stellar binary model is formally excluded with $\Delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and the
planetary model is preferred. However, it is difficult to claim a planet
discovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model are
larger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. Considering
that 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, it
is expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy is
common.

element method (TSEM) on unstructured meshes, using the rectangle-triangle
mapping proposed in the conference note [21]. Here, we provide some new
insights into the originality and distinctive features of the mapping, and show
that this transform only induces a logarithmic singularity, which allows us to
devise a fast, stable and accurate numerical algorithm for its removal.
Consequently, any triangular element can be treated as efficiently as a
quadrilateral element, which affords a great flexibility in handling complex
computational domains. Benefited from the fact that the image of the mapping
includes the polynomial space as a subset, we are able to obtain optimal $L^2$-
and $H^1$-estimates of approximation by the proposed basis functions on
triangle. The implementation details and some numerical examples are provided
to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. All these will
pave the way for developing an unstructured TSEM based on, e.g., the
hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin formulation.

We show that the added degree of freedom is very constrained if both low

undistinguishable from LCDM at the present time, but could be distinguished in
the future with very accurate data at both low and high redshifts. We stress
the formal analogy at the phenomenological level of the running vacuum models
with recently proposed dark energy models based on the holographic or entropic
point of view, where a combination of \dot{H} and H^2 term is also present.
However those particular entropic formulations which do not have a constant
term in the Friedmann equations are not viable. The presence of this term is
necessary in order to allow for a transition from a decelerated to an
accelerated expansion. In contrast, the running vacuum models, both the
original and the generalized one introduced here contain this constant term in
a more natural way. Finally, important conceptual issues common to all these

temperature after a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration and provides a
simple measure of global warming. An early estimate of climate sensitivity,
1.5-4.5{\deg}C, has changed little subsequently, including the latest
assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
  The persistence of such large uncertainties in this simple measure casts
doubt on our understanding of the mechanisms of climate change and our ability
to predict the response of the climate system to future perturbations. This has
motivated continued attempts to constrain the range with climate data, alone or
in conjunction with models. The majority of studies use data from the
instrumental period (post-1850) but recent work has made use of information
about the large climate changes experienced in the geological past.
  In this review, we first outline approaches that estimate climate sensitivity
using instrumental climate observations and then summarise attempts to use the
record of climate change on geological timescales. We examine the limitations
of these studies and suggest ways in which the power of the palaeoclimate

points among maps homotopic to $f$. When these numbers are equal, the map is
called Wecken. A recent paper by Brimley, Griisser, Miller, and the second
author investigates the abundance of Wecken maps on surfaces with boundary, and
shows that the set of Wecken maps has nonzero asymptotic density.
  We extend the previous results as follows: When the fundamental group is free
with rank $n$, we give a lower bound on the density of the Wecken maps which
depends on $n$. This lower bound improves on the bounds given in the previous
paper, and approaches 1 as $n$ increases. Thus the proportion of Wecken maps
approaches 1 for large $n$. In this sense (for large $n$) the known examples of
non-Wecken maps represent exceptional, rather than typical, behavior for maps
on surfaces with boundary.

inventory-based psychological analysis, we demonstrate via experimental studies
that users' personalities can be predicted with reasonable precision based on

state with extraordinary properties. Superconductivity and Bose-Einstein
condensation are examples of such cooperative phenomena where macroscopic order
appears spontaneously. Here, we demonstrate that such an ordered state can also
be obtained in an optically excited semiconductor quantum well in a high
magnetic field. When we create a dense electron-hole plasma with an intense
laser pulse, after a certain delay, an ultrashort burst of coherent radiation
emerges. We interpret this striking phenomenon as a manifestation of
superfluorescence (SF), in which a macroscopic polarization spontaneously
builds up from an initially incoherent ensemble of excited quantum oscillators
and then decays abruptly producing giant pulses of coherent radiation. SF has
been observed in atomic gases, but the present work represents the first
observation of SF in a solid-state setting. While there is an analogy between
the recombination of electron-hole pairs and radiative transitions in atoms,
there is no a priori reason for SF in semiconductors to be similar to atomic
SF. This is a complex many-body system with a variety of ultrafast
interactions, where the decoherence rates are at least 1,000 times faster than
the radiative decay rate, an unusual situation totally unexplored in previous
atomic SF studies. We show, nonetheless, that collective many-body coupling via
a common radiation field does develop under certain conditions and leads to SF
bursts. The solid-state realization of SF resulted in an unprecedented degree
of controllability in the generation of SF, opening up opportunities for both
fundamental many-body studies and device applications. We demonstrate that the
intensity and delay time of SF bursts are fully tunable through an external
magnetic field, temperature, and pump laser power.
