algebra over $k$, and choose any maximal order $\mathcal{D}$ of $B$. The object
of this paper is to show that the group $\mathcal{D}_S^*$ of $S$-units of $B$
is generated by elements of small height once $S$ contains an explicit finite
set of places of $k$. This generalizes a theorem of H.\ W.\ Lenstra Jr., who
proved such a result when $B = k$. Our height bound is an explicit function of
the number field and the discriminant of a maximal order in $B$ used to define
its $S$-units.

projection we show that classical vacuums can be constructed in terms of
Killing vector fields on the group SU(3). Consequently, homotopic classes of
Killing vector fields determine the topological structure of the vacuum. In
particular, the second homotopy group \pi_2(SU(3)/U(1)\times U(1)) describes
all topologically non-equivalent vacuums which are classified by two
topological numbers. For each given Killing vector field one can construct six
vacuums forming Weyl sextet representation. An interesting feature of SU(3)
gauge theory is that it admits a Weyl symmetric vacuum represented by a linear
superposition of the six vacuums from the Weyl vacuum sextet. A non-trivial
manifestation of Weyl symmetry is demonstrated on monopole solutions. We
construct a family of finite energy monopole solutions in Yang-Mills-Higgs
theory which includes Weyl monopole sextet. From the analysis of the classical
vacuum structure and monopole solutions we conjecture that a similar Weyl
symmetric vacuum structure can be realized in quantum theory.

STIS measurements of the C I fine-structure excitation toward HD 85259 and HD

that of the warm clouds in the Local Bubble. The mean LLCC pressure measured
toward these two stars (60,000 cm$^{-3}$ K) implies an H I density of ~3000
cm$^{-3}$ and a cloud thickness of ~200 AU at the 20 K cloud temperature. Such
a thin, cold, dense structure could arise at the collision interface between
converging flows of warm gas. However, the measured LLCC pressure is
appreciably higher than that expected in the colliding cloud interpretation

Asteroids (NEAs) by performing orbital fits to optical and radar astrometry of
all numbered NEAs. We focus on a subset of 54 NEAs that exhibit some of the
most reliable and strongest drift rates. Our selection criteria include a
Yarkovsky sensitivity metric that quantifies the detectability of semi-major
axis drift in any given data set, a signal-to-noise metric, and orbital
coverage requirements. In 42 cases, the observed drifts (~10^-3 AU/Myr) agree
well with numerical estimates of Yarkovsky drifts. This agreement suggests that
the Yarkovsky effect is the dominant non-gravitational process affecting these
orbits, and allows us to derive constraints on asteroid physical properties. In
12 cases, the drifts exceed nominal Yarkovsky predictions, which could be due
to inaccuracies in our knowledge of physical properties, faulty astrometry, or
modeling errors. If these high rates cannot be ruled out by further
observations or improvements in modeling, they would be indicative of the
presence of an additional non-gravitational force, such as that resulting from
a loss of mass of order a kilogram per second. We define the Yarkovsky
efficiency f_Y as the ratio of the change in orbital energy to incident solar
radiation energy, and we find that typical Yarkovsky efficiencies are ~10^-5.

particles and neutral particles likely have significant consequences for the
thermodynamics of the plasma. We investigate the importance of introducing
neutral particles using numerical 2.5D radiative MHD simulations obtained with
the Bifrost code. The models span from the upper layers of the convection zone
to the low corona, and solve the full MHD equations with non-grey and NLTE
radiative transfer, and thermal conduction. The effects of partial ionization
are implemented using the generalized Ohm's law. The approximations required in
going from three fluids to the generalized Ohm's law are tested in our
simulations. The Ohmic diffusion, the Hall term, and ambipolar diffusion show
strong variations in the chromosphere. These strong variations of the various
magnetic diffusivities are absent or significantly underestimated when, as has
been common for these types of studies, using the VAL-C model as a basis for
estimates. In addition, we find that differences in estimating the magnitude of
ambipolar diffusion arise depending on which method is used to calculate the
ion-neutral collision frequency. These differences cause uncertainties in the
different magnetic diffusivity terms. In the chromosphere, we find that the
ambipolar diffusion is of the same order of magnitude or even larger than the
numerical diffusion used to stabilize our code. As a consequence, ambipolar
diffusion produces a strong impact on the modeled atmosphere. Perhaps more
importantly, it suggests that at least in the chromospheric domain,
self-consistent simulations of the solar atmosphere driven by
magneto-convection can accurately describe the impact of the dominant form of
resistivity (ambipolar diffusion). This suggests that such simulations may be
more realistic in their approach to the lower solar atmosphere than previously
assumed.

lowest-energy structure is not the most probable one. We perform numerical
simulations on systems containing up to 100 particles interacting through

propose to rely on the configurational entropy as a robust and objective
measure of uncertainty. The configurational entropy can be understood as the
logarithm of the effective number of states; it is insensitive to the presence
of overlooked low-probability states and can be reliably determined even within
a limited time of a simulation or an experiment.

timescales by thermal conduction, unless protected by magnetic fields that are

to the fronts. We present MHD simulations of cold front formation in the core
of a galaxy cluster with anisotropic thermal conduction, exploring a parameter
space of conduction strengths parallel and perpendicular to the field lines.
Including conduction has a strong effect on the temperature of the core and the
cold fronts. Though magnetic field lines are draping parallel to the front
surfaces, the temperature jumps across the fronts are nevertheless reduced. The
field geometry is such that the cold gas below the front surfaces can be
connected to hotter regions outside via field lines along directions
perpendicular to the plane of the sloshing motions and along sections of the
front which are not perfectly draped. This results in the heating of this gas
below the front on a timescale of a Gyr, but the sharpness of the density and
temperature jumps may still be preserved. By modifying the density distribution
below the front, conduction may indirectly aid in suppressing Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities. If conduction along the field lines is unsuppressed, we find
that the characteristic sharp jumps in X-ray emission seen in observations of
clusters do not form. This suggests that the presence of sharp cold fronts in
hot clusters could be used to place upper limits on conduction in the {\it
bulk} of the ICM. Finally, the combination of sloshing and anisotropic thermal
conduction can result in a larger flux of heat to the core than either process
in isolation. While still not sufficient to prevent a cooling catastrophe in
the very central ($r \sim$ 5 kpc) regions of the cool core, it reduces
significantly the mass of cool gas that accumulates outside those radii.

the same VDJ recombination. This probability $p$ increases with the B cell

A virus evolves to escape antibody binding. This evolution of the H3N2 virus

relative entropy to measure the diversity and selection pressure by antibody in
each amino acid site of H3 hemagglutinin between the 1992-1993 season and the
2009-2010 season. Shannon entropy and relative entropy are two independent
state variables that we use to characterize H3N2 evolution. The entropy method
estimates future H3N2 evolution and migration using currently available H3
hemagglutinin sequences. First, we show that the rate of evolution increases
with the virus diversity in the current season. The Shannon entropy of the
sequence in the current season predicts relative entropy between sequences in
the current season and those in the next season. Second, a global migration
pattern of H3N2 is assembled by comparing the relative entropy flows of
sequences sampled in China, Japan, the USA, and Europe. We verify this entropy
method by describing two aspects of historical H3N2 evolution. First, we
identify 54 amino acid sites in hemagglutinin that have evolved in the past to
evade the immune system. Second, the entropy method shows that epitopes A and B

is the grounds for this paper. In our paper, we extend recent results by the
author from the one dimensional Kac model to the $d$ dimensional one, showing
that the entropy-entropy production ratio, $\Gamma_N$, still yields a very
strong dependency in the number of particles of the problem when we consider
the general case.

bottomonia whose mass is too light to produce B-meson pairs, we get a
qualitatively new experimental signature, decays to b-quarks invisible to

(stochastic electrodynamics) is the classical theory which most closely
approximates quantum electrodynamics. Indeed, in inertial frames, there is a
general connection between classical field theories with classical zero-point
radiation and quantum field theories. However, this connection does not extend
to noninertial frames where the time parameter is not a geodesic coordinate.
Quantum field theory applies the canonical quantization procedure (depending on
the local time coordinate) to a mirror-walled box, and, in general, each
non-inertial coordinate frame has its own vacuum state. In complete contrast,
the spectrum of random classical zero-point radiation is based upon symmetry
principles of relativistic spacetime; in empty space, the correlation functions
depend upon only the geodesic separations (and their coordinate derivatives)
between the spacetime points. It makes no difference whether a box of classical
zero-point radiation is gradually or suddenly set into uniform acceleration;
the radiation in the interior retains the same correlation function except for
small end-point (Casimir) corrections. Thus in classical theory where
zero-point radiation is defined in terms of geodesic separations, there is
nothing physically comparable to the quantum distinction between the Minkowski
and Rindler vacuum states. It is also noted that relativistic classical systems
with internal potential energy must be spatially extended and can not be point
systems. Based upon the classical analysis, it is suggested that the claimed
heating effects of acceleration through the vacuum may not exist in nature.

Bilinear R-parity violation, with the single operator L H_u, does not require
any special flavor structure and can be naturally embedded in a GUT while
avoiding constraints from proton decay (unlike baryon-number-violating RPV).
The LSP in this scenario can be naturally long-lived, giving rise to displaced

leptons, are insensitive to events with such detector-scale displaced decays
owing to cuts on track quality and impact parameter. We demonstrate that for

be as low as ~450 GeV for squarks and ~40 GeV for LSPs. In some parts of

quantitatively compare these different possibilities, a new method analysing
angular momentum directions in modelled data is presented. It determines how
likely it is to find sets of angular momenta as concentrated and as close to a
polar orientation as is observed for the MW satellite orbital poles. The method
can be easily applied to orbital pole data from different models. The observed
distribution of satellite orbital poles is compared to published angular
momentum directions of subhalos derived from six cosmological state-of-the-art
simulations in the Aquarius project. This tests the possibility that
filamentary accretion might be able to naturally explain the satellite orbits
within the DoS. For the most likely alignment of main halo and MW disc spin,
the probability to reproduce the MW satellite orbital pole properties turns out
to be less than 0.5 per cent in Aquarius models. Even an isotropic distribution
of angular momenta has a higher likelihood to produce the observed
distribution. The two Via Lactea cosmological simulations give results similar
to the Aquarius simulations. Comparing instead with numerical models of
galaxy-interactions gives a probability of up to 90 per cent for some models to
draw the observed distribution of orbital poles from the angular momenta of

red-to-blue supergiants, morphological appearance of the regions, surface
brightness fluctuations, and the ages of clusters in the regions. We find
reasonably good agreement between these methods. We also find that young stars
are much more likely to be found in concentrated aggregates along spiral arms,
while older stars are more dispersed. These results are consistent with the
scenario that star formation is associated with the spiral arms, and stars form
primarily in star clusters and then disperse on short timescales to form the
field population. The locations of Wolf-Rayet stars are found to correlate with
the positions of many of the youngest regions, providing additional support for
our ability to accurately estimate ages. We address the effects of spatial

mechanism whereby general relativity is restored in massive halos or high

feel an extra force, as opposed to screened galaxies. The first step to study
differences between screened and unscreened galaxies is to create a 3D
screening map. We use N-body simulations to test and calibrate simple
approximations to determine the level of screening in galaxy catalogs. Sources
of systematic errors in the screening map due to observational inaccuracies are
modeled and their contamination is estimated. We then apply our methods to
create a map out to 200 Mpc in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey footprint using

130 GeV has been reported from analyses of data from the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT). The excess is potentially of great interest, as it could be
associated with the pair-annihilation of Galactic dark matter and the
subsequent production of monochromatic or internal bremsstrahlung gamma rays.
The 130 GeV excess appears when an optimized selection of the target region of
interest is employed, a procedure that depends upon the assumed dark matter
density profile. For the profiles producing an appreciable signal, these target
regions vastly overlap with the region corresponding to the so-called ""Fermi
bubbles"". We argue that the tentative evidence for a line feature is likely due
to hard photons in the Fermi bubbles regions, where the gamma-ray spectrum
contains a spectral break in the energy range of interest (100-150 GeV).
Although the origin of this broken power-law is unclear, it is probably related
to standard astrophysical processes and not to dark matter annihilation. A
broken power-law provides as good a fit as a line ""excess"", even within small
energy windows, and a significantly better fit for large energy windows.

indicate that the optimal sampling structures extract out the set of
frequencies that exhibits the highest signal-to-noise ratio among all spectral
sets of measure equal to the sampling rate. This can be attained through
filterbank sampling with uniform sampling at each branch with possibly
different rates, or through a single branch of modulation and filtering
followed by uniform sampling. These results reveal that for a large class of
channels, employing irregular nonuniform sampling sets, while typically
complicated to realize, does not provide capacity gain over uniform sampling
sets with appropriate preprocessing. Our findings demonstrate that aliasing or
scrambling of spectral components does not provide capacity gain, which is in

develop filtered two-fluid models for a gas-particle flow in the presence of an
isothermal, first-order, solid-catalyzed reaction of a gaseous species. As a
consequence of the filtering procedure, terms describing the filtered reaction
rate and filtered reactant dispersion need to be constituted in order to close
the filtered species balance equation. In this work, a constitutive relation
for filtered reaction rate is developed by performing fine-grid, two-fluid
model simulations of an isothermal, solid-catalyzed, first-order reaction in a
periodic domain. It is observed that the cluster-scale effectiveness factor,
defined as the ratio between the reaction rate observed in a fine-grid
simulation to that observed in a coarse-grid simulation, can be substantially
smaller than unity, and it manifests an inverted bell shape dependence on
filtered particle volume fraction in all simulation cases. Moreover, the
magnitude of the deviation in the cluster-scale effectiveness factor from unity
is a strong function of the meso-scale Thiele modulus and dimensionless filter
size. Thus coarse-grid simulations of a reacting gas-particle flow will
overestimate the reaction rate if the cluster-scale effectiveness factor is not

induced by its collision with collapsing outer layers during the early stages
of supernova explosions, can trigger a gravitational shock, which can readily
eject a small but significant fraction of the collapsing material at
ultra-relativistic speeds. The development of such shocks is a strong-field
effect arising in near-critical collapse in General Relativity and has been
observed in numerical simulations in various contexts, including in particular
radially perturbed neutron star collapse, albeit for a tiny range of initial
conditions. Therefore, this effect can be easily missed in numerical
simulations if the relevant parameter space is not exhaustively investigated.
In the proposed picture, the observed rarity of $\gamma$-ray bursts would be
explained if the relevant conditions for this mechanism appear in only about
one in every $10^4-10^5$ core collapse supernovae. We also mention the
possibility that near-critical collapse could play a role in powering the

exploits not just the line width but the entire line shape, and show how the
excellent spectral resolution of Astro-H can overcome its relatively poor
spatial resolution in making detailed infer- ences about the velocity field.
The spectrum is decomposed into distinct components, which can be
quantitatively analyzed using Gaussian mixture models. For instance, bulk flows
and sloshing produce components with offset means, while partial volume-
filling turbulence from AGN or galaxy stirring leads to components with
different widths. The offset between components allows us to measure gas bulk
motions and separate them from small-scale turbulence, while component
fractions and widths con- strain the emission weighted volume and turbulent
energy density in each component. We apply mixture modeling to a series of
analytic toy models as well as numerical simu- lations of clusters with cold
fronts and AGN feedback respectively. From Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Fisher
matrix estimates which include line blending and continuum contamination, we
show that the mixture parameters can be accurately constrained with Astro-H
spectra: at a \sim 10% level when components differ significantly in width, and
a \sim 1% level when they differ significantly in mean value. We also study
error scalings and use information criteria to determine when a mixture model
is preferred. Mixture modeling of spectra is a powerful technique which is
potentially applicable to other astrophysical scenarios.

replication, a data store waits for responses from a subset of replicas before
answering a query, without guaranteeing that read and write replica sets
intersect. As deployed in practice, these configurations provide only basic
eventual consistency guarantees, with no limit to the recency of data returned.
However, anecdotally, partial quorums are often ""good enough"" for practitioners
given their latency benefits. In this work, we explain why partial quorums are
regularly acceptable in practice, analyzing both the staleness of data they
return and the latency benefits they offer. We introduce Probabilistically
Bounded Staleness (PBS) consistency, which provides expected bounds on
staleness with respect to both versions and wall clock time. We derive a
closed-form solution for versioned staleness as well as model real-time
staleness for representative Dynamo-style systems under internet-scale
production workloads. Using PBS, we measure the latency-consistency trade-off

consistent systems frequently return consistent data within tens of

(LLPT) can be positive, negative, or zero. All three possibilities have been
found in Monte-Carlo simulations of a modified spherically symmetric two-scale
Jagla model. Since the liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) frequently lies in a
region of the phase diagram that is difficult to access experimentally, it is
of great interest to study critical phenomena in the supercritical region. We
therefore study the properties of the Widom line, which is defined in the
one-phase region above the critical point as the locus of maximum correlation
length as function of the ordering field at constant thermal field.
Asymptotically close to the critical point, the Widom line coincides with the
loci of the response function extrema, because all response functions can be
asymptotically expressed as functions of the diverging correlation length. We
find that the method of identifying the Widom line as the loci of heat capacity
maxima becomes unfruitful when the slope of the coexistence line approaches
zero in the $T$-$P$ plane. In this case the specific heat displays no maximum
in the one-phase region because for a horizontal phase coexistence line,
according to the Clapeyron equation, the enthalpy difference between the
coexisting phases is zero, and thus there can be no contribution to enthalpy
fluctuations from the critical fluctuations. The extension of the coexistence
line beyond the critical point into the one-phase region must in this case be
performed using density fluctuations; the line of compressibility maxima
remains well defined, though it bifurcates into a symmetrical pair of lines.
These findings agree well with the linear scaling theory of the LLCP by
Anisimov and collaborators.

features of the early light curve of SN 2006gy with the circumstellar medium
whose mass is about 15 Msun (the average mass-loss rate ~ 0.1 Msun/yr). Thus,
the progenitor of SN 2006gy is likely a very massive star. The density profile
of the circumstellar medium is not well constrained by the light curve modeling
only, but our modeling disfavors the circumstellar medium formed by steady mass
loss. The ejecta mass is estimated to be comparable to or less than 15 Msun and
the explosion energy is expected to be more than 4e51 erg. No 56Ni is required

These solutions are regular, localized on the brane and mirror symmetric with
respect to the extra dimension. They form a tower of ""excited branes"". The
study of some perturbations of the solutions reveals that the new solutions are
not stable. Finally, fermions are coupled to the scalar field by means of a
Yukawa potential and their localization in the background of the new solutions

rolling of a particle about surface asperities arising from the moments of the
fluctuating drag forces acting on the particle close to the surface. In this
work, the model is improved by using values of both the streamwise fluid
velocity andacceleration close to the wall obtained from Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS) of turbulentchannel flow. Using analysis and numerical
calculations of the drag force on a sphere near a wall in shear flow (O'Neill
(1968) and Lee and Balachandar (2010)) these values are used to obtain the
joint distribution of the moments of the fluctuating drag force and its time
derivative acting on a particle attached to a surface. In so doing the
influence of highly non-Gaussian forces (associated with the sweeping and
ejection events in a turbulent boundary layer) on short and long term
resuspension rates is examined for a sparse monolayer coverage of particles,
along with the dependence of the resuspension upon the timescale of the
particle motion attached to the surface, the ratio of the rms/ mean of the
removal force and the distribution of adhesive forces. Model predictions of the
fraction resuspended are compared with experimental results.

an analytic model of dark matter haloes and numerical mock data of weak lensing

matter distributions within clusters. We find that peak heights of the lensing
convergence map correlates rather poorly with the virial mass of haloes. The
correlation is tighter for the spherical overdensity mass with a higher mean
interior density. We examine the dependence of the halo shape on the peak
heights, and find that the rms scatter caused by the halo diversity scales
linearly with the peak heights with the proportionality factor of 0.1-0.2. The
noise originated from the halo shape is found to be comparable to the source
galaxy shape noise and the cosmic shear noise. We find the significant halo
orientation bias, i.e., weak lensing selected clusters on average have their
major axes aligned with the line-of-sight direction. We compute the orientation
bias using an analytic triaxial halo model and obtain results quite consistent

very precise separation such as, for instance, in neurobiological imaging a
separation into spines (pointlike structures) and dendrites (curvilinear
structures). Recently, applied harmonic analysis introduced powerful
methodologies to achieve this task, exploiting specifically designed
representation systems in which the components are sparsely representable,
combined with either performing $\ell_1$ minimization or thresholding on the

exploiting a surprisingly simple single-pass alternating thresholding method
applied to the two complementary frames: wavelets and curvelets. Utilizing the
fact that the coefficients are clustered geometrically, thereby exhibiting

that those wavefront sets are perfectly separated by the thresholding
procedure. Main ingredients of our analysis are the novel notion of cluster

  In this paper we provide the first thorough theoretical study of the

the image in a combined dictionary consisting of a curvelet tight frame and a

separating the image. Utilizing the fact that the coefficients are clustered

of $\rho_{dm}$ and $\rho_{de}$ is smaller, and the relative increment
(decrement) amount of the energy in the dark matter component is constrained to
be less than 9% (15%) at the 95.4% CL. By introducing the interaction, we find
that even when $c<1$ the big rip still can be avoided due to the existence of a
de Sitter solution at $z\rightarrow-1$. We show that this solution can not be
accomplished in the two simple models, while for the general model such a
solution can be achieved with a large $\beta$, and the big rip may be avoided
at the 95.4% CL.

numerous previous related investigations, is compared with a novel local
density approximation (LDA) for the ion-solvent interactions. It turns out that
within BCA the bulk phase diagrams, the two-point correlation functions, and
critical adsorption exhibit qualitative features which are not compatible with
the available experimental data. These discrepancies do not occur within the
proposed LDA. Further experimental investigations are suggested which assess
the reliability of the proposed LDA. This approach allows one to obtain a
consistent and rather general understanding of the effects of ions on solvent

experimentally detectable influence of ions on binary liquid mixtures due to
steric effects but not due to charge effects.

in which a discrete bound state of the full Hamiltonian approaches the energy
continuum as the system parameters are varied. We find in this case that at
least two regions exist yielding qualitatively different power law decay

the near zone the survival probability falls off according to a $t^{-1}$ power
law, and in the far zone it falls off as $t^{-3}$. We show that the timescale
$T_Q$ separating these two regions is inversely related to the gap between the
discrete bound state energy and the continuum threshold. In the case that the
bound state is absorbed into the continuum and vanishes, then the time scale
$T_Q$ diverges and the survival probability follows the $t^{-1}$ power law even
on asymptotic scales. Conversely, one could study the case of an anti-bound
state approaching the threshold before being ejected from the continuum to form
a bound state. Again the $t^{-1}$ power law dominates precisely at the point of
ejection.

the applied electric field. This famous relation, known as Ohm's law, is the
result of relaxation of the current due to charge carriers undergoing
collisions, predominantly with impurities and lattice vibrations in the
material. The field of spintronics, where the spin of the electron is
manipulated rather than its charge, has recently also led to interest in spin
currents. Contrary to charge currents, these spin currents can be subject to
strong relaxation due to collisions between different spin species, a
phenomenon known as spin drag. This effect has been observed for electrons in
semi-conductors\cite{Weber} and for cold fermionic atoms, where in both cases
it is reduced at low temperatures due to the fermionic nature of the particles.
Here, we perform a transport experiment using ultra-cold bosonic atoms and
observe spin drag for bosons for the first time. By lowering the temperature we
find that spin drag for bosons is enhanced in the quantum regime due to Bose
stimulation, which is in agreement with recent theoretical predictions. Our
work on bosonic transport shows that this field may be as rich as transport in
solid-state physics and may lead to the development of advanced devices in
atomtronics.

and modal regions, is contained in the derivatives of the probability density
function. Despite this importance, nonparametric estimation of higher order
derivatives of the density functions have received only relatively scant
attention. Kernel estimators of density functions are widely used as they
exhibit excellent theoretical and practical properties, though their
generalization to density derivatives has progressed more slowly due to the
mathematical intractabilities encountered in the crucial problem of bandwidth
(or smoothing parameter) selection. This paper presents the first fully
automatic, data-based bandwidth selectors for multivariate kernel density
derivative estimators. This is achieved by synthesizing recent advances in
matrix analytic theory which allow mathematically and computationally tractable
representations of higher order derivatives of multivariate vector valued
functions. The theoretical asymptotic properties as well as the finite sample
behaviour of the proposed selectors are studied. {In addition, we explore in
detail the applications of the new data-driven methods for two other
statistical problems: clustering and bump hunting. The introduced techniques
are combined with the mean shift algorithm to develop novel automatic,
nonparametric clustering procedures which are shown to outperform mixture-model
cluster analysis and other recent nonparametric approaches in practice.
Furthermore, the advantage of the use of smoothing parameters designed for
density derivative estimation for feature significance analysis for bump
hunting is illustrated with a real data example.

cylindrical symmetry in the flow environment cause the early decay to become
turbulent. This is identified from a rapid initial overshoot in the vortex
density above the value before the spin-down and its subsequent decay with a
t^(-3/2) time dependence. The high polarization of the vortices along the
rotation axis significantly suppresses the effective turbulent kinematic
viscosity below the values reported for more homogeneous turbulence and leads
to a laminar late-time response. The vortex dissipation down to T < 0.15Tc is
determined from the precession frequency of the polarized vortex configuration.

In particular, the second flight has led to results on the energy spectrum of
the secondary boron nuclei, and on the boron abundance relative to that of the
heavier primary parent nuclei, commonly quantified as the ""B/C abundance

through the Galaxy, and for the shape of the cosmic-ray source energy spectrum.
We use a Leaky-Box approximation of cosmic-ray propagation to obtain

spectrum is a relatively soft power law in energy E^{-\alpha}, with spectral
exponent \alpha = 2.37 \pm 0.12, and that the propagation path length
\Lambda(E) is described by a power law in energy with exponent \delta = 0.53

The value of \Lambda_0 is not well constrained but should be less than about
0.8 g cm^{-2}. Finally, we compare the data with numerical solutions of a
diffusive reacceleration model, which also indicates a soft source spectrum.

animal maintains a running estimate of its location during an excursion.
Evidence suggests it is both ancient and ubiquitous in nature. Over the past
century or so, canonical and neural network models have flourished, based on a
wide range of assumptions, justifications and supporting data. Despite the
importance of the phenomenon, consensus and unifying principles appear lacking.
A fundamental issue is the neural representation of space needed for biological
path integration. This paper presents a scheme to classify path integration
systems on the basis of the way the home vector records and updates the spatial
relationship between the animal and its home location. Four extended classes of
coordinate systems are used to unify and review both canonical and neural
network models of path integration, from the arthropod and mammalian
literature. This scheme demonstrates analytical equivalence between models
which may otherwise appear unrelated, and distinguishes between models which
may superficially appear similar. A thorough analysis is carried out of the
equational forms of important facets of path integration including updating,
steering, searching and systematic errors, using each of the four coordinate
systems. The type of available directional cue, namely allothetic or
idiothetic, is also considered. It is shown that on balance, the class of home
vectors which includes the geocentric Cartesian coordinate system, appears to
be the most robust for biological systems. A key conclusion is that deducing
computational structure from behavioural data alone will be difficult or
impossible, at least in the absence of an analysis of random errors.
Consequently it is likely that further theoretical insights into path
integration will require an in-depth study of the effect of noise on the four
classes of home vectors.

the expanding 1.4 GHz radio lobes have displaced the gas, compressing it into a
shell that appears as bright cool arms. Finally we show that the large-scale

With this criterion we can recover 98.6% of 3089 radio-detected SDSS-WISE
quasars with redshifts less than four and overcome the difficulty in selecting
quasars with redshifts between 2.2 and 3 from SDSS photometric data alone. We
also suggest another criterion involving the WISE color only, $W1-W2>0.57$, to
efficiently separate quasars with redshifts less than 3.2 from stars. In
addition, we compile a catalog of 5614 SDSS quasars detected by both WISE and
UKIDSS surveys and present their color-redshift relations in the optical and
infrared bands. By using the SDSS $ugriz$, UKIDSS YJHK and WISE W1- and W2-band
photometric data, we can efficiently select quasar candidates and increase the
photometric redshift reliability up to 87.0%. We discuss the implications of
our results on the future quasar surveys. An updated SDSS-WISE quasar catalog
consisting of 101,853 quasars with the recently released WISE all-sky data is

Bogomol'nyi type is well approximated by geodesic motion in M_n, the moduli
space of static n-solitons. There is an obvious quantization of this dynamics
wherein the wavefunction evolves according to the Hamiltonian H_0 equal to
(half) the Laplacian on M_n. Born-Oppenheimer reduction of analogous mechanical
systems suggests, however, that this simple Hamiltonian should receive
corrections including k, the scalar curvature of M_n, and C, the n-soliton
Casimir energy, which are usually difficult to compute, and whose effect on the
energy spectrum is unknown. This paper analyzes the spectra of H_0 and two
corrections to it suggested by work of Moss and Shiiki, namely H_1=H_0+k/4 and
H_2=H_1+C, in the simple but nontrivial case of a single CP^1 lump moving on
the two-sphere. Here M_1=TSO(3), a noncompact kaehler 6-manifold invariant
under an SO(3)xSO(3) action, whose geometry is well understood. The symmetry
gives rise to two conserved angular momenta, spin and isospin. A hidden
isometry of M_1 is found which implies that all three energy spectra are
symmetric under spin-isospin interchange. The Casimir energy is found exactly
on the zero section of TSO(3), and approximated numerically on the rest of M_1.
The lowest 19 eigenvalues of H_i are found for i=0,1,2, and their spin-isospin
and parity compared. The curvature corrections in H_1 lead to a qualitatively
unchanged low-level spectrum while the Casimir energy in H_2 leads to
significant changes. The scaling behaviour of the spectra under changes in the
radii of the domain and target spheres is analyzed, and it is found that the
disparity between the spectra of H_1 and H_2 is reduced when the target sphere

small changes in trait value. Then, traditionally, the evolutionary dynamics is
studied in the limit of vanishing mutational step sizes. In the present
approach, small but non-negligible mutational steps are considered. By means of
theoretical analysis in the limit of infinitely large populations, as well as
computer simulations, we demonstrate how discrete mutational steps affect the
patterns of evolutionary branching. We also argue that the average time to the

from long slit spectroscopy to understand their formation, evolution and their
influence on the evolution of disk galaxies. In this work we aim to determine
the gas metallicity distribution of a sample of 20 barred early-type galaxies.
We compare the nebular and stellar metallicity distributions to conclude about
the origin of the warm gas. We compare the results of nebular emission
metallicities using different semi-empirical methods. We carry out AGN
diagnostic diagrams along the radius to determine the radius of influence of
the AGN and the nuclei nature of the studied galaxies. We then derive the gas
metallicities along the bars and compare the results to the distribution of
stellar metallicities in the same regions. Most of the gas emission is
centrally concentrated, although 15 galaxies also show emission along the bar.
In the central regions, gas oxygen abundances are in the range 12+$\log$(O/H)=
8.4-9.1. The nebular metallicity gradients are very shallow in the bulge and
bar regions. For three galaxies (one of them a LINER), the gas metallicities
lie well below the stellar ones in the bulge region. These results do not
depend on the choice of the semi-empirical calibration used to calculate the
abundances. We see that the galaxies with the lowest abundances are those with
the largest rotational velocities. The presence of gas of significantly lower
metallicity than the stellar abundances in three of our galaxies, points to an
external origin as the source of the gas that fuels the present star formation
in the centre of some early-type barred galaxies. The fact that the bar/disk
nebular metallicities are higher than the central ones might be indicating that
the gas could be accreted via cooling flows instead of radial accretion from
gas sitting in the outer parts of the disk.

dominated by dielectronic recombination (DR) resonances associated with 3s-3p

3-N' and 2-N' core excitations DR. We compare our experimental results to
state-of-the-art multi-configuration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations and find
significant differences, both in resonance energies and strengths. We have
extracted the DR contributions from the measured MBRRC data and transformed
them into a plasma recombination rate coefficient (PRRC) for temperatures in
the range of 10^3 to 10^7 K. We show that the previously recommended DR data
for Fe XII significantly underestimate the PRRC at temperatures relevant for
both photoionized plasmas (PPs) and collisionaly ionized plasmas (CPs). This is
to be contrasted with our MCBP PRRC results which agree with the experiment to
within 30% at PP temperatures and even better at CP temperatures. We find this
agreement despite the disagreement shown by the detailed comparison between our
MCBP and experimental MBRRC results. Lastly, we present a simple parameterized

generalize this construction to higher dimensions. The appropriate dual
description in d dimensions, additionally to a (non-symmetric) tensor field
$h_{\mu\nu}$, involves an extra rank-(d-1) field equivalently represented by
the torsion rank-3 tensor. The symmetry condition for $h_{\mu\nu}$ arises
on-shell as a consequence of the field equations. The action principle of the
dual theory is formulated. The focus has been made on four dimensions. Solving
one of the fields in terms of the other and putting back in the action one
obtains two other equivalent formulations of the theory in which the action is
quadratic in derivatives. In one of these representations the theory is
formulated entirely in terms of a rank-2 non-symmetric tensor $h_{\mu\nu}$.
This quadratic theory is not identical to the Fierz-Pauli theory and contains
the coupling between the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of $h_{\mu\nu}$.
Nevertheless, the only singularity in the propagator is the same as in the
Fierz-Pauli theory so that only the massive spin-2 particle is propagating. In
the other representation, the theory is formulated in terms of the torsion
rank-3 tensor only. We analyze the conditions which follow from the field
equations and show that they restrict to 5 degrees of freedom thus producing an
alternative description to the massive spin-2 particle. A generalization to

involved in such forecasts, proposed methods hardly ever characterize their

hindsight, applications of these approaches must quantify how reliable
different indicators are in avoiding false alarms, and how sensitive they are
to missing subtle warning signs. We propose a model based approach in order to
quantify this trade-off between reliability and sensitivity and allow
comparisons between different indicators. We show these error rates can be
quite severe for common indicators even under favorable assumptions, and also
illustrate how a model-based indicator can improve this performance. We
demonstrate how the performance of an early warning indicator varies in
different data sets, and suggest that uncertainty quantification become a more
central part of early warning predictions.

hard combinatorial problems to allow faster algorithms than for general
unstructured or random instances. For SAT and its counting version #SAT, hidden
structure has been exploited in terms of decomposability and strong backdoor
sets. Decomposability can be considered in terms of the treewidth of a graph
that is associated with the given CNF formula, for instance by considering
clauses and variables as vertices of the graph, and making a variable adjacent
with all the clauses it appears in. On the other hand, a strong backdoor set of
a CNF formula is a set of variables such that each possible partial assignment
to this set moves the formula into a fixed class for which (#)SAT can be solved
in polynomial time.
  In this paper we combine the two above approaches. In particular, we study
the algorithmic question of finding a small strong backdoor set into the class
W_t of CNF formulas whose associated graphs have treewidth at most t. The main
results are positive:
  (1) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F and two
constants k,t\ge 0, either finds a strong W_t-backdoor set of size at most 2^k,
or concludes that F has no strong W_t-backdoor set of size at most k.
  (2) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F, computes the
number of satisfying assignments of F or concludes that sb_t(F)>k, for any pair
of constants k,t\ge 0. Here, sb_t(F) denotes the size of a smallest strong
W_t-backdoor set of F.
  The significance of our results lies in the fact that they allow us to
exploit algorithmically a hidden structure in formulas that is not accessible
by any one of the two approaches (decomposability, backdoors) alone. Already a
backdoor size 1 on top of treewidth 1 (i.e., sb_1(F)=1) entails formulas of
arbitrarily large treewidth and arbitrarily large cycle cutsets.

rewriting capability into logics of fixed-point definitions towards
additionally supporting recursive specifications. In particular, we describe a
natural deduction calculus that adds a form of ""closed-world"" equality - a key
ingredient to supporting fixed-point definitions - to deduction modulo, a
framework for extending a logic with a rewriting layer operating on formulas.
We show that our calculus enjoys strong normalizability when the rewrite system
satisfies general properties and we demonstrate its usefulness in specifying
and reasoning about syntax-based descriptions. The integration of closed-world
equality into deduction modulo leads us to reconfigure the elimination
principle for this form of equality in a way that, for the first time, resolves
issues regarding the stability of finite proofs under reduction.

cardinality of a set $S$ of black vertices (whereas vertices in

finitely many applications of ""the (classical) color change rule"": a white

introduce here a probabilistic color change rule (pccr) which is a natural
generalization of the classical color change rule. We introduce a theory of
probabilistic zero forcing arising out of the pccr; the theory yields a
quantity $P_A(G)$, which can be viewed as the probability that a graph $G$ with
an initial black set $A$ will be converted entirely to the color black. We also
interpret the evolution of the sample spaces of this theory as a Markov

stars and between a neutron star and a stellar-mass black hole. We focus on the

We also calculate fallback rates and analyze the properties of the dynamically
ejected matter. Last but not least we address the electromagnetic transients

  The canonical nsns merger case ejects more than 1% of a solar mass of
extremely neutron-rich ($Y_e\sim 0.03$) material, an amount that is consistent
with double neutron star mergers being a major source of r-process in the
galaxy. nsbh collisions eject very large amounts of matter ($\sim 0.15$ \msun)
which seriously constrains their admissible occurrence rates. The compact
object collision rate must therefore be less, likely much less, than 10% of the
nsns merger rate. The radioactively decaying ejecta produce optical-UV
""macronova"" which, for the canonical merger case, peak after $\sim 0.4$ days
with a luminosity of $\sim 10^{42}$ erg/s. nsns (nsbh) collisions reach up to 3
(7) times larger peak luminosities. The dynamic ejecta deposit a kinetic energy
comparable to a supernova in the ambient medium. The canonical merger case
releases approximately $2 \times 10^{50}$ erg, the most extreme (but likely
rare) cases deposit kinetic energies of up to $10^{52}$ erg. The deceleration
of this mildly relativistic material by the ambient medium produces long
lasting radio flares. A canonical ns$^2$ merger at the detection horizon of

one with crucial consequences to the quest for gravitational waves. We present
a large set of numerical simulations that focus on the electromagnetic signals
that emerge from the dynamically ejected sub-relativistic material. These
outflows produce on a time scale of a day macronovae - short-lived IR to UV
signals powered by radioactive decay. The interaction of this outflow with the
surrounding matter inevitably leads to a long-lasting remnant. The expected
radio signals of these remnants last longer than a year, when the
sub-relativistic ejecta dominate the emission. We discuss their detectability
in 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz and compare it with the detectability of short GRBs'
orphan afterglows (which are produced by a different component of this
outflow). Mergers with characteristics similar to those of the Galactic neutron
star binary population (similar masses and typical circum-merger Galactic disk
density of ~1cm^-3) taking place at the detection horizon of advanced GW
detectors (300 Mpc) yield 1.4 GHz [150 MHz] signals of ~50 [300] microJy. The
signal on time scales of weeks, is dominated by the mildly and/or
ultra-relativistic outflow, which is not accounted for by our simulations, and
is expected to be even brighter. Upcoming all sky surveys are expected to
detect a few dozen, and possibly more, merger remnants at any given time

superconductor (FTSC) as a strongly correlated topological state which can be
achieved by inducing superconductivity into an Abelian fractional quantum Hall
state, through the proximity effect. When the proximity coupling is weak, the
FTSC has the same topological order as its parent state and is thus Abelian.
However, upon increasing the proximity coupling, the bulk gap of such an
Abelian FTSC closes and reopens resulting in a new topological order: a
non-Abelian FTSC. Using several arguments we will conjecture that the conformal
field theory (CFT) that describes the edge state of the non-Abelian FTSC is
$U(1)/Z_2$ orbifold theory and use this to write down the ground-state wave
function. Further, we predict FTSC based on the Laughlin state at $\nu=1/m$
filling to host fractionalized Majorana zero modes bound to superconducting
vortices. These zero modes are non-Abelian quasiparticles which is evident in
their quantum dimension of $d_m=\sqrt{2m}$. Using the multi-quasi-particle wave
function based on the edge CFT, we derive the projective braid matrix for the
zero modes. Finally, the connection between the non-Abelian FTSCs and the
$Z_{2m}$ rotor model with a similar topological order is illustrated.

by confining the ion beam mixing length to about 2 monolayers. This corresponds
to the escape depth of secondary ions, the fundamental depth resolution

context of random matrix theory and two-color quantum chromodynamics. We
investigate the level spacing distributions of eigenvalues that remain real or
become complex conjugate pairs under the perturbation. We work out analytical
surmises from small matrices and show that they describe the level spacings of
large random matrices. As expected from symmetry arguments, these level
spacings also apply to the overlap Dirac operator for two-color QCD with
chemical potential.

includes particle-vibration coupling is applied to the charge-exchange channel.
Spin-dipole excitation spectra are calculated an compared to available data for
$^{90}$Zr and $^{208}$Pb. A significant fragmentation is found for all three
angular-momentum components of the spin-dipole strength as a result of
particle-vibration coupling, as well as a shift of a portion of the strength to
higher energy. A high-energy tail is formed in the strength distribution that
linearly decreases with energy. Using a model-independent sum rule,the
corresponding neutron skin thickness is estimated and shown to be consistent
with values obtained at the mean-field level.

investigated by means of two-dimensional electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell
simulations with various Alfven Mach numbers, ion-to-electron mass ratios, and
the upstream electron beta_e (the ratio of the thermal pressure to the magnetic
pressure). We found electrons are effectively accelerated at a super-high Mach
number shock (MA~30) with a mass ratio of M/m=100 and beta_e=0.5. The electron
shock surfing acceleration is an effective mechanism for accelerating the
particles toward the relativistic regime even in two dimensions with the large
mass ratio. Buneman instability excited at the leading edge of the foot in the
super-high Mach number shock results in a coherent electrostatic potential
structure. While multi-dimensionality allows the electrons to escape from the
trapping region, they can interact with the strong electrostatic field several
times. Simulation runs in various parameter regimes indicate that the electron
shock surfing acceleration is an effective mechanism for producing relativistic
particles in extremely-high Mach number shocks in supernova remnants, provided
that the upstream electron temperature is reasonably low.

pandemics in the last century (1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2). The 2009
A(H1N1) was classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the fourth
pandemic. Influenza has a high evolution rate, which makes vaccine design
challenging. We here consider an approach for early detection of new dominant
strains. By clustering the 2009 A(H1N1) sequence data, we found two main
clusters. We then define a metric to detect the emergence of dominant strains.
We show on historical H3N2 data that this method is able to identify a cluster
around an incipient dominant strain before it becomes dominant. For example,
for H3N2 as of March 30, 2009, the method detects the cluster for the new
A/British Columbia/RV1222/2009 strain. This strain detection tool would appear
to be useful for annual influenza vaccine selection.
