models was formulated as a noncommutative Kubo formula in Refs.
\cite{BELLISSARD:1994xj,Schulz-Baldes:1998vm,Schulz-Baldes:1998oq}. This
formula was derived directly in the thermodynamic limit, within the framework
of $C^*$-algebras and noncommutative calculi defined over infinite spaces. As
such, the numerical implementation of the formalism encountered fundamental
obstacles. The present work defines a $C^*$-algebra and an approximate
noncommutative calculus over a finite real-space torus, which naturally leads
to an approximate finite-volume noncommutative Kubo formula, amenable on a
computer. For finite temperatures and dissipation, it is shown that this
approximate formula converges exponentially fast to its thermodynamic limit,
which is the exact noncommutative Kubo formula. The approximate noncommutative
Kubo formula is then deconstructed to a form that is implementable on a
computer and simulations of the quantum transport in a 2-dimensional disordered
lattice gas in a magnetic field are presented.

solved for the quantum numbers $\jO=0,1,2,3,4$ and $\bjz=\pm 1$. This
eigenvalue problem admits \emph{ambiguous} solutions for $0<|\bjz|<\jO$ whereas
the solutions for $\bjz=0$ and $\bjz=\pm \jO$ are \emph{unique}. In order to
attain some (at least approximative) solutions of the energy eigenvalue problem
one tries a factorized ansatz for the wave function and thus splits off the
angular problem (with its ambiguous solutions) from the residual radial
problem. The latter does, as usual, finally fix the energy eigenvalues. But it
is just by this procedure that the ambiguity of the angular problem is
transferred to most of the energy levels which thereby become doubled. The
corresponding doubling energy amounts to (roughly) one percent of the total
binding energy and is, however, of purely \emph{electric} origin, since
magnetism is completely neglected. Indeed, the charge distributions of both
positronium constituents (i.e.\ electron and positron) do inherit their
ambiguity from the ambiguous solution of the angular eigenvalue problem
($\leadsto$ charge ""dimorphism""); and naturally the dimorphic configurations
must then possess slightly different interaction energies of the electrostatic

systems, a notion of {\em canonical conservative dynamics} with respect to a
positive, differentiable stationary density $\rho(x)$ is introduced:
$\dot{x}=j(x)$ in which $\nabla\cdot\big(\rho(x)j(x)\big)=0$. Such systems have
a conserved ""generalized free energy function"" $F[u]$ $=$ $\int
u(x,t)\ln\big(u(x,t)/\rho(x)\big)dx$ in phase space with a density flow
$u(x,t)$ satisfying $\partial u_t =-\nabla\cdot(ju)$. Any general stochastic
diffusion process without detailed balance, in terms of its Fokker-Planck
equation, can be decomposed into a reversible diffusion process with detailed
balance and a canonical conservative dynamics. This decomposition can be
rigorously established in a function space with inner product defined as
$\langle\phi,\psi\rangle=\int\rho^{-1}(x)\phi(x)\psi(x)dx$. Furthermore, a law
for balancing $F[u]$ can be obtained: The non-positive $dF[u(x,t)]/dt$ $=$
$E_{in}(t)-e_p(t)$ where the ""source"" $E_{in}(t)\ge 0$ and the ""sink""
$e_p(t)\ge 0$ are known as house-keeping heat and entropy production,
respectively. A reversible diffusion has $E_{in}(t)=0$. For a linear
(Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) diffusion process, our decomposition is equivalent to the
previous approaches developed by R. Graham and P. Ao, as well as the theory of
large deviations. In terms of two different formulations of time reversal for a

350,000 RAVE survey stellar spectra using locally linear embedding, a
dimensionality reduction method which enables representing the complex spectral
morphology in a low dimensional projected space while still preserving the
properties of the local neighborhoods of spectra. We find that the majority of
all spectra in the database ~90-95% belong to normal single stars, but there is
also a significant population of several types of peculiars. Among them the
most populated groups are those of various types of spectroscopic binary and
chromospherically active stars. Both of them include several thousands of
spectra. Particularly the latter group offers significant further investigation
opportunities since activity of stars is a known proxy of stellar ages.
Applying the same classification procedure to the sample of normal single stars
alone shows that the shape of the projected manifold in two dimensional space
correlates with stellar temperature, surface gravity and metallicity.

article proposes a new framework for nonparametric Bayes inference in which the
prior distribution for a possibly infinite-dimensional parameter is decomposed
into two parts: an informative prior on a finite set of functionals, and a
nonparametric conditional prior for the parameter given the functionals. Such
priors can be easily constructed from standard nonparametric prior
distributions in common use, and inherit the large support of the standard
priors upon which they are based. Additionally, posterior approximations under
these informative priors can generally be made via minor adjustments to
existing Markov chain approximation algorithms for standard nonparametric prior

Paul A. M. Dirac (1927), John von Neumann (1927a) developed the modern Hilbert
space formalism of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we focus on Jordan and von
Neumann. Central to the formalisms of both are expressions for conditional
probabilities of finding some value for one quantity given the value of
another. Beyond that Jordan and von Neumann had very different views about the
appropriate formulation of problems in quantum mechanics. For Jordan, unable to
let go of the analogy to classical mechanics, the solution of such problems
required the identication of sets of canonically conjugate variables, i.e., p's
and q's. For von Neumann, not constrained by the analogy to classical
mechanics, it required only the identication of a maximal set of commuting
operators with simultaneous eigenstates. He had no need for p's and q's. Jordan
and von Neumann also stated the characteristic new rules for probabilities in
quantum mechanics somewhat differently. Jordan (1927b) was the first to state
those rules in full generality. Von Neumann (1927a) rephrased them and, in a
subsequent paper (von Neumann, 1927b), sought to derive them from more basic
considerations. In this paper we reconstruct the central arguments of these
1927 papers by Jordan and von Neumann and of a paper on Jordan's approach by
Hilbert, von Neumann, and Nordheim (1928). We highlight those elements in these
papers that bring out the gradual loosening of the ties between the new quantum
formalism and classical mechanics.

performed by particle-in-cell (PIC) methods. However, due to the well-known
numerical noise, it is challenging to use PIC methods to get a precise
description of the distribution function in phase space. To control the
numerical error, we introduce an adaptive phase-space remapping which
regularizes the particle distribution by periodically reconstructing the
distribution function on a hierarchy of phase-space grids with high-order
interpolations. The positivity of the distribution function can be preserved by
using a local redistribution technique. The method has been successfully
applied to a set of classical plasma problems in one dimension. In this paper,
we present the algorithm for the two dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equations. An
efficient Poisson solver with infinite domain boundary conditions is used. The

task. Categorization becomes more useful as the collection of resources
increases. Large collections of books, movies, and web pages, for instance, are
cataloged in libraries, organized in databases and classified in directories,
respectively. However, the usual largeness of these collections requires a vast
endeavor and an outrageous expense to organize manually.
  Recent research is moving towards developing automated classifiers that
reduce the increasing costs and effort of the task. Little work has been done
analyzing the appropriateness of and exploring how to harness the annotations
provided by users on social tagging systems as a data source. Users on these
systems save resources as bookmarks in a social environment by attaching
annotations in the form of tags. It has been shown that these tags facilitate
retrieval of resources not only for the annotators themselves but also for the
whole community. Likewise, these tags provide meaningful metadata that refers
to the content of the resources.
  In this thesis, we deal with the utilization of these user-provided tags in
search of the most accurate classification of resources as compared to
expert-driven categorizations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
research work performing actual classification experiments utilizing social
tags. By exploring the characteristics and nature of these systems and the
underlying folksonomies, this thesis sheds new light on the way of getting the
most out of social tags for the sake of automated resource classification
tasks. Therefore, we believe that the contributions in this work are of utmost
interest for future researchers in the field, as well as for the scientific
community in order to better understand these systems and further utilize the

mildly non-linear regime is essential for comparison with data from next
generation galaxy surveys. In a recent approach one follows the time evolution
of correlators directly and finds a hierarchy of evolution equations with
increasing order (Pietroni 2008). So far, in this so called time
renormalisation group method the trispectrum was neglected in order to obtain a
closed set of equations. In this work we study the influence of the trispectrum
on the evolution of the power spectrum. In order to keep the numerical cost at
a manageable level we use the tree-level trispectrum from Eulerian perturbation
theory. In comparison to numerical simulations we find improvement in the
mildly non-linear regime up to k = 0.25 h/Mpc. Beyond k = 0.25 h/Mpc the
perturbative description of the trispectrum fails and the method performs worse
than without the trispectrum included. Our results reinforce the conceptual
advantage of the time renormalisation group method with respect to perturbation
theory.

classes SLUR (Single Lookahead Unit Refutation), introduced in 1995, and UC
(Unit refutation Complete), introduced in 1994.
  The class SLUR, introduced in [Annexstein et al, 1995], is the class of
clause-sets for which unit-clause-propagation (denoted by r_1) detects
unsatisfiability, or where otherwise iterative assignment, avoiding obviously
false assignments by look-ahead, always yields a satisfying assignment. It is
natural to consider how to form a hierarchy based on SLUR. Such investigations
were started in [Cepek et al, 2012] and [Balyo et al, 2012]. We present what we
consider the ""limit hierarchy"" SLUR_k, based on generalising r_1 by r_k, that
is, using generalised unit-clause-propagation introduced in [Kullmann, 1999,
2004].
  The class UC, studied in [Del Val, 1994], is the class of Unit refutation
Complete clause-sets, that is, those clause-sets for which unsatisfiability is
decidable by r_1 under any falsifying assignment. For unsatisfiable clause-sets
F, the minimum k such that r_k determines unsatisfiability of F is exactly the
""hardness"" of F, as introduced in [Ku 99, 04]. For satisfiable F we use now an
extension mentioned in [Ansotegui et al, 2008]: The hardness is the minimum k
such that after application of any falsifying partial assignments, r_k
determines unsatisfiability. The class UC_k is given by the clause-sets which
have hardness <= k. We observe that UC_1 is exactly UC.
  UC_k has a proof-theoretic character, due to the relations between hardness
and tree-resolution, while SLUR_k has an algorithmic character. The
correspondence between r_k and k-times nested input resolution (or tree
resolution using clause-space k+1) means that r_k has a dual nature: both
algorithmic and proof theoretic. This corresponds to a basic result of this
paper, namely SLUR_k = UC_k.

  main theorem",,,,"math.CO math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many important theorems in combinatorics, such as Szemer\'edi's theorem on
arithmetic progressions and the Erd\H{o}s-Stone Theorem in extremal graph
theory, can be phrased as statements about independent sets in uniform
hypergraphs. In recent years, an important trend in the area has been to extend
such classical results to the so-called sparse random setting. This line of
research culminated recently in the breakthroughs of Conlon and Gowers and of
Schacht, who developed general tools for solving problems of this type.
  In this paper, we provide a third, completely different approach to proving
extremal and structural results in sparse random sets. We give a structural
characterization of the independent sets in a large class of uniform
hypergraphs by showing that every independent set is almost contained in one of
a small number of relatively sparse sets. We then derive many interesting
results as fairly straightforward consequences of this abstract theorem. In
particular, we prove the well-known conjecture of Kohayakawa, \L uczak and
R\""odl, a probabilistic embedding lemma for sparse graphs. We also give
alternative proofs of many of the results of Conlon and Gowers and Schacht, and
obtain their natural counting versions, which in some cases are considerably
stronger. We moreover prove a sparse version of the Erd\H{o}s-Frankl-R\""odl
Theorem on the number of H-free graphs and extend a result of R\""odl and
Ruci\'nski on Ramsey properties in sparse random graphs to the general,
non-symmetric setting.
  We remark that similar results have been discovered independently by Saxton
and Thomason, and that, in parallel to this work, Conlon, Gowers, Samotij and
Schacht have proved a sparse analogue of the counting lemma for subgraphs of
the random graph G(n,p), which may be viewed as a version of the K\L R
conjecture that is stronger in some ways and weaker in others.

combinatorial complexity resulting from practical applications of generalized

tensor in the HFB theory. The resultant formula is simpler and more compact
than the traditional description of matrix elements of general many-body

learning, natural language processing, etc. are naturally structured as acyclic
graphs. These datasets, particularly those in bio-informatics and computational
epidemiology, have grown tremendously over the last decade or so. Increasingly,
as a consequence, there is a need to build and evaluate various strategies for
processing acyclic structured graphs. Most of the proposed research models the
real world acyclic structures as random graphs, i.e., they are generated by
randomly selecting a subset of edges from all possible edges. Unfortunately the
graphs thus generated have predictable and degenerate structures, i.e., the
resulting graphs will always have almost the same degree distribution and very
short paths.
  Specifically, we show that if $O(n \log n \log n)$ edges are added to a
binary tree of $n$ nodes then with probability more than $O(1/(\log n)^{1/n})$
the depth of all but $O({\log \log n} ^{\log \log n})$ vertices of the dag
collapses to 1. Experiments show that irregularity, as measured by distribution
of length of random walks from root to leaves, is also predictable and small.
The degree distribution and random walk length properties of real world graphs
from these domains are significantly different from random graphs of similar
vertex and edge size.

establish deterministic conditions under which exact recovery of the low-rank

arises with traffic anomaly detection in backbone networks, and subsumes
compressed sensing as well as the timely low-rank plus sparse matrix recovery
tasks encountered in matrix decomposition problems. Leveraging the ability of
$\ell_1$- and nuclear norms to recover sparse and low-rank matrices, a convex
program is formulated to estimate the unknowns. Analysis and simulations
confirm that the said convex program can recover the unknowns for sufficiently
low-rank and sparse enough components, along with a compression matrix
possessing an isometry property when restricted to operate on sparse vectors.
When the low-rank, sparse, and compression matrices are drawn from certain
random ensembles, it is established that exact recovery is possible with high
probability. First-order algorithms are developed to solve the nonsmooth convex
optimization problem with provable iteration complexity guarantees. Insightful
tests with synthetic and real network data corroborate the effectiveness of the
novel approach in unveiling traffic anomalies across flows and time, and its

recorded by the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode

distinguished the moss regions from the rest of the active region by defining a
low density cut-off as derived by Tripathi et al. (2010). We have carried out a
very careful analysis of the EIS wavelength calibration based on the method
described in Young et al. (2012). For spectral lines having maximum sensitivity
between log T = 5.85 and log T = 6.25 K, we find that the velocity distribution
peaks at around 0 km/s with an estimated error of 4-5 km/s. The width of the
distribution decreases with temperature. The mean of the distribution shows a
blue shift which increases with increasing temperature and the distribution
also shows asymmetries towards blue-shift. Comparing these results with
observables predicted from different coronal heating models, we find that these
results are consistent with both steady and impulsive heating scenarios.
However, the fact that there are a significant number of pixels showing
velocity amplitudes that exceed the uncertainty of 5 km s$^{-1}$ is suggestive
of impulsive heating. Clearly, further observational constraints are needed to
distinguish between these two heating scenarios.

The challenge was to form a group that would be the first to find the locations
of ten moored weather balloons across the United States. We consider a model in
which $N$ people (who can form groups) are located in some topology with a
fixed coverage volume around each person's geographical location. We consider
various topologies where the players can be located such as the Euclidean

complex network theory provides a tool to describe either important nodes, or
structures that exist in the networks, at different topological scale. This can
then provide distinct information for time series of different dynamical
systems. In this paper, we systematically investigate the recurrence-based
phase space network of order $k$ that has previously been used to specify
different types of dynamics in terms of the motif ranking from a different
perspective. Globally, we find that the network size scales with different
scale exponents and the degree distribution follows a quasi-symmetric bell
shape around the value of $2k$ with different values of degree variance from

with respect to spectral constraints. We consider here a Heisenberg spin chain,

  overlap with arXiv:1204.4000",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) suffer from a prohibitively high decoding
complexity unless the low-complexity decodability property is taken into
consideration in the STBC design. For this purpose, several families of STBCs
that involve a reduced decoding complexity have been proposed, notably the
multi-group decodable and the fast decodable (FD) codes. Recently, a new family
of codes that combines both of these families namely the fast group decodable
(FGD) codes was proposed. In this paper, we propose a new construction scheme
for rate-1 FGD codes for 2^a transmit antennas. The proposed scheme is then
applied to the case of four transmit antennas and we show that the new rate-1
FGD code has the lowest worst-case decoding complexity among existing
comparable STBCs. The coding gain of the new rate-1 code is optimized through
constellation stretching and proved to be constant irrespective of the
underlying QAM constellation prior to normalization. Next, we propose a new
rate-2 FD STBC by multiplexing two of our rate-1 codes by the means of a
unitary matrix. Also a compromise between rate and complexity is obtained
through puncturing our rate-2 FD code giving rise to a new rate-3/2 FD code.
The proposed codes are compared to existing codes in the literature and
simulation results show that our rate-3/2 code has a lower average decoding
complexity while our rate-2 code maintains its lower average decoding
complexity in the low SNR region. If a time-out sphere decoder is employed, our
proposed codes outperform existing codes at high SNR region thanks to their
lower worst-case decoding complexity.

effects of matter and gauge fields. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107,
275301 (2011)] a method for simulating compact Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED)
using Bose-Einstein condensates has been suggested. We suggest an alternative
approach, which relies on single atoms in an optical lattice, carrying 2l+1
internal levels, which converges rapidly to cQED as l increases. That enables
the simulation of cQED in 2+1 dimensions in both the weak and the strong
coupling regimes, hence allowing to probe confinement as well as other
nonperturbative effects of the theory. We provide an explicit construction for
the case l=1 which is sufficient for simulating the effect of confinement
between two external static charges.

1905 Einstein showed that a change in energy is associated with a change in
inertial mass equal to the change in energy divided by c2. In 1900 Poincar\'e
considered a device creating and emitting electromagnetic waves. The device
emits energy in all directions. As a result of the energy being emitted, it
recoils. No motion of any other material body compensates for the recoil at
that moment. Poincar\'e found that as a result of the recoil of the oscillator,
in the moving system, the oscillator generating the electromagnetic energy
suffers an ""apparent complementary force"". In addition, in order to demonstrate
the non-violation of the theorem of the motion of the centre of gravity,
Poincar\'e needed an arbitrary convention, the ""fictitious fluid"". Einstein
demonstrated that if the inertial mass E/c2 is associated with the energy E,
and on assuming the inseparability of the theorem of the conservation of mass
and that of energy, then - at least as a first approximation - the theorem of
the conservation of the motion of the centre of gravity is also valid for all
systems in which electromagnetic processes take place. Before 1905 (and also
afterwards) Poincar\'e did not explore the inertial mass-energy equivalence. In
1908 Einstein wrote the German physicist Johannes Stark, ""I was a little
surprised to see that you did not acknowledge my priority regarding the
relationship between inertial mass and energy"".

their synchronization, but unlike Einstein, magnet and conductor (asymmetries
in Lorentz's theory regarding the explanation of Faraday's induction) or
chasing a light beam and overtaking it, were not a matter of great concern for
him. In 1905 Poincar\'e elaborated Lorentz's electron theory from 1904 in two
papers entitled ""Sur la dynamique de l'electron"". In May 1905 he sent three
letters to Lorentz at the same time that Albert Einstein wrote his famous May
1905 letter to Conrad Habicht: ""I can promise you in return four works,[...]
The fourth paper is only a rough draft at this point, and is an electrodynamics
of moving bodies"". In the May 1905 letters to Lorentz Poincar\'e presented the
basic equations of his 1905 Dynamics of the Electron. Hence, in May 1905,
Poincar\'e and Einstein both had drafts of papers pertaining to the principle
of relativity. Poincar\'e's draft led to a space-time mathematical theory of
groups at the basis of which stood the postulate of relativity, and Einstein's
draft led to a kinematical theory of relativity. Poincar\'e did not renounce
the ether. He wrote a new law of addition of velocities, but he did not abandon
the tacit assumptions made about the nature of time, simultaneity, and space
measurements implicit in Newtonian kinematics. Although he questioned absolute
time and absolute simultaneity, he did not make new kinematical tacit
assumptions about space and time. He also did not require reciprocity of the
appearances, and therefore did not discover relativity of simultaneity: these
are the main hallmarks of Einstein's special theory of relativity.
Nevertheless, as shown by other writers, Poincar\'e's theory had influenced
later scientists especially Hermann Minkowski.

one is loss function approach and the other is uncertainty set approach. The
loss function approach is applied to major learning algorithms such as support
vector machine (SVM) and boosting methods. The loss function represents the
penalty of the decision function on the training samples. In the learning
algorithm, the empirical mean of the loss function is minimized to obtain the
classifier. Against a backdrop of the development of mathematical programming,
nowadays learning algorithms based on loss functions are widely applied to
real-world data analysis. In addition, statistical properties of such learning
algorithms are well-understood based on a lots of theoretical works. On the
other hand, the learning method using the so-called uncertainty set is used in
hard-margin SVM, mini-max probability machine (MPM) and maximum margin MPM. In
the learning algorithm, firstly, the uncertainty set is defined for each binary
label based on the training samples. Then, the best separating hyperplane
between the two uncertainty sets is employed as the decision function. This is
regarded as an extension of the maximum-margin approach. The uncertainty set
approach has been studied as an application of robust optimization in the field
of mathematical programming. The statistical properties of learning algorithms
with uncertainty sets have not been intensively studied. In this paper, we
consider the relation between the above two approaches. We point out that the
uncertainty set is described by using the level set of the conjugate of the
loss function. Based on such relation, we study statistical properties of
learning algorithms using uncertainty sets.

is the raison d'etre of the field of learning theory, and of the ERM (Empirical

not deal with computational complexity. We discuss two particular problems for

different from that assumed in the traditional 'potential + force-free' field

separated by numerous non-force-free elements (tangential discontinuities)
which are neglected in the traditional field picture. An incorporation of these
elements into the model implies a dynamical rather than statical character of
equilibrium of the field configuration. A transition of the system into flaring
can be triggered by the ballooning mode of flute instability of prominences
or/and coronal condensations. Tearing-mode and MHD instabilities as well as the
effects of overheating of the turbulent current sheet prevent the field from
stationary reconnection as it is adopted in the traditional scenario. We
speculate around the assumption that the energy release in active regions is
governed by the same scenario as dynamical current percolation through a random

every $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$, we find a relatively small collection $C$ of
vertex subsets, such that every independent set of $G$ is contained within a
member of $C$, and no member of $C$ is large; the collection, which is in
various respects optimal, reveals an underlying structure to the independent
sets. The containers offer a straightforward and unified approach to many
combinatorial questions concerned (usually implicitly) with independence.
  With regard to colouring, it follows that simple $r$-uniform hypergraphs of
average degree $d$ have list chromatic number at least $(1/(r-1)^2 + o(1))
\log_r d$. For $r = 2$ this improves a bound due to Alon and is tight. For $r
\ge 3$, previous bounds were weak but the present inequality is close to
optimal.
  In the context of extremal graph theory, it follows that, for each
$\ell$-uniform hypergraph $H$ of order $k$, there is a collection $C$ of
$\ell$-uniform hypergraphs of order $n$ each with $o(n^k)$ copies of $H$, such
that every $H$-free $\ell$-uniform hypergraph of order $n$ is a subgraph of a
hypergraph in $C$, and $\log |C| \le c n^{\ell-1/m(H)} \log n$ where $m(H)$ is
a standard parameter (there is a similar statement for induced subgraphs). This
yields simple proofs, for example, for the number of $H$-free hypergraphs, and
for the sparsity theorems of Conlon-Gowers and Schacht. A slight variant yields
a counting version of the K{\L}R conjecture.
  Likewise, for systems of linear equations the containers supply, for example,
bounds on the number of solution-free sets, and the existence of solutions in
sparse random subsets.
  Balogh, Morris and Samotij have independently obtained related results.

advantages of integration and scalability can only be fully utilized with the
availability of a source for higher-dimensional entangled photons. Here, a
novel fiber integrated source for path-entangled photons in the telecom band at
1.55\mum using only standard fiber technology is presented. Due to the special
design the source shows good scalability towards higher-dimensional entangled
photonic states (quNits), while path entanglement offers direct compatibility
with on-chip path encoding. We present an experimental realization of a
path-entangled two-qubit source. A very high quality of entanglement is
verified by various measurements, i.a. a tomographic state reconstruction is
performed leading to a background corrected fidelity of (99.45+-0.06)%.
Moreover, we describe an easy method for extending our source to arbitrarily
high dimensions.

important when formulating spatial planning and economic policy. A simple model
was proposed by Simon, who assumed that firms grow at a rate proportional to
their size, and that new divisions of firms with certain probabilities relocate
to other firms or to new centres of economic activity. Simon's model produces
realistic results in the sense that the sizes of economic centres follow a Zipf
distribution, which is also observed in reality. It lacks realism in the sense
that mechanisms such as cluster formation, congestion (defined as an overly
high density of the same activities) and dependence on the spatial distribution
of external parties (clients, labour markets) are ignored.
  The present paper proposed an extension of the Simon model that includes both
centripetal and centrifugal forces. Centripetal forces are included in the
sense that firm divisions are more likely to settle in locations that offer a
higher accessibility to other firms. Centrifugal forces are represented by an
aversion of a too high density of activities in the potential location. The
model is implemented as an agent-based simulation model in a simplified spatial
setting. By running both the Simon model and the extended model, comparisons
are made with respect to their effects on spatial configurations. To this end a
series of metrics are used, including the rank-size distribution and indices of
the degree of clustering and concentration.

forward equations to the case of a two-parameter Markov process. These
equations relates the infinitesimal transition matrix of the two-parameter
Markov process. However, solving these equations is not possible and we require
a numerical procedure. In this paper, we give an alternative method by use of
double Laplace transform of the transition probability matrix and of the
infinitesimal transition matrix of the process. An illustrative example is

We calculate the transition density matrix of these states and also the cost of
the warranty for the proposed model.

extending extremal results to sparse graphs. Many of the key applications of

prove extensions of these results which also apply to sparse graphs, it
remained a well-known open problem to prove a counting lemma in sparse graphs.
  The main advance of this paper lies in a new counting lemma, proved following
the functional approach of Gowers, which complements the sparse regularity

successively emanated from the flare kernel, they propagated along a cluster of
open coronal loops with a phase speed of 834 km/s during the flare's rising
phase, and the multiple arc-shaped wave trains can be fitted with a series of
concentric circles. We generate the k-omega diagram of the Fourier power and
find a straight ridge that represents the dispersion relation of the waves.
Along the ridge, we find a lot of prominent nodes which represent the available
frequencies of the QFP waves. On the other hand, the frequencies of the flare
are also obtained by analyzing the flare light curves using the wavelet
technique. The results indicate that almost all the main frequencies of the
flare are consistent with those of the QFP waves. This suggests that the flare
and the QFP waves were possibly excited by a common physical origin. On the
other hand, a few low frequencies revealed by the k-omega diagram can not be
found in the accompanying flare. We propose that these low frequencies were
possibly due to the leakage of the pressure-driven p-mode oscillations from the
photosphere into the low corona, which should be a noticeable mechanism for
driving the QFP waves observed in the corona.

like for the young Crab and Vela pulsars. nIR observations, never performed for
PSR B0540-69, are crucial to determine whether the optical power-law spectrum
extends to longer wavelengths or a new break occurs, like it happens for both
the Crab and Vela pulsars in the mIR, hinting at an even more complex particle
energy and density distribution in the pulsar magnetosphere. We observed PSR
B0540-69 in the J, H, and Ks bands with the VLT to detect it, for the first
time, in the nIR and characterise its optical-to-nIR spectrum. To disentangle
the pulsar emission from that of its pulsar wind nebula (PWN), we obtained
high-spatial resolution adaptive optics images with NACO. We could clearly
identify PSR B0540-69 in our J, H, and Ks-band images and measure its flux
(J=20.14, H=19.33, Ks=18.55, with an overall error of +/- 0.1 magnitudes in

power-law spectrum gives a spectral index alpha=0.70 +/-0.04. The comparison
between our NACO images and HST optical ones does not reveal any apparent
difference in the PWN morphology as a function of wavelength. The PWN
optical-to-nIR spectrum is also fit by a single power-law, with spectral index
alpha=0.56+/- 0.03, slightly flatter than the pulsar's. Using NACO at the VLT,
we obtained the first detection of PSR B0540-69 and its PWN in the nIR. Due to
the small angular scale of the PWN (~4"") only the spatial resolution of the
JWST will make it possible to extend the study of the pulsar and PWN spectrum
towards the mid-IR.

and NGC 3690, are consistent with a wide range of gas components, from warm
moderately dense gas with T_{kin} > 30 K and n(H_{2}) ~ 0.3 - 3 x 10^{3}

gas masses and star formation rates of each region in order to derive molecular
gas depletion times. The depletion times of all regions (20-60 Myr) are found
to be about 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of normal spiral galaxies.
This rapid depletion time can probably be explained by a high fraction of dense

generation of mppSoC (massively parallel processing System-on-Chip)
configuration. Indeed, depending on the application requirements, a framework
of Netbeans Platform Software Tool named MppSoCGEN was developed in order to
accelerate the design process of complex mppSoC. Starting from an architecture
parameters design, VHDL code will be automatically generated using parsing
method. Configuration rules are proposed to have a correct and valid VHDL
syntax configuration. Finally, an automatic generation of Processor Elements
and network topologies models of mppSoC architecture will be done for Stratix
II device family. Our framework improves its flexibility on Netbeans 5.5
version and centrino duo Core 2GHz with 22 Kbytes and 3 seconds average
runtime. Experimental results for reduction algorithm validate our MppSoCGEN
design flow and demonstrate the efficiency of generated architectures.

simply as alternative theories of gravity with a preferred acceleration scale,
and could be tested in the solar system by extending the LISA Pathfinder (LPF)

with requirements arising from astrophysical and cosmological applications, but
a clear separation of the issues is achieved. The central technical content of
this paper is the derivation of a scaling prescription allowing complex
numerical work to be bypassed in the generation of templates. We find that LPF
could constrain very tightly the acceleration $a_0$ and the free parameter
$\kappa$ present in these theories. As an application of our technique we also
produce predictions for the moon saddle (for which a similar scaling argument
is applicable) with the result that we recommend that it should be included in

polarisation of line emission together with a model library and a Python-based
user interface. DustPol can easily manage analytical as well as pre-gridded
models to generate synthetic maps of the Stokes I, Q, and U parameters. These
maps are stored in FITS format which is straightforwardly read by the data
reduction software used, e.g., by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).
This turns DustPol into a powerful engine for the prediction of the expected
polarisation features of a source observed with ALMA or the Planck satellite as
well as for the interpretation of existing submillimetre observations obtained
with other telescopes. DustPol allows the parameterisation of the maximum
degree of polarisation and we find that, in a prestellar core, if there is
depolarisation, this effect should happen at densities of 10^6 cm-3 or larger.
We compare a model generated by DustPol with the observational polarisation
data of the low-mass Class 0 object NGC 1333 IRAS 4A, finding that the total

frequently observed in the heliosphere at different distances r from the Sun.
Usually, it is supposed that the IMF behavior corresponds to Parker's model
overall, but there is some turbulent component that impacts and disrupts the
full picture of the IMF spatial and temporal distribution. However, the
analysis of multi-spacecraft in-ecliptic IMF measurements from 0.29 AU to 5 AU
shows that the IMF radial evolution is rather far from expected. The radial IMF
component decreases with the adiabatic power index (|Br| \sim r^-5/3), the
tangential component |Bt| \sim r^-1.1 and, the IMF strength B \sim r^-1.4. This
means that the IMF is not completely frozen in the solar wind. Possibly,
turbulent processes in the inner heliosphere significantly influence the IMF
expansion. This means that the IMF is not completely frozen in the solar wind.
It is possible that turbulent processes in the inner heliosphere significantly
influence the IMF expansion. This is confirmed by the analysis of the Br
distribution's radial evolution. We consider a quasi-continuous magnetic
reconnection, occurring both at the heliospheric current sheet and at local
current sheets inside the IMF sectors, to be a key process responsible for the
solar wind turbulization with heliocentric distance as well as for the
breakdown of the frozen-in IMF law.

communication network is represented by a graph where vertices host processors,
and communication is performed over the edges. Computation proceeds in
synchronous rounds. The running time of an algorithm is the number of rounds
from the beginning until all vertices terminate. Local computation is free. An
algorithm is called {local} if it terminates within a constant number of
rounds. The question of what problems can be computed locally was raised by
Naor and Stockmayer \cite{NS93} in their seminal paper in STOC'93. Since then
the quest for problems with local algorithms, and for problems that cannot be
computed locally, has become a central research direction in the field of
distributed algorithms \cite{KMW04,KMW10,LOW08,PR01}.
  We devise the first local algorithm for an {NP-complete} problem.
Specifically, our randomized algorithm computes, with high probability, an
O(n^{1/2 + epsilon} \cdot chi)-coloring within O(1) rounds, where epsilon > 0
is an arbitrarily small constant, and chi is the chromatic number of the input
graph. (This problem was shown to be NP-complete in \cite{Z07}.) On our way to
this result we devise a constant-time algorithm for computing (O(1), O(n^{1/2 +
epsilon}))-network-decompositions. Network-decompositions were introduced by
Awerbuch et al. \cite{AGLP89}, and are very useful for solving various
distributed problems. The best previously-known algorithm for
network-decomposition has a polylogarithmic running time (but is applicable for
a wider range of parameters) \cite{LS93}. We also devise a Delta^{1 +
epsilon}-coloring algorithm for graphs with sufficiently large maximum degree
Delta that runs within O(1) rounds. It improves the best previously-known
result for this family of graphs, which is O(\log-star n) \cite{SW10}.
