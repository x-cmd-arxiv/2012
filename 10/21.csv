also satisfying a k-nondegeneracy condition at all points. This might be only
if dim M is greater than or equal to 5 and if dim M = 5, then k= 2 at all

{\zeta}(s) valid for all -Re(s) not an integer. The series expansion of the

reflection formula. The reflection function is singular at s = 0 and the
residue at this point changes sign from negative to positive between the values
of N = 176 and N = 177. The Gauss map h(x) is recalled so that its fixed points

function of the fractal string associated to the lengths of the harmonic
sawtooth map components happens to coincide with the counting function for the

field of type theory from logic and theoretical computer science. This has
given rise to a new field, which has been christened ""homotopy type theory"". In
this direction, Vladimir Voevodsky observed that it is possible to model type
theory using simplicial sets and that this model satisfies an additional
property, called the Univalence Axiom, which has a number of striking
consequences. He has subsequently advocated a program, which he calls univalent
foundations, of developing mathematics in the setting of type theory with the
Univalence Axiom and possibly other additional axioms motivated by the
simplicial set model. Because type theory possesses good computational
properties, this program can be carried out in a computer proof assistant. In
this paper we give an introduction to homotopy type theory in Voevodsky's
setting, paying attention to both theoretical and practical issues. In
particular, the paper serves as an introduction to both the general ideas of
homotopy type theory as well as to some of the concrete details of Voevodsky's

component-based software systems have recently attracted a considerable
attention. Current specification theories are however qualitative in nature,
and therefore fragile in the sense that the inevitable approximation of systems
by models, combined with the fundamental unpredictability of hardware
platforms, makes it difficult to transfer conclusions about the behavior, based
on models, to the actual system. Hence this approach is arguably unsuited for
modern software systems. We propose here the first specification theory which
allows to capture quantitative aspects during the refinement and implementation
process, thus leveraging the problems of the qualitative setting.
  Our proposed quantitative specification framework uses weighted modal
transition systems as a formal model of specifications. These are labeled
transition systems with the additional feature that they can model optional
behavior which may or may not be implemented by the system. Satisfaction and
refinement is lifted from the well-known qualitative to our quantitative
setting, by introducing a notion of distances between weighted modal transition
systems. We show that quantitative versions of parallel composition as well as
quotient (the dual to parallel composition) inherit the properties from the
Boolean setting.

the null hypothesis of sphericity of a high-dimensional covariance matrix
against an alternative of (unspecified) multiple symmetry-breaking directions

asymptotic power envelope and the asymptotic powers of previously proposed
tests are derived. These asymptotic powers are shown to lie very substantially
below the envelope, at least for relatively small values of the number of
symmetry-breaking directions under the alternative. In contrast, the asymptotic
power of the likelihood ratio test based on the eigenvalues of the sample
covariance matrix is shown to be close to that envelope. These results extend
to the case of multispiked alternatives the findings of an earlier study
(Onatski, Moreira and Hallin, 2011) of the single-spiked case. The methods we
are using here, however, are entirely new, as the Laplace approximations

characterized by competition between clones carrying different beneficial
mutations. This interference phenomenon slows down the adaptation speed and
makes the theoretical description of the dynamics more complex with respect to
the successional occurrence and fixation of beneficial mutations typical of
small populations. A simplified modeling framework considering multiple
beneficial mutations with equal and constant fitness advantage captures some of
the essential features of the actual complex dynamics, and some key predictions
from this model are verified in laboratory evolution experiments. However, in
these experiments the relative advantage of a beneficial mutation is generally
dependent on the genetic background. In particular, the general pattern is
that, as mutations in different loci accumulate, the relative advantage of new
mutations decreases, trend often referred to as ""diminishing return"" epistasis.
  In this paper, we propose a phenomenological model that generalizes the
fixed-advantage framework to include in a simple way this feature. To evaluate
the quantitative consequences of diminishing returns on the evolutionary
dynamics, we approach the model analytically as well as with direct
simulations. Finally, we show how the model parameters can be matched with data
from evolutionary experiments in order to infer the mean effect of epistasis
and derive order-of-magnitude estimates of the rate of beneficial mutations.
Applying this procedure to two experimental data sets gives values of the
beneficial mutation rate within the range of previous measurements.

In this paper our focus is on two algorithms that allow one to construct

as input two lambda-calculus expressions G and H and compute a lambda-calculus
expression F such that F with input as G, denoted by F@G, is equal to H; and
similarly G@F = H. We present correctness and complexity results about these

and explore the breakdown of self-similarity at the crests of extreme standing

counter-propagating solitary waves that repeatedly collide quasi-elastically.
In deep water with surface tension, we find that standing waves resemble
counter-propagating depression waves. We also discuss existence and
non-uniqueness of solutions, and smooth versus erratic dependence of Fourier

  In the numerical method, robustness is achieved by posing the problem as an
overdetermined nonlinear system and using either adjoint-based minimization
techniques or a quadratically convergent trust-region method to minimize the
objective function. Accuracy is maintained using spectral collocation with
optional mesh refinement in space, a high order Runge-Kutta or spectral
deferred correction method in time, and quadruple-precision for improved
navigation of delicate regions of parameter space as well as validation of
double-precision results. Implementation issues for GPU acceleration are

interactions consisting of Higgs doublets. These operators emerge from kinetic
terms of composite Higgs models or integrating out heavy particles that
interact with Higgs doublets. They lead to new phenomena beyond the Standard
Model. One of characteristic contributions by derivative interactions appear in
vector boson scattering processes. Longitudinal modes of massive vector bosons
can be regarded as Nambu Goldstone bosons eaten by each vector field with the
equivalence theorem. Since their effects become larger and larger as the
collision energy of vector bosons increases, vector boson scattering processes
become important in a high energy region around the TeV scale. On the other
hand, in such a high energy region, we have to take the unitarity of amplitudes
into account. We have obtained the unitarity condition in terms of the
parameter included in the effective Lagrangian for one Higgs doublet models.
Applying it to some of models, we have found that contributions of derivative
interactions are not so large enough to clearly discriminate them from the
Standard Model ones. We also study it in two Higgs doublet models. Because they
are too complex to obtain the bound in the general effective Lagrangian, we
have calculated it in explicit models. These analyses tell us highly model
dependence of the perturbative unitarity bounds.

= Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni). In the magnetization curves measured at 1.8 K, a change in
the spin-state was not observed for Cr, Mn, or Fe doping but was observed for
Ni doping. Strong magnetic anisotropy along the [100] easy axis was also found
in the Ni-doped sample. The fluorescence measurements revealed that the
valences were roughly estimated to be Cr^3+, Mn^4+, Fe^(3+delta)+, and Ni^3+.
From the observed chemical trends, we propose that the chemical potential is a
key factor in inducing the change of the low-spin state. By expanding a model
of the ferromagnetic spin-state heptamer generated by hole doping, we discuss
the emergence of highly anisotropic ferromagnetic spin-state clusters induced
by low-spin Ni^3+ with Jahn-Teller activity. We also discuss applicability of
the present results to mantle materials and impurity-doped pyrites with Fe
(d^6).

associated with $G$. A spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ is called an $H$-factor if
the degree of any vertex $v$ in $F$ belongs to the set $H(v)$. This paper
contains two results on the existence of $H$-factors in regular graphs. First,
we construct an $r$-regular graph without some given $H^*$-factor. In
particular, this gives a negative answer to a problem recently posed by Akbari
and Kano. Second, by using Lov\'asz's characterization theorem on the existence
of $(g, f)$-factors, we find a sharp condition for the existence of general
$H$-factors in $\{r, r+1\}$-graphs, in terms of the maximum and minimum of $H$.
The result reduces to Thomassen's theorem for the case that $H(v)$ consists of
the same two consecutive integers for all vertices $v$, and to Tutte's theorem
if the graph is regular in addition.

  and Katoomba : Australia (2010)",,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An expression of the piano soundboard mechanical mobility (in the direction
normal to the soundboard) depending on a small number of parameters and valid
up to several kHz is given in this communication. Up to 1.1 kHz, our
experimental and numerical investigations confirm previous results showing that
the soundboard behaves like a homogeneous plate with isotropic properties and
clamped boundary conditions. Therefore, according to the Skudrzyk mean-value
theorem (Skudrzyk 1980), only the mass of the structure M, the modal density
n(f), and the mean loss factor eta(f), are needed to express the average
driving point mobility. Moreover, the expression of the envelope - resonances
and antiresonances - of the mobility can be derived, according to (Langley
1994). We measured the modal loss factor and the modal density of the
soundboard of an upright piano in playing condition, in an anechoic
environment. The measurements could be done up to 2.5 kHz, with a novel
high-resolution modal analysis technique (see the ICA companion-paper, Ege and
Boutillon (2010)). Above 1.1 kHz, the change in the observed modal density
together with numerical simulations confirm Berthaut's finding that the waves
in the soundboard are confined between adjacent ribs (Berthaut et al. 2003).
Extending the Skudrzyk and Langley approaches, we synthesize the mechanical
mobility at the bridge up to 2.5 kHz. The validity of the computation for an
extended spectral domain is discussed. It is also shown that the evolution of
the modal density with frequency is consistent with the rise of mobility (fall
of impedance) in this frequency range and that both are due to the inter-rib
effect appearing when the half-wavelength becomes equal to the rib spacing.
Results match previous observations by Wogram (1980), Conklin (1996), Giordano
(1998), Nakamura (1983) and could be used for numerical simulations for
example. This approach avoids the detailed description of the soundboard, based
on a very high number of parameters. However, it can be used to predict the
changes of the driving point mobility, and possibly of the sound radiation in
the treble range, resulting from structural modifications.

central stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*) of a galaxy might be a better
indicator for its host dark matter halo mass. Here we test this hypothesis by
estimating the dark matter halo mass for central alaxies in groups as function
of M* and sigma*. For this we have estimated the redshift-space
cross-correlation function (CCF) between the central galaxies at given M* and
sigma* and a reference galaxy sample, from which we determine both the
projected CCF, w_p(r_p), and the velocity dispersion profile (VDP) of
satellites around the centrals. A halo mass is then obtained from the average
velocity dispersion within the virial radius. At fixed M*, we find very weak or
no correlation between halo mass and sigma*. In contrast, strong mass
dependence is clearly seen even when sigma* is limited to a narrow range. Our
results thus firmly demonstrate that the stellar mass of central galaxies is
still a good (if not the best) indicator for dark matter halo mass, better than
the stellar velocity dispersion. The dependence of galaxy clustering on sigma*
fixed M*, as recently discovered by Wake et al. (2012), may be attributed to
satellite galaxies, for which the tidal stripping occurring within halos has
stronger effect on stellar mass than on central stellar velocity dispersion.

two vertices of the quadruple either miss (have no neighbours on) some path
connecting the remaining two vertices of the quadruple, or are connected by
some path missed by the remaining two vertices. This is akin to the notion of
asteroidal triple used in the classical characterization of interval graphs by
Lekkerkerker and Boland. We show that a circular-arc graph cannot have a
blocking quadruple. We also observe that the absence of blocking quadruples is
not in general sufficient to guarantee that a graph is a circular-arc graph.
Nonetheless, it can be shown to be sufficient for some special classes of
graphs, such as those investigated by Bonomo et al. In this note, we focus on
chordal graphs, and study the relationship between the structure of chordal
graphs and the presence/absence of blocking quadruples. Our contribution is
two-fold. Firstly, we provide a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of
chordal graphs without blocking quadruples. In particular, we observe that all
the forbidden subgraphs are variants of the subgraphs forbidden for interval
graphs. Secondly, we show that the absence of blocking quadruples is sufficient
to guarantee that a chordal graph with no independent set of size five is a
circular-arc graph. In our proof we use a novel geometric approach,
constructing a circular-arc representation by traversing around a carefully
chosen clique tree.

information, and the characteristic matrixes of coverings viewed as an
effective approach to approximating the concept should update with time for
knowledge discovery. This paper further investigates the construction of
characteristic matrixes without running the matrix acquisition algorithm
repeatedly. First, we present two approaches to computing the characteristic
matrixes of the covering with lower time complexity. Then, we investigate the
construction of the characteristic matrixes of the dynamic covering using the
incremental approach. We mainly address the characteristic matrix updating from
three aspects: the variations of elements in the covering, the immigration and
emigration of objects and the changes of attribute values. Afterwards, several
illustrative examples are employed to show that the proposed approach can
effectively compute the characteristic matrixes of the dynamic covering for
approximations of concepts.

the square lattice Ising model. First, using a bond propagation algorithm, we
find the difference $2H_L(w) - H_{2L}(w)$ between entropies on cylinders of
finite lengths $L$ and 2L with open end cap boundaries, in the limit
$L\to\infty$. This essentially quantifies how the finite length correction for
the entropy scales with the cylinder circumference $w$. Secondly, using the
transfer matrix, we obtain precise estimates for the information needed to
specify the spin state on a ring encircling an infinite long cylinder.
Combining both results we obtain the mutual information between the two halves
of a cylinder (the ""excess entropy"" for the cylinder), where we confirm with
higher precision but for smaller systems results recently obtained by Wilms et
al. -- and we show that the mutual information between the two halves of the
ring diverges at the critical point logarithmically with $w$. Finally we use
the second result together with Monte Carlo simulations to show that also the
excess entropy of a straight line of $n$ spins in an infinite lattice diverges
at criticality logarithmically with $n$. We conjecture that such logarithmic
divergence happens generically for any one-dimensional subset of sites at any
2-dimensional second order phase transition. Comparing straight lines on square
and triangular lattices with square loops and with lines of thickness 2, we
discuss questions of universality.

important to study the structure of the trails. However, statistical inference
for the count data is not an easy task, because of its Poisson characteristics.
We carried out a wide-field video observation of the Leonid meteor storm in

self-organizing state space model, to infer the true behavior of the dust
density of the trails properly from the meteor count data. {}From this
analysis, we found that the trails have a fairly smooth spatial structure, with
small and dense clumps that cause a temporal burst of meteor flux. We also
proved that the time behavior (trend) of the fluxes of bright meteors and that
of faint meteors are significantly different. In addition we comment on some
other application of the self-organizing state-space model in fields related to

immersed in an optical field, in relation to the internal energy flows (optical
currents) and their spin and orbital constituents. The problem is studied
analytically, based on the dipole model, and numerically. Three sources of the
field mechanical action - energy density gradient and the orbital and spin
parts of the energy flow - differ by the ponderomotive mechanism, and their
physical nature manifests itself in the optical force dependence on the
particle radius a. If a is much less than the radiation wavelength, the optical
force behaves as a^n and integer n can be used to classify the sources of the
mechanical action. This classification correlates with the multipole
representation of the field-particle interaction: The gradient force and the
orbital-momentum force appear due to the electric or magnetic dipole moments
per se, the spin-momentum force emerges due to interaction between the electric
and magnetic dipoles or between the dipole and quadruple moments (if the
particle is polarisable electrically but not magnetically or vice versa). In
principle, the spin and orbital currents can be measured separately by the
probe particle motion, employing the special choice of particles with necessary
magnetic and/or electric properties.

  The separate addition of either transitive relations or relation hierarchies

shown to stay decidable, by resorting to results already proved in the
literature. However, such results do not directly allow for concluding whether
the logic including both features is still decidable. The existence of a

the addition of transitive relations and relation hierarchies to such an
