space, M. S. Gowda, R. Sznajder and J. Tao have defined generalized lattice
operations, which in the particular case of the nonnegative orthant of a
Cartesian reference system reduce to the lattice operations of the
coordinate-wise ordering. The aim of the present note is twofold: to give a
geometric characterization of the closed convex sets which are invariant with
respect to these operations, and to relate this invariance property to the
isotonicity of the metric projection onto these sets. As concrete examples the
Lorentz cone and the nonnegative orthant are considered. Old and recent results
on closed convex Euclidean sublattices due to D. M. Topkis, A. F. Veinott and
to M. Queyranne and F. Tardella, respectively are obtained as particular cases.
The topic is related to variational inequalities where the isotonicity of the
metric projection is an important technical tool. For Euclidean sublattices
this approach was considered by G. Isac, H. Nishimura and E. A. Ok.

into analyzing its general structure, and at the one-loop level also a number
of explicit computations have been done, using various approaches. Here we use
the string-inspired formalism to unify the calculations of the scalar, spinor

in dimensionally continued form, so that it can be used as a building block for

originally derived for the on-shell case, hold off-shell as well. We explain
the relation of the structure of this representation to the low-energy
effective action, and establish the precise connection with the standard
Ball-Chiu decomposition of the vertex. This allows us also to predict that the
vanishing of the completely antisymmetric coefficient function S of this
decomposition is not a one-loop accident, but persists at higher loop orders.
The sum rule found by Binger and Brodsky, which leads to the vanishing of the
one-loop vertex in N=4 SYM theory, in the present approach relates to worldline

electronic shower fraction, and $h/e$ is the hadron/electron response ratio. In
conventional calorimeters the energy resolution is dominated by the stochastic
variable $\fem$, whose broad, skewed pdf has an energy-dependent mean. The slow
increase of the mean with $E$ is responsible for response nonlinearity and the
skewness results in a non-Gaussian response. If the cascade is observed in two
channels with different values of $h/e$ (typically scintillator($S$) and
Cherenkov ($C$)), $\fem$ can be eliminated. An energy estimator, linear in $C$
and $S$, is obtained which is proportional to the incident hadron's energy. The
resolution depends upon the contrast in $h/e$ between the two channels. The
Cherenkov $h/e$ will be 0.20--0.25. In sampling calorimeters, $h/e$ can be
increased to about 0.7 by arranging for preferential absorption of the
electromagnetic (EM) shower energy in the absorber (decreasing $e$) and using a
hydrogenous detector (organic scintillator) to enhance $h$ through the
contribution of recoil protons in $n$--$p$ scattering. Neither mechanism is
available in a homogeneous crystal or glass scintillator,\rm where $h/e$is
expected to be in the vicinity of 0.4 because of invisible hadronic energy loss
and other effects. The $h/e$ contrast is very likely too small to provide the
needed energy resolution. We support this conclusion with simple Monte Carlo

the weak coupling limit the energy spectrum in each Hilbert subspace of an
angular momentum consists of discrete LLs of graphene. In the intermediate
coupling regime non-resonant states form a closely spaced energy spectrum. We
find, counter-intuitively, that resonant quasi-boundstates of both positive and
negative energies exist in the spectrum. The presence of resonant
quasi-boundstates of negative energies are a unique property of massless Dirac
fermions. As the strong coupling limit is approached resonant and non-resonant
states transform into anomalous states, whose probability densities develop a
narrow peak inside the well and another broad peak under the potential barrier.
These properties may investigated experimentally by measuring optical
transition energies that can be described by a scaling function of the coupling
constant.

trapping (leading to continuous-time random walks) can easily be distinguished
from the rest by testing their non-ergodicity, the latter two cases are harder
to distinguish. We propose a statistical test for distinguishing between these
two based on the space-filling properties of trajectories, and prove its

the system of two mechanical oscillators, we show that when two cavity modes in
each cavity are driven at red- and blue-detuned sidebands, respectively, a
stationary two-mode squeezed vacuum state of the two mechanical oscillators can
be generated with the help of the cavity dissipation. The degree of squeezing
is controllable by adjusting the relative strength of the pump lasers. Our
calculations also show that the achieved mechanical entanglement is robust
against thermal fluctuations of phononic environments. For the case of multiple
mechanical oscillators, we find that the steady-state genuine multipartite
entanglement can also be built up among the remote mechanical oscillators by
the cavity dissipation. The present scheme does not require nonclassical light

mechanics, which is based on the postulate that the final state of a
measurement is classical. Unlike the usual formulation (in which the
post-measurement state is a unit vector in Hilbert space), our version actually
opens the possibility of admitting a purely technical solution within the
confines of conventional quantum theory (as opposed to solutions that either
modify this theory, or introduce unusual and controversial interpretative rules
and/or ontologies). To that effect, we recall a remarkable phenomenon in the
theory of Schroedinger operators (discovered in 1981 by Jona-Lasinio et al),
according to which the ground state of a symmetric double-well Hamiltonian
becomes exponentially sensitive to tiny perturbations of the potential as h ->
0. We show that this instability emerges also from the textbook WKB
approximation, extend it to time-dependent perturbations, and study the
dynamical transition from the ground state of the double well to the perturbed
ground state (in which the cat is typically either dead or alive, depending on
the details of the perturbation). Numerical simulations show that adiabatically
arising perturbations may (quite literally) cause the collapse of the
wave-function in the classical limit. Thus, at least in the context of a simple
mathematical model, we combine the technical and conceptual virtues of
decoherence (which fails to solve the measurement problem but launches the key
idea that perturbations may come from the environment) with those of dynamical
collapse models a la GRW (which do solve the measurement problem but are ad
hoc), without sharing their drawbacks: single measurement outcomes are obtained
(instead of merely diagonal reduced density matrices), and no modification of
quantum mechanics is needed.

reveal a trend for the star-formation enhancement in S+S pairs to decrease with
increasing redshift. Between z=0 and z=1, this decline of interaction-induced
star-formation enhancement occurs in parallel with the dramatic increase (by a
factor of ~10) of the sSFR of single SFGs, both can be explained by the higher

topology, algebraic and symplectic geometry, combinatorics and commutative
algebra. It has quickly grown up into a very active area with many
interdisciplinary links and applications, and continues to attract experts from
different fields.
  The key players in toric topology are moment-angle manifolds, a family of
manifolds with torus actions defined in combinatorial terms. Their construction
links to combinatorial geometry and algebraic geometry of toric varieties via
the related notion of a quasitoric manifold. Discovery of remarkable geometric
structures on moment-angle manifolds led to seminal connections with the
classical and modern areas of symplectic, Lagrangian and non-Kaehler complex
geometry. A related categorical construction of moment-angle complexes and
their generalisations, polyhedral products, provides a universal framework for
many fundamental constructions of homotopical topology. The study of polyhedral
products is now evolving into a separate area of homotopy theory, with strong
links to other areas of toric topology. A new perspective on torus action has
also contributed to the development of classical areas of algebraic topology,
such as complex cobordism.
  The book contains lots of open problems and is addressed to experts
interested in new ideas linking all the subjects involved, as well as to
graduate students and young researchers ready to enter into a beautiful new
area.

ferromagnets within density-functional theory (DFT) and the mapping of DFT
results onto a spin Hamiltonian. We delve into the problem of systems
comprising atoms with strong spontaneous moments together with atoms with weak
induced moments. All moments are considered as degrees of freedom, with the
strong moments thermally fluctuating only in angle and the weak moments
thermally fluctuating in angle and magnitude. We argue that a quadratic
dependence of the energy on the weak local moments magnitude, which is a good
approximation in many cases, allows for an elimination of the weak-moment
degrees of freedom from the thermodynamic expressions in favor of a
renormalization of the Heisenberg interactions among the strong moments. We
show that the renormalization is valid at all temperatures accounting for the
thermal fluctuations and resulting in temperature-independent renormalized
interactions. These are shown to be the ones directly derived from total-energy
DFT calculations by constraining the strong-moment directions, as is done e.g.
in spin-spiral methods. We furthermore prove that within this framework the
thermodynamics of the weak-moment subsystem, and in particular all correlation
functions, can be derived as polynomials of the correlation functions of the
strong-moment subsystem with coefficients that depend on the spin
susceptibility and that can be calculated within DFT. These conclusions are
rigorous under certain physical assumptions on the measure in the magnetic
phase space. We implement the scheme in the full-potential linearized augmented
plane wave method using the concept of spin-spiral states, considering
applicable symmetry relations and the use of the magnetic force theorem. Our
analytical results are corroborated by numerical calculations employing DFT and

sparse in transform domains such as spatial finite differences or wavelets
using frequency domain samples. For such applications, overwhelming empirical
evidence suggests that superior image reconstruction can be obtained through
variable density sampling strategies that concentrate on lower frequencies. The
wavelet and Fourier transform domains are not incoherent because low-order
wavelets and low-order frequencies are correlated, so compressive sensing
theory does not immediately imply sampling strategies and reconstruction
guarantees. In this paper we turn to a more refined notion of coherence -- the
so-called local coherence -- measuring for each sensing vector separately how
correlated it is to the sparsity basis. For Fourier measurements and Haar
wavelet sparsity, the local coherence can be controlled and bounded explicitly,
so for matrices comprised of frequencies sampled from a suitable inverse square
power-law density, we can prove the restricted isometry property with
near-optimal embedding dimensions. Consequently, the variable-density sampling
strategy we provide allows for image reconstructions that are stable to
sparsity defects and robust to measurement noise. Our results cover both
reconstruction by $\ell_1$-minimization and by total variation minimization.
The local coherence framework developed in this paper should be of independent
interest in sparse recovery problems more generally, as it implies that for
optimal sparse recovery results, it suffices to have bounded \emph{average}
coherence from sensing basis to sparsity basis -- as opposed to bounded maximal
coherence -- as long as the sampling strategy is adapted accordingly.

Smith and Ullman STOC'10, De TCC'12, Muthukrishnan and Nikolov STOC'12) but
have so far been applied only in settings with releases that are obviously
linear.
  Consider a database curator who manages a database of sensitive information
but wants to release statistics about how a sensitive attribute (say, disease)
in the database relates to some nonsensitive attributes (e.g., postal code,
age, gender, etc). We show one can mount linear reconstruction attacks based on
any release that gives: a) the fraction of records that satisfy a given
non-degenerate boolean function. Such releases include contingency tables
(previously studied by Kasiviswanathan et al., STOC'10) as well as more complex
outputs like the error rate of classifiers such as decision trees; b) any one
of a large class of M-estimators (that is, the output of empirical risk
minimization algorithms), including the standard estimators for linear and
logistic regression.
  We make two contributions: first, we show how these types of releases can be
transformed into a linear format, making them amenable to existing
polynomial-time reconstruction algorithms. This is already perhaps surprising,
since many of the above releases (like M-estimators) are obtained by solving
highly nonlinear formulations. Second, we show how to analyze the resulting
attacks under various distributional assumptions on the data. Specifically, we
consider a setting in which the same statistic (either a) or b) above) is
released about how the sensitive attribute relates to all subsets of size k

editing task, i.e., video de-fencing. It targets automatic restoration of the
video clips that are corrupted by fence-like occlusions during capture. Our key
observation lies in the visual parallax between fences and background scenes,
which is caused by the fact that the former are typically closer to the camera.
Unlike in traditional image inpainting, fence-occluded pixels in the videos
tend to appear later in the temporal dimension and are therefore recoverable
via optimized pixel selection from relevant frames. To eventually produce
fence-free videos, major challenges include cross-frame sub-pixel image
alignment under diverse scene depth, and ""correct"" pixel selection that is
robust to dominating fence pixels. Several novel tools are developed in this
paper, including soft fence detection, weighted truncated optical flow method
and robust temporal median filter. The proposed algorithm is validated on
several real-world video clips with fences.

triaxial shapes and anisotropic velocity distributions. Recently it has been
shown that the velocity anisotropy, beta, of cosmological haloes and major
merger remnants depends on direction in such a way that beta is largest along
the major axis and smallest along the minor axis. In this work we use a wide
range of non-cosmological N-body simulations to examine halo shapes and
direction-dependence of velocity anisotropy profiles. For each of our simulated
haloes we define 48 cones pointing in different directions, and from the
particles inside each cone we compute velocity anisotropy profiles. We find
that elongated haloes can have very distinct velocity anisotropies. We group
the behaviour of haloes into three different categories, that range from
spherically symmetric profiles to a much more complex behaviour, where
significant differences are found for beta along the major and minor axes. We
encourage future studies of velocity anisotropies in haloes from cosmological
simulations to calculate beta-profiles in cones, since it reveals information,
which is hidden from a spherically averaged profile. Finally, we show that
spherically averaged profiles often obey a linear relation between beta and the
logarithmic density slope in the inner parts of haloes, but this relation is
not necessarily obeyed, when properties are calculated in cones.

from our samples 3 LBGs and 3 LAEs with spectroscopic evidence of contamination

signals for supersymmetry or direct detection signals of dark matter, motivate
further study of a particular theory of split supersymmetry. In arguably the
theoretically simplest implementation of split, the superpartner spectrum is
spread over several decades. The squarks and sleptons are heavier than the
gravitino and Higgsinos by a factor M_Pl/M_*, where M_* is the mediation scale
of supersymmetry breaking and is high, between unified and Planck scales. On
the other hand the gaugino masses are 1-loop smaller than the gravitino and
Higgsino masses, arising from both anomaly mediation and a Higgsino loop. Wino
dark matter arises from three sources: gravitino production by scattering at
high temperatures, gravitino production from squark decays, and thermal
freeze-out. For reheating temperatures larger than the squark mass, these
conspire to require that the squarks are lighter than about 10^4 TeV, while
collider limits on gaugino masses require squarks to be heavier than about 100
TeV. Whether winos constitute all or just a fraction of the dark matter, a
large fraction of the allowed parameter space has the gluino within reach of
the LHC with 0.1 mm < c\tau_{\~g} < 10 cm, leading to displaced vertices. In
addition, events with cascades via \~W^+- lead to disappearing charged tracks
with c\tau_{\~W^+-} \sim 10 cm. The squarks and sleptons are predicted to be
just heavy enough to solve the supersymmetric flavor and CP problems. Thus
gluino decay modes may typically violate flavor and involve heavy quarks:
[\bar{t}(t,c,u)+\bar{b}(b,s,d)] \~W^0 and
[\bar{t}(b,s,d)+(\bar{t},\bar{c},\bar{u})b] \~W^+-. The electron electric

point, about which quantum fluctuations can occur. An issue occurs when
computing the expectation values of specific types of quantities, like the
distance between points. The problem being that the gauge redundancy of the
path integral over metrics is not completely fixed even after fixing to
conformal gauge by imposing $g_{\mu\nu} = e^{2\b\phi}\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$, where
$\phi$ is the Liouville field and $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ is a reference metric.
The physical metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, and therefore the path integral over metrics
still possesses a gauge redundancy due to invariance under $SL_{2}(\mathbb{C})$
coordinate transformations of the reference coordinates. This zero mode of the
action must be dealt with before a perturbative analysis can be made.
  This paper shows that after fixing to conformal gauge, the remaining zero
mode of the linearized Liouville action due to $SL_{2}(\mathbb{C})$ coordinate
transformations can be dealt with by using standard Fadeev-Popov methods.
Employing the gauge condition that the ""dipole"" of the reference coordinate
system is a fixed vector, and then integrating over all values of this dipole
vector. The ""dipole"" vector referring to how coordinate area is concentrated
about the sphere; assuming the sphere is embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and
centered at the origin, and the coordinate area is thought of as a charge
density on the sphere. The vector points along the ray from the origin of
$\mathbb{R}^{3}$ to the direction of greatest coordinate area.
  A Green's function is obtained and used to compute the expectation value of
the geodesic length between two points on the $\mathbb{S}^{2}$ to second order
in the Timelike Liouville coupling $\b$. This quantity doesn't suffer from any
power law or logarithmic divergences as a na\""{i}ve power counting argument
might suggest.

leading order of the large-N expansion, the corrections due to the presence of
random disorder to any connected correlation functions vanish identically,
provided that the disorder strength is normalized as discussed in literatures
and that the symmetry among replicas is unbroken. Same must hold true to any
observables that are determined by the connected correlation functions through
a linear relation. This behavior resembles strongly that of a free theory where
disorder is coupled to the fundamental field. We demonstrate this by both the
means of holographic principle and field theory analysis in a toy model. We
also propose ways of evaluating the non-zero sub-leading effects perturbatively

Redshift Survey photometric and spectroscopic catalogs with ugriz photometry
from two other surveys; the Canada-France-Hawaii Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Each catalog is cross-matched by position on
the sky in order to assign ugriz photometry to objects in the DEEP2 catalogs.
We have recalibrated the CFHTLS photometry where it overlaps DEEP2 in order to
provide a more uniform dataset. We have also used this improved photometry to
predict DEEP2 BRI photometry in regions where only poorer measurements were
available previously. In addition, we have included improved astrometry tied to
SDSS rather than USNO-A2.0 for all DEEP2 objects. In total this catalog
contains ~27,000 objects with full ugriz photometry as well as robust
spectroscopic redshift measurements, 64% of which have r > 23. By combining the
secure and accurate redshifts of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey with ugriz
photometry, we have created a catalog that can be used as an excellent testbed
for future photo-z studies, including tests of algorithms for surveys such as
LSST and DES.

opportunities to be exploited, risks to be ameliorated, or certain features to
be extracted, such events become of paramount significance. Due to their
sporadic nature, the information-bearing signals associated with rare events
often lie in a large set of irrelevant signals and are not easily accessible.
This paper provides a statistical framework for detecting such events so that
an optimal balance between detection reliability and agility, as two opposing
performance measures, is established. The core component of this framework is a
sampling procedure that adaptively and quickly focuses the
information-gathering resources on the segments of the dataset that bear the
information pertinent to the rare events. Particular focus is placed on
Gaussian signals with the aim of detecting signals with rare mean and variance
values.

in diffractive excitation, based on the optical analogy where diffraction is
fully determined by the absorption into inelastic channels. The formalism is
based on the Good--Walker formalism for diffractive excitation, and it is
assumed that the virtual parton cascades represent the diffractive eigenstates
defined by a definite absorption amplitude. We emphasize that, although
diffractive excitation is basically a quantum-mechanical phenomenon with strong
interference effects, it is possible to calculate the different interfering
components to the amplitude in an event generator, add them and thus calculate
the reaction cross section for exclusive diffractive final states. The
formalism is implemented in the DIPSY event generator, introducing no tunable
parameters beyond what has been determined previously in studies of
non-diffractive events. Some early results from DIS and proton-proton
collisions are presented, and compared to experimental data.

between a 2D paramagnet and a spin-density-wave metal with ordering momentum
(\pi,\pi). This problem is highly non-trivial because the system at criticality
displays a non-Fermi liquid behavior and because the effective coupling
constant \lambda for the pairing is generally of order one, even when the
actual interaction is smaller than fermionic bandwidth. Previous study [M. A.
Metlitski, S. Sachdev, Phys.Rev.B 82, 075128 (2010)] has found that the
renormalizations of the pairing vertex are stronger than in BCS theory and hold
in powers of \log^2 (1/T), like in color superconductivity. We analyze the full
gap equation and argue that, for QCP problem, summing up of the leading
logarithms does not lead to a pairing instability. Yet, we show that
superconductivity has no threshold and appears even if the coupling is set to
be small, because subleading logarithmical renormalizations diverge and give
rise to BCS-like \log(1/T_c) \propto 1/\lambda. We argue that the analogy with
BCS is not accidental as at small coupling superconductivity at a QCP
predominantly comes from fermions which retain Fermi liquid behavior at
criticality. We computed T_c for the actual \lambda \sim 1, and found that both
Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi liquid fermions contribute to the pairing. The value
of T_c agrees well with the numerical results.

exploiting a molecular orbital representation derived in the maximally

done in Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 137006 (2011), and separate not only the intra-
and intermolecular phonon contributions but also the local and non-local
electronic states in the electron-phonon matrix elements. Despite the molecular
nature of the crystal, we find that the purely molecular contributions
(Holstein-like couplings where the local deformation potential is coupled to
intramolecular phonons) account for only 20% of the total electron-phonon
interaction lambda. In particular, the Holstein-like contributions to lambda in
K3Picene are four times smaller than those computed for an isolated neutral
molecule, as they are strongly screened by the metallic bands of the doped
crystal. Our findings invalidate the use of molecular electron-phonon
calculations to estimate the total electron-phonon coupling in metallic picene,
and possibly in other doped metallic molecular crystals. The major contribution
(80%) to lambda in K3Picene comes from non-local couplings due to phonon
modulated hoppings. We show that the crystal geometry together with the
molecular picene structure leads to a strong 1D spatial anisotropy of the
non-local couplings. Finally, based on the parameters derived from our density
functional theory calculations, we propose a lattice modelization of the
electron-phonon couplings in K3Picene which gives 90% of ab-initio lambda.

efforts of a first generation of 21cm experiments which are targeting a
detection of the signal from the Epoch of Reionization at z ~ 10. At z ~ 1, the
emission from neutral hydrogen in self-shielded overdense halos also presents
an accessible signal, since the dominant, synchrotron foreground emission is
considerably fainter than at redshift 10. The principle science driver for
these observations are Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the matter power
spectrum which have the potential to act as a standard ruler and constrain the
nature of dark energy. BAOBAB will fully correlate dual-polarization antenna
tiles over the 600-900MHz band with a frequency resolution of 300 kHz and a
system temperature of 50K. The number of antennas will grow in staged

yielding a 1.8% error on the z ~ 1 distance scale, and, in turn, significant

we analyse the data in total intensity for the spectrally-selected PACO sample,
a complete sample of 69 sources brighter than 200 mJy at 20 GHz selected from
the AT20G survey catalogue to be inverted or upturning between 5 and 20 GHz. We
study the spectral behaviour and variability of the sample. We use the
variability between AT20G (2004-2007) and PACO (2009-2010) epochs to
discriminate between candidate High Frequency Peakers (HFPs) and candidate
blazars. The HFPs picked up by our selection criteria have spectral peaks > 10
GHz in the observer frame and turn out to be rare (<0.5% of the S >200 mJy
sources), consistent with the short duration of this phase implied by the
`youth' scenario. Most (~ 89 %) of blazar candidates have remarkably smooth
spectra, well described by a double power-law, suggesting that the emission in
the PACO frequency range is dominated by a single emitting region. Sources with
peaked PACO spectra show a decrease of the peak frequency with time at a mean
rate of -3 +- 2 GHz/yr on an average timescale of \tau = 2.1 +- 0.5 yr. The
5-20 GHz spectral indices show a systematic decrease from AT20G to PACO
observations. At higher frequencies spectral indices steepen: the median \alpha
30-40 GHz is steeper than the median \alpha 5-20 GHz by \delta\alpha = 0.6.
Taking further into account the WISE data we find that the SEDs, \nu S(\nu), of
most of our blazars peak at \nu_p <10^5 GHz; the median peak wavelength is
\lambda_p ~93 \mu m. Only 6 have \nu_p>10^5 GHz.

of stability through an absolutely irreducible representation of a compact Lie
group leads to bifurcation of steady states. The main ingredient of the proof
is the hypotheses, that for an absolutely irreducible representation of a
compact Lie group there exists a closed subgroup whose fixed point space is odd
dimensional. Then, using Brouwer degree, one gets the result. We refer to the
hypotheses that for an absolutely irreducible representation of a compact Lie
group there exists at least one subgroup with an odd dimensional fixed point
space as the algebraic Ize conjecture (AIC). Lauterbach and Matthews [10] have
shown that the (AIC) is in general not true. In fact they have constructed
three infinite families of finite subgroups of SO{4} which act absolutely
irreducibly on $\R^4$ and for each of them any isotropy subgroup has an even
dimensional fixed point space. Moreover in [10] it is shown that in spite of
this failure of the (AIC) the original conjecture is true at least for groups
in two of these three families. In this paper we show a similar bifurcation
result for the third family defined in [10]. We go on and construct a family of
groups acting absolutely irreducibly on $\R^8$ which have only even dimensional
fixed point spaces. Then we discuss the steady state bifurcations in this case.
We end this paper with a discussion on how to extend the results in [10] to
larger sets of groups which act on $\R^{4}$.

i.e, the absence of any phase transition as N \to infinity, or rapid-crossovers
for finite-N, and the small-L weak coupling limit to render the semi-classical
sector well-defined and calculable. We classify semi-classical configurations
with actions 1/N (kink-instantons), 2/N (bions and bi-kinks), in units where
the 2d instanton action is normalized to one. Perturbation theory possesses the
IR-renormalon ambiguity that arises due to non-Borel summability of the
large-orders perturbation series (of Gevrey-1 type), for which a microscopic
cancellation mechanism was unknown. This divergence must be present because the
corresponding expansion is on a singular Stokes ray in the complexified
coupling constant plane, and the sum exhibits the Stokes phenomenon crossing

the semiclassical expansion. We find a set of ""confluence equations"" that
encode the exact cancellation of the two different type of ambiguities. We show
that a new notion of ""graded resurgence triangle"" is necessary to capture the
path integral approach to resurgence, and that graded resurgence underlies a
potentially rigorous definition of general QFTs. The mass gap and the Theta
angle dependence of vacuum energy are calculated from first principles, and are
in accord with large-N and lattice results.

of predictors (e.g., the expression data of genes) that are responsible for
majority of the variation in a response variable (e.g., the malignancy of a
tumor). This paper focuses on group model selection in high-dimensional linear
models, in which the number of predictors far exceeds the number of samples of
the response variable. Existing works on high-dimensional group model selection
either require the number of samples of the response variable to be
significantly larger than the total number of predictors contributing to the
response or impose restrictive statistical priors on the predictors and/or
nonzero regression coefficients. This paper provides comprehensive
understanding of a low-complexity approach to group model selection that avoids
some of these limitations. The proposed approach, termed Group Thresholding
(GroTh), is based on thresholding of marginal correlations of groups of
predictors with the response variable and is reminiscent of existing
thresholding-based approaches in the literature. The most important
contribution of the paper in this regard is relating the performance of GroTh
to a polynomial-time verifiable property of the predictors for the general case
of arbitrary (random or deterministic) predictors and arbitrary nonzero
regression coefficients.

certain boundary effect estimates due to an inhomogeneous electromagnetic
inclusion with an asymptotically small support but an arbitrary content
enclosed by a thin high-conducting layer. Sharp estimates are established in
terms of the asymptotic parameter, which are independent of the material
tensors of the small electromagnetic inclusion. The result implies that the
`blow-up-a-small-region' construction via the transformation optics approach
yields a near-cloak for the electromagnetic waves. A novelty lies in the fact
that the geometry of the cloaking construction of this work can be very
general. Moreover, by incorporating the conducting layer developed in the
present paper right between the cloaked region and the cloaking region,
arbitrary electromagnetic contents can be nearly cloaked. Our mathematical
technique extends the general one developed in [30] for nearly cloaking scalar
optics. In order to investigate the approximate electromagnetic cloaking for

localization of objects or radio signals diffusion and detection. To this end
we decided to specialize some variables of the HIOAs whose values are functions
both of time and space. We call them world variables. Basically they are
treated similarly to the other variables of HIOAs, but they have the function
of representing the interaction of each automaton with the surrounding
environment, hence they can be output, input or internal variables. Since these
special variables have the role of simulating implicit communication, their
dynamics are specified both in time and space, because they model the
perturbations induced by the agent to the environment, and the perturbations of
the environment as perceived by the agent. Parallel composition of world
variables is slightly different from parallel composition of the other
variables, since their signals are summed. The theory is illustrated through a
simple example of agents systems.

systems that are k-resilient. In order to be k-resilient, a system needs to be
able to rapidly recover from a small number, up to k, of local faults
infinitely many times, provided that blocks of up to k faults are separated by
short recovery periods in which no fault occurs. k-resilience is a simple but
powerful abstraction from the precise distribution of local faults, but much
more refined than the traditional objective to maximize the number of local
faults. We argue why we believe this to be the right level of abstraction for
safety critical systems when local faults are few and far between. We show that
the computational complexity of constructing optimal control with respect to

in most cases by very small numbers. This analysis strengthens in some sense
Friedmann's results and shows that the discrete strategy improvement algorithm

by MFV couplings independent of the Higgs couplings to gauge bosons or the top
quark. To determine the implications of the present Higgs data on the model, we
have performed global fits to all relevant data. Several surprisingly large
effects on the light Higgs phenomenology can arise: (1) The modified couplings
of the Higgs to fermions can enhance the h --> gamma gamma rate significantly
in both VBF production (up to a factor of 3 or more) and the inclusive rate (up
to a factor of 1.5 or more). (2) In the 2HDM Type MFV, the constraints on a
light charged Higgs are milder than in 2HDM Types I-IV. Thus, there can be
substantial charged Higgs loop contribution to the di-photon rate, allowing
further enhancements of the di-photon rates. (3) The h --> tau+tau- rate can be
(highly) suppressed, independently of the other decay channels. Furthermore, we
studied the correlation between the light Higgs and the heavy Higgs
phenomenology. We showed that even small deviations from the decoupling limit
would imply good prospects for the detection of the heavy Higgs boson. In some
regions of parameter space, a substantial range of M_H is already either ruled
out or on the edge of detection. Finally we investigated the possibility that
the heavy Higgs is close in mass to the light Higgs, providing additional h/H

campaigns. Astrometric parameters are commonly derived by fitting them as
parameters of a timing model to a series of pulse times of arrival (TOAs). TOAs
measured to microsecond precision over several-year spans can yield position
measurements with sub-milliarcsecond precision. However, timing-based
astrometry can become biased if a pulsar displays any red spin noise, which can
be compared to the red noise signal produced by the stochastic gravitational
wave background. We investigate how noise of different spectral types is
absorbed by timing models, leading to significant estimation errors in the
astrometric parameters. We find that commonly used techniques for fitting
timing models in the presence of red noise (Cholesky whitening) prevent the
absorption of noise into the timing model remarkably well if the time baseline
of observations exceeds several years, but are inadequate for dealing with
shorter pulsar data sets. Independent of timing, pulsar-optimized very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI) is capable of providing position estimates
precise to the sub-milliarcsecond levels needed for high-precision timing. We
compute a necessary transformation between the International Celestial
Reference Frame and pulsar timing frames and quantitatively discuss how the
transformation will improve in coming years. We find that incorporating VLBI
astrometry into the timing models of pulsars for which only a couple of years
of timing data exist will lead to more realistic assessments of red spin noise
and could enhance the amplitude of gravitational wave signatures in post-fit
timing residuals by factors of 20 or more.

star formation histories and chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies by using a
new chemodynamical model. We mainly present the numerical results of two
comparative models so that the A-SN feedback effects on galaxies can be more
clearly seen. SNe originating from stars with masses larger than 30M_sun are
A-SNe in the ""ASN"" model whereas all SNe are spherical ones (S-SNe) in the
""SSN"" model. Each S-SN and A-SN are assumed to release feedback energy of
10^{51} erg and 10^{52} erg, respectively, and chemical yields and feedback
energy of A-SN ejecta depend on angles between the axis of symmetry and the
ejection directions. We find that star formation can become at least by a
factor of ~3 lower in the ASN model in comparison with the SSN one owing to the
more energetic feedback of A-SNe. As a result of this, chemical evolution can
proceed very slowly in the ASN model. A-SN feedback effects can play a
significant role in the formation of giant gaseous holes and energetic gaseous
outflow and unique chemical abundances (e.g., high [Mg/Ca]). Based on these
results, we provide a number of implications of the A-SN feedback effects on

C$^+$, which reacts with CH$_4$ to form carbon chains, increases in abundance

provide here an approximate formula for the radii r_{ph}(a/M;cos i) of these
spherical null geodesics, where a/M is the dimensionless angular-momentum of
the black hole and cos i is an effective inclination angle (with respect to the
black-hole equatorial plane) of the orbit. It is well-known that the equatorial

black hole. Furthermore, it is shown that spherical photon orbits of
rapidly-rotating black holes are characterized by a critical inclination angle,
cos i=\sqrt{4/7}, above which the coordinate radii of the orbits approach the
black-hole radius in the extremal limit. We prove that this critical
inclination angle signals a transition in the physical properties of the
spherical null geodesics: in particular, it separates orbits which are
characterized by finite proper distances to the black-hole horizon from orbits
which are characterized by infinite proper distances to the horizon.

that a combination of selection effects (both instrumental and astrophysical)

the empirical distribution function (e.d.f.) of Gaussian vector components,

stationary. Rather, we make a ""vanishing second order"" assumption ensuring that
the covariance matrix $\Gamma^{(m)}$ is not too far from the identity matrix,
while the behavior of the e.d.f. is affected by $\Gamma^{(m)}$ only through the
sequence $\gamma_m=m^{-2} \sum_{i\neq j} \Gamma_{i,j}^{(m)}$, as $m$ grows to
infinity. This result recovers some of the previous results for stationary
long-range dependencies while it also applies to various, high-dimensional,
non-stationary frameworks, for which the most correlated variables are not
necessarily next to each other. Finally, we present an application of this work
to the multiple testing problem, which was the initial statistical motivation

shift-keying framework for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output systems, which uses a
set of Space-Time matrices termed as Dispersion Matrices (DM). CSTSK may be
combined with a classic signaling set (eg. QAM, PSK) in order to strike a
flexible tradeoff between the achievable diversity and multiplexing gain. One
of the key benefits of the CSTSK scheme is its Inter-Channel Interference (ICI)
free system that makes single-stream Maximum Likelihood detection possible at
low-complexity. In the existing CSTSK scheme, DMs are chosen by maximizing the
mutual information over a large set of complex valued, Gaussian random matrices
through numerical simulations. We refer to them as Capacity-Optimized (CO) DMs.
In this contribution we establish a connection between the STSK scheme as well
as the Space-Time Block Codes (STBC) and show that a class of STBCs termed as
Decomposable Dispersion Codes (DDC) enjoy all the benefits that are specific to
the STSK scheme. Two STBCs belonging to this class are proposed, a rate-one
code from Field Extensions and a full-rate code from Cyclic Division Algebras,
that offer structured DMs with desirable properties such as full-diversity, and
a high coding gain. We show that the DMs derived from these codes are capable
of achieving a performance than CO-DMs, and emphasize the importance of DMs
having a higher coding gain than CO-DMs in scenarios having realistic,
imperfect channel state information at the receiver.

Under-fitting can be avoided by more informative priors on observation noise.
Combining these methods allows applying GP methods reliably automatically to

  The condition for this self-sustained MRI is set by the balance between the
energy supply from the shearing motion and the energy consumed by the Ohmic
dissipation. We apply the condition to various disk models and study where the
active, self-sustained, and dead zones of MRI are. In the fiducial minimum-mass
solar nebula (MMSN) model, the newly-found sustained zone occupies only the
limited volume of the disk. In the late-phase gas-depleted disk models,
however, the sustained zone occupies larger volume of the disk.

higher latitudes (beyond +-50 degree). Statistical analysis of these data
indicates that the magnetic networks are of fractal in nature, and the average
fractal dimension is D_f = 1.253+-0.011. We also find that both the fractal
dimension and the size of the magnetic networks are anti-correlated with the

spatially modulated oscillation, compress the boundaries of network cells,
leading to smoother cell boundaries. The fractal dimension of the cell deviates
that predicted from an isobar of Kolmogorov homogeneous turbulence.

quantification and protein identification are two major computational problems.
To quantify the protein abundance, a list of proteins must be firstly inferred
from the sample. Then the relative or absolute protein abundance is estimated
with quantification methods, such as spectral counting. Until now, researchers
have been dealing with these two processes separately. In fact, they are two
sides of same coin in the sense that truly present proteins are those proteins
with non-zero abundances. Then, one interesting question is if we regard the
protein inference problem as a special protein quantification problem, is it
possible to achieve better protein inference performance?
  Contribution: In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using protein
quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem. Protein
inference is to determine whether each candidate protein is present in the
sample or not. Protein quantification is to calculate the abundance of each
protein. Naturally, the absent proteins should have zero abundances. Thus, we
argue that the protein inference problem can be viewed as a special case of
protein quantification problem: present proteins are those proteins with
non-zero abundances. Based on this idea, our paper tries to use three very
simple protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem
effectively.
  Results: The experimental results on six datasets show that these three
methods are competitive with previous protein inference algorithms. This
demonstrates that it is plausible to take the protein inference problem as a
special case of protein quantification, which opens the door of devising more
effective protein inference algorithms from a quantification perspective.

fields are almost Gaussian, the possibility of a small deviation of their
fields from Gaussianity is widely discussed. Theoretically, there exist
numerous inflationary scenarios which predict large and characteristic
non-Gaussianities in the primordial perturbations. These model-dependent
non-Gaussianities act as sources of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
bispectrum; therefore, the analysis of the CMB bispectrum is very important and
attractive in order to clarify the nature of the early Universe. Currently, the
impacts of the primordial non-Gaussianities in the scalar perturbations, where
the rotational and parity invariances are kept, on the CMB bispectrum have been
well-studied. However, for a complex treatment, the CMB bispectra generated
from the non-Gaussianities, which originate from the vector- and tensor-mode
perturbations and include the violation of the rotational or parity invariance,
have never been considered in spite of the importance of this information. On
the basis of our current studies, this thesis provides the general formalism
for the CMB bispectrum sourced by the non-Gaussianities not only in the
scalar-mode perturbations but also in the vector- and tensor-mode
perturbations. Applying this formalism, we calculate the CMB bispectrum from
two scalars and a graviton correlation and that from primordial magnetic
fields, and we then outline new constraints on these amplitudes. Furthermore,
this formalism can be easily extended to the cases where the rotational or
parity invariance is broken. We also compute the CMB bispectra from the
non-Gaussianities of the curvature perturbations with a preferred direction and
the graviton non-Gaussianities induced by the parity-violating Weyl cubic
terms. We also present some unique impacts to the violation of these
invariances on the CMB bispectrum.

with radio 1.4 GHz and mid-IR 24 um detections using some of the deepest

date, we have robustly identified a sample of 51 radio-excess AGN (~1300
deg^-2) out to redshift z~3. These radio-excess AGN have a significantly lower
far-IR/radio ratio (q<1.68) than the typical relation observed for star-forming
galaxies (q~2.2). We find that ~45% of these radio-excess sources have a
dominant AGN component in the mid-IR band, while for the remainders the excess
radio emission is the only indicator of AGN activity. The fraction of
radio-excess AGN increases with X-ray luminosity reaching ~60% at
Lx~10^44-10^45 erg/s, making these sources an important part of the total AGN
population. However, almost half (24/51) of these radio-excess AGN are not
detected in the deep Chandra X-ray data, suggesting that some of these sources
might be heavily obscured. We also find that the specific star formation rates
(sSFRs) of the radio-excess AGN are on average lower that those observed for
X-ray selected AGN hosts, indicating that our sources are forming stars more
slowly than typical AGN hosts, and possibly their star formation is
progressively quenching.

  Here we analyse metabolic networks from a section of microorganisms, using a

Evershed effect disappears together with the continuum intensity drop at the
outer sunspot (penumbral) border. Corresponding downflows must then be smaller
than the spatial resolution presently achieved (i.e., <0.5 arcsec) and located

the sharp threshold of the equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energy

growth process based on the TASEP model by allowing particles to move both
forward and backward on the lattice. The bias in the forward and backward jump
rates determines the lattice tip speed, which we analyze and also compare to
simulations. For positive bias, the system is in a non-equilibrium steady state
and exhibits boundary-induced phase transitions. The tip speed is constant. In
the no-bias case we find that the length of the lattice grows as

photometry obtained during the spectroscopic run. We found a considerable
star-to-star variation in both A(C) and A(N) at all luminosities for our sample
of 35 targets. These abundances appear to be anticorrelated, with a hint of
bimodality in the C content for stars with luminosities below the RBG bump
(V~15.7), while the range of variations in N abundances is very large and spans
almost ~ 2 dex. We find additional C depletion as the stars evolve off the RGB
bump, in fairly good agreement with theoretical predictions for metal-poor
stars in the course of normal stellar evolution. We isolated two groups with
N-rich and N-poor stars and found that N abundance variations correlate with
the (U-V) color in the DOLORES color-magnitude diagram (CMD). The V, (U-V) CMD
for this cluster shows an additional RGB sequence, located at the red of the
main RGB and amounting to a small fraction of the total giant population. We
identified two CH stars detected in previous studies in our U, V images. These
stars, which are both cluster members, fall on this redder sequence, suggesting
that the anomalous RGB should have a peculiar chemical pattern. Unfortunately,

it is believed that we need to understand the gravitational self-forces.

estimate the order of magnitude of the dephasing caused by the second order
self-forces on a small body in a quasi-circular orbit around a Kerr black hole,
based on the knowledge of the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation and invoking
the energy balance argument. In particular, we focus on the averaged
dissipative part of the self-force, since it gives the leading order
contribution among the various components of them. To avoid the possibility
that the energy flux of GWs becomes negative, we propose a new simple
resummation called exponential resummation, which assures the positivity of the
energy flux. In order to estimate the magnitude of the yet unknown second order
self-forces, here we point out the scaling property in the absolute value of
the PN coefficients of the energy flux. Using these new tools, we evaluate the
expected magnitude of dephasing. Our analysis indicates that the dephasing due
to the second order self-forces for quasi-circular E(I)MRIs may be well
captured by the 3PN energy flux, once we obtain all the spin dependent terms,
except for the case with an extremely large spin of the central Kerr black.

correlates with $\lambda$; (iii) radio-loudness, ${\cal R} \equiv

of the Eddington ratio indicates that the parent population of NLRGs includes
both radio-loud quasars (RLQs) and broad-line radio galaxies (BLRGs). The
correlations they obey and their high jet production efficiencies favor a jet
production model which involves the so-called 'magnetically choked' accretion
scenario. In this model, production of the jet is dominated by the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism, and the magnetic fields in the vicinity of the
central black hole are confined by the ram pressure of the accretion flow.
Since large net magnetic flux accumulated in central regions of the accretion
flow required by the model can take place only via geometrically thick
accretion, we speculate that the massive, 'cold' accretion events associated
with luminous emission-line AGN can be accompanied by an efficient jet
production only if preceded by a hot, very sub-Eddington accretion phase.

codes are perfectly capable of not only following the formation and evolution
of dark matter but also account for baryonic physics (e.g. hydrodynamics, star
formation, feedback) object finders should also be capable of taking these
additional processes into consideration. Here we report on a comparison of
codes as applied to the Constrained Local UniversE Simulation (CLUES) of the
formation of the Local Group which incorporates much of the physics relevant

velocity-space to spherical overdensity based codes, including also a mere
baryonic object finder. We obtain agreement amongst codes comparable to (if not
better than) our previous comparisons, at least for the total, dark, and
stellar components of the objects. However, the diffuse gas content of the
haloes shows great disparity, especially for low-mass satellite galaxies. This
is primarily due to differences in the treatment of the thermal energy during
the unbinding procedure. We acknowledge that the handling of gas in halo
finders is something that needs to be dealt with carefully, and the precise
treatment may depend sensitively upon the scientific problem being studied.

task can only be executed if all input and output files fit into memory, and a
file can only be removed from memory after it has been consumed. Such trees
arise, for instance, in the multifrontal method of sparse matrix factorization.
The maximum amount of memory needed depends on the execution order of the
tasks. With one processor the objective of the tree traversal is to minimize
the required memory. This problem was well studied and optimal polynomial
algorithms were proposed.
  Here, we extend the problem by considering multiple processors, which is of
obvious interest in the application area of matrix factorization. With the
multiple processors comes the additional objective to minimize the time needed
to traverse the tree, i.e., to minimize the makespan. Not surprisingly, this
problem proves to be much harder than the sequential one. We study the
computational complexity of this problem and provide an inapproximability
result even for unit weight trees. Several heuristics are proposed, each with a
different optimization focus, and they are analyzed in an extensive

the barrier, Rayleigh-Taylor instability results in the creation of a mixing
region, which grows with time. This growth accelerates until the mixing region
fills the entire tank. The second sequence shows Rayleigh-Taylor instability
when it is confined between two stable stratifications. Although initially the
growth of the mixing region accelerates, the stable stratification slows the
growth of the instability and brings it to a halt before it can fill the tank.

permutations, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms face the
label-switching problem, rendering marginal inference particularly cumbersome.
Such a situation arises, for example, in the Bayesian analysis of finite
mixture models. Adaptive MCMC algorithms such as adaptive Metropolis (AM),
which self-calibrates its proposal distribution using an online estimate of the
covariance matrix of the target, are no exception. To address the
label-switching issue, relabeling algorithms associate a permutation to each
MCMC sample, trying to obtain reasonable marginals. In the case of adaptive
Metropolis (Bernoulli 7 (2001) 223-242), an online relabeling strategy is
required. This paper is devoted to the AMOR algorithm, a provably consistent
variant of AM that can cope with the label-switching problem. The idea is to
nest relabeling steps within the MCMC algorithm based on the estimation of a
single covariance matrix that is used both for adapting the covariance of the
proposal distribution in the Metropolis algorithm step and for online
relabeling. We compare the behavior of AMOR to similar relabeling methods. In
the case of compactly supported target distributions, we prove a strong law of
large numbers for AMOR and its ergodicity. These are the first results on the
consistency of an online relabeling algorithm to our knowledge. The proof
underlines latent relations between relabeling and vector quantization.

structures observed by Chinese Solar Broadband Radio Spectrometer
(SBRS/Huairou) at 2.6-3.8 GHz in 9 solar flares, and found that the ratio
between the plasma density scale height LN and the magnetic field scale height
LB in emission source displays a tendency of decrease during the flaring
processes. The ratio LN/LB is about 3-5 before the maximum of flares. It
decreases to about 2 after the maximum. The detailed analysis of three typical
X-class flares implied that the variation of LN/LB during the flaring process
is most likely due to the topological changes of the magnetic field in the
flaring source region, and the step-wise decrease of LN/LB possibly reflects
the magnetic field relaxation relative to the plasma density when the flaring
energy released. This result may also constrain the solar flare modeling to
some extent.

given size are there? What is a ""typical"" structure of a simply typable term?
Despite their ostensible simplicity, these questions still remain unanswered,
whereas solutions to such problems are essential for testing compilers and
optimizing programs whose expected efficiency depends on the size of terms. Our
approach toward the afore-mentioned problems may be later extended to any
language with bound variables, i.e., with scopes and declarations. This paper
presents two complementary approaches: one, theoretical, uses complex analysis
and generating functions, the other, experimental, is based on a generator of
lambda-terms. Thanks to de Bruijn indices, we provide three families of
formulas for the number of closed lambda terms of a given size and we give four
relations between these numbers which have interesting combinatorial
interpretations. As a by-product of the counting formulas, we design an
algorithm for generating lambda terms. Performed tests provide us with
experimental data, like the average depth of bound variables and the average
number of head lambdas. We also create random generators for various sorts of
terms. Thereafter, we conduct experiments that answer questions like: What is
the ratio of simply typable terms among all terms? (Very small!) How are simply
typable lambda terms distributed among all lambda terms? (A typable term almost
always starts with an abstraction.) In this paper, abstractions and
applications have size 1 and variables have size 0.

the advantage of avoiding decoherence from the hyperfine interaction by
purifying them with only zero-spin nuclei. Complications of group IV materials
arise from the valley degeneracies in the electronic bandstructure. These lead
to complicated multiplet states even for two-electron quantum dots thereby
significantly weakening the selection rules for Pauli blockade. Only recently
have spin qubits been realized in silicon devices where the valley degeneracy
is lifted by strain and spatial confinement. In carbon nanotubes Pauli blockade
can be observed by lifting valley degeneracy through disorder. In clean
nanotubes, quantum dots have to be made ultra-small to obtain a large energy
difference between the relevant multiplet states. Here we report on
low-disorder nanotubes and demonstrate Pauli blockade based on both valley and

potential prototype curves used for the drawing of prehistoric wall-paintings.
The approach includes a) preprocessing of the wall-paintings contours to
properly partition them, according to their curvature, b) choice of prototype
curves families, c) analysis and optimization in 4-manifold for a first
estimation of the form of these prototypes, d) clustering of the contour parts
and the prototypes, to determine a minimal number of potential guides, e)
further optimization in 4-manifold, applied to each cluster separately, in
order to determine the exact functional form of the potential guides, together
with the corresponding drawn contour parts. The introduced methodology
simultaneously deals with two problems: a) the arbitrariness in data-points
orientation and b) the determination of one proper form for a prototype curve
that optimally fits the corresponding contour data. Arbitrariness in
orientation has been dealt with a novel curvature based error, while the proper
forms of curve prototypes have been exhaustively determined by embedding
curvature deformations of the prototypes into 4-manifolds. Application of this
methodology to celebrated wall-paintings excavated at Tyrins, Greece and the
Greek island of Thera, manifests it is highly probable that these
wall-paintings had been drawn by means of geometric guides that correspond to
linear spirals and hyperbolae. These geometric forms fit the drawings' lines
with an exceptionally low average error, less than 0.39mm. Hence, the approach
suggests the existence of accurate realizations of complicated geometric
entities, more than 1000 years before their axiomatic formulation in Classical
Ages.

decoherence-free (DF) subsystem for an infinite dimensional linear open quantum
system. The main idea is that, based on the Heisenberg picture of the dynamics
rather than the commonly-taken Schrodinger picture, the notions of
controllability and observability in control theory are employed to
characterize a DF subsystem. A particularly useful result is a general if and
only if condition for a linear system to have a DF component; this condition is
used to demonstrate how to actually construct a DF dynamics in some specific
examples. It is also shown that, as in the finite dimensional case, we are able
to do coherent manipulation and preservation of a state of a DF subsystem.

evaluate in this model the CP-even scalar decay rate to two photons and use

provide input for nuclear matrix element calculations relevant to the decay.
The $(p,t)$ two-neutron transfer reaction was measured on nuclei of
$^{102,100}$Ru and $^{100,98}$Mo. The experiment was designed to have
particular sensitivity to $0^{+}$ states up to excitation energies of $\sim 3$
MeV with high energy resolution. Measurements were made at two angles and L=0
transitions identified by the ratio of yields between the two angles. For the
reactions leading to and from $^{100}$Ru, greater than 95% of the L=0 $(p,t)$
strength was in the ground state, but in $^{100}$Mo about 20% was in excited
$0^{+}$ states. The measured $(p,t)$ data, together with existing $(t,p)$ data,
suggest that $^{100}$Mo is a shape-transitional nucleus while $^{100}$Ru is
closer to the spherical side of that transition. Theoretical calculations of
the $0\nu2\beta$ nuclear matrix element may be complicated by this difference
in shape.

between the different views in order to exchange information during the
learning process. However, many applications provide only a partial mapping
between the views, creating a challenge for current methods. To address this
problem, we propose a multi-view algorithm based on constrained clustering that
can operate with an incomplete mapping. Given a set of pairwise constraints in
each view, our approach propagates these constraints using a local similarity
measure to those instances that can be mapped to the other views, allowing the
propagated constraints to be transferred across views via the partial mapping.
It uses co-EM to iteratively estimate the propagation within each view based on
the current clustering model, transfer the constraints across views, and then
update the clustering model. By alternating the learning process between views,
this approach produces a unified clustering model that is consistent with all
views. We show that this approach significantly improves clustering performance
over several other methods for transferring constraints and allows multi-view
clustering to be reliably applied when given a limited mapping between the
views. Our evaluation reveals that the propagated constraints have high
precision with respect to the true clusters in the data, explaining their
benefit to clustering performance in both single- and multi-view learning
scenarios.

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) jump conditions of relativistic shocks. The adiabatic
constant is calculated directly from first principle particle-in-cell
simulation data, enabling a semi-kinetic approach to improve the standard fluid
model and allowing for an identification of the key parameters that define the
shock structure. We find that the evolving upstream parameters have a stronger
impact than the corrections due to non-thermal particles. We find that the
decrease of the upstream bulk speed yields deviations from the standard MHD
model up to 10%. Furthermore, we obtain a quantitative definition of the shock
transition region from our analysis. For Weibel-mediated shocks the inclusion
of a magnetic field in the MHD conservation equations is addressed for the
first time.

"1210.2644","Tristan van Leeuwen","Tristan van Leeuwen","Fourier analysis of the CGMN method for solving the Helmholtz equation",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Helmholtz equation arises in many applications, such as seismic and
medical imaging. These application are characterized by the need to propagate
many wavelengths through an inhomogeneous medium. The typical size of the
problems in 3D applications precludes the use of direct factorization to solve
the equation and hence iterative methods are used in practice. For higher
wavenumbers, the system becomes increasingly indefinite and thus good
preconditioners need to be constructed. In this note we consider an accelerated
Kazcmarz method (CGMN) and present an expression for the resulting iteration
matrix. This iteration matrix can be used to analyze the convergence of the
CGMN method. In particular, we present a Fourier analysis for the method
applied to the 1D Helmholtz equation. This analysis suggests an optimal choice
of the relaxation parameter. Finally, we present some numerical experiments.

elastic body deformation instances, so as to quantify mechano-elastic
characteristics that are deformation invariant. Determination of such
characteristics allows for developing methods offering an image of the
undeformed body. General assumptions about the mechano-elastic properties of
the bodies are stated, which lead to two different approaches for obtaining
bodies' deformation invariants. One was developed to spot deformed body's
neutral line and its cross sections, while the other solves deformation PDEs by
performing a set of equivalent image operations on the deformed body images.
Both these processes may furnish a body undeformed version from its deformed
image. This was confirmed by obtaining the undeformed shape of deformed
parasites, cells (protozoa), fibers and human lips. In addition, the method has
been applied to the important problem of parasite automatic classification from
their microscopic images. To achieve this, we first apply the previous method
to straighten the highly deformed parasites and then we apply a dedicated curve
classification method to the straightened parasite contours. It is demonstrated
that essentially different deformations of the same parasite give rise to
practically the same undeformed shape, thus confirming the consistency of the
introduced methodology. Finally, the developed pattern recognition method
classifies the unwrapped parasites into 6 families, with an accuracy rate of
97.6 %.

identified and classified 458 Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in and around the H
II regions. YSOs were determined by fitting a collection of radiative transfer
model spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to infrared photometry for a large
sample of point sources. We determined areas where there exist enhanced
populations of relatively unevolved YSOs on the bright rims of these regions,
suggesting that star formation has been triggered there. We further
investigated the physical properties of the regions by using radio continuum
emission as a proxy for ionizing flux powering the H II regions, and 13CO (1-0)
observations to measure masses and gravitational stability of molecular clumps.
We used an analytical model of collect and collapse triggered star formation,
as well as a simulation of radiatively driven implosion, and thus we compare
the observed properties of the molecular gas with those predicted in the
triggering scenarios. Notably, those regions in our sample that show evidence

"1210.3575","Edward Gillis","Edward J. Gillis","Relativity Is Not About Spacetime","11 pages. Written for the 2012 FQXi essay contest ""Which of Our Basic
  Physical Assumptions Are Wrong?""",,,,"physics.hist-ph gr-qc quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum measurement predictions are consistent with relativity for
macroscopic observations, but there is no consensus on how to explain this
consistency in fundamental terms. The prevailing assumption is that the
relativistic structure of spacetime should provide the framework for any
microphysical account. This bias is due, in large part, to our intuitions about
local causality, the idea that all physical processes propagate through space
in a continuous manner. I argue that relativity is not a guarantor of local
causality, and is not about ontological features of spacetime. It is, rather,
an expression of the observational equivalence of spacetime descriptions of
physical processes. This observational equivalence is due to the essentially
probabilistic nature of quantum theory.
