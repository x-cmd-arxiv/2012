infinity. The motivating examples are eigenspaces or quasi-mode spaces of a
Laplace or Schrodinger operator. We define a random ONB of H_N by fixing one
ONB and changing it by a random element of U(d_N). A random ONB of the direct
sum of the H_N is an independent sequence {U_N} of random ONB's of the H_N. We
prove that if d_N tends to infinity and if the normalized traces of observables
in H_N tend to a unique limit state, then a random ONB also tends to that limit
state. This generalizes an earlier result of the author for eigenspaces of the
standard 2-sphere, and shows that the result does not depend on how fast the
dimensions grow. In particular it is valid for eigenspaces of a flat rational
torus in dimensions > 4. The main idea is to convert quantum ergodicity into a
problem on the moments of inertia of permutahedra and to calculate the moments
using Schur polynomials.

point process - the stochastic growth-interaction process - which is an
extension of the spatio-temporal growth-interaction process to the stochastic
mark setting. As a pilot study we here consider a particular version of this
extended process, which has a homogenous Poisson process as unmarked point
process and shifted independent Cox-Ingersoll-Ross processes as functional
marks. These marks have supports determined by the lifetimes generated by an
immigration-death process. By considering a (temporally) discrete sample scheme
for the marks and by considering the process' alternative evolutionary
representation as a multivariate diffusion (Markovian) with jumps, the
likelihood function is expressed as a product of the process' closed form
transition densities. Additionally, under the assumption that the mark
processes are started in their common stationary distribution, and under some
restrictions on the underlying parameters, consistency and asymptotic normality
of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimators are proved. The ML-estimators derived
from the stationarity assumption are then compared numerically to the
ML-estimators derived under non-stationarity, in order to investigate the
robustness of the stationarity assumption. To illustrate the model's use in
forestry, it is fitted to a data set of Scots pines.

energy dependence of the flow observables are quantitatively studied for both
the Monte-Carlo Glauber and Monte-Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) models.
For MC-Glauber model initial conditions with {\eta}/s = 0.08, the differential
charged hadron elliptic flow v_2^{ch}(p_T, sqrt(s)) is found to exhibit a very
broad maximum in the region 39 < sqrt(s) < 2760 A GeV. For MC-KLN initial
conditions with {\eta}/s = 0.2, a similar ""saturation"" is not observed up to

the interplay between radial flow and elliptic flow which shifts with sqrt(s)
depending on the fluid's viscosity. By generalizing the definition of spatial
eccentricity to isothermal hyper-surface, we also calculate {\epsilon}_x on the

represented by the same degrees of freedom that describe its exterior.
Entanglement plays a crucial role in the reconstruction of the interior degrees
of freedom. This connection is manifest in ""two-sided"" eternal black holes. But
for real black holes which are formed from collapse there are no second sides.
The sense in which horizon entropy is entanglement entropy is much more subtle
for one-sided black holes. It involves entanglement between different parts of
the near-horizon system. As a one-sided black hole evaporates the entanglement
that accounts for its interior degrees of freedom disappears, and is gradually
replaced by entanglement with the outgoing Hawking radiation. A principle of
""transfer of entanglement"" can be formulated. According to the argument of
Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski and Sully, it is when the transfer of entanglement
is completed at the Page time, that a firewall replaces the horizon.
Alternatives to firewalls may suffer contradictions which are similar to those

analytical approaches are unknown, the only available solution is to perform an
exhaustive search over the encoder and the labeling. For large constellation
sizes and/or many encoder states, however, an exhaustive search is unfeasible.
Traditional TCM designs overcome this problem by using a labeling that follows
the set-partitioning principle and by performing an exhaustive search over the
encoders. In this paper we study binary labelings for TCM and show how they can
be grouped into classes, which considerably reduces the search space in a joint

must be tested is reduced from 8!=40320 to 240. For the particular case of an
8-ary pulse amplitude modulation constellation, this number is further reduced
to 120 and for 8-ary phase shift keying to only 30. An algorithm to generate

encoders are tabulated which are up to 0.3 dB better than the previously best

fields of X-ray astronomy. It often results from the reprocessing of external
X-rays by a neutral or low-ionized medium, but it can also be excited by
impacts of low-energy cosmic rays. This paper aims to provide signatures
allowing identification of radiation from low-energy cosmic rays in X-ray
spectra showing the 6.4 keV line. We study in detail the production of
nonthermal line and continuum X-rays by interaction of accelerated electrons
and ions with a neutral ambient gas. Corresponding models are then applied to
XMM-Newton observations of the X-ray emission emanating from the Arches cluster
region near the Galactic center. Bright 6.4 keV line structures are observed
around the Arches cluster. This emission is very likely produced by cosmic
rays. We find that it can result from the bombardment of molecular gas by
energetic ions, but probably not by accelerated electrons. Using a model of
X-ray production by cosmic-ray ions, we obtain a best-fit metallicity of the
ambient medium of 1.7 plus-minus 0.2 times the solar metallicity. A large flux
of low-energy cosmic ray ions could be produced in the ongoing supersonic
collision between the star cluster and an adjacent molecular cloud. We find
that a particle acceleration efficiency in the resulting shock system of a few
percent would give enough power in the cosmic rays to explain the luminosity of
the nonthermal X-ray emission. Depending on the unknown shape of the kinetic
energy distribution of the fast ions above 1 GeV per nucleon, the Arches
cluster region may be a source of high-energy gamma-rays detectable with the
Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. At present, the X-ray emission prominent in
the 6.4 keV Fe line emanating from the Arches cluster region probably offers
the best available signature for a source of low-energy hadronic cosmic rays in
the Galaxy.

of left-right type between the transition metals and the oxygen atoms, which is
mediated by excitations from the nominal single Slater ground state into
antibonding and d-type orbitals. In a localized representation, this
correlation manifests itself in a 2-electron hopping term that is off-diagonal.
This term is of similar magnitude to the commonly considered Hubbard-type
on-site interaction.

  translational addition theorem","10 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the translational addition theorem for spherical functions is
employed to exactly calculate the acoustic radiation force produced by an
arbitrary shaped beam on a sphere suspended in an inviscid fluid. The radiation
force is given in terms of the beam-shape and the scattering coefficients. Each
beam-shape coefficient (BSC) is the complex weight of a multipole mode in
partial-wave expansion of the incident beam. Moreover, they depend on the
choice of the reference frame which is defined by the sphere's center. On the
other hand, the scattering coefficients are obtained from the acoustic boundary
conditions across the sphere's surface. Given a set of known BSCs, the
translational addition theorem can be used to obtain the new coefficients
relative to the sphere's position. Such approach is particularly useful when no
closed-form expression of the incident pressure is known, but its BSCs are
available. This is the case of a spherically focused ultrasound beam, for which
we compute the radiation force on an absorbing compressible sphere arbitrarly
placed in the fluid. The analysis is carried out in the Rayleigh and the
resonant scattering regimes. It is shown that the focused beam may trap a
spherical particle in the Rayleigh scattering regime.

environment restores the distribution of entanglement. Surprisingly, this
reactivation can be induced by the injection of separable correlations from the
composite environment. In any dimension (finite or infinite), we can construct
classically-correlated ""twirling"" environments which are entanglement-breaking
in the transmission of single systems but entanglement-preserving when two
systems are transmitted. Here entanglement is simply preserved by the existence
of decoherence-free subspaces. Remarkably, even when such subspaces do not
exist, a fraction of the input entanglement can still be distributed. This is
found in separable Gaussian environments, where distillable entanglement is
able to survive the two-mode transmission, despite being broken in any
single-mode transmission by the strong thermal noise. In the Gaussian setting,
entanglement restoration is a threshold process, occurring only after a
critical amount of correlations has been injected. Such findings suggest new
perspectives for distributing entanglement in realistic environments with
extreme decoherence, identifying separable correlations and classical memory
effects as physical resources for ""breaking entanglement-breaking"".

naturally decomposed into various modules. The integration of specification
modules contrasts to the parallel composition of program components, and

recent development of multiparty session types for process calculi provides
useful techniques to accommodate the protocol modularisation, by encoding
fragments of communication protocols in the usage of private channels for a
class of agents. In this paper, we extend forgoing session type theories by
enhancing the session integration mechanism. More specifically, we propose a
novel synchronous multiparty session type theory, in which sessions are
separated into the communicating and integrating levels. Communicating sessions
record the message-based communications between multiple agents, whilst
integrating sessions describe the integration of communicating ones. A
two-level session type system is developed for pi-calculus with syntactic
primitives for session establishment, and several key properties of the type
system are studied. Applying the theory to system description, we show that a
channel safety property and a session conformance property can be analysed.
Also, to improve the utility of the theory, a process slicing method is used to
help identify the violated sessions in the type checking.

jet is highly polarized, and surprisingly, the electric vector position angles
in the jet are ``twisted'' with respect to the jet axis. Simple models of
magnetized jets are investigated in order to study various possible origins of
the electric vector distribution. In a cylindrically-symmetric transparent jet
a helical magnetic field will appear either transverse or longitudinal due to
partial cancellations of Stokes parameters between the front and back of the
jet. Synchrotron opacity can break the symmetry, but it leads to fractional
polarization less than that observed, and to strong frequency dependence that
is not seen. Modeling shows that differential Doppler boosting in a diverging
jet can break the symmetry, allowing a helical magnetic field to produce a
twisted electric vector pattern. Constraints on the jet inclination, magnetic
field properties, intrinsic opening angle, and fluid velocities are obtained,
and show that highly relativistic speeds ($\beta \ga 0.95$) are required. This
is consistent with the observed jet opening angle, with the absence of a
counter-jet, with the polarization of the knots at the end of the jet, and with
some inverse-Compton models for the X-ray emission from the 3C\,345 jet. This
model can also apply on parsec scales and may help explain those sources where
the electric vector position angles in the jet are neither parallel nor
transverse to the jet axis.

electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the direct methanol
fuel cell cathodes and the oxygen binding energy is a descriptor for the
catalyst activity towards this reaction. We find the character of chemical
bonding of Se on a flat nanoparticle facet to be ionic, similar to that
obtained earlier for the Se/Ru(0001) surface, while in the case of a low
coordinated Ru configuration there is an indication of some covalent
contribution to the bonding leading to an increase in Se binding energy. Se and
O co-adsorbed on the flat facet, both accept electronic charge from Ru, whereas
the adsorption on low-coordinated sites causes more complicated valence charge
redistribution. The Se modification of the Ru particles leads to weakening of
the oxygen bonding to the particle. However, overall, O binding energies are
found to be higher for the particles than for Se/Ru(0001). High reactivity of
the Se/Ru nanoparticles found in this work is not favorable for ORR. We thus
expect that larger particles with well-developed flat facets are more efficient
ORR catalysts than small nanoparticles with a large fraction of

total neutrino mass, favors an extra light degree of freedom, and supports the

in constraining cosmological model parameters for fixed $w$. The dataset of

the action potentials, in the form of electromagnetic (EM) pulses, can

We consider two spatially separated sources with correlated unknown source

$n$ from one of the sources provided that the decoder has access to (i.e.,
memorized) a sequence of length $m$ from the other source. In this setup, the
correlation does not arise from symbol-by-symbol dependency of two outputs from
the two sources (as in Slepian-Wolf setup). Instead, the two sequences are
correlated because they are originated from the two sources with \emph{unknown}
correlated parameters. The finite-length nature of the compression problem at
hand requires considering a notion of almost lossless source coding, where
coding incurs an error probability $p_e(n)$ that vanishes as sequence length
$n$ grows to infinity. We obtain bounds on the redundancy of almost lossless
codes when the decoder has access to a random memory of length $m$ as a
function of the sequence length $n$ and the permissible error probability
$p_e(n)$. Our results demonstrate that distributed network compression via

Bertsekas (2001) into Hadamard spaces. The method is quite robust and not only
does it yield algorithms for the median and the mean, but it also applies to
various other optimization problems. We moreover show that another algorithm
for computing the Frechet mean can be derived from the law of large numbers due
to K.-T. Sturm (2002). In applications, computing medians and means is probably
most needed in tree space, which is an instance of an Hadamard space, invented

Unfortunately, the very presence and usage of such interfaces also expose the
medical devices to novel attacks from malicious parties. The emerging threat
from malicious mobile devices is significant and severe, since attackers can
steal confidential data from a patient's medical device. Also, attackers can
compromise the medical device and either feed doctors bad data from it or issue
potentially fatal commands to the device, which may even result in the death of
the patient. As the mobile devices are often at close proximity to the patient
(either in the hospital or home settings), attacks from such devices are hard
to prevent. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of this new threat

from a plastic phase where the particles in the driven region break away or
decouple from the particles in the bulk, producing a shear band. For a
bidisperse assembly, we find that the onset of a bulk disordering transition
coincides with the broadening of the shear band. We identify several distinct
dynamical regimes that are correlated with features in the velocity-force
curves. As a function of bidispersity, the decoupling force shows a
nonmonotonic behavior associated with features in the noise fluctuations, power
spectra, and bulk velocity profiles. When pinning is added in the bulk, we find
that the shear band regions can become more localized, causing a decoupling of
the driven particles from the bulk particles. For a system with thermal noise
and no pinning, the shear band region becomes more extended and the average
velocity of the driven particles drops at the thermal disordering transition of

crowds to respond to public events such as speeches, sports and debates. While
this promises tremendous opportunities to understand and make sense of the
reception of an event from the social media, the promises come entwined with
significant technical challenges. In particular, given an event and an
associated large scale collection of tweets, we need approaches to effectively
align tweets and the parts of the event they refer to. This in turn raises
questions about how to segment the event into smaller yet meaningful parts, and
how to figure out whether a tweet is a general one about the entire event or
specific one aimed at a particular segment of the event. In this work, we
present ET-LDA, an effective method for aligning an event and its tweets
through joint statistical modeling of topical influences from the events and
their associated tweets. The model enables the automatic segmentation of the
events and the characterization of tweets into two categories: (1) episodic
tweets that respond specifically to the content in the segments of the events,
and (2) steady tweets that respond generally about the events. We present an
efficient inference method for this model, and a comprehensive evaluation of
its effectiveness over existing methods. In particular, through a user study,
we demonstrate that users find the topics, the segments, the alignment, and the

localized and has a very brief impulsive phase, but more statistics are needed
to determine if these factors influence the presence of a Lyman-{\alpha} flare

the flutter of a flexible flag in axial flow, can be used to harvest energy if
one is able to convert the solid energy into electricity. Here, this is
achieved using piezoelectric patches attached to the surface of the flag that
convert the solid deformation into an electric current powering purely
resistive output circuits. Nonlinear numerical simulations in the slender-body
limit, based on an explicit description of the coupling between the fluid-solid
and electric systems, are used to determine the harvesting efficiency of the
system, namely the fraction of the flow kinetic energy flux effectively used to
power the output circuit, and its evolution with the system's parameters. The
role of the tuning between the characteristic frequencies of the fluid-solid
and electric systems is emphasized, as well as the critical impact of the
piezoelectric coupling intensity. High fluid loading, classically associated
with destabilization by damping, leads to greater energy harvesting, but with a
weaker robustness to flow velocity fluctuations due to the sensitivity of the
flapping mode selection. This suggests that a control of this mode selection by
a careful design of the output circuit could provide some opportunities of
improvement for the efficiency and robustness of the energy harvesting process.

parameter. Recent achievements of ultracold trapped Fermi atoms near a Feshbach
resonance have ushered in enormous changes. The unprecedented control of
interaction, geometry and purity in these novel systems has led to many
exciting experimental results, which are to be urgently understood at both low
and finite temperatures. Here we review the latest developments of virial
expansion for a strongly correlated Fermi gas and their applications on
ultracold trapped Fermi atoms. We show remarkable, quantitative agreements
between virial predictions and various recent experimental measurements at
about the Fermi degenerate temperature. For equation of state, we discuss a
practical way of determining high-order virial coefficients and use it to
calculate accurately the long-sought third-order virial coefficient, which is
now verified firmly in experiments at ENS and MIT. We discuss also virial
expansion of a new many-body paramter - Tan's contact. We then turn to less
widely discussed issues of dynamical properties. For dynamic structure factor,
the virial prediction agrees well with the measurement at the Swinburne
University of Technology. For single-particle spectral function, we show that
the expansion up to the second order accounts for the main feature of
momentum-resolved rf-spectroscopy for a resonantly interacting Fermi gas, as

virial expansion are possible, owing to the ever-growing power in computation.

the Kelvin point and a line image extending from the Kelvin point to infinity

approximation. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basics of the
effect. The main challenge now is to account for the strong interactions
between the constituents of the fluid. The main result is that the ChME is not
renormalized: in the hydrodynamic approximation it remains the same as for
non-interacting chiral fermions moving in an external magnetic field. The key
ingredients in the proof are general laws of thermodynamics and the
Adler-Bardeen theorem for the chiral anomaly in external electromagnetic
fields. The chiral magnetic effect in hydrodynamics represents a macroscopic
manifestation of a quantum phenomenon (chiral anomaly). Moreover, one can argue
that the current induced by the magnetic field is dissipation free and talk
about a kind of ""chiral superconductivity"". More precise description is a
ballistic transport along magnetic field taking place in equilibrium and in
absence of a driving force. The basic limitation is exact chiral limit while
the temperature--excitingly enough- does not seemingly matter. What is still
lacking, is a detailed quantum microscopic picture for the ChME in
hydrodynamics. Probably, the chiral currents propagate through
lower-dimensional defects, like vortices in superfluid. In case of superfluid,
the prediction for the chiral magnetic effect remains unmodified although the
emerging dynamical picture differs from the standard one.

quasiparticle form for both, t_{2g} and e_g states. In the temperature range
T=1200-1500 K, where \gamma-iron exist in nature, this substance can be
nevertheless characterized by temperature-dependent effective local moments,
which yield relatively narrow peaks in the real part of the local magnetic
susceptibility. At the same time, at low temperatures \gamma-iron (which is
realized in precipitates) is better described in terms of itinerant picture. In
particular, the nesting features of the Fermi surfaces yield maximum of the
static magnetic susceptibility at the incommensurate wave vector q_{max}
belonging the direction q_X-q_W (q_X=(2\pi/a)(1,0,0),q_W=(2\pi/a)(1,1/2,0), a

vectors along the directions q_X-q_L-q_K, where q_L=(2\pi/a)(1/2,1/2,1/2),

susceptibility we find that contrary to \alpha-iron, the Curie-Weiss law is not
fulfilled in a broad temperature range, although the inverse susceptibility is
nearly linear in the moderate-temperature region (1200-1500 K). The
non-linearity of the inverse uniform magnetic susceptibility in a broader
temperature range is due to the density of states peak located close to the
Fermi level. The effective exchange integrals in the paramagnetic phase are
estimated on the base of momentum dependent susceptibility.

data for a future Euclid-like galaxy survey and Planck. We consider two
different galaxy surveys: a spectroscopic redshift survey and a cosmic shear
survey. We make use of the Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) technique and
assume two sets of theoretical errors. The first error is meant to account for
uncertainties in the modelling of the effect of neutrinos on the non-linear
galaxy power spectrum and we assume this error to be fully correlated in
Fourier space. The second error is meant to parametrize the overall residual
uncertainties in modelling the non-linear galaxy power spectrum at small
scales, and is conservatively assumed to be uncorrelated and to increase with
the ratio of a given scale to the scale of non-linearity. It hence increases
with wavenumber and decreases with redshift. With these two assumptions for the
errors and assuming further conservatively that the uncorrelated error rises
above 2% at k = 0.4 h/Mpc and z = 0.5, we find that a future Euclid-like cosmic
shear/galaxy survey achieves a 1-sigma error on Mnu close to 32 meV/25 meV,
sufficient for detecting the total neutrino mass with good significance. If the
residual uncorrelated errors indeed rises rapidly towards smaller scales in the
non-linear regime as we have assumed here then the data on non-linear scales
does not increase the sensitivity to the total neutrino mass. Assuming instead
a ten times smaller theoretical error with the same scale dependence, the error
on the total neutrino mass decreases moderately from sigma(Mnu) = 18 meV to 14
meV when mildly non-linear scales with 0.1 h/Mpc < k < 0.6 h/Mpc are included

receivers, say, Bob(1), Bob(2), ...., Bob(n). For this task, we suggest two
schemes using (n+1)-partite GHZ state as a quantum channel. The first scheme
involves C-NOT operations on qubit of Bobs with the control as qubit of Alice,
while the second scheme involves measurements in the Hadamard basis by Bobs on
their qubits. We have generalized both schemes for quantum teleportation of
arbitrary m-qubit information state within the quantum network. Further, we
have proposed two experimental schemes for the generation of (n+1)-partite GHZ
state using interaction between highly detuned \Lambda-type three-level atoms
and optical coherent field. We also discuss the possible experimental
imperfections like, atomic-radiative time, cavity damping time and atom-cavity
interaction time.

assumption, in a $3$-dimensional space of constant curvature was settled by
B\""or\""oczky and Florian for the hyperbolic space $\HYP$ in \cite{BF64} and by
proving the famous Kepler conjecture by Hales \cite{H} for the Euclidean space
$\EUC$. The goal of this paper is to extend the problem of finding the densest
geodesic ball (or sphere) packing for the other $3$-dimensional homogeneous
geometries (Thurston geometries) $$ \SXR,~\HXR,~\SLR,~\NIL,~\SOL, $$ where a
transitive symmetry group of the ball packing is assumed, one of the discrete
isometry groups of the considered space.
  Moreover, we describe a candidate of the densest geodesic ball packing. The
greatest density until now is $\approx 0.85327613$ that is not realized by
packing with equal balls of the hyperbolic space $\HYP$. However, it attains
e.g. at horoball packing of $\overline{\bH}^3$ where the ideal centres of
horoballs lie on the absolute figure of $\overline{\bH}^3$ inducing the regular
ideal simplex tiling $(3,3,6)$ by its Coxeter-Schl\""afli symbol. In this work
we present a geodesic ball packing in the $\SXR$ geometry whose density is
$\approx 0.87499429$. The extremal configuration is described in Theorem 2.8,
Our conjecture and further remarks are summarized in Section 3.

motivated by the results emerging from recent Gross-Pitaevskii simulations of
pinned, decelerating quantum condensates. It is shown that the observed glitch
size distributions cannot be reproduced if superfluid vortices unpin
independently via a Poisson process; the central limit theorem yields a narrow
Gaussian for the size distribution, instead of the broad, power-law tail
observed. This conclusion is not altered fundamentally when a range of pinning
potentials is included, which leads to excavation of the potential distribution
of occupied sites, vortex accumulation at strong pinning sites, and hence the
occasional, abnormally large glitch. Knock-on processes are therefore needed to
make the unpinning rate of a vortex conditional on the pinning state of its
near and/or remote neighbours, so that the Gaussian size distributions
resulting generically from the central limit theorem are avoided. At least two
knock-on processes, nearest- neighbour proximity knock-on and remote acoustic
knock-on, are clearly evident in the Gross-Pitaevskii simulation output. It is
shown that scale-invariant (i.e. power-law) vortex avalanches occur when
knock-on is included, provided that two specific relations hold between the
temperature and spin-down torque. This fine tuning is unlikely in an
astronomical setting, leaving the overall problem partly unsolved. A
state-dependent Poisson formalism is presented which will form the basis of
future studies in this area.

that the NIR/optical flux originates from an amalgam of different emission

low-mass X-ray binary and black hole candidate, XTE J1650-500, via photometric,

spectra, obtained with the ESO-New Technology Telescope, during the peak of the

due to a combination of emission mechanisms including a significant

relativistic jet that is NIR/radio dim compared to similar sources.The jet of
XTE J1650-500 is relatively weak compared to that of other black hole low-mass

the mid-fifteenth century A.D. suffered a decline. For the purpose of examining
this belief, a manuscript by Qasim ali al-Qayini (ca. A.D.1685) was chosen
based on previous works which considered it a valuable source on the history of
optics that had not been studied before. After studying his major optical
manuscript, titled Manazir wa Maraya, it was found very interesting that the
majority of al-Qayini's propositions relating to natural phenomena were not
merely geometrical definitions, but that the proofs related to astronomy. As an
example, in one case, which had not been explained in previous astronomical and
optical manuscripts, al-Qayini tried, despite lacking a vigorous proof, to show
how a special point in a room could be lit up by sunlight throughout the year.
His particular interest in astronomy led us to a general study of his other
works, and it is worth noting that out of the nineteen works that have been
attributed to him, eleven are devoted to astronomy and have not been thoroughly
studied. Much more research is required on his astronomical manuscripts in
order to obtain a better understanding of this author, the century in which he
lived and the general state of science in the late Islamic period. After all,
given the many as-yet unstudied manuscripts that still exist, maybe this
decline was not as rapid as has previously been assumed.

by the YORP effect can be detected by analysis of asteroid photometric
lightcurves. We analyzed photometric lightcurves of near-Earth asteroids (1865)
Cerberus, (2100) Ra-Shalom, and (3103) Eger with the aim to detect possible
deviations from the constant rotation caused by the YORP effect. We carried out
new photometric observations of the three asteroids, combined the new
lightcurves with archived data, and used the lightcurve inversion method to
model the asteroid shape, pole direction, and rotation rate. The YORP effect
was modeled as a linear change in the rotation rate in time d\omega /dt. Values
of d\omega/ dt derived from observations were compared with the values
predicted by theory. We derived physical models for all three asteroids. We had
to model Eger as a nonconvex body because the convex model failed to fit the
lightcurves observed at high phase angles. We probably detected the
acceleration of the rotation rate of Eger d\omega / dt = (1.4 +/- 0.6) x
10^{-8} rad/d (3\sigma error), which corresponds to a decrease in the rotation
period by 4.2 ms/yr. The photometry of Cerberus and Ra-Shalom was consistent

the surface of topological insulators like \Bi. They form scattering centers
for the helical surface states which have a Dirac cone dispersion as long as
the local spins are disordered. However, the local density of states (LDOS) may
be severely modified by the formation of bound states. Commonly only elastic
scattering due to normal and exchange potentials of the adatom is assumed.
Magnetization measurements show, however, that considerable magnetic single ion
anisotropies exist which lead to a splitting of the local impurity spin states
resulting in a singlet ground state. Therefore inelastic scattering processes
of helical Dirac electrons become possible as described by a dynamical local
self energy of second order in the exchange interaction. The self energy
influences bound state formation and leads to significant new anomalies in the
LDOS at low energies and low temperatures which we calculate within T-matrix
approach. We propose that they may be used for spectroscopy of local impurity
spin states by appropriate tuning of chemical potential and magnetic field.

solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the Chapman-Enskog method is
considered further. As in the elastic case, the associated transport
coefficients $D$, $D_p$ and $D'$ are given in terms of the solutions of a set
of coupled linear integral equations which are approximately solved by
considering the first and second Sonine approximations. The diffusion
coefficients are explicitly obtained as functions of the coefficients of
restitution and the parameters of the mixture (masses, diameters and
concentration) and their expressions hold for an arbitrary number of
dimensions. In order to check the accuracy of the second Sonine correction for
highly inelastic collisions, the Boltzmann equation is also numerically solved
by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to determine the
mutual diffusion coefficient $D$ in some special situations (self-diffusion
problem and tracer limit). The comparison with DSMC results reveals that the
second Sonine approximation to $D$ improves the predictions made from the first
Sonine approximation. We also study the granular segregation driven by a
uni-directional thermal gradient. The segregation criterion is obtained from
the so-called thermal diffusion factor $\Lambda$, which measures the amount of
segregation parallel to the temperature gradient. The factor $\Lambda$ is
determined here by considering the second-order Sonine forms of the diffusion
coefficients and its dependence on the coefficients of restitution is widely
analyzed across the parameter space of the system. The results obtained in this

equal to 1-e and all the other indices 1. Via conformal transformation of the
dual space image of this momentum space representation we relate such a family
of the triangle ladder momentum diagrams to a family of the box ladder momentum
diagrams in which the indices of the rungs are equal to 1-e and all the other
indices are 1. Since any diagram from this family can be reduced to one-loop
diagram, the proposed generalization of the Belokurov-Usyukina loop reduction
technique to non-integer number of dimensions allows us to calculate this
family of box-ladder diagrams in the momentum space explicitly in terms of
Appell's hypergeometric function F_4 without expanding in powers of parameter e
in an arbitrary kinematic region in the momentum space.

lines, and the lack of clear LiI absorption, the targets are not T Tauri stars.

the stars may lie inside the molecular cloud (120-150pc). From the fact that

propagate through the system and transfer energy. Nevertheless most of the
vibrations in this range are not localized. We show that they are similar to
diffusons introduced by Allen, Feldman et al., Phil. Mag. B 79, 1715 (1999) to
describe heat transport in glasses. The crossover frequency w_IR is close to
the position of the boson peak. Changing strength of disorder we can vary w_IR
from zero value (when rigidity is zero and there are no phonons in the lattice)
up to a typical frequency in the system. Above w_IR the energy in the lattice
is transferred by means of diffusion of vibrational excitations. We calculated
the diffusivity of the modes D(w) using both the direct numerical solution of
Newton equations and the formula of Edwards and Thouless. It is nearly a
constant above w_IR and goes to zero at the localization threshold. We show
that apart from the diffusion of energy, the diffusion of particle
displacements in the lattice takes place as well. Above w_IR a displacement
structure factor S(q,w) coincides well with a structure factor of random walk
on the lattice. As a result the vibrational line width Gamma(q)=D_u q^2 where
D_u is a diffusion coefficient of particle displacements. Our findings may have

stopping of Richardson-Lucy iterations. In the case of point-wise objects such
as binaries or open star clusters, iterations can be pushed to convergence.
However, it is well-known that Richardson-Lucy is an inefficient method. In
most cases, acceptable solutions are obtained at the cost of hundreds or
thousands of iterations. A general optimization method, referred to as the
scaled gradient projection method, has been proposed for the constrained
minimization of continuously differentiable convex functions. It is applicable
to the non-negative minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. If the
scaling suggested by Richardson-Lucy is used in this method, then it provides a
considerable increase in the efficiency of Richardson-Lucy. Therefore the aim
of this paper is to apply the scaled gradient projection method to a number of
imaging problems in astronomy such as single image deconvolution, multiple
image deconvolution, and boundary effect correction. The corresponding
algorithms are derived and implemented in interactive data language. To attempt
to achieve a further increase in efficiency, we also consider an implementation
on graphic processing units. The proposed algorithms are tested on simulated
images. The acceleration of scaled gradient projection methods achieved with
respect to the corresponding Richardson-Lucy methods strongly depends on both
the problem and the specific object to be reconstructed, and in our simulations
the improvement achieved ranges from about a factor of 4 to more than 30.
Moreover, significant accelerations of up to two orders of magnitude have been
observed between the serial and parallel implementations of the algorithms.

degrees of freedom (DoF) of interference channels (ICs) through Renyi
information dimension. Specifically, we find a single-letter formula for the
DoF of vector ICs, encompassing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ICs,
time- and/or frequency-selective ICs, and combinations thereof, as well as
scalar ICs as considered in [3]. The DoF-formula we obtain lower-bounds the DoF
of all channels--with respect to the choice of the channel matrix--and
upper-bounds the DoF of almost all channels. It applies to a large class of
noise distributions, and its proof is based on an extension of a result by
Guionnet and Shlyakthenko [3] to the vector case in combination with the Ruzsa
triangle inequality for differential entropy introduced by Kontoyiannis and
Madiman [4]. As in scalar ICs, achieving full DoF requires the use of singular
input distributions. Strikingly, in the vector case it suffices to enforce
singularity on the joint distribution of each individual transmit vector. This
can be realized through signaling in subspaces of the ambient signal space,
which is in accordance with the idea of interference alignment, and, most
importantly, allows the scalar entries of the transmit vectors to have
non-singular distributions. The DoF-formula for vector ICs we obtain enables a
unified treatment of ""classical"" interference alignment a la Cadambe and Jafar
[5], and Maddah-Ali et al. [6], and the number-theoretic schemes proposed in
[7], [8]. Moreover, it allows to calculate the DoF achieved by new signaling
schemes for vector ICs. We furthermore recover the result by Cadambe and Jafar
on the non-separability of parallel ICs [9] and we show that almost all
parallel ICs are separable in terms of DoF. Finally, our results apply to
complex vector ICs, thereby extending the main findings of [2] to the complex
case.

($MinHom_R$) is a set of variables $V$ subject to specified constraints
together with a positive weight $c_{vr}$ for each combination of $v \in V$ and
$r \in R$. The aim is to find a function $f:V \rightarrow D$ such that $f$
satisfies all constraints and $\sum_{v \in V} \sum_{r \in R} c_{vr}r(f(v))$ is
minimized.
  This problem unifies well-known optimization problems such as the minimum
cost homomorphism problem and the maximum solution problem, and this makes it a
computationally interesting fragment of the valued CSP framework for
optimization problems. We parameterize $MinHom_R\left(\Gamma\right)$ by {\em
constraint languages}, i.e. sets $\Gamma$ of relations that are allowed in
constraints. A constraint language is called {\em conservative} if every unary
relation is a member of it; such constraint languages play an important role in
understanding the structure of constraint problems. The dichotomy conjecture
for $MinHom_R$ is the following statement: if $\Gamma$ is a constraint
language, then $MinHom_R\left(\Gamma\right)$ is either polynomial-time solvable
or NP-complete. For $MinHom$ the dichotomy result has been recently obtained
[Takhanov, STACS, 2010] and the goal of this paper is to expand this result to
the case of $MinHom_R$ with conservative constraint language. For arbitrary $R$
this problem is still open, but assuming certain restrictions on $R$ we prove a
dichotomy. As a consequence of this result we obtain a dichotomy for the
conservative maximum solution problem.

films in the plane of the substrate. Samples with different tilt of
crystallographic basal planes of manganite as well as bicrystal junctions with
rotation of the crystallographic axes (RB - junction) and with tilting of basal
planes (TB - junction) were investigated. It was found that on vicinal NGO
substrates the value of magnetic anisotropy could be varied by changing the
substrate inclination angle from 0 to 25 degrees. Measurement of magnetic
anisotropy of manganite bicrystal junction demonstrated the presence of two
ferromagnetically ordered spin subsystems for both types of bicrystal

increased with decreasing temperature and with the misorientation angle even
misorientation of easy axes in the parts of junction does not change. Analysis
of the voltage dependencies of bicrystal junction conductivity show that the
low value of the magnetoresistance for the LSMO bicrystal junctions can be
caused by two scattering mechanisms with the spin- flip of spin - polarized
carriers due to the strong electron - electron interactions in a disordered
layer at the bicrystal boundary at low temperatures and the spin-flip by anti

  First the basic ideas of dynamical systems (fixed points, stability, etc.)
are recalled, and an example of universality is discussed in this context: this
is Feigenbaum's universality of the period doubling cascade for iterated maps
on the interval. It is shown how renormalization ideas can be applied to
explain universality and compute Feigenbaum's constants.
  Then, universality is presented in the scenario of quantum field theories,
and studied by means of functional renormalization group equations, which allow
for a close comparison with the case of dynamical systems. In particular,
Wetterich equation for a scalar field is derived and discussed, and then
applied to the computation of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point and critical
exponent for the Ising universality class.
  References to more advanced topics and applications are provided.

a is the infimum of the size of a 4-ball into which the ellipsoid E(1,a)
symplectically embeds (here, a >= 1 is the ratio of the area of the large axis
to that of the smaller axis of the ellipsoid). In this paper we look at
embeddings into four-dimensional cubes instead, and determine the function
c_{EC}(a) whose value at a is the infimum of the size of a 4-cube C^{4}(A) =
D^{2}(A) times D^{2}(A) into which the ellipsoid E(1,a) symplectically embeds
(where D^{2}(A) denotes the disc in mathbb{R}^{2} of area A). As in the case of
embeddings into balls, the structure of the graph of c_{EC}(a) is very rich:
for a less than the square sigma^2 of the silver ratio sigma := 1+sqrt(2), the
function c_{EC}(a) turns out to be piecewise linear, with an infinite staircase
converging to (sigma^2, sqrt(sigma^2/2)). This staircase is determined by Pell
numbers. On the interval [sigma^2,7+1/32], the function c_{EC}(a) coincides
with the volume constraint sqrt(a/2) except on seven disjoint intervals, where
c is piecewise linear. Finally, for a >= 7+1/32, the functions c_{EC}(a) and
sqrt(a/2) are equal.
  For the proof, we first translate the embedding problem E(1,a)-->C^{4}(A) to
a certain ball packing problem of the ball B^{4}(2A). This embedding problem is
then solved by adapting the method from McDuff-Schlenk, which finds all
exceptional spheres in blow-ups of the complex projective plane that provide an
embedding obstruction.
  We also prove that the ellipsoid E(1,a) symplectically embeds into the cube
C^{4}(A) if and only if E(1,a) symplectically embeds into the elllipsoid
E(A,2A). Our embedding function c_{EC}(a) thus also describes the smallest
dilate of E(1,2) into which E(1,a) symplectically embeds.

providing a highly portable solution for applications that can benefit from
concurrency. When multi-threading is combined with tabling, we can exploit the
power of higher procedural control and declarative semantics. However, despite
the availability of both threads and tabling in some Prolog systems, the
implementation of these two features implies complex ties to each other and to
the underlying engine. Until now, XSB was the only Prolog system combining
multi-threading with tabling. In XSB, tables may be either private or shared
between threads. While thread-private tables are easier to implement, shared
tables have all the associated issues of locking, synchronization and potential
deadlocks. In this paper, we propose an alternative view to XSB's approach. In
our proposal, each thread views its tables as private but, at the engine level,
we use a common table space where tables are shared among all threads. We
present three designs for our common table space approach: No-Sharing (NS)
(similar to XSB's private tables), Subgoal-Sharing (SS) and Full-Sharing (FS).
The primary goal of this work was to reduce the memory usage for the table
space but, our experimental results, using the YapTab tabling system with a
local evaluation strategy, show that we can also achieve significant reductions
on running time.

toroids. The masses of gas and dust of the millimetre sources are estimated to
be around 100 and 50 Msun. MM1, the dominant source at all wavelengths, with a
total luminosity of (1-2)x10^5 Lsun at 9 kpc, is however not associated with 6
cm emission down to a rms noise level of 0.1 mJy. We propose that IRAS
19520+2759 could be an example of the recent theoretical prediction of
`bloated' or `swollen' star, i.e., a massive young stellar object whose radius
has increased due to effects of accretion at a high-mass accretion rate.

exhibiting intensive activity on parsec (pc) scales, such as intense core

previous works the existence of precession motions in the pc-scale jet of BL
Lacertae has been suggested. In this work we revisit this issue, investigating
temporal changes of the observed right ascension and declination offsets of the
jet knots in terms of our relativistic jet-precession model. The seven free
parameters of our precession model were optimized via a heuristic cross-entropy
method, comparing the projected precession helix with the positions of the jet
components on the plane of the sky and imposing constraints on their maximum
and minimum superluminal velocities. Our optimized best model is compatible
with a jet having a bulk velocity of 0.9824c, which is precessing with a period
of about 12.1 yr in the observer's reference frame and changing its orientation
in relation to the line of sight between 4 and 5 degrees, approximately.
Assuming that the jet precession has its origin in a supermassive binary black
hole system, we show that the 2.3-yr periodic variation in the structural
position angle of the very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) core of BL
Lacertae reported by Stirling et al. is compatible with a nutation phenomenon
if the secondary black hole has a mass higher than about six times that of the
primary black hole.

suspended graphene flakes that is based on transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) techniques. For this method, the dynamical theory of electron diffraction
(Bloch-wave approach in two-beam case approximation) was used to obtain an
analytical expression for the intensity of the transmitted electron beam I0(t),
as function of the specimen thickness t for thin samples (t<< {\lambda}; where
{\lambda} is the absorption constant for graphite). We show that in thin
graphite crystals the transmitted intensity is a linear function of the
thickness. To obtain a more quantitative description of I0(t), high resolution
(HR) TEM simulations are performed using the Bloch wave approach of the JEMS
software. From such calculations, we obtain {\lambda} for a 001 zone axis
orientation, in a two-beam case and in a low symmetry orientation.
Subsequently, HR (used to determine t) and bright-field (to measure I0(0) and
I0(t)) images were acquired to experimentally determine {\lambda}. We obtain
that the experimental value in the low symmetry orientation is close to the
calculated value (i.e. {\lambda}=225 nm for 300 kV accelerating voltage and 3
mrad collection angle). The simulations also show that the linear approximation
obtained from the analytical expression is valid up to a sample thickness of
several ten nanometers, depending on the orientation. When compared to standard
techniques for thickness determination of graphene/graphite, the method we
propose has the advantage of being relatively simple and fast, requiring only
the acquisition of bright-field images.

formation and early evolution of binaries is a longstanding problem in star
formation that is not fully understood. In particular, how the magnetic field
observed in star-forming cores shapes the binary characteristics remains
relatively unexplored. We demonstrate numerically, using the ENZO-MHD code,
that a magnetic field of the observed strength can drastically change two of
the basic quantities of a binary system: the orbital separation and mass ratio
of the two components. Our calculations focus on the protostellar mass
accretion phase, after a pair of stellar 'seeds' have already formed. We find
that, in dense cores magnetized to a realistic level, the angular momentum of
the gas accreted by the protobinary is greatly reduced by magnetic braking.
Accretion of strongly braked material shrinks the protobinary separation by a
large factor compared to the non-magnetic case. The magnetic braking also
changes the evolution of the mass ratio of unequal-mass protobinaries by
producing gas of low specific angular momentum that accretes preferentially
onto the primary rather than the secondary. This is in contrast with the
preferential mass accretion onto the secondary previously found for
protobinaries accreting from an unmagnetized envelope, which tends to drive the
mass ratio towards unity. In addition, the magnetic field greatly modifies the
morphology and dynamics of the protobinary accretion flow. It suppresses the
circumstellar and circumbinary disks that feed the protobinary in the
non-magnetic case; the binary is fed instead by a fast collapsing pseudodisk
whose rotation is strongly braked. The magnetic braking-driven inward migration
of binaries from their birth locations may be constrained by high-resolution
observations of the orbital distribution of deeply embedded protobinaries,
especially with ALMA.

are used in a wide context of applications. An important Datalog extension is
Disjunctive Datalog, which significantly increases the expressivity of the
basic language. Disjunctive Datalog is useful in a wide range of applications,
ranging from Databases (e.g., Data Integration) to Artificial Intelligence
(e.g., diagnosis and planning under incomplete knowledge). However, in recent
years an important shortcoming of Datalog-based languages became evident, e.g.
in the context of data-integration (consistent query-answering, ontology-based
data access) and Semantic Web applications: The language does not permit any
generation of and reasoning with unnamed individuals in an obvious way. In
general, it is weak in supporting many cases of existential quantification. To
overcome this problem, Datalogex has recently been proposed, which extends
traditional Datalog by existential quantification in rule heads. In this work,
we propose a natural extension of Disjunctive Datalog and Datalogex, called
Datalogexor, which allows both disjunctions and existential quantification in
rule heads and is therefore an attractive language for knowledge representation
and reasoning, especially in domains where ontology-based reasoning is needed.
We formally define syntax and semantics of the language Datalogexor, and
provide a notion of instantiation, which we prove to be adequate for
Datalogexor. A main issue of Datalogex and hence also of Datalogexor is that
decidability is no longer guaranteed for typical reasoning tasks. In order to
address this issue, we identify many decidable fragments of the language, which
extend, in a natural way, analog classes defined in the non-disjunctive case.
Moreover, we carry out an in-depth complexity analysis, deriving interesting
results which range from Logarithmic Space to Exponential Time.

visual appeal of grayscale images, but also enriches the information contained
in scientific images that lack color information. Most existing methods of
colorization require laborious user interaction for scribbles or image
segmentation. To eliminate the need for human labor, we develop an automatic
image colorization method using epitome. Built upon a generative graphical
model, epitome is a condensed image appearance and shape model which also
proves to be an effective summary of color information for the colorization
task. We train the epitome from the reference images and perform inference in
the epitome to colorize grayscale images, rendering better colorization results
than previous method in our experiments.
