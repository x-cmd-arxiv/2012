down to 3.6 nm using low energy electron and photoelectron emission microscopy.
The measured polarization decays strongly below a critical thickness of 5-7 nm

not change. We resolve this apparent contradiction using first-principles-based
effective Hamiltonian calculations. In ultra thin films the energetics of near
open circuit electrical boundary conditions, i.e. unscreened depolarizing
field, drive the system through a phase transition from single out-of-plane
polarization to a nanoscale stripe domains, giving rise to an average remnant
polarization close to zero as measured by the electron microscopy whilst
maintaining the relatively large tetragonal distortion imposed by the non-zero
polarization state of each individual domain.

(GC) systems of five intermediate-luminosity (M_V ~-21 to -22) early-type
galaxies. The aim is to accurately quantify the global properties of the GC
systems by measuring them out to large radii. We obtained BVR imaging of four
lenticular galaxies (NGC 5866, NGC 4762, NGC 4754, NGC 3384) and one elliptical
galaxy (NGC 5813) using the KPNO 4m telescope and MOSAIC imager and traced the
GC population to projected galactocentric radii ranging from ~20 kpc to 120
kpc. We combine our imaging with Hubble Space Telescope data to measure the GC
surface density close to the galaxy center. We calculate the total number of
GCs (N_GC) from the integrated radial profile and find N_GC = 340 +/- 80 for
NGC 5866, N_GC = 2900 +/- 400 for NGC 5813, N_GC = 270 +/- 30 for NGC 4762,
N_GC = 115 +/- 15$ for NGC 4754, and N_GC = 120 +/- 30 for NGC 3384. The
measured GC specific frequencies are S_N between 0.6 and 3.6 and T in the range
0.9 to 4.2. These values are consistent with the mean specific frequencies for
the galaxies' morphological types found by our survey and other published data.
Three galaxies (NGC 5866, NGC 5813, NGC 4762) had sufficient numbers of GC
candidates to investigate color bimodality and color gradients in the GC
systems. NGC 5813 shows strong evidence (>3 sigma) for bimodality and a B-R
color gradient resulting from a more centrally concentrated red (metal-rich) GC
subpopulation. We find no evidence for statistically significant color
gradients in the other two galaxies.

adjusted pricing equation, which allows to price a deal while taking into
account credit and debit valuation adjustments (CVA, DVA) along with margining
and funding costs, all in a consistent way. Funding risk breaks the bilateral
nature of the valuation formula. We find that the equation has a recursive
form, making the introduction of a purely additive funding valuation adjustment
(FVA) difficult. Yet, we can cast the pricing equation into a set of iterative
relationships which can be solved by means of standard least-square Monte Carlo
techniques. As a consequence, we find that identifying funding costs and debit
valuation adjustments is not tenable in general, contrary to what has been
suggested in the literature in simple cases. The assumptions under which
funding costs vanish are a very special case of the more general theory. We
define a comprehensive framework that allows us to derive earlier results on
funding or counterparty risk as a special case, although our framework is more
than the sum of such special cases. We derive the general pricing equation by
resorting to a risk-neutral approach where the new types of risks are included
by modifying the payout cash flows. We consider realistic settings and include
in our models the common market practices suggested by ISDA documentation,
without assuming restrictive constraints on margining procedures and close-out
netting rules. In particular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding
rates, and exogenous liquidity policies and hedging strategies.
Re-hypothecation liquidity risk and close-out amount evaluation issues are also
covered. Finally, relevant examples of non-trivial settings illustrate how to
derive known facts about discounting curves from a robust general framework and
without resorting to ad hoc hypotheses.

polymer and a fluid. The problems that we study are motivated by predictions of
the life cycle of body-implantable medical devices. Scaling arguments suggest
neglecting inertia terms, and therefore, we consider the quasi-static
approximation to the dynamics. We focus on the linearized system about relevant
equilibrium solutions, and derive sufficient conditions for the solvability of
the time dependent problems. These turn out to be conditions that guarantee
local stability of the equilibrium solutions. The fact that some equilibrium
solutions of interest are not stress free brings additional challenges to the
analysis, and, in particular, to the derivation of the energy law of the
systems. It also singles out the special role of the rotations in the analysis.
From the point of view of applications, we point out that the conditions that
guarantee stability of solutions also provide criteria to select material
parameters for devices. The boundary conditions that we consider are of two
types, first displacement-traction conditions for the governing equation of the
polymer component, and secondly permeability conditions for the fluid equation.
We present a rigorous study of these conditions in terms of balance laws of the
fluid across the interface between the gel and its environment. We also
consider the cases of viscous and inviscid solvent, assume Newtonian
dissipation for the polymer component. We establish existence of weak solutions
for the different boundary permeability conditions and viscosity assumptions.

Some jets seem to be rotating in a direction opposite to that of the underlying
disk, although it is not yet clear if this affects the totality or part of the
outflows. On the other hand, Ulysses data also suggest that the solar wind may
rotate in two opposite ways between the northern and southern hemispheres. We
show that this result is not as surprising as it may seem and that it emerges
naturally from the ideal MHD equations. Specifically, counterrotating jets
neither contradict the magnetocentrifugal driving of the flow nor prevent
extraction of angular momentum from the disk. The demonstration of this result
is shown by combining the ideal MHD equations for steady axisymmetric flows.
Provided that the jet is decelerated below some given threshold beyond the
Alfven surface, the flow will change its direction of rotation locally or
globally. Counterrotation is also possible for only some layers of the outflow
at specific altitudes along the jet axis. We conclude that the counterrotation
of winds or jets with respect to the source, star or disk, is not in
contradiction with the magnetocentrifugal driving paradigm. This phenomenon may
affect part of the outflow, either in one hemisphere, or only in some of the
outflow layers. From a time-dependent simulation, we illustrate this effect and
show that it may not be permanent.

maximum rate achieved by Tx-$i$ using any linear precoder, when the
interference channel-coefficients are zero, as the signal to noise ratio (SNR)
tends to infinity to be the Constellation Constrained Saturation Capacity
(CCSC) for Tx-$i$. We derive a high SNR approximation for the rate achieved by
Tx-$i$ when interference is treated as noise and this rate is given by the
mutual information between Tx-$i$ and Rx-$i$, denoted as $I[X_i;Y_i]$. A set of

the interaction of vortices with the magnetic moments described by the
relaxation dynamics (polaronic effect). At low amplitudes of the driving force
$F_{{\rm ac}}$ the dissipation in the system is suppressed due to the
enhancement of the effective viscosity at low frequencies and due to formation
of the magnetic pinning at high frequencies $\omega$. In the adiabatic limit
with low frequencies $\omega$ and high amplitude of the driving force $F_{ac}$,
the vortex and magnetic polarization form a vortex polaron when $F_L(t)$ is
small. When $F_L$ increases, the vortex polaron accelerates and at a threshold
driving force, the vortex polaron dissociates and the motion of vortex and the
relaxation of magnetization are decoupled. When $F_L$ decreases, the vortex is
retrapped by the background of remnant magnetization and they again form vortex
polaron. This process repeats when $F_L(t)$ increases in the opposite
direction. Remarkably, after dissociation, decoupled vortices move in the
periodic potential induced by magnetization which remains for some periods of
time due to retardation after the decoupling. At this stage vortices oscillate
with high frequencies determined by the Lorentz force at the moment of
dissociation. We derive also the creep rate of vortices and show that magnetic
moments suppress creep rate.

counterpart of the well-studied exclusion process and has strong connections to
models of heat conduction and applications in population genetics. Like the
zero-range process, due to attractive interaction between the particles, the
inclusion process can exhibit a condensation transition. In this paper we
present first rigorous results on the dynamics of the condensate formation for
this class of models. We study the symmetric inclusion process on a finite set
$S$ with total number of particles $N$ in the regime of strong interaction,
i.e. with independent diffusion rate $m=m_N \to 0$. For the case $N
m_N\to\infty$ we show that on the time scale $1/m_N$ condensates emerge from
general homogeneous initial conditions, and we precisely characterize their
limiting dynamics. In the simplest case of two sites or a fully connected
underlying random walk kernel, there is a single condensate hopping over $S$ as
a continuous-time random walk. In the non fully connected case several
condensates can coexist and exchange mass via intermediate sites in an
interesting coarsening process, which consists of a mixture of a diffusive
motion and a jump process, until a single condensate is formed. Our result is
based on a general two-scale form of the generator, with a fast-scale neutral
Wright-Fisher diffusion and a slow-scale deterministic motion. The motion of
the condensates is described in terms of the generator of the deterministic
motion and the harmonic projection corresponding to the absorbing states of the
Wright-Fisher diffusion.

different network entities (i.e., user terminals and BS) have a significant
influence on the energy efficiency of proposed inter-network cooperation
scheme. Specifically, when the cooperating users are close to BS or the users
are far away from each other, the inter-network cooperation may consume more
energy than conventional schemes without user cooperation or with intra-network

inter-user distance is not too large, the inter-network cooperation
significantly reduces the energy consumption over conventional schemes.

studying planetary evolution for a wide range of initial conditions. We perform
thermal evolution simulations for generic terrestrial planets with masses
ranging from that of Mars to 10 Earth-masses in the stagnant-lid regime, the
most natural mode of convection with strongly temperature- dependent viscosity.
Given considerable uncertainty surrounding the dependency of mantle rheology on
pressure, we choose to focus on the end-member case of pressure-independent
potential viscosity, where viscosity does not change with depth along an
adiabatic temperature gradient. We employ principal component analysis and
linear regression to capture the first-order systematics of possible
evolutionary scenarios from a large number of simulation runs. With increased
planetary mass, crustal thickness and the degree of mantle processing are both
predicted to decrease, and such size effects can also be derived with simple
scaling analyses. The likelihood of plate tectonics is quantified using a
mantle rheology that takes into account both ductile and brittle deformation
mechanisms. Confirming earlier scaling analyses, the effects of lithosphere
hydration dominate the effects of planetary mass. The possibility of
basalt-eclogite phase transition in the planetary crust is found to increase
with planetary mass, and we suggest that massive terrestrial planets may escape
the stagnant-lid regime through the formation of a self-destabilizing dense
eclogite layer.

capture the behavior of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms in an adequate
and precise way. At the center of our framework is a parameterized system model
where control flow automata are used for process specification. To account for
the specific features and properties of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms
for message-passing systems, our control flow automata are extended to model
threshold guards as well as the inherent non-determinism stemming from
asynchronous communication, interleavings of steps, and faulty processes.
  We demonstrate the adequacy of our framework in a representative case study
where we formalize a family of well-known fault-tolerant broadcasting
algorithms under a variety of failure assumptions. Our case study is supported
by model checking experiments with safety and liveness specifications for a
fixed number of processes. In the experiments, we systematically varied the
assumptions on both the resilience condition and the failure model. In all
cases, our experiments coincided with the theoretical results predicted in the
distributed algorithms literature. This is giving clear evidence for the
adequacy of our model.

necessary for parametric verification of the distributed algorithms captured in

reduce the parameterized problem to finite-state model checking. We demonstrate
the practical feasibility of our method by verifying several variants of the

Euler-Lagrange neutral differential delay equations with state-dependent

extrema satisfy the Weierstrass-Erdmann conditions that energies and momenta

derived quantities that can be extended only to a bounded region B of
space-time. For extrema with a finite number of velocity discontinuities,
extended fields are defined for all point in B with the exception of sets of
zero measure. The extended fields satisfy the integral laws of classical
electrodynamics for most surfaces and curves inside B. As an application, we
study globally bounded trajectories with vanishing far-fields for the
hydrogenoid atomic models of hydrogen, muonium and positronium. Our model uses
solutions of the neutral differential delay equations along regular segments

model predicts a discrete set of finitely measured neighbourhoods of orbits

and qualitative agreement with experiment and quantum mechanics, i.e., the
spacings between consecutive discrete angular momenta agree with Planck's

Bayesian Paid-Incurred-Claims models, combining the claims reserving models of
Hertig et al. (1985) and Gogol et al. (1993). In the process we extend the
independent log-normal model of Merz et al. (2010) by incorporating different
dependence structures using a Data-Augmented mixture Copula Paid-Incurred
claims model.
  The utility and influence of incorporating both payment and incurred losses
into estimating of the full predictive distribution of the outstanding loss
liabilities and the resulting reserves is demonstrated in the following cases:
(i) an independent payment (P) data model; (ii) the independent
Payment-Incurred Claims (PIC) data model of Merz et al. (2010); (iii) a novel
dependent lag-year telescoping block diagonal Gaussian Copula PIC data model
incorporating conjugacy via transformation; (iv) a novel data-augmented mixture
Archimedean copula dependent PIC data model.
  Inference in such models is developed via a class of adaptive Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. These incorporate a data-augmentation
framework utilized to efficiently evaluate the likelihood for the copula based
PIC model in the loss reserving triangles. The adaptation strategy is based on
representing a positive definite covariance matrix by the exponential of a
symmetric matrix as proposed by Leonard et al. (1992).

particle which die. This natural genetic type selection scheme appears in
numerous applications in applied probability, physics, Bayesian statistics,

this paper to introduce them to risk modeling. From a purely mathematical point

relay. By exploiting properties of the error covariance matrix and results from
majorization theory, we derive the optimal structures of the source and relay

the binary SMBH population generated from this distribution, we simulate pulsar

these variations do not correspond to an isotropic, stochastic GW background.
The ""Hellings & Downs"" correlations between simulated datasets for different

estimates is greater than expected for an isotropic, stochastic GW background.
These results are attributable to the fact that just a few GW sources dominate
the GW-induced variations in every Fourier frequency bin of a 5-year dataset.
Current constraints on the amplitude of the GW signal from binary SMBHs will be
biased. Individual binary systems are likely to be detectable in 5-year pulsar
timing array datasets where the noise is dominated by GW-induced variations.
Searches for GWs in pulsar timing array data therefore need to account for the

modified gravity. To account for the observational data regarding the rotation
curves of spiral galaxies, nonlocality is associated with a characteristic
length scale of order \lambda_0 = 10 kpc. It follows that in nonlocal gravity,
the treatment of extremely low-frequency (~ 10^{-12} Hz) gravitational waves
with wavelengths of order \lambda_0 would be quite different than in general
relativity. However, for radiation of frequency > 10^{-8} Hz, which is the

essentially average out and can be safely neglected in practice.

there is no value of the dimensionality that guarantees that the field is free.
Conformal invariance is not used in the proof of these results, but it gives
them a special interest; as already known and as shown here in an appendix, the
only fields in a conformal field theory that can describe massless particles
belong to the $(j,0)$ or $(0,j)$ representations of the Lorentz group and have

Furthermore, nonlinear gain/loss terms enable the existence of both symmetric

realistic and detailed flow motions during droplet collision. The differences
of collision outcome between Newtonian and non-Newtonian were compared. Various
types of droplet collision were presented, including bouncing, coalescence, and
stretching separation. Because of the reducing of equivalent viscosity caused
by shear stress, the gas film between shear-thinning droplet is thinner than
Newtonian liquid. Since thinner gas film promotes coalescence, shear thinning
liquid has smaller area of bouncing regime in the diagram of Weber number and
impact parameter. During the ligament/thread breakup process of stretching
separation, two kinds of instabilities are identified, helical and buckling
instabilities. Helical instability is analogous to a viscous rotating liquid
jet, while the buckling instability is analogous to electrically charged liquid
jets of polymer solutions.

signals is the rule, not the exception. Herein, we propose a novel theoretical
framework, spatio-temporal Granger causality, which allows us to more reliably
and precisely estimate the Granger causality from experimental datasets
possessing time-varying properties caused by physiological oscillations. Within
this framework, Granger causality is redefined as a global index measuring the
directed information flow between two time series with time-varying properties.
Both theoretical analyses and numerical examples demonstrate that Granger
causality is a monotonically increasing function of the temporal resolution
used in the estimation. This is consistent with the general principle of coarse
graining, which causes information loss by smoothing out very fine-scale
details in time and space. Our results confirm that the Granger causality at
the finer spatio-temporal scales considerably outperforms the traditional
approach in terms of an improved consistency between two resting-state scans of
the same subject. To optimally estimate the Granger causality, the proposed
theoretical framework is implemented through a combination of several
approaches, such as dividing the optimal time window and estimating the
parameters at the fine temporal and spatial scales. Taken together, our
approach provides a novel and robust framework for estimating the Granger
causality from fMRI, EEG, and other related data.

the cone of positive definite matrices when applied to every off-diagonal
element. Our results extend theorems of Schoenberg [Duke Math. J. 9], Rudin
[Duke Math. J. 26], Christensen and Ressel [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 243], and
others, where similar problems were studied when the function is applied to all
elements, including the diagonal ones. It is shown that functions that are
guaranteed to preserve positive definiteness cannot at the same time induce
sparsity, i.e., set elements to zero. These results have important implications
for the regularization of positive definite matrices, where functions are often
applied to only the off-diagonal elements to obtain sparse matrices with better
properties (e.g., Markov random field/graphical model structure, better
condition number). As a particular case, it is shown that
\emph{soft-thresholding}, a commonly used operation in modern high-dimensional
probability and statistics, is not guaranteed to maintain positive
definiteness, even if the original matrix is sparse. This result has a deep
connection to graphs, and in particular, to the class of trees. We then proceed
to fully characterize functions which do preserve positive definiteness. This
characterization is in terms of absolutely monotonic functions and turns out to
be quite different from the case when the function is also applied to diagonal
elements. We conclude by giving bounds on the condition number of a matrix
which guarantee that the regularized matrix is positive definite.

by slip-springs inspired by the single chain slip-spring model [A. E. Likhtman,
Macromolecules 38, 6128 (2005)]. In this model the entanglement effect is
replaced by the slip-springs, not by the hard-core interaction between beads so
that this model is located in the niche between conventional multi-chain
simulations and single chain models. The set of state variables are the
position of beads and the connectivity (indices) of the slip-springs between
beads. The dynamics of the system is described by the time evolution equation
and stochastic transition dynamics for these variables. We propose a simple
model which is based on the well-defined total free-energy and the detailed
balance condition. The free energy in our model contains a repulsive
interaction between beads, which compensate the attractive interaction
artificially generated by the slip-springs. The explicit expression of linear
relaxation modulus is also derived by the linear response theory. We also

benefits such that QC LDPC codes lifted from them can potentially have larger

inevitable cycles, are fully investigated based on graph-theoretic approach. By
using combinatorial designs, a systematic construction method of multiple-edge

the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and multi-wavelength observations
from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). From the evolutionary study of HMI intensity and AIA channels, it is
observed that the AR consists of two major rotating sunspots one connected to
flare-prone region and another with CME. The constructed space-time intensity
maps reveal that the sunspots exhibited peak rotation rates coinciding with the
occurrence of the major eruptive events. Further, temporal profiles of twist
parameters, viz., average shear angle, $\alpha_{\rm av}$, $\alpha_{\rm best}$,
derived from HMI vector magnetograms and the rate of helicity injection,
obtained from the horizontal flux motions of HMI line-of-sight magnetograms,
corresponded well with the rotational profile of the sunspot in CME-prone
region, giving predominant evidence of rotational motion to cause magnetic
non-potentiality. Moreover, mean value of free-energy from the Virial theorem
calculated at the photospheric level shows clear step down decrease at the on
set time of the flares revealing unambiguous evidence of energy release,
intermittently that is stored by flux emergence and/or motions in pre-flare
phases. Additionally, distribution of helicity injection is homogeneous in CME
prone region while it is not and often changes sign in flare-prone region. This
study provides clear picture that both proper and rotational motions of the
observed fluxes played significant role to enhance the magnetic
non-potentiality of the AR, leading to favorable conditions for the observed
transient activity.

objects in the Universe. They exhibit extremely high star formation rates, and
most of them seem to harbour an AGN. They are unique laboratories to
investigate the most extreme star formation, and its connection to
super-massive black hole growth. The AGN and SB relative contributions to the
total output in these objects is still debated. Our aim is to disentangle the
AGN and SB emission of a sample of thirteen HLIRG. We have studied the MIR low
resolution spectra of a sample of thirteen HLIRG obtained with the IRS on board
Spitzer. The 5-8 {\mu}m range is an optimal window to detect AGN activity even
in a heavily obscured environment. We performed a SB/AGN decomposition of the
continuum using templates, successfully applied for ULIRG in previous works.
The MIR spectra of all sources is largely dominated by AGN emission. Converting
the 6 {\mu}m luminosity into IR luminosity, we found that ~80% of the sample
shows an IR output dominated by the AGN emission. However, the SB activity is
significant in all sources (mean SB contribution ~30%), showing star formation
rates ~300-3000 solar masses per year. Using X-ray and MIR data we estimated
the dust covering factor (CF) of these HLIRG, finding that a significant
fraction presents a CF consistent with unity. Along with the high X-ray
absorption shown by these sources, this suggests that large amounts of dust and
gas enshroud the nucleus of these HLIRG, as also observed in ULIRG. Our results
are in agreement with previous studies of the IR SED of HLIRG using radiative
transfer models, and we find strong evidence that all HLIRG harbour an AGN.
This work provides further support to the idea that AGN and SB are both crucial
to understand the properties of HLIRG. Our study of the CF supports the
hypothesis that HLIRG can be divided in two different populations.

the possibility to search for spin correlations far above the magnetic ordering
temperature and for anomalies in the magnon lifetime in the magnetically
ordered state by probing exciton-magnon sidebands of the spin-forbidden
crystal-field transitions of the Cr3+ ions (spin S = 3/2). In CuCrO2 and
alpha-CaCr2O4 the appearance of fine structures below T_N is assigned to magnon
sidebands by comparison with neutron scattering results. The temperature
dependence of the line width of the most intense sidebands in both compounds
can be described by an Arrhenius law. For CuCrO2 the sideband associated with
the 4A2 -> 2T2 transition can be observed even above T_N. Its line width does
not show a kink at the magnetic ordering temperature and can alternatively be
described by a Z2 vortex scenario proposed previously for similar materials.
The exciton-magnon features in alpha-CaCr2O4 are more complex due to the
orthorhombic distortion. While for CdCr2O4 magnon sidebands are identified
below T_N and one sideband excitation is found to persist across the magnetic
ordering transition, only a weak fine structure related to magnetic ordering
has been observed in ZnCr2O4.

directly measure the in-plane polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis

pure Tetrogonal-like phase is obtained and its polarization vector is
constrained to lie in the (010) plane with a significantly large in-plane

  Gravitational Theory of the Quantum","Minor revisions, including some shortening, to first submission",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A realistic measurement-free theory for the quantum physics of multiple
qubits is proposed. This theory is based on a symbolic representation of a
fractal state-space geometry which is invariant under the action of
deterministic and locally causal dynamics. This symbolic representation is
constructed from self-similar families of quaternionic operators. Using
number-theoretic properties of the cosine function, the statistical properties
of the symbolic representation of the invariant set are shown to be consistent
with the contextual requirements of the Kochen-Specker theorem, are not
constrained by Bell inequalities, and mirror the statistics of entangled
qubits. These number-theoretic properties in turn reflect the sparseness of the
invariant set in state space, and relate to the metaphysical notion of
counterfactual incompleteness. Using the concept of probability, the complex
Hilbert Space can be considered the completion of this symbolic representation
into the state space continuum. As a result, it is proposed that the complex
Hilbert Space should merely be considered a computational convenience in the
light of the algorithmic intractability of the invariant set geometry, and
consequently the superposed state should not be considered a fundamental aspect
of physical theory. The physical basis for the proposed theory is relativistic
gravity; for example the symbols used to describe the invariant set themselves
label gravitationally distinct cosmological space-times. This implies that the
very notion of a `quantum theory of gravity' may be profoundly misguided -
erroneously putting the quantum cart before the gravitational horse. Here some
elements of an alternative `gravitational theory of the quantum' are proposed,
based on a deterministic and locally causal theory of gravity which extends
general relativity by being geometric in both space-time and state space.

This paper proposes a transversal overview on Henri Poincar\'e's early works
(1878-1885). Our investigations start with a case study of a short note
published by Poincar\'e on 1884 : ""Sur les nombres complexes"". In the
perspective of today's mathematical disciplines - especially linear algebra -,
this note seems completely isolated in Poincar\'e's works. This short paper
actually exemplifies that the categories used today for describing some
collective organizations of knowledge fail to grasp both the collective
dimensions and individual specificity of Poincar\'es work. It also highlights
the crucial and transversal role played in Poincar\'e's works by a specific
algebraic practice of classification of linear groups by reducing the
analytical representation of linear substitution to their Jordan's canonical
forms. We then analyze in detail this algebraic practice as well as the roles
it plays in Poincar\'e's works. We first provide a micro-historical analysis of
Poincar\'e's appropriation of Jordan's approach to linear groups through the
prism of the legacy of Hermite's works on algebraic forms between 1879 and
1881. This mixed legacy illuminates the interrelations between all the papers
published by Poincar\'e between 1878 and 1885 ; especially between some
researches on algebraic forms and the development of the theory of Fuchsian
functions. Moreover, our investigation sheds new light on how the notion of
group came to play a key role in Poincar\'e's approach. The present paper also
offers a historical account of the statement by Jordan of his canonical form
theorem. Further, we analyze how Poincar\'e transformed this theorem by
appealing to Hermite's

a statistically-sound approach based on multiple linear regression, it is shown

mutations capable of malignant transformation have been described. These
mutations usually occur in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), transforming them
into leukemia stem cells. NUP98 gene translocations are an example of such
chromosomal aberrations; these translocations produce a fusion protein
containing the N-terminal portion of Nup98 and the C-terminal of a fusion
partner. Over 75% of Nup98 fusions can interact with chromatin, and lead to
changes in gene expression. Therefore, I hypothesize that nup98 fusions act as
rogue transcriptional regulators in the cell. Collecting previously published
gene expression data (microarray) from HSCs expressing Nup98 fusions, we can
generate data to corroborate this hypothesis. Several different fusions affect
the expression of similar genes; these are involved in a few biological
processes in the cell: embryonic development, immune system formation and
chromatin organization. Deregulated genes also present similar transcription
factor binding sites in their regulatory regions. These putative regulatory
transcription factors are highly interconnected through protein-protein
interactions and transcriptional regulation among themselves, and they have
important roles in cell cycle regulation, embryonic development, hematopoiesis,
apoptosis and chromatin modification.

nonlinear eigenvalue problems for differential operators on unbounded domains.
In this paper we propose to detect and approximate the point spectra of such
operators (and the associated eigenfunctions) via contour integrals of
solutions to resolvent equations. The approach is based on Keldysh' theorem and
extends a recent method for matrices depending analytically on the eigenvalue
parameter. We show that errors are well-controlled under very general
assumptions when the resolvent equations are solved via boundary value problems
on finite domains. Two applications are presented: an analytical study of
Schr\""odinger operators on the real line as well as on bounded intervals and a
numerical study of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system. We also relate the contour
method to the well-known Evans function and show that our approach provides an
alternative to evaluating and computing its zeroes.

  overlap with arXiv:1112.1584",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper deals with physical layer network-coding for the four-way wireless
relaying scenario where four nodes A, B, C and D wish to communicate their
messages to all the other nodes with the help of the relay node R. The scheme
given in the paper is based on the denoise-and-forward scheme proposed first by
Popovski et al. Intending to minimize the number of channel uses, the protocol
employs two phases: Multiple Access (MA) phase and Broadcast (BC) phase with
each phase utilizing one channel use. This paper does the equivalent for the
four-way relaying scenario as was done for the two-way relaying scenario by
Koike-Akino et al., and for three-way relaying scenario in [3]. It is observed
that adaptively changing the network coding map used at the relay according to
the channel conditions greatly reduces the impact of multiple access
interference which occurs at the relay during the MA phase. These network
coding maps are so chosen so that they satisfy a requirement called exclusive
law. We show that when the four users transmit points from the same M-PSK
constellation, every such network coding map that satisfies the exclusive law
can be represented by a 4-fold Latin Hyper-Cube of side M. The network code map
used by the relay for the BC phase is explicitly obtained and is aimed at
reducing the effect of interference at the MA stage.

functions on G (with pointwise product). Define a coproduct $\Delta$ on A by
$\Delta(f)(p,q)=f(pq)$ where $f\in A$ and $p,q\in G$. Then $(A,\Delta)$ is a
Hopf algebra. If $G$ is only a {\it groupoid}, so that the product of two
elements is not always defined, one still can consider $A$ and define
$\Delta(f)(p,q)$ as above when $pq$ is defined. If we let $\Delta(f)(p,q)=0$
otherwise, we still get a coproduct on $A$, but $\Delta(1)$ will no longer be
the identity in $A\ot A$. The pair $(A,\Delta)$ is not a Hopf algebra but a
weak Hopf algebra. If $G$ is a {\it group}, but {\it no longer finite}, one
takes for $A$ the algebra of functions with finite support. Then $A$ has no
identity and $(A,\Delta)$ is not a Hopf algebra but a multiplier Hopf algebra.
Finally, if $G$ is a {\it groupoid}, but {\it not necessarily finite}, the
standard construction above, will give, what we call in this paper, a weak
multiplier Hopf algebra.
  Indeed, this paper is devoted to the development of this 'missing link': {\it
weak multiplier Hopf algebras}. We spend a great part of this paper to the
motivation of our notion and to explain where the various assumptions come
from. The goal is to obtain a good definition of a weak multiplier Hopf
algebra. Throughout the paper, we consider the basic examples and use them, as
far as this is possible, to illustrate what we do. In particular, we think of
the finite-dimensional weak Hopf algebras. On the other hand however, we are
also inspired by the far more complicated existing analytical theory.
  In forthcoming papers on the subject, we develop the theory further.

of telecomband has to be required to realize the interface between the
atomic-based memory and the photon-based carrier. In order for that, two atomic

into account, and besides, one more atomic system as a storing media is need.
So the ability of storing a photon in telecomband is an interesting and
exciting topic. In this work, we give a first experimental proof of principle
of storing a light in telecomband. The telecom light is directly stored and

fraction and stellar metallicity as well as the higher [Ba/Fe] in metal-poor
stars at [Fe/H]<-1.5 can be more self-consistently explained by models with
steeper initial mass functions. The observed higher [Mg/Fe] (> 0.3) at [Fe/H] ~
-0.6 and higher [Ba/Fe] (>0.5) at [Fe/H] ~ -0.3 can be due to significantly
enhanced star formation about 2 Gyr ago. The observed overall [Ca/Fe]-[Fe/H]
relation and remarkably low [Ca/Fe] (<-0.2) at [Fe/H]>-0.6 are consistent with
models with short-delay supernova Ia and with the more efficient loss of Ca
possibly caused by an explosion mechanism of type II supernovae. Although the
metallicity distribution functions do not show double peaks in the models with
a starburst about 2 Gyr ago, they show characteristic double peaks in the
models with double starbursts at ~200 Myr and ~2 Gyr ago. The observed apparent
dip of [Fe/H] around ~1.5 Gyr ago in the age--metallicity relation can be
reproduced by models in which a large amount (~10^9 M_{sun}) of metal-poor

also evaluate the excitation spectrum of the dipolar Bose gas in the context of

evaluate its expected in not yet infested areas. A structured discrete model is
built, taking into account all biological information we were able to find,
including the environmental variability implemented by means of stochastic
parameters (coefficients of fertility, death, etc.). This model is based on a
structure with 7 age classes, i.e. a Leslie mathematical population modeling
type and it is calibrated with laboratory data provided by the Department of
Evolutionary Biology (DEB) of Florence (Italy). The model presents many
interesting aspects: the population has a high initial growth, then it
stabilizes similarly to the logistic growth, but then it exhibits oscillations
(a kind of limit-cycle attractor in the phase plane). The sensitivity analysis
shows a good resilience of the model and, for low values of reproductive female
fraction, the fluctuations may eventually lead to the extinction of the
species: this fact might be exploited as a controlling factor. Moreover, the
probability of extinction is valuated with an inverse Gaussian that indicates a
high resilience of the species, confirmed by experimental data and field
observation: this species has diffused in Italy since 1989 and it has shown a
natural tendency to grow. Finally, the spatial mobility is introduced in the
model, simulating the movement of the crayfishes in a virtual lake of
elliptical form by means of simple cinematic rules encouraging the movement
towards the banks of the catchment (as it happens in reality) while a random

cylindrical lenses to induce a deformation in the particle shape, which will be
then correlated with its distance from the observer. With this method we are

than in the Standard Model (SM). We show how the determination of the EF
loop-contributions to the Higgs couplings with photons and gluons is relying on
the knowledge of the top and bottom Yukawa couplings (affected by EF mixings);
for determining the latter coupling, the relevance of the investigation of the
Higgs production in association with bottom quarks is emphasized. In the
instructive approximation of a single EF, we find that the constraints from the
fit already turn out to be quite predictive, in both cases of an EF mixed or
not with SM fermions, and especially when combined with the extra-quark
(-lepton) mass bounds from direct EF searches at the LHC (LEP) collider. In the
case of an unmixed extra-quark, non-trivial fit constraints are pointed out on
the Yukawa couplings for masses up to ~200 TeV. In particular, we define the
extra-dysfermiophilia, which is predicted at 68.27% C.L. for any single
extra-quark (independently of its electric charge). Another result is that,
among any components of SM multiplet extensions, the extra-quark with a -7/3

of spectral lines by the Doppler effect. Russel & Atkinson (1931) and Oort
(1932) already noted that due to the large proper motion and parallax of the
white dwarf (WD) van Maanen 2, a determination of the perspective acceleration
of the proper motion would provide a direct astrometric determination of the
radial velocity which is independent of the gravitational redshift. If
spectroscopic redshift measurements of Halpha and Hbeta NLTE cores exist, a
purely astrometric determination would allow disentangling the gravitational
redshift from the Doppler shift.
  The best instrument for measuring the tiny perspective acceleration is the
Gaia satellite of the European Space Agency, aiming at absolute astrometric
measurements of one billion stars down to 20th magnitude with unprecedented
accuracy. At 15th magnitude, the predicted angular accuracy of Gaia is about 20
micro-arcseconds. In this article, we estimate whether it is possible to
measure the radial velocity of WDs astrometrically by the exchange of proper
motion into radial velocity during the 5-year mission of the satellite or by
combining Hipparcos data with the position measurements at the beginning of the
Gaia mission (the Hundred-Thousand-Proper-Motion project HTPM).

some particularly well populated GCs and why they are so. I then discuss some
particularly interesting objects, like millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with
eccentric orbits, which were heavily perturbed by passing stars. Some of these
systems, like NGC 1851A and NGC 6544B, are almost certainly the result of
exchange interactions, i.e., they are witnesses to the very same processes that
created the large population of MSPs in the first place. I also review briefly
the problem posed by the presence of young pulsars in GCs (with a special
emphasis on a sub-class of young pulsars, the super-energetic MSPs), which
suggest continuing formation of NSs in low-velocity SNe. In the final section,
I discuss the possibility of an analogous population in the Galaxy and
highlight a particularly interesting case, PSR J1903+0327, where the primary
neutron star appears to have formed with a small-velocity kick and small
fractional mass loss. Systems with primary NSs formed in electron-capture SNe
should constitute a distinct low-velocity Galactic population akin in many
respects to the GC population. Current high-resolution surveys of the Galactic
plane should be able to detect it clearly.

better sensitivity than any currently available all-sky survey. We investigate

down to a very low threshold (> 4 counts net of background). At the faint end,
the survey reaches a flux sensitivity of roughly 3e-12 erg/cm2/s (2-10 keV).
Our starting point was a sample of 487 sources detected in the XMMSL1d2 XSS at
high galactic latitude in the hard band. Through cross-correlation with
published source catalogues from surveys spanning the electromagnetic spectrum
from radio to gamma-rays, we find that 45% of the sources have likely
identifications with normal/active galaxies, 18% are associated with other
classes of X-ray object (nearby coronally active stars, accreting binaries,
clusters of galaxies), leaving 37% of the XSS sources with no current
identification. We go on to define an XSS extragalactic hard band sample
comprised of 219 galaxies and active galaxies. We investigate the properties of
this extragalactic sample including its X-ray logN-logS distribution. We find
that in the low-count limit, the XSS is strongly affected by Eddington bias.
There is also a very strong bias in the XSS against the detection of extended
sources, most notably clusters of galaxies. A significant fraction of the
detections at and around the low-count limit may be spurious. Nevertheless, it
is possible to use the XSS to extract a reasonably robust sample of
extragalactic sources, excluding galaxy clusters. The differential logN-logS
relation of these extragalactic sources matches very well to the HEAO-1 A2
all-sky survey measurements at bright fluxes and to the 2XMM source counts at

cataclysmic variables containing white dwarfs with magnetic fields sufficiently
strong to prevent the formation of an accretion disk. So an accretion stream
flows from the L1 point and impacts directly onto one or more spots on the
surface of the white dwarf. Observations indicate that the white dwarf, in some
binaries, possesses a complex (non-dipolar) magnetic field. We perform
simulations of 10 polars or equivalently one asynchronous polar at 10 different
beat phases. Our models have an aligned dipole plus quadrupole magnetic field
centered on the white dwarf primary. We find that for a sufficiently strong
quadrupole component an accretion spot occurs near the magnetic equator for
slightly less than half of our simulations while a polar accretion zone is
active for most of the rest of the simulations. For one or two configurations;
accretion at the dominant polar region and at an equatorial zone occurs
simultaneously. These are the first 3D MHD calculations to confirm the
existence of complex magnetic fields in magnetic CVs. We conclude, that it
might be difficult observationally determine if the field is a pure dipole or
if it is complex for polars, but there will be indications for some systems.
Specifically, a complex magnetic field should be considered if the there is an
accretion zone near the white dwarf's spin equator (orbital plane) or if there
are two or more accretion regions that cannot be fit by a dipole magnetic
field. For asynchronous polars, magnetic field constraints are expected to be
substantially stronger, with clearer indicators of complex field geometry due
to changes in accretion flow structure as a function of spin-orbit beat phase.

the inclusion of the (cor)relation between surface brightness and local
effective gravity. Until recently, this correlation has always been modeled by
a power law relating the flux or the effective temperature and the effective
gravity, namely T_eff {\alpha} g_eff^{\beta}.
  Aims. We look for a simple model that can describe the variations of the flux
at the surface of stars belonging to a binary system.
  Methods. This model assumes that the energy flux is a divergence-free vector
anti-parallel to the effective gravity. The effective gravity is computed from
the Roche model.
  Results. After explaining in a simple manner the old result of Lucy (1967),
which says that {\beta}=0.08 for solar type stars, we first argue that
one-dimensional models should no longer be used to evaluate gravity darkening
laws. We compute the correlation between log T_eff and log g_eff using a new
approach that is valid for synchronous, weakly magnetized, weakly irradiated
binaries. We show that this correlation is approximately linear, validating the
use of a power law relation between effective temperature and effective gravity
as a first approximation. We further show that the exponent {\beta} of this
power law is a slowly varying function, which we tabulate, of the mass ratio of
the binary star and the Roche lobe filling factor of the stars of the system.
The exponent {\beta} remains mostly in the interval (0.20, 0.25) if extreme
mass ratios are eliminated.
  Conclusions. For binary stars that are synchronous, weakly magnetized and
weakly irradiated, the gravity darkening exponent is well constrained and may
be removed from the free parameters of the models.

null model should characterize some features of the observed network. However,
the null model in the original definition of modularity is unrealistically
mixed, in the sense that any node can be linked to any other node without
preference and only connectivity matters. Thus, it fails to be a good
representation of real-world networks. A common feature of many real-world
networks is ""similarity attraction"", i.e., edges tend to link to nodes that are
similar to each other. We propose a null model that captures the similarity
attraction feature. This null model enables us to create a framework for

first on the formation of a solid core which, when massive enough, can
gravitationally bind gas from the nebula to form the envelope. In order to
trigger the accretion of gas, the core has to grow up to several Earth masses
before the gas component of the protoplanetary disc dissipates. We compute the
formation of planets, considering the oligarchic regime for the growth of the
solid core. Embryos growing in the disc stir their neighbour planetesimals,
exciting their relative velocities, which makes accretion more difficult. We
compute the excitation state of planetesimals, as a result of stirring by
forming planets, and gas-solid interactions. We find that the formation of
giant planets is favoured by the accretion of small planetesimals, as their
random velocities are more easily damped by the gas drag of the nebula.
Moreover, the capture radius of a protoplanet with a (tiny) envelope is also
larger for small planetesimals. However, planets migrate as a result of
disc-planet angular momentum exchange, with important consequences for their
survival: due to the slow growth of a protoplanet in the oligarchic regime,
rapid inward type I migration has important implications on intermediate mass
planets that have not started yet their runaway accretion phase of gas. Most of
these planets are lost in the central star. Surviving planets have either
masses below 10 ME or above several Jupiter masses. To form giant planets
before the dissipation of the disc, small planetesimals (~ 0.1 km) have to be
the major contributors of the solid accretion process. However, the combination
of oligarchic growth and fast inward migration leads to the absence of
intermediate mass planets. Other processes must therefore be at work in order
to explain the population of extrasolar planets presently known.

means of Bayesian statistics. We consider three particle physics models for
spin-independent dark matter interaction with nuclei: elastic, inelastic and
isospin violating scattering. We shortly present the state of the art for the
three models, marginalising over experimental systematics and astrophysical
uncertainties. Whatever the scenario is, XENON100 appears to challenge the
detection region of DAMA, CoGeNT and CRESST. The first aim of this study is to
rigorously quantify the significance of the inconsistency between XENON100 data
and the combined set of detection (DAMA, CoGeNT and CRESST together),
performing two statistical tests based on the Bayesian evidence. We show that
XENON100 and the combined set are inconsistent at least at 2 sigma level in all
scenarios but inelastic scattering, for which the disagreement drops to 1 sigma
level. Secondly we consider only the combined set and hunt the best particle
physics model that accounts for the events, using Bayesian model comparison.
The outcome between elastic and isospin violating scattering is inconclusive,
with the odds 2:1, while inelastic scattering is disfavoured with the odds of
1:32 because of CoGeNT data. Our results are robust under reasonable prior
assumptions. We conclude that the simple elastic scattering remains the best
model to explain the detection regions, since the data do not support extra
free parameters. Present direct searches therefore are not able to constrain
the particle physics interaction of the dark matter. The outcome of consistency
tests implies that either a better understanding of astrophysical and
experimental uncertainties is needed, either the dark matter theoretical model
is at odds with the data.

modes inside and outside the horizon. Some attempt, as an extension, was
focused on producing the Hawking emission spectrum of the (charged)
Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m black hole in the Banerjee-Majhi's treatment.
Unfortunately, the Kruskal extension in their observation was so badly defined
that the ingoing mode was classically forbidden traveling towards the center of
black hole, but could quantum tunnel across the horizon with the probability
$\Gamma=e^{-\pi \omega_0/\kappa_+}$. This tunneling picture is unphysical. With
this point as a central motivation, in this paper we first introduce such a
suitable Kruskal extension for the (charged) Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m black hole
that a perfect tunneling picture can be provided during the charged particle's
emission. Then, under the new Kruskal extension, we revisit the Hawking
emission spectrum and entropy spectroscopy as tunneling from the charged black
hole. The result shows that the tunneling method is so universally robust that
the Hawking blackbody emission spectrum from a charged black hole can be well
reproduced in the tunneling mechanism, and its induced entropy quantum is a
much better approximation for the forthcoming quantum gravity theory.

We
argue that such system can now be implemented in the real world using advance
technics in distributed network computing and cryptography. The specification
of the so called \net{} is presented. To Limit the number of financial
transactions, the system is forced to define its own currency, with many
benefits. The new ""cup"" currency, extended worldwide, is dedicated to {\sc ig},
available only for person-to-person trading, protected from speculation and
adapted for tax recovery with no additional computation. Those nices features
makes the \net{} a new democratic tool, fixing specific issues in {\sc ig}
trading and reviving a whole domain activity. We emphasis on the fact that all
proposed documentation, algorithm, program in any language related to this
proposal shall be open-source without any possibility to post any patent of any
sort on the system or subsystem. This new trading model should be considered as
a pure intellectual construction, like parts of Mathematics and then belongs to
nobody or everybody, like $1+1=2$. Next step will be to test, validate the
security of various implementations details, and to ask for legal rules
adaptations. The first draft paper is written in French language and posted to

F$_1$-motor hydrolyzes ATP, which is accompanied by unidirectional rotation of
its central $\gamma$-shaft. When a strong opposing torque is imposed, the
$\gamma$-shaft rotates in the opposite direction and drives the F$_1$-motor to
synthesize ATP. This mechanical-to-chemical free-energy transduction is the
final and central step of the multistep cellular ATP-synthetic pathway. Here,
we determined the amount of mechanical work exploited by the F$_1$-motor to
synthesize an ATP molecule during forced rotations using methodology combining
a nonequilibrium theory and single molecule measurements of responses to
external torque. We found that the internal dissipation of the motor is
negligible even during rotations far from a quasistatic process.

relationships between the massive black hole (MBH) mass (M_bh) and the stellar
mass (M^*_sph; or velocity dispersion \sigma) of the host galaxy/spheroid.
Assuming that the M_bh-M^*_sph (or M_bh-\sigma) relation evolves with redshift
as \propto (1+z)^\Gamma, the MBH mass density can be obtained from either the
observationally determined galaxy stellar mass functions or velocity dispersion
distribution functions over redshift z~0-1.2 for any given \Gamma. The MBH mass
density at different redshifts can also be inferred from the luminosity
function of QSOs/AGNs provided known radiative efficiency \epsilon. By matching
the MBH density inferred from galaxies to that obtained from QSOs/AGNs, we find
that \Gamma=0.64^{+0.27}_{-0.29} for the M_bh-M^*_sph relation and
\Gamma=-0.21^{+0.28}_{-0.33} for the M_bh-\sigma relation, and
\epsilon=0.11^{+0.04}_{-0.03}. Our results suggest that the MBH mass growth
precedes the bulge mass growth but the galaxy velocity dispersion does not
increase with the mass growth of the bulge after the quench of nuclear
activity, which is roughly consistent with the two-phase galaxy formation
scenario proposed by Oser et al. (2012) in which a galaxy roughly double its

explosions allow more detailed investigations of their host galaxies. We
present a detailed analysis of the host galaxy of SN 2010gx (z=0.23), one of
the best studied super-luminous type Ic supernovae. The host is a dwarf galaxy
(M_g=-17.42+/-0.17) with a high specific star formation rate. It has a
remarkably low metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=7.5+/-0.1 dex as determined from the
detection of the [OIII] 4363 Angs line. This is the first reliable metallicity
determination of a super-luminous stripped-envelope supernova host. We
collected deep multi-epoch imaging with Gemini + GMOS between 240-560 days
after explosion to search for any sign of radioactive nickel-56, which might
provide further insights on the explosion mechanism and the progenitor's
nature. We reach griz magnitudes of m_AB~26, but do not detect SN 2010gx at
these epochs. The limit implies that any nickel-56 production was similar to or
below that of SN 1998bw (a luminous type Ic SN that produced around 0.4 M_sun
of nickel-56). The low volumetric rates of these supernovae (~10^-4 of the
core-collapse population) could be qualitatively matched if the explosion
mechanism requires a combination of low-metallicity (below 0.2 Z_sun), high
progenitor mass (>60 M_sun) and high rotation rate (fastest 10% of rotators).

influenced by selection on linked regions of the genome, but our quantitative

predicting the distribution of fitness within an evolving population, and this
forms the basis for several methods that leverage the fitness distribution to
predict the patterns of genetic diversity when selection is strong. However, in
weakly selected populations random fluctuations due to genetic drift are more
severe, and neither the distribution of fitness nor the sequence diversity
within the population are well understood. Here, we briefly review the
motivations behind the fitness-distribution picture, and summarize the general
approaches that have been used to analyze this distribution in the
strong-selection regime. We then extend these approaches to the case of weak
selection, by outlining a perturbative treatment of selection at a large number
of linked sites. This allows us to quantify the stochastic behavior of the
fitness distribution and yields exact analytical predictions for the sequence
diversity and substitution rate in the limit that selection is weak.

jointly decide how to partition the cache among the cores and assign the jobs.
We initiate a theoretical study of this problem which we call the joint cache

harmonic oscillator, a couple of constant-of-motion operators generating the
Heisenberg-Weyl algebra can be found. The inclusion of the standard time
evolution generator (which is not a symmetry) as a symmetry in this algebra, in
a unitary manner, requires a non-trivial extension of this basic algebra and
hence of the physical system itself. Surprisingly, this extension leads
directly to the so-called Bateman dual system, which now includes a new
particle acting as an energy reservoir. In addition, the Caldirola-Kanai
dissipative system can be retrieved by imposing constraints. The algebra of
symmetries of the dual system is presented, as well as a quantization that
implies, in particular, a first-order Schr\""odinger equation. As opposed to
other approaches, where it is claimed that the spectrum of the Bateman
Hamiltonian is complex and discrete, we obtain that it is real and continuous,
with infinite degeneracy in all regimes.

approximation. The results of this approach are compared to phase diagrams
previously derived by thermodynamic integration using path integral and
classical simulations, as well as to experimental data. The studied models are
based on both flexible (q-TIP4P/F) and rigid (TIP4P/2005, TIP4PQ/2005)
descriptions of the water molecule. Many aspects of the simulated phase
diagrams are reasonably reproduced by the quasi-harmonic approximation.
Advantages of this simple approach are that it is free from the statistical
errors inherent to computer simulations, both classical and quantum limits are
easily accessible, and the error of the approximation is expected to decrease
in the zero temperature limit. We find that the calculated phase diagram of ice
Ih, II, and III depends strongly on the hydrogen disorder of ice III, at least
for cell sizes typically used in phase coexistence simulations. Either ice II
(in the classical limit) or ice III (in the quantum one) may become unstable
depending upon the proton disorder in ice III. The comparison of quantum and
classical limits shows that the stabilization of ice II is the most important
quantum effect in the phase diagram. The lower vibrational zero-point energy of
ice II, compared to either ice Ih or III, is the microscopic origin of this
stabilization. The necessity of performing an average of the lattice energy
over the proton disorder of ice III is discussed.

we found tight relations between the colours of the stars and their abundances
of p-capture elements. This strongly supports the idea that the He content -
which is expected to be closely correlated with the abundances of p-capture
elements - is the third parameter (after overall metallicity and age) that
determines the colour of HB stars. However, the range in He abundance must be
small (Delta Y<0.03) in 47 Tuc to reproduce our observations; this agrees with
previous analyses. There is possibly a correlation between the abundances of p-
and n-capture elements in 47 Tuc. If confirmed, this might suggest that AGB
stars of moderate mass contributed to the gas from which second-generation
stars formed. Considering the selection effects in our sample (which does not
include stars warmer than 11000 K and RR Lyrae variables) is important to
understand our results for M5. In this case, we find that, as expected, RHB
stars are Na-poor and O-rich, and likely belong to the primordial population.
There is a clear correlation of the [Na/O] ratio and N abundance with colour
along the BHB. A derivation of the He abundance for these stars yields a low
value of Y=0.22\pm 0.03. This is expected because HB stars of a putative
He-rich population in this cluster should be warmer than 11000 K, and would
accordingly not have been sampled by our analysis. However, we need some
additional source of scatter in the total mass loss of stars climbing up the
RGB to reproduce our results for M5. Finally, we found a C-star on the HB of 47
Tuc and a Ba-rich, fast-rotating, likely binary star on the HB of M5. These
stars are among the brightest and coolest HB stars.

present here a fluid dynamics video showing experimental results and CFD

the droplet breaking up and then returning back into the nozzle. This is due to
the fact that during the droplet formation the surface tension begins to slow
down the flow velocity inside the droplet and then finally inverts the flow
direction, while the droplet tail still breaks off from the nozzle. Thus after
the break up the droplet momentum is oriented toward the nozzle. It is
therefore possible to observe the droplet returning into the bulk fluid.
High-speed images of this particular phenomenon are shown and simulation

consistent with random orientations - no preferential alignment with respect to
the Galactic disk was found. A subsample of HII region driven Galactic bubbles
was identified, and as a single population they show random orientations. When
this subsample was further divided into subthermal and suprathermal HII
regions, based on hydrogren radio recombination linewidths, the subthermal HII

suprathermal HII regions showed significant alignment with the Galactic plane.
The mean orientation of the Galactic disk magnetic field was characterized

suprathermal linewidths are associated with younger HII regions, then the
evolution of young HII regions is significantly affected by the Galactic

Galactic magnetic field, as surrounding density variations come to dominate
their morphological evolution. From the new observations, the ratios of
magnetic-to-ram pressures in the expanding ionization fronts were estimated for
younger HII regions.

of superconducting spiral resonators will be discussed in detail, including the
mechanism of resonance, the origin of higher order modes, the analytical
framework for their determination, the effects of coupling scheme, and the
dependence of the resonance quality factor and insertion loss on the parity of
the mode. All the aforementioned models are compared with the experimental data
from a micro-fabricated YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) spiral resonator.
Moreover, the evolution of the resonance characteristics for the fundamental
mode with variation of the operating temperature and applied RF power is
experimentally examined, and its implications for metamaterial applications are
addressed.

  Polytope Study","20 page, 4 figures",,,,"cs.NA cs.CV cs.DS cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a method for construction of approximate feasible primal
solutions from dual ones for large-scale optimization problems possessing
certain separability properties. Whereas infeasible primal estimates can
typically be produced from (sub-)gradients of the dual function, it is often
not easy to project them to the primal feasible set, since the projection
itself has a complexity comparable to the complexity of the initial problem. We
propose an alternative efficient method to obtain feasibility and show that its
properties influencing the convergence to the optimum are similar to the
properties of the Euclidean projection. We apply our method to the local
polytope relaxation of inference problems for Markov Random Fields and
demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.

non-magnetized initial conditions with a velocity distribution that is (i)
gaussian, (ii) semi-elliptical, and (iii) waterbag. Below a critical energy
E_c, depending on the initial condition, this distribution is Vlasov
dynamically unstable. The system undergoes a process of violent relaxation and
quickly reaches a quasi-stationary state (QSS). We find that the distribution
function of this QSS can be conveniently fitted by a polytrope with index (i)
n=2, (ii) n=1, and (iii) n=1/2. Using the values of these indices, we are able
to determine the physical caloric curve T_{kin}(E) and explain the negative
kinetic specific heat region C_{kin}=dE/dT_{kin}<0 observed in the numerical
simulations. At low energies, we find that the system takes a ""core-halo""
structure. The core corresponds to the pure polytrope discussed above but it is
now surrounded by a halo of particles. We also consider unsteady initial
conditions with magnetization M_0=1 and isotropic waterbag distribution and
report the complex dynamics of the system creating phase space holes and dense
filaments. We show that the kinetic caloric curve is approximately constant,
corresponding to a polytrope with index n_0= 3.56. Finally, we consider the
collisional evolution of an initially Vlasov stable distribution, and show that
the time-evolving distribution function f(v,t) can be fitted by a sequence of
polytropic distributions with a time-dependent index n(t) both in the
non-magnetized and magnetized regimes. These numerical results show that
polytropic distributions (also called Tsallis distributions) provide in many
cases a good fit of the QSSs. However, in order to moderate our message, we
also report a case where the Lynden-Bell theory provides an excellent
prediction of an inhomogeneous QSS.

disappears when a charged capacitor is connected to an identical capacitor is
discussed based on the mechanical harmonic oscillator model approach. In the
mechanical harmonic oscillator model, it is shown first that \emph {exactly
half} the work done by a constant applied force is dissipated irrespective of
the form of dissipation mechanism when the system comes to a new equilibrium
after a constant force is abruptly applied. This model is then applied to the
energy loss mechanism in the capacitor charging problem or the two-capacitor
problem. This approach allows a simple explanation of the energy dissipation
mechanism in these problems and shows that the dissipated energy should always
be \emph {exactly half} the supplied energy whether that is caused by the Joule
heat or by the radiation. This paper which provides a simple treatment of the
energy dissipation mechanism in the two-capacitor problem is suitable for all

  Two Optoelectronic Oscillators",,,,,"physics.ins-det physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Absolute distance measurement (ADM) over a long range has been studied
intensely over the last several decades, due to its important applications in
large-scale manufacturing and outer space explorations [1-5]. Traditional
absolute distance measurements utilize detection of time-of-flight information,
detection of phase shift, or a combination of the two [6-17]. In this paper, we
present a novel scheme for high-precision ADM over a long range based on
frequency detection by using two optoelectronic oscillators (OEO) to convert
distance information to frequency information. By taking advantage of
accumulative magnification theory, the absolute error of the measured distance
is magnified by about 2*10E5 times, which makes the precision of the measured
distance significantly improved. In our experiments, the maximum error is 1.5
um at the emulated ~6 km distance, including the drift error of about 1 um in
the air path due to the change in environmental conditions. In addition, the
measurable distance using this scheme could be further extended. The highest
relative measurement precision is 2*10E10 in our current system while the
actual relative measurement precision of our experimental system is limited by
the variation of atmospheric conditions and is about 4*10E9.

two parts: In the first part, the Pfaff problem is presented and discussed in a
largely mathematical way, and in the second part, the mathematical generalities
thus introduced are applied to various physical models in which the normal form
of a 1-form has already been implicitly introduced, such as non-conservative
forces, linear non-holonomic constraints, the theory of vortices and
equilibrium thermodynamics. The role of integrability in the conservation of
energy is a recurring theme.
