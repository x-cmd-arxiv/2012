complex scenes consisting of stationary and moving targets. We use the classic
SAR setup with a single antenna emitting signals and receiving the echoes from
the scene. The known motion estimation methods for such setups work only in
simple cases, with one or a few targets in the same motion. We propose to
extend the applicability of these methods to complex scenes, by complementing
them with a data pre-processing step intended to separate the echoes from the
stationary targets and the moving ones. We present two approaches. The first is
an iteration designed to subtract the echoes from the stationary targets one by
one. It estimates the location of each stationary target from a preliminary
image, and then uses it to define a filter that removes its echo from the data.
The second approach is based on the robust principle component analysis (PCA)
method. The key observation is that with appropriate pre-processing and
windowing, the discrete samples of the stationary target echoes form a low rank
matrix, whereas the samples of a few moving target echoes form a high rank
sparse matrix. The robust PCA method is designed to separate the low rank from
the sparse part, and thus can be used for the SAR data separation. We present a
brief analysis of the two methods and explain how they can be combined to
improve the data separation for extended and complex imaging scenes. We also
assess the performance of the methods with extensive numerical simulations.

feature cumulative angular dispersion rates almost two orders of magnitude

multi-crystal arrangements become potential dispersing elements of hard x-ray
spectrographs. The hard x-ray spectrograph principles are demonstrated by
imaging a spectrum of photons with a record high resolution of $\Delta E \simeq

programers have to trade one for the other. We analyze this dilemma in the
context of programs operating on collections. Performance-critical code using
collections need often to be hand-optimized, leading to non-modular, brittle,
and redundant code. In principle, this dilemma could be avoided by automatic
collection-specific optimizations, such as fusion of collection traversals,
usage of indexing, or reordering of filters. Unfortunately, it is not obvious
how to encode such optimizations in terms of ordinary collection APIs, because
the program operating on the collections is not reified and hence cannot be
analyzed.
  We propose SQuOpt, the Scala Query Optimizer--a deep embedding of the Scala
collections API that allows such analyses and optimizations to be defined and
executed within Scala, without relying on external tools or compiler
extensions. SQuOpt provides the same ""look and feel"" (syntax and static typing
guarantees) as the standard collections API. We evaluate SQuOpt by
re-implementing several code analyses of the Findbugs tool using SQuOpt, show
average speedups of 12x with a maximum of 12800x and hence demonstrate that
SQuOpt can reconcile modularity and efficiency in real-world applications.

All-disk survey of Giant Molecular Clouds project (NRO MAGiC). The spatial

12CO (J=3-2) emission of 65 GMCs successfully. Furthermore, we find that the
correlation between the surface density of the star formation rate, which is
derived from a linear combination of Halpha and 24um emissions, and the 12CO
(J=3-2) integrated intensity still holds at this scale. This result show that
the star-forming activity is closely associated with warm and dense gases that
are traced with the 12CO (J=3-2) line, even in the scale of GMCs. We also find
that the GMCs with a high star-forming activity tend to show a high integrated
intensity ratio (R3-2/1-0). Moreover, we also observe a mass-dependent trend of
R3-2/1-0 for the GMCs with a low star-forming activity. From these results, we
speculate that the R3-2/1-0 values of the GMCs with a low star-forming activity
mainly depend on the dense gas fraction and not on the temperature, and
therefore, the dense gas fraction increases with the mass of GMCs, at least in
the GMCs with a low star-forming activity.

and an electron, a muon and a hadron, or an electron and a hadron. The
production cross-section for $Z$ bosons, with invariant mass between 60 and 120
GeV/$c^2$, which decay to $\tau$ leptons with transverse momenta greater than
20 GeV/$c$ and pseudorapidities between 2.0 and 4.5, is measured to be
$\sigma_{pp \to Z \to \tau\tau} = 71.4 \pm 3.5 \pm 2.8 \pm 2.5$ pb; the first
uncertainty is statistical, the second uncertainty is systematic, and the third
is due to the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity. The ratio of the
cross-sections for $Z \to \tau\tau$ to $Z \to \mu\mu$ is determined to be $0.93

been used to study the structure and linear polarization of its radio jet on
scales ranging from 2 to 30 kpc. There is a 7--8 Jy unresolved core with
spectral index $\alpha \simeq -0.24$ ($I_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$). The jet
(typical intensity 15 mJy/beam) consists of a $2.5\arcsec$ straight section
containing two knots, and two additional non-co-linear knots at the end. The
jet's total projected length is about 27 kpc. The spectral index of the jet
varies over $-1.1 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -0.5$. The jet diverges with a
semi-opening angle of about $9^\circ$, and is nearly constant in integrated
brightness over its length. A faint feature north-east of the core does not
appear to be a true counter-jet, but rather an extended lobe of this FR-II
radio source seen in projection. The absence of a counter-jet is sufficient to
place modest constraints on the speed of the jet on these scales, requiring
$\beta \ga 0.5$. Despite the indication of jet precession in the total
intensity structure, the polarization images suggest instead a jet re-directed
at least twice by collisions with the external medium.
  Surprisingly, the electric vector position angles in the main body of the jet
are neither longitudinal nor transverse, but make an angle of about $55^\circ$
with the jet axis in the middle while along the edges the vectors are
transverse, suggesting a helical magnetic field. There is no significant
Faraday rotation in the source, so that is not the cause of the twist. The
fractional polarization in the jet averages 25% and is higher at the edges. In
a companion paper it is shown that differential Doppler boosting in a diverging
relativisitic velocity field can explain the electric vector pattern in the
jet.

genome, before any of them fix. The resulting dynamics, although studied by
many authors, is still not fully understood, fundamentally because the effects
of fluctuations due to the small numbers of the fittest individuals are large
even in enormous populations. In this paper, branching processes and various
asymptotic methods for analyzing the stochastic dynamics are further developed
and used to obtain information on fluctuations, time dependence, and the
distributions of sizes of subpopulations, jumps in the mean fitness, and other
properties. The focus is on the behavior of a broad class of models: those with
a distribution of selective advantages of available beneficial mutations that
falls off more rapidly than exponentially. For such distributions, many aspects
of the dynamics are universal - quantitatively so for extremely large
populations. On the most important time scale that controls coalescent
properties and fluctuations of the speed, the dynamics is reduced to a simple
stochastic model that couples the peak and the high-fitness ""nose"" of the
fitness distribution. Extensions to other models and distributions of available
mutations are discussed briefly.

indeterminism. In particular, we identify FW in a physical theory with dynamics

concentration due to long-range disorder. Interplay between intra- and
interband transitions is analyzed for the high-frequency regime of response,
near the Pauli blocking threshold. The gate voltage and temperature
dependencies of the absorption efficiency are calculated. It is demonstrated
that for typical parameters, the smearing of the interband absorption edge is
determined by a unscreened part of long-range disorder while the intraband
absorption is determined by finite-range scattering. The latter yields the
spectral dependencies which deviate from those following from the Drude

wave function of one of the projectiles is probed at very small Bjorken $x$,
being characterized by a large number of gluons. In this kinematical regime, a
new state of matter - the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) - is expected to be

dynamical momentum scale, the saturation scale $Q_s$, which can assume values
very larger than the QCD confinement scale $\Lambda_{QCD}$ and give the scale
of the running coupling constant. In this paper we assume that in particular
kinematical region probed by LHC forward (LHCf) experiment the saturation scale
can be considered the hard momentum scale present in the process and calculate
the forward neutral pion production at very low-$p_T$ using a perturbative
approach. We demonstrate that the CGC formalism is able to successfully
describe the LHCf data, which can be considered as a compelling indication of

(MVPA) to fMRI. Information maps are constructed using the so called
searchlight method, where the spherical multivoxel neighborhood of every voxel
(i.e., a searchlight) in the brain is evaluated for the presence of
task-relevant response patterns. Despite their widespread use, information maps
present several challenges for interpretation. One such challenge has to do
with inferring the size and shape of a multivoxel pattern from its signature on
the information map. To address this issue, we formally examined the geometric
basis of this mapping relationship. Based on geometric considerations, we show
how and why small patterns (i.e., having smaller spatial extents) can produce a
larger signature on the information map as compared to large patterns,
independent of the size of the searchlight radius. Furthermore, we show that
the number of informative searchlights over the brain increase as a function of
searchlight radius, even in the complete absence of any multivariate response
patterns. These properties are unrelated to the statistical capabilities of the
pattern-analysis algorithms used but are obligatory geometric properties
arising from using the searchlight procedure.

combination of the very low mass function and such a short orbital period is
unique. The discoverers suggested that the progenitor system could be an
ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB), which is a binary with a sub-hour orbital
period in which a (semi-)degenerate donor fills its Roche lobe and transfers
mass to a neutron star. The standard gravitational-wave driven UCXB scenario,
however, cannot produce a system like PSR J1719-1438 as it would take longer
than the age of the Universe to reach an orbital period of 131 min. We
investigate two modifications to the standard UCXB evolution that may resolve
this discrepancy. The first involves significant heating and bloating of the
donor by pulsar irradiation, and in the second modification the system loses
orbital angular momentum via a fast stellar wind from the irradiated donor,
additional to the losses via the usual gravitational wave radiation. In
particular a donor wind is effective in accelerating orbital expansion, and
even a mild wind could produce the 131 minute period within the age of the
Universe. We note that UCXBs could be an important class of progenitors of
solitary millisecond radio pulsars.

evolution of UCXBs is poorly understood -- all 13 known systems are relatively
young and it is not clear why. One question is whether old UCXBs actually still
exist, or have they become disrupted at some point? Alternatively they may be
simply too faint to see. To investigate this, we apply the theories of

flux using dust radiative transfer calculations of starbursts realized in

diagnostics commonly used to disentangle AGN and star formation in
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). We examine these quantities as a
function of time, viewing angle, dust model, AGN spectrum, and AGN strength in
merger simulations representing two possible extremes of the ULIRG population:
one is a typical gas-rich merger at z ~ 0, and the other is characteristic of
extremely obscured starbursts at z ~ 2 to 4. This highly obscured burst begins
star-formation-dominated with significant PAH emission, and ends with a ~10^9
yr period of red near-IR colors. At coalescence, when the AGN is most luminous,
dust obscures the near-infrared AGN signature, reduces the relative emission
from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and enhances the 9.7 micron
absorption by silicate grains. Although generally consistent with previous
interpretations, our results imply none of these indicators can unambiguously
estimate the AGN luminosity fraction in all cases. Motivated by the
simulations, we show that a combination of the extinction feature at 9.7
micron, the PAH strength, and a near-infrared slope can simultaneously
constrain the AGN fraction and dust grain distribution for a wide range of
obscuration. We find that this indicator, accessible to the James Webb Space
Telescope, may estimate the AGN power as tightly as the hard X-ray flux alone,
thereby providing a valuable future cross-check and constraint for large
samples of distant ULIRGs.

hole is given within the framework of a unitary theory of quantum gravity
preserving locality, without dropping the information that manifests as
macroscopic properties of the state at late times. The resulting picture
depends strongly on the reference frame one chooses to describe the process. In
one description based on a reference frame in which the reference point stays
outside the black hole horizon for sufficiently long time, a late black hole
state becomes a superposition of black holes in different locations and with
different spins, even if the back hole is formed from collapsing matter that
had a well-defined classical configuration with no angular momentum. The
information about the initial state is partly encoded in relative
coefficients---especially phases---of the terms representing macroscopically
different geometries. In another description in which the reference point
enters into the black hole horizon at late times, an S-matrix description in
the asymptotically Minkowski spacetime is not applicable, but it sill allows
for an ""S-matrix"" description in the full quantum gravitational Hilbert space
including singularity states. Relations between different descriptions are
given by unitary transformations acting on the full Hilbert space, and they in
general involve superpositions of ""distant"" and ""infalling"" descriptions.
Despite the intrinsically quantum mechanical nature of the black hole state,
measurements performed by a classical physical observer are consistent with
those implied by general relativity. In particular, the recently-considered
firewall phenomenon can occur only for an exponentially fine-tuned (and
intrinsically quantum mechanical) initial state, analogous to an entropy

The ratio shows clear evidence for the evolution of molecular gas from the
upstream interarm regions, passage into the spiral arms and back into the
downstream interarm regions. In the interarm regions, R is typically low <0.7
(and often 0.4-0.6); this is similar to the ratios observed in Galactic giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) with low far-IR luminosities. However, the ratio rises
to >0.7 (often 0.8-1.0) in the spiral arms, particularly at their leading
(downstream) edge. R is also high, 0.8-1.0, in the central region. An LVG
calculation provides insight into the changes in the gas physical conditions
between the arm and interarm regions: cold and low density gas (~10K, ~300cm-3)
is required for the interarm GMCs, but this gas must become warmer and/or
denser in the more active star forming spiral arms. R is higher in areas of
high 24micron brightness (an approximate tracer of star formation rate surface
density) and high CO(1-0) integrated intensity (a well-calibrated tracer of
total molecular gas surface density). The systematic enhancement of the CO(2-1)
line relative to CO(1-0) in luminous star forming regions suggests that some
caution is needed when using CO(2-1) as a tracer of bulk molecular gas mass.

uncertainty to that population. Application of stellar evolution models allows
us to infer the MZAMS from this age. Because our technique is not contingent on
precise location of the progenitor star, it can be applied to the location of
any known SNR. We identify significant young SF around 53 of the 59 SNRs and
assign progenitor masses to these, representing a factor of 2 increase over
currently measured progenitor masses. We consider the remaining 6 SNRs as
either probable Type Ia candidates or the result of core-collapse progenitors
that have escaped their birth sites. The distribution of recovered progenitor
masses is bottom heavy, showing a paucity of the most massive stars. If we
assume a single power law distribution, dN/dM proportional to M^alpha, we find
a distribution that is steeper than a Salpeter IMF (alpha=-2.35). In
particular, we find values of alpha outside the range -2.7 to -4.4 inconsistent

distribution that follows a Salpeter IMF up to some maximum mass, we find that

and formation time, and the shape of subhalos' spatial distribution and

the peak maximum circular velocity in their histories (a property expected to
be closely related to the galaxy luminosity), is uncorrelated with the
formation time of the main halo. This is in contrast to the previously reported
correlation from studies where subhalos are selected by the current maximum
circular velocity; we show that this difference is a result of the tidal
stripping of the subhalos. We also find that the dominance of the main halo and
the subhalo mass fraction are strongly correlated with halo concentration and
formation history. These correlations are important to take into account when
interpreting results from cluster samples selected with different criteria. Our

quantum multipartite states. In this paper we prove two new quantum de Finetti
theorems, both showing that under tests formed by local measurements one can
get a much improved error dependence on the dimension of the subsystems. We
also obtain similar results for non-signaling probability distributions. We
give the following applications of the results:
  We prove the optimality of the Chen-Drucker protocol for 3-SAT, under the
exponential time hypothesis.
  We show that the maximum winning probability of free games can be estimated
in polynomial time by linear programming. We also show that 3-SAT with m
variables can be reduced to obtaining a constant error approximation of the
maximum winning probability under entangled strategies of O(m^{1/2})-player
one-round non-local games, in which the players communicate O(m^{1/2}) bits all
together.
  We show that the optimization of certain polynomials over the hypersphere can
be performed in quasipolynomial time in the number of variables n by
considering O(log(n)) rounds of the Sum-of-Squares (Parrilo/Lasserre) hierarchy
of semidefinite programs. As an application to entanglement theory, we find a
quasipolynomial-time algorithm for deciding multipartite separability.
  We consider a result due to Aaronson -- showing that given an unknown n qubit
state one can perform tomography that works well for most observables by
measuring only O(n) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of
the state -- and relax the assumption of having i.i.d copies of the state to
merely the ability to select subsystems at random from a quantum multipartite
state.
  The proofs of the new quantum de Finetti theorems are based on information
theory, in particular on the chain rule of mutual information.

on the formation process of Sun-like stars in our Galaxy. These results tell us
that Sun-like stars form in dense regions of molecular clouds and that three
major steps are involved before the planet formation period. They are
represented by the pre-stellar core, protostellar envelope and protoplanetary
disk phases. Simultaneously with the evolution from one phase to the other, the
chemical composition gains increasing complexity.
  In this review, we first present the information on the chemical composition
of meteorites, comets and other small bodies of the Solar System, which is
potentially linked to the first phases of the Solar System's formation. Then we
describe the observed chemical composition in the pre-stellar core,
protostellar envelope and protoplanetary disk phases, including the processes
that lead to them. Finally, we draw together pieces from the different objects

that the structure of information is not what we thought it was: there are
operational, i.e., phenomenal, probabilistic correlations that lie outside the
polytope of local correlations. Such correlations cannot be simulated with
classical resources, which generate classical correlations represented by the
points in a simplex, where the vertices of the simplex represent joint
deterministic states that are the common causes of the correlations. The `no
go' hidden variable theorems tell us that we can't shoe-horn correlations
outside the local polytope into a classical simplex by supposing that something
has been left out of the story. The replacement of the classical simplex by the
quantum convex set as the structure representing probabilistic correlations is
the analogue for quantum mechanics of the replacement of Newton's Euclidean
space and time by Minkowski spacetime in special relativity. The nonclassical
features of quantum mechanics, including the irreducible information loss on
measurement, are generic features of correlations that lie outside the local
correlation polytope. This paper is an elaboration of these ideas, and its
consequences for the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. A large part of
the difficulty is removed by seeing that the inconsistency in reconciling the
entangled state at the end of a quantum measurement process with the
definiteness of the macroscopic pointer reading and the definiteness of the
correlated value of the measured micro-observable is only apparent and depends
on a stipulation that is not required by the structure of the quantum
possibility space. Replacing this stipulation by an alternative consistent
stipulation resolves the problem.

multiferroicity below a high TC of 108 K over a wide temperature range

limitations that process calculi have for describing patterns of dynamic

behavior and location of running processes, and so they are at the heart of the
adaptation capabilities present in many modern concurrent systems. Adaptable
processes have a location and are sensible to actions of dynamic update at
runtime; this allows to express a wide range of evolvability patterns for
concurrent processes. We introduce a core calculus of adaptable processes and
propose two verification problems for them: bounded and eventual adaptation.
While the former ensures that the number of consecutive erroneous states that
can be traversed during a computation is bound by some given number k, the
latter ensures that if the system enters into a state with errors then a state
without errors will be eventually reached. We study the (un)decidability of
these two problems in several variants of the calculus, which result from
considering dynamic and static topologies of adaptable processes as well as
different evolvability patterns. Rather than a specification language, our
calculus intends to be a basis for investigating the fundamental properties of
evolvable processes and for developing richer languages with evolvability
capabilities.

neutron-capture reactions, including seven elements (germanium, cadmium,
tellurium, lutetium, osmium, platinum, and gold) that can only be detected in
the near-ultraviolet. We also examine 202 heavy element absorption lines in

High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on the Keck I Telescope on Mauna Kea. We
have detected up to 34 elements heavier than zinc. The bulk of the heavy
elements in these four stars are produced by r-process nucleosynthesis. These
observations affirm earlier results suggesting that the tellurium found in
metal-poor halo stars with moderate amounts of r-process material scales with
the rare earth and third r-process peak elements. Cadmium often follows the
abundances of the neighboring elements palladium and silver. We identify
several sources of systematic uncertainty that must be considered when
comparing these abundances with theoretical predictions. We also present new

Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS-III: BOSS). From the SDSS-III Data Release Nine
(DR9), we select a uniform sample of 22,301 i<=21.8 quasars over an area of
2236 sq. deg with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts between 2.2<z<3.5, filling
in a key part of the luminosity-redshift plane for optical quasar studies. We
derive the completeness of the survey through simulated quasar photometry, and
check this completeness estimate using a sample of quasars selected by their
photometric variability within the BOSS footprint. We investigate the level of
systematics associated with our quasar sample using the simulations, in the
process generating color-redshift relations and a new quasar k-correction. We
probe the faint end of the QLF to M_i(z=2.2) = -24.5 and see a clear break in
the QLF at all redshifts up to z=3.5. We find that a log-linear relation (in
log[Phi*] - M*) for a luminosity and density evolution (LEDE) model adequately
describes our data within the range 2.2<z<3.5; across this interval the break
luminosity increases by a factor of ~2.3 while Phi* declines by a factor of ~6.
At z<2.2 our data is reasonably well fit by a pure luminosity evolution (PLE)
model. We see only a weak signature of ""AGN downsizing"", in line with recent
studies of the hard X-ray luminosity function. We compare our measured QLF to a
number of theoretical models and find that models making a variety of
assumptions about quasar triggering and halo occupation can fit our data over a
wide range of redshifts and luminosities.

observation that a scalar resonance coupling to $\phi \omega$ unavoidably
couples strongly to $K \bar K$, but no trace of a peak is seen in the $K \bar
K$ spectrum of the $J/\Psi \to \gamma K \bar K$ at this energy. This serves us
to rule out the interpretation of the observed peak as a signal of a new

of a pair of vector mesons and how its interaction leads necessarily to a peak
in the $J/\Psi \to \gamma \phi \omega$ reaction close to the $\phi \omega$
threshold, due to the dynamical generation of the $f_0(1710)$ resonance by the
vector-vector interaction. We then show that both the shape obtained for the

broad Ha selected type 1 AGN, and explore their positions in the BPT diagrams

luminosities of all measured narrow lines (Ha, Hb, [OIII], [NII], [SII], [OI])
show a Baldwin relation relative to the broad Ha luminosity L_bHa, with slopes
in the range of 0.53-0.72. 2. About 20% of the type 1 AGN reside within the
`Composite' and `SF' regions of the BPT diagrams. These objects also show
excess narrow Ha and UV luminosities, for their L_bHa, consistent with
contribution from star formation which dominates the narrow lines emission, as
expected from their positions in the BPT diagrams. 3. The type 1 which reside
within the AGN region in the BPT diagrams, are offset to lower [SII]/Ha and
[NII]/Ha luminosity ratios, compared to type 2 AGN. This offset is a selection
effect, related to the lower AGN/host luminosity selection of the type 2 AGN
selected from the SDSS galaxy sample. 4. The [NII]/Ha and [NII]/[SII] ratios in
type 1 AGN increase with the host mass, as expected if the mass-metallicity
relation of quiescent galaxies holds for the AGN narrow line region. 5. The
broad lines optical FeII is higher for a higher [NII]/Ha, at a fixed L_Bol and
Eddington ratio L/L_Edd. This suggests that the broad line region metallicity
is also related to the host mass. 6. The fraction of AGN which are LINERs
increases sharply with decreasing L/L_Edd. This fraction is the same for type 1
and type 2 AGN. 7. The BPT position is unaffected by the amount of dust
extinction of the optical-UV continuum, which suggests the extincting dust
resides on scales larger than the NLR.

it is possible to derive total hydrogen volume densities. These densities,
obtained through a combination of atomic hydrogen, far-ultraviolet and
metallicity data, provide an independent probe of the combined atomic and
molecular hydrogen gas in galactic disks. We present a new, flexible and fully
automated procedure using this simple model. This automated method will allow
us to take full advantage of a host of available data on galaxies in order to
calculate total hydrogen volume densities of giant molecular clouds surrounding
sites of recent star formation. So far this was only possible on a
galaxy-by-galaxy basis using by-eye analysis of candidate photodissociation
regions. We test the automated method by adopting different models for the
dust-to-gas ratio and comparing the resulting densities for M74, including a
new metallicity map of M74 produced by integral field spectroscopy. We test the
procedure against previously published M83 volume densities based on the same
method and find no significant differences. The range of total hydrogen volume
densities obtained for M74 is approximately 5-700 cm-3 . Different dust-to-gas
ratio models do not result in measurably different densities. The cloud
densities presented here add M74 to the list of galaxies analyzed using the
assumption of photodissociated atomic hydrogen occurring near sites of recent
star formation and further solidify the method. For the first time, full
metallicity maps were included in the analysis as opposed to metallicity
gradients. The results will need to be compared to other tracers of the
interstellar medium and photodissociation regions, such as CO and CII, in order
to test our basic assumptions, specifically, our assumption that the HI we
detect originates in photodissociation regions.

from the initial state? This problem can be reduced to solving a linear
equation Ax = b for x, where A is a matrix and b is a vector. We consider two
iterative methods to solve the linear equation: the Jacobi method and the
biconjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGStab) method. For both methods, a
sequential and a parallel version have been implemented. The parallel versions
have been implemented on the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) so that
they can be run on a NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU). From our
experiments we conclude that as the size of the matrix increases, the CUDA
implementations outperform the sequential implementations. Furthermore, the
BiCGStab method performs better than the Jacobi method for dense matrices,
whereas the Jacobi method does better for sparse ones. Since the reachability
probabilities problem plays a key role in probabilistic model checking, we also
compared the implementations for matrices obtained from a probabilistic model
checker. Our experiments support the conjecture by Bosnacki et al. that the
Jacobi method is superior to Krylov subspace methods, a class to which the
BiCGStab method belongs, for probabilistic model checking.

solving the game. Practical game solvers exist, but the instantiation step is
the bottleneck.
  We enhance the instantiation in two steps. First, we transform the PBES to a
Parameterised Parity Game (PPG), a PBES with each equation either conjunctive
or disjunctive. Then we use LTSmin, that offers transition caching, efficient
storage of states and both distributed and symbolic state space generation, for
generating the game graph. To that end we define a language module for LTSmin,
consisting of an encoding of variables with parameters into state vectors, a
grouped transition relation and a dependency matrix to indicate the
dependencies between parts of the state vector and transition groups.
  Benchmarks on some large case studies, show that the method speeds up the

State sets are represented and modified by accessing and manipulating their

  In this paper, we propose a novel BDD partitioning option. The partitioning
is lexicographical in the binary representation of the states contained in the
set that is represented by a BDD and uniform with respect to the number of
states represented. The motivation of controlling the state set sizes in the
partitioning is to eventually bridge the gap between explicit and symbolic
search.
  Let n be the size of the binary state vector. We propose an O(n) ranking and
unranking scheme that supports negated edges and operates on top of precomputed
satcount values. For the uniform split of a BDD, we then use unranking to
provide paths along which we partition the BDDs. In a shared BDD representation
the efforts are O(n). The algorithms are fully integrated in the CUDD library
and evaluated in strongly solving general game playing benchmarks.

equation as a field equation, after field quantization, the Heisenberg
equations for the momentum and position operators of the particles excited from
the (Schr\""odinger) field and the Feynman path integral formula of QM are also
obtained. We then give the probability concepts of quantum mechanics in terms
of a statistical ensemble, realizing the ensemble(or statistical)
interpretation. With these, we make a series of conceptual modifications to the
standard quantum mechanics, especially propose a new assumption about the
quantum measurement theory which can solve the EPR paradox from the view of the
QFT. Besides, a field theoretical description to the double-slit interference
experiment is developed, obtaining the required particle number distribution.
In the end, we extend all the above concepts to the relativistic case so that
the ensemble interpretation is still proper.
  Two extra topics are added, in the first one, an operable experiment is
proposed to distinguish the Copenhagen interpretation from the ensemble one via
very different experimental results. While the second topic concerns with the
extensions of the concept of coherent state to both the Bosonic and Fermionic
field cases, to obtain the corresponding classical fields. And in the
concluding section, we make some general comparisons between the standard QM
and the one derived from the QFT, from which we claim that the QFT is the
fundamental theory.

Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction is realized in a `mobile' weighted space of

magnitude of this anomaly emerges naturally from hastatic order, a proposal for
hidden order that is a two-component spinor arising from the hybridization of a
non-Kramers Gamma_5 doublet with Kramers conduction electrons. A prediction is
made for the angular anisotropy of the nonlinear susceptibility anomaly as a
test of this proposed order parameter for URu_2Si_2.

large trilinear supersymmetry-breaking terms A_t between stops and one of the
elementary Higgs fields. We consider the possibility that electroweak symmetry
breaking may be triggered by supersymmetry breaking with a large A_t, large
enough to generate a composite field with the same quantum numbers as the Higgs

vacuum, the usual relation between the gauge couplings and the Higgs
self-coupling does not apply, and there is no reason to expect the same upper

bound state is assumed to have no mixing with the other fields, we calculate
the critical coupling A_t necessary for symmetry breaking using the
lowest-order Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation. Study of the BS equation is
complicated by the structure of its lowest-order kernel, which is a crossed box
graph, but we find an accurate approximation to its solution. In a realistic

the population birth and death rates. Assuming that the Allee effect is strong,
and the environmental noise is positively correlated and Gaussian, we derive a
Fokker-Planck equation for the joint probability distribution of the population
sizes and environmental fluctuations. In WKB approximation this equation
reduces to an effective two-dimensional Hamiltonian mechanics, where the most
likely path to extinction and the most likely environmental fluctuation are
encoded in an instanton-like trajectory in the phase space. The mean time to
extinction (MTE) is related to the mechanical action along this trajectory. We
obtain new analytic results for short-correlated, long-correlated and
relatively weak environmental noise. The population-size dependence of the MTE
changes from exponential for weak environmental noise to no dependence for
strong noise, implying a greatly increased extinction risk. The theory is
readily extendable to population switches between different metastable states,
and to stochastic population explosion, due to a combined action of demographic
and environmental noise.

origin of these LABs is not well understood. In this paper, we investigate a
merger model for the formation of LABs by studying Lya emission from
interacting galaxies at high redshifts by means of a combination of
hydrodynamics simulations with three dimensional radiative transfer
calculations. Our galaxy simulations focus on a set of binary major mergers of
galaxies with a mass range of 3-7 *10^12 Msun in the redshift range of z ~ 3
-7, and we use the newly improved ART^2 code to perform the radiative transfer
calculations which couple multi-wavelength continuum, ionization of hydrogen,
and Lya line emission. We find that intense star formation and enhanced cooling
induced by gravitational interaction produce strong Lya emission from these
merging galaxies. The Lya emission appears to be extended due to the extended
distribution of sources and gas. During the close encounter of galaxy
progenitors when the star formation rate peaks at ~ 10^3 Msun/yr, our model
produces Lya blobs with luminosity of L ~ 10^42-10^44 erg/s, and size of D ~
10-20 kpc at z>6 and D ~ 20-50 kpc at z ~ 3, in broad agreement with

galaxies may produce some typical LABs as observed, but the giant ones may be

which thermal losses out of the boundaries are balanced by dissipative heating.
We identify two regimes. A conductive regime in which the heat is transported
mostly by conduction and the density decreases with height. In the limit of
large thermal diffusivity this regime resembles the more familiar isothermal
case. Another, the convective regime, observed at smaller values of the thermal
diffusivity, in which the layer becomes unstable to overturning motions, the
heat is carried mostly by advection and the density becomes nearly constant

time points. This introduces dependencies between the sets of compared genes,
and may lead to biased results. Here we overcome this problem using an
alternative modular analysis. We used the Iterative Signature Algorithm to
identify distinct modules of genes co-expressed specifically in consecutive
stages of zebrafish development. We then performed a detailed comparison of
several gene properties between modules, allowing for a less biased and more
powerful analysis. Notably, our analysis corroborated the hourglass pattern
only at the regulatory level, with sequences of regulatory regions being most
conserved for genes expressed in mid-development, but not at the level of gene
sequence, age or expression, in contrast to some previous studies. The early
conservation model was supported with gene duplication and birth that were the
most rare for genes expressed in early development. Finally, for all gene
properties we observed the least conservation for genes expressed in late
development or adult, consistent with both models. Overall, with the modular
approach, we showed that different levels of molecular evolution follow
different patterns of developmental constraints. Thus both models are valid,
but with respect to different genomic features.

with various degrees of disturbance, showing that the assumptions of
hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical shape which are used to determine the
cluster mass from X-ray data are not always satisfied. It is therefore
important for the understanding of cluster properties as well as for
cosmological applications to detect and quantify substructure in X-ray images
of galaxy clusters. Two promising methods to do so are power ratios and center
shifts. Since these estimators can be heavily affected by Poisson noise and
X-ray background, we performed an extensive analysis of their statistical
properties using a large sample of simulated X-ray observations of clusters
from hydrodynamical simulations. We quantify the measurement bias and error in
detail and give ranges where morphological analysis is feasible. A new,
computationally fast method to correct for the Poisson bias and the X-ray
background contribution in power ratio and center shift measurements is
presented and tested for typical XMM-Newton observational data sets. We studied
the morphology of 121 simulated cluster images and establish structure
boundaries to divide samples into relaxed, mildly disturbed and disturbed
clusters. In addition, we present a new morphology estimator - the peak of the
0.3-1 r500 P3/P0 profile to better identify merging clusters. The analysis
methods were applied to a sample of 80 galaxy clusters observed with
XMM-Newton. We give structure parameters (P3/P0 in r500, w and P3/P0_max) for
all 80 observed clusters. Using our definition of the P3/P0 (w) substructure
boundary, we find 41% (47%) of our observed clusters to be disturbed.

conventional lasers, random lasers have no resonator to trap light, they are
highly multimode with potentially strong modal interactions and they are based
on disordered gain media, where photons undergo random multiple scattering.
Interference effects notoriously modify the propagation of waves in such random
media, but their fate in the presence of nonlinearity and interactions is
poorly understood. Here, we present a semiclassical theory for multimode random
lasing in the strongly scattering regime. We show that Anderson localization, a
wave-interference effect, is not affected by the presence of nonlinearities. To
the contrary, its presence suppresses interactions between simultaneously
lasing modes. Using a recently constructed theory for complex multimode lasers,
we show analytically how Anderson localization justifies a noninteracting,
single-pole approximation. Consequently, lasing modes in a strongly scattering
random laser are given by long-lived, Anderson localized modes of the passive
cavity, whose frequency and wave profile does not vary with pumping, even in
the multi-mode regime when mode overlap spatially.

of high-resolution images of pores and sunspots and employing wavelet analysis
in conjunction with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) makes the MHD wave
analysis possible. For this paper, two sunspots and one pore (with a light
bridge) were chosen as representative examples of MHD waveguides in the lower
solar atmosphere. The sunspots and pore display a range of periods from 4 to 65

a doubling or quadrupling of the maximum pore oscillatory period. All of these
structures display area oscillations indicative of MHD sausage modes and
in-phase behaviour between the area and intensity, presenting mounting evidence
for the presence of the slow sausage mode within these waveguides. The presence
of fast and slow MHD sausage waves has been detected in three different
magnetic waveguides in the lower solar photosphere. Furthermore, these
oscillations are potentially standing harmonics supported in the waveguides
which are sandwiched vertically between the temperature minimum in the lower
solar atmosphere and the transition region. Standing harmonic oscillations, by
means of solar magneto-seismology, may allow insight into the sub-resolution

parameter sets characteristic of these models places intense demands on both
computational and experimental resources, limiting the scope of in silico

reproducing the complex responses to variations in daylength generated by more
detailed differential equation formulations. Our work also demonstrates that

magnetization, resistivity and specific heat) of CePt_3B_(1-x)Si-x, an alloying
system that crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric lattice, and derive the
magnetic phase diagram. The materials at the end point of the alloying series
have previously been studied, with CePt_3B established as a material with two
different magnetic phases at low temperatures (antiferromagnetic below T_N =
7.8 K, weakly ferromagnetic below T_C ~ 5 K), while CePt3Si is a heavy fermion
superconductor (T_c = 0.75 K) coexisting with antiferromagnetism (T_N = 2.2 K).
From our experiments we conclude that the magnetic phase diagram is divided
into two regions. In the region of low Si content (up to x ~ 0.7) the material
properties resemble those of CePt3B. Upon increasing the Si concentration
further the magnetic ground state continuously transforms into that of CePt3Si.
In essence, we argue that CePt_3B can be understood as a low pressure variant
of CePt3Si.

propagation and aggregation algorithms are developed to consider the indirect
influence: CP (Conservative Propagation) and NCP (None Conservative

TOIM to construct their progressive opinions and neighbors' opinion influence
through a statistical learning process, which can be further utilized to
predict users' future opinions on some specific topics. To evaluate and test
this proposed model, an experiment was designed and a sub-dataset from Tencent
Micro-Blogging was used. The experimental results show that TOIM outperforms
baseline methods on predicting users' opinion. The applications of CP and NCP
have no significant differences and could significantly improve recall and

building block in the crystal structures have been rationalized in the past
using ideas based on the Fermi Surface nesting of hole and electron pockets
when in the presence of weak Hubbard $U$ interactions. This approach seemed
appropriate considering the small values of the magnetic moments in the parent
compounds and the clear evidence based on photoemission experiments of the
required electron and hole pockets. However, recent results in the context of
alkali metal iron selenides, with generic chemical composition
$A_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ ($A$ = alkali element), have drastically challenged those
previous ideas since at particular compositions $y$ the low-temperature ground
states are insulating and display antiferromagnetic magnetic order with large
iron magnetic moments. Moreover, angle resolved photoemission studies have
revealed the absence of hole pockets at the Fermi level in these materials. The
present status of this exciting area of research, with the potential to alter
conceptually our understanding of the iron-based superconductors, is here
reviewed, covering both experimental and theoretical investigations. Other
recent related developments are also briefly reviewed, such as the study of
selenide two-leg ladders and the discovery of superconductivity in a single

source HESS J1303-631, discovered in 2004, is re-examined including new data
from the H.E.S.S. Cherenkov telescope array. Archival data from the XMM-Newton
X-ray satellite and from the PMN radio survey are also examined. Detailed
morphological and spectral studies of VHE \gamma-ray emission as well as of the
XMM-Newton X-ray data are performed. Significant energy-dependent morphology of
the \gamma-ray source is detected with high-energy emission (E > 10 TeV)
positionally coincident with the pulsar PSR J1301-6305 and lower energy
emission (E <2 TeV) extending \sim 0.4^{\circ} to the South-East of the pulsar.
The spectrum of the VHE source can be described with a power-law with an
exponential cut-off N_{0} = (5.6 \pm 0.5) X 10^{-12} TeV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1, \Gamma
= 1.5 \pm 0.2) and E_{\rm cut} = (7.7 \pm 2.2) TeV. The PWN is also detected in
X-rays, extending \sim 2-3' from the pulsar position towards the center of the
\gamma-ray emission region. The spectral energy distribution (SED) is well
described by a one zone leptonic scenario which, with its associated caveats,
predicts a very low average magnetic field for this source. Significant
energy-dependent morphology of this source, as well as the identification of an
associated X-ray PWN from XMM-Newton observations enable identification of the
VHE source as an evolved PWN associated to the pulsar PSR J1303-6305. However,
the large discrepancy in emission region sizes and the low level of synchrotron
radiation suggest a multi-population leptonic nature. The low implied magnetic
field suggests that the PWN has undergone significant expansion. This would
explain the low level of synchrotron radiation and the difficulty in detecting
counterparts at lower energies, the reason this source was originally
classified as a ""dark"" VHE \gamma-ray source.

Classical theory, being
fully deterministic, completely excludes fundamental randomness. On the
contrary, quantum theory allows for randomness within its axiomatic structure.
Yet, the fact that a theory makes prediction only in probabilistic terms does
not imply the existence of any form of randomness in nature. The question then
remains whether one can certify randomness independent of the physical
framework used. While standard Bell tests approach this question from this
perspective, they require prior perfect randomness, which renders the approach
circular. Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to certify full
randomness using almost perfect random bits. Here, we prove that full
randomness can indeed be certified using quantum non-locality under the minimal
possible assumptions: the existence of a source of arbitrarily weak (but
non-zero) randomness and the impossibility of instantaneous signalling. Thus we
are left with a strict dichotomic choice: either our world is fully
deterministic or there exist in nature events that are fully random. Apart from
the foundational implications, our results represent a quantum protocol for
full randomness amplification, an information task known to be impossible
classically. Finally, they open a new path for device-independent protocols
under minimal assumptions.

onto a subspace of the RKHS associated with a given MVE problem. We show that,
under mild conditions, the Barankin bound (the tightest possible lower bound on
the estimator variance) is a lower semicontinuous function of the parameter
vector. We also show that the RKHS associated with an MVE problem remains
unchanged if the observation is replaced by a sufficient statistic. Finally,
for MVE problems conforming to an exponential family of distributions, we
derive novel closed-form lower bound on the estimator variance and show that a
reduction of the parameter set leaves the minimum achievable variance

  986-1049","10.1016/j.aim.2013.08.020",,"math.CT math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address the (pointed) homotopy theory of 2-crossed modules (of groups),
which are known to faithfully represent Gray 3-groupoids, with a single object,
and also connected homotopy 3-types. The homotopy relation between 2-crossed
module maps will be defined in a similar way to Crans' 1-transfors between
strict Gray functors, however being pointed, thus this corresponds to Baues'
homotopy relation between quadratic module maps. Despite the fact that this
homotopy relation between 2-crossed module morphisms is not, in general, an
equivalence relation, we prove that if $A$ and $A'$ are 2-crossed modules, with
the underlying group $F$ of $A$ being free (in short $A$ is free up to order
one), then homotopy between 2-crossed module maps $A \to A'$ yields, in this
case, an equivalence relation. Furthermore, if a chosen basis $B$ is specified
for $F$, then we can define a 2-groupoid $HOM_B(A,A')$ of 2-crossed module maps
$A \to A'$, homotopies connecting them, and 2-fold homotopies between
homotopies, where the latter correspond to (pointed) Crans' 2-transfors between
1-transfors.
  We define a partial resolution $Q^1(A)$, for a 2-crossed module $A$, whose
underlying group is free, with a canonical chosen basis, together with a
projection map ${\rm proj}\colon Q^1(A) \to A$, defining isomorphisms at the
level of 2-crossed module homotopy groups. This resolution (which is part of a
comonad) leads to a weaker notion of homotopy (lax homotopy) between 2-crossed
module maps, which we fully develop and describe. In particular, given
2-crossed modules $A$ and $A'$, there exists a 2-groupoid ${HOM}_{\rm
LAX}(A,A')$ of (strict) 2-crossed module maps $A \to A'$, and their lax
homotopies and lax 2-fold homotopies.
  The associated notion of a (strict) 2-crossed module map $f\colon A \to A'$
to be a lax homotopy equivalence has the two-of-three property, and it is
closed under retracts.

and Bob unwittingly end up with different keys precautions must be taken.
Before running the error correction protocol, Bob and Alice normally sacrifice
some bits to estimate the error rate. To reduce the probability that they end
up with different keys to an acceptable level, we show that a large number of
bits must be sacrificed. Instead, if Alice and Bob can make a good guess about
the error rate before the error correction, they can verify that their keys are
similar after the error correction protocol. This verification can be done by
utilizing properties of Low Density Parity Check codes used in the error
correction. We compare the methods and show that by verification it is often
possible to sacrifice less bits without compromising security. The improvement
is heavily dependent on the error rate and the block length, but for a key
produced by the IdQuantique system Clavis^2, the increase in the key rate is
approximately 5 percent. We also show that for systems with large fluctuations
in the error rate a combination of the two methods is optimal.

larger than 57 degrees. This makes SDSS 1355+0856 one of the shortest period
post-common envelope WD+M dwarf binaries known, and one of only a few where the
primary is likely a He-core white dwarf, which has interesting implications for
our understanding of common envelope evolution and the phenomenology of
cataclysmic variables. The short cooling time of the WD (25 Myr) implies that
the system emerged from the common envelope phase with a period very similar to
what we observe today, and was born in the period gap of cataclysmic variables.

constructed in previous works is investigated. Firstly, it is noted that the
model employed constitutes a generalization of the Hubbard one for the same
system. Thus, the former predictions of the insulator gap, antiferromagnetic
character and the existence of a paramagnetic-pseudogap state, become natural
ones to be expected from this more general picture. The effect of hole doping
on the antiferromagnetic-insulator state (AFI) and the paramagnetic-pseudogap
one, is investigated. The results predict a quantum phase transition (QPT) from
the AFI state at low doping to a paramagnetic-metallic state (PM) at higher
hole densities. Therefore, a clear description of the hidden QPT laying beneath
the dome in high critical temperature superconducting materials is found. At
low doping, the system prefers the AFI state, and at the critical value of the
doping density 0.2, the energy of a metallic state becomes lower. The evolution
with small doping values of the band spectrum of the AFI state, shows that the
holes tend to become localized at the middle of the sides of the reduced
Brillouin zone (BZ). Then, around the critical value, the holes of the AFI
state move to become situated at the corners of the same reduced BZ, showing a
structural change at the phase transition point. Thus, the PM state appearing
at the QPT acquires the same behavior with respect to the position of holes as
the pseudogap state. In the small doping limit a clear difference between the
degree of convergence of the iterative self-consistent solution is associated
to an even or odd number of electrons. It suggests that the Kramers
degeneration in combination with the spin-spatial entangled nature of the hole
states, leads to a new kind of pair interaction between two holes. The binding
energy value is estimated as a function of the screening.

dynamical ejection mediated by gravitational torques, as neutrino-driven winds
and probably also a good fraction of the resulting accretion disc finally
becomes unbound by a combination of viscous and nuclear processes. If compact
binary mergers produce indeed gamma-ray bursts there should also be an
interaction region where an ultra-relativistic outflow interacts with the
neutrino-driven wind and produces moderately relativistic ejecta. Each type of
ejecta has different physical properties and therefore plays a different role
for nucleosynthesis and for the electromagnetic transients that go along with
compact object encounters. Here we focus on the dynamic ejecta and present
results for over 30 hydrodynamical simulations of both gravitational
wave-driven mergers and parabolic encounters as they may occur in globular
clusters. We find that mergers eject $\sim 1$% of a solar mass of extremely
neutron-rich material. The exact amount as well as the ejection velocity
depends on the involved masses with asymmetric systems ejecting more material
at higher velocities. This material undergoes a robust r-process and both
ejecta amount and abundance pattern are consistent with neutron star mergers
being a major source of the ""heavy"" ($A>130$) r-process isotopes. Parabolic
collisions, especially those between neutron stars and black holes, eject
substantially larger amounts of mass and therefore cannot occur frequently
without overproducing galactic r-process matter. We also discuss the
electromagnetic transients that are powered by radioactive decays within the
ejecta (""Macronovae""), and the radio flares that emerge when the ejecta
dissipate their large kinetic energies in the ambient medium.

comprehension of many complex man-made and biological networks. In the central
nervous system, SWN models have been shown to fit well both anatomical and
functional maps at the macroscopic level. However the functional microscopic
level, where the nodes of a network are composed of single neurons, is still
poorly understood. At this level, although recent evidences suggest that
functional connectivity maps exhibit small-world organization, it is not known
whether and how these maps, distributed in multiple brain regions, change
across different conditions. We addressed these questions by simultaneous
multi-array extracellular recordings in three brain regions diversely involved
in somatosensory information processing: the ventropostero-lateral thalamic
nuclei (VPL), the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the centro-median
thalamic nuclei (CM). From both spike and Local Field Potential (LFP)
recordings, we estimated the functional connectivity maps by using the
Normalized Compression Similarity (spikes) and the Phase Synchrony (LFPs).
Then, by using graph-theoretical statistics, we characterized the functional
map topology both during spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. Our main
results show that: (i) spikes and LFPs show SWN organization during spontaneous
activity; (ii) After stimulation onset, while substantial functional map
reconfigurations occur both in spike and LFPs, small-worldness is nonetheless
preserved (iii) The stimulus triggers a significant increase of inter-area LFP
connections without modifying the topology of intra-area functional
connections; (iv) Through computer simulations of the fundamental concept of
cell assemblies, transient groups of activating neurons can be described by
small-world networks.

these operations are slow, and easy to get slightly wrong at small radii. Here
we exploit the realization that these models can be approximated to arbitrary

  Sections 6 and 7 greatly simplified due to referee comments",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We compute the cone of effective divisors on the Hilbert scheme of points in
the projective plane. We show the sections of many stable vector bundles
satisfy a natural interpolation condition, and that these bundles always give
rise to the edge of the effective cone of the Hilbert scheme. To do this, we
give a generalization of Gaeta's theorem on the resolution of the ideal sheaf
of a general collection of points in the plane. This resolution has a natural
interpretation in terms of Bridgeland stability, and we observe that ideal
sheaves of collections of points are destabilized by exceptional bundles. By
studying the Bridgeland stability of exceptional bundles, we also show that our
computation of the effective cone of the Hilbert scheme is consistent with a
conjecture which predicts a correspondence between Mori and Bridgeland walls
for the Hilbert scheme.

the Kolmogorov distance between two cumulative event distribution functions.
The unbinned and non-parametric nature of the test makes it particularly
suitable for searches of statistically limited data sets and we also show that
it performs well in the presence of modest energy resolutions typical of
gamma-ray observations (~20%). We illustrate its potential to set constraints
on quantum-gravity induced Lorentz invariance violation effects from
observations by the current and future generation of ground-based gamma-ray

modes switching according to a white random process is presented. The new
formulation includes a term, in the dynamics equation, that depends on the most
recent linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimate of the state. This
can model the behavior of a feedback control system featuring a state
estimator. The measurement equation is allowed to depend on the previous LMMSE
estimate of the state, which can represent the fact that measurements are
obtained from a validation window centered about the predicted measurement and
not from the entire surveillance region. The LMMSE filter is derived for the
considered problem. The approach is demonstrated in the context of target
tracking in clutter and is shown to be competitive with several popular
nonlinear methods.

  As a corollary, we deduce that the inclusion of the Chern subring in the

the following condition holds: For any homomorphism f between elementary

developed for predicting the near-future churners and win-backs for a telecom
company. On a large-scale and real-world database containing customer profiles
and some transaction data from a telecom company, we first analyzed the data
schema, developed feature computation strategies and then extracted a large set
of relevant features that can be associated with the customer churning and
returning behaviors. Our features include both the original driver factors as
well as some derived features. We evaluated our features on the imbalance
corrected dataset, i.e. under-sampled dataset and compare a large number of
existing machine learning tools, especially decision tree-based classifiers,
for predicting the churners and win-backs. In general, we find RandomForest and
SimpleCart learning algorithms generally perform well and tend to provide us
with highly competitive prediction performance. Among the top-15 driver factors
that signal the churn behavior, we find that the service utilization, e.g. last
two months' download and upload volume, last three months' average upload and
download, and the payment related factors are the most indicative features for
predicting if churn will happen soon. Such features can collectively tell
discrepancies between the service plans, payments and the dynamically changing
utilization needs of the customers. Our proposed features and their
computational strategy exhibit reasonable precision performance to predict
churn behavior in near future.

identified in all 5 optical bands of the deep SDF images. The photometric
redshift of the host yields z~0.6 and the corresponding absolute magnitude at

brighter than -19 mag for approximately 300 d in the rest frame, which is
significantly longer than a typical supernova and ultra-luminous supernova. The
