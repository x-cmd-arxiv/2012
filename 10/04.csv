(2009)[1] are more consistent with those from the \mbh-$\sigma_*$ relation than
those from previous single-epoch mass estimators, using a large sample of AGNs.
Furthermore, we examine the differences between the line widths of \hb and
\mgii in detail by comparing their line profiles. The flux around the line core
and that in the wing of both \hb and \mgii show an opposite variation tendency,
which indicates the BLR is multi-componential. The contribution of the wing
makes the FWHM deviate from $\sigma_{line}$, and thus bias the \mbh estimated
from previous single-epoch mass estimators. Thus the correction on the
formalism suggested by Wang et al. (2009)[1] is crucial to \mbh estimation.

  Constraining the parameters for non convective mixing on the RGB","Accepted for publication in Astron. & Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201220148",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We re-analysed the carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in the atmospheres of
the two bright K giants Arcturus and Aldebaran. Previous determinations of
their 16O/18O ratios showed a rough agreement with FDU expectations; however,
the estimated 16O/17O and 12C/13C ratios were lower than in the canonical
predictions. These anomalies are interpreted as signs of the occurrence of
non-convective mixing episodes. We re-investigated this issue in order to
verify whether the observed data can be reproduced in this hypothesis and if
the well determined properties of the two stars can help us in fixing the
uncertain parameters characterizing non-convective mixing and its physical
nature. We used high-resolution infrared spectra to derive the 12C/13C and
16O/17O/18O ratios from CO molecular lines near 5 mu. We also reconsidered the
determination of the stellar parameters to build the proper atmospheric and
evolutionary models. We found that both the C and the O isotopic ratios for the
two stars considered actually disagree with pure FDU predictions. This
reinforces the idea that non-convective transport episodes occurred in them. By
reproducing the observed elemental and isotopic abundances with the help of
parametric models of nucleosynthesis and mass circulation, we derived
constraints on the properties of non convective mixing. We find that very slow
mixing is incapable of explaining the observed data, which require a fast
transport. Circulation mechanisms with speeds intermediate between those
typical of diffusive and of convective mixing should be at play. We however
conclude with a word of caution on the conclusions possible at this stage, as
the parameters for the mass transport are rather sensitive to the stellar mass
and initial composition.

work investigates the appropriateness of attributes, obtained from empirical
project databases and aims to reduce the cost drivers used while preserving
performance. Finding suitable subset selections that may cater improved

technique employed for cost estimation (filter or wrapper) or an internal
(embedded) step to minimise the fitting error. This paper compares nine
relatively popular feature selection methods and uses the empirical values of

helium white dwarf for which the mass of both stars has been measured. We
confirm that the correlation between the companion mass and the orbital period

0.5Msun in the orbital period range covered by the observations. Moreover, a

1.51 eV for a (8,0) zigzag nanotube to 0.83 eV for a (20,0) zigzag nanotube.
This is in part explained by the transition from sp2 to sp3 bonding occurring
to a carbon atom of a nanotube when a phenyl is grafted to it and the fact that
smaller nanotubes are closer to a sp3 hybridization than larger ones due to
increased curvature. Since a second bromophenyl unit can attach without energy
barrier next to an isolated grafted unit, they are assumed to exist in pairs.
The para configuration is found to be favored for the pairs and their binding
energy decreases with increasing diameter, ranging from 4.34 eV for a (7,0)
nanotube to 2.27 eV for a (29,0) nanotube. An analytic form for this radius
dependence is derived using a tight binding hamiltonian and first order
perturbation theory. The 1/R^2 dependance obtained (where R is the nanotube
radius) is verified by our DFT results within numerical accuracy. Finally,
metallic nanotubes are found to be more reactive than semiconducting nanotubes,
a feature that can be explained by a non-zero density of states at the Fermi
level for metallic nanotubes.

crucial role in the reproductive fitness of various organisms. In addition,
subjective evaluation has also been exploited in Interactive Evolutionary

dynamic interactive evolutionary computation environment, designers are
presented with visualizations of object-oriented software designs, which they
rank according to a subjective assessment of elegance. For three out of the
four elegance measures proposed, it is found that a significant correlation
exists between elegance values and reward elicited. These three elegance
measures assess the evenness of distribution of (a) attributes and methods

node to deliver a rumor to all nodes in an unknown network. Gossip algorithms
allow nodes only to call one neighbor per round and have recently attracted
attention as message efficient, simple and robust solutions to the rumor
spreading problem.
  Recently, non-uniform random gossip schemes were devised to allow efficient
rumor spreading in networks with bottlenecks. In particular, [Censor-Hillel et
al., STOC'12] gave an O(log^3 n) algorithm to solve the 1-local broadcast
problem in which each node wants to exchange rumors locally with its
1-neighborhood. By repeatedly applying this protocol one can solve the global
rumor spreading quickly for all networks with small diameter, independently of
the conductance.
  This and all prior gossip algorithms for the rumor spreading problem have
been inherently randomized in their design and analysis. This resulted in a
parallel research direction trying to reduce and determine the amount of
randomness needed for efficient rumor spreading. This has been done via lower
bounds for restricted models and by designing gossip algorithms with a reduced
need for randomness. The general intuition and consensus of these results has
been that randomization plays a important role in effectively spreading rumors.
  In this paper we improves over this state of the art in several ways by
presenting a deterministic gossip algorithm that solves the the k-local
broadcast problem in 2(k+log n)log n rounds. Besides being the first efficient
deterministic solution to the rumor spreading problem this algorithm is
interesting in many aspects: It is simpler, more natural, more robust and
faster than its randomized pendant and guarantees success with certainty
instead of with high probability. Its analysis is furthermore simple,
self-contained and fundamentally different from prior works.

in the 4.7 - 4.8 MeV excitation region in 30S. Therefore, the abundances of
silicon isotopes synthesized in novae, which are relevant for the
identification of presolar grains of putative nova origin, were uncertain by a
factor of 3. To investigate the level structure of 30S above the proton
threshold (4394.9(7) keV), a charged-particle spectroscopy and an in-beam
gamma-ray spectroscopy experiments were performed. Differential cross sections
of the 32S(p,t)30S reaction were measured at 34.5 MeV. Distorted wave Born
approximation calculations were performed to constrain the spin-parity
assignments of the observed levels. An energy level scheme was deduced from
gamma-gamma coincidence measurements using the 28Si(3He,n-gamma)30S reaction.
Spin-parity assignments based on measurements of gamma-ray angular
distributions and gamma-gamma directional correlation from oriented nuclei were
made for most of the observed levels of 30S. As a result, the resonance

subgraph detection. We exhibit the power of our framework by giving a simple
explicit constructions that reproduce both the $O(n^{35/27})$ and $O(n^{9/7})$
learning graph upper bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for triangle finding,
and discuss how other known upper bounds in the original learning graph
framework can be converted to algorithms in our framework. We hope that the
ease of use of this framework will lead to the discovery of new upper bounds.

given by the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs formula, so the probability is
independent of T (and also of the void shape, as only the volume matters). In
the quenched case, which is intrinsically non-equilibrium, we evaluate the void
formation probability analytically for non-interacting random walkers and probe
it numerically for the simple symmetric exclusion process. For voids that are
small compared with the diffusion length, the equilibrium result for the void
formation probability is recovered. We also re-derive our main results for
non-interacting random walkers from an exact microscopic analysis.

critical transition, such as the eutrophication of a lake, the collapse of a

unfold on temporal and spatial scales that can be difficult to approach by
experimental manipulation, research has often relied on historical observations

between selecting systems for study based on the fact that we have observed a
critical transition and those systems for which we wish to forecast the

systems known to experience a transition of some sort and failing to account
for the bias this introduces -- a statistical error often known as the
Prosecutor's Fallacy. By analysing simulated systems that have experienced

quenched due to the feedback of the nuclear activity. In this paper our goal is
to test this scenario with a resolved stellar population study of the PSQ
J0210-0903, as well as of its emitting gas kinematics and excitation. We have
used optical Integral Field Spectroscopy obtained with the Gemini GMOS
instrument at a velocity resolution of ~120 km/s and spatial resolution of ~0.5
kpc. We find that old stars dominate the luminosity (at 4700 \AA) in the inner
0.3 kpc (radius), while beyond this region (at ~0.8 kpc) the stellar population
is dominated by both intermediate age and young ionizing stars. The gas
emission-line ratios are typical of Seyfert nuclei in the inner 0.3 kpc, where
an outflow is observed. Beyond this region the line ratios are typical of
LINERs and may result from the combination of diluted radiation from the
nucleus and ionization from young stars. The gas kinematics show a combination
of rotation in the plane of the galaxy and outflows, observed with a maximum
blueshift of -670 km/s. We have estimated a mass outflow rate in ionized gas in
the range 0.3--1.1 M_sun/yr and a kinetic power for the outflow of dE/dt ~
1.4--5.0 x 10^40 erg/s ~0.03% - 0.1% x L_bol. This outflow rate is two orders
of magnitude higher than the nuclear accretion rate of ~8.7 x 10^-3 M_sun/yr,
thus being the result of mass loading of the nuclear outflow by circumnuclear
galactic gas. Our observations support an evolutionary scenario in which the
feeding of gas to the nuclear region has triggered a circumnuclear starburst
100's Myr ago, followed by the triggering of the nuclear activity, producing
the observed gas outflow which may have quenched further star formation in the
inner 0.3 kpc.

oscillations are not driven primarily by the periodically-varying large-scale
magnetic torque, as one might have expected, but rather via the magnetic
modulation of angular-momentum transport by the large-scale meridional flow.
This result is confirmed by a straightforward energy analysis. We also detect a
fairly sharp transition in rotational dynamics taking place as one moves from
the base of the convecting layers to the base of the thin tachocline-like shear
layer formed in the stably stratified fluid layers immediately below. We
conclude by discussing the implications of our analyses with regards to the
mechanism of amplitude saturation in the global dynamo operating in the
simulation, and speculate on the possible precursor value of torsional
oscillations for the forecast of solar cycle characteristics.

is a matter of debates. One of the popular hypothesis associates them with
accretion at a sub-Eddington rate on to intermediate mass black holes. Another
possibility is a stellar-mass black hole in a high-mass X-ray binary accreting
at super-Eddington rates. In this paper we find a highly significant
association between brightest X-ray sources in the Antennae galaxies and
stellar clusters. On the other hand, we show that most of the X-ray sources are
located outside of these clusters. We study clusters associated with the ULXs
using the ESO Very Large Telescope spectra and the Hubble Space Telescope data
together with the theoretical evolutionary tracks and determine their ages to
be below 6 Myr. This implies that the ULX progenitor masses certainly exceed 30
and for some objects are closer to 100 solar masses. We also estimate the ages
of clusters situated close to the less luminous X-ray sources (with luminosity
in the range 3x10^38 < L_X < 10^39 erg/s) and find that most of them are
younger than 10 Myr, because they are surrounded by strong H$\alpha$ emission.
These findings are consistent with the idea that majority of ULXs are massive
X-ray binaries that have been ejected in the process of formation of stellar
clusters by a few-body encounters and at the same time rules out the proposal
that most of the ULXs are intermediate mass black holes.

(i) the real energetic E_gamma, obtained by correcting the isotropic equivalent

10^50-10^51 erg and it is correlated with the peak energy E_p of the prompt

incomplete data samples and their observed distributions could be subject to

assumed intrinsic distributions of Gamma_0 and theta_jet can reproduce a set of
observational constraints. Assuming that all bursts have the same E'_p and
E'_gamma in the comoving frame, we find that Gamma_0 and theta_jet cannot be

  accepted version. (Abstract abridged)",,"10.1093/mnras/sts617",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For investigating the relationship between the star formation rate and gas
surface density, we develop a Bayesian linear regression method that rigorously
treats measurement uncertainties and accounts for hierarchical data structure.
The hierarchical method simultaneously estimates the intercept, slope, and
scatter about the regression line of each individual subject and the
population. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that the method recovers
the underlying parameters of both the individuals and the population,
especially when compared to commonly employed ordinary least squares
techniques, such as the bisector fit. We apply the hierarchical method to
estimate the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) parameters of a sample of spiral galaxies
compiled by Bigiel et al. (2008). We find significant variation in the KS
parameters, indicating that no single relationship holds for all galaxies. This
suggests that the relationship between molecular gas and star formation differs
between galaxies, possibly due to the influence of other properties within a
given galaxy, such as metallicity, molecular gas fraction, or stellar mass. In
four galaxies the slope estimates are sub-linear (at the 95% level). We
estimate the mean index of the KS relationship for the population to be 0.84,
with 95% range [0.63, 1.0]. For the galaxies with sub-linear KS relationships,
a possible interpretation is that CO emission is tracing some molecular gas
that is not directly associated with star formation. Equivalently, a sub-linear
KS relationship may be indicative of an increasing gas depletion time at higher
surface densities, as traced by CO emission. The Bayesian method can account
for all sources of uncertainties, including variations in the conversion of
observed intensities to star formation rates and gas surface densities, and is
therefore well suited for a thorough statistical analysis of the KS law.

  We conducted an extensive search for variable stars in the GSEP field leading
to the discovery of 6789 variable stars. In this sample we found 132 classical
Cepheids, 686 RR Lyr type stars, 2819 long-period, and 1377 eclipsing

to distinguish galactic foreground variable stars detected in the GSEP field

very little analytic tools have been developed specifically for the statistical

control criteria to filter unreliable cell measurements. We propose a
statistical model accounting for the fact that genes at the single-cell level

dichotomously off (and the recorded expression is zero). Based on this model,
we derive a combined likelihood-ratio test for differential expression that
incorporates both the discrete and continuous components. Using an experiment
that examines treatment-specific changes in expression, we show that this
combined test is more powerful than either the continuous or dichotomous

for measurements from a specific platform (Fluidigm), these tools are
generalizable to other multi-parametric measures over large numbers of events.

during this cycle and discrete spectral absorption components that were
interpreted as evidence of systemic mass loss. We find that the best fit to the
multi-band light curves requires a circumprimary optically thick disc with a
radius about twice the radius of the more massive star. The spectroscopy
indicates a mass ratio of 0.21+-0.02 and masses for the hot and cool stars of
9.1+-0.5 and 1.9+-0.2 M_sun, respectively. A comparison with synthetic
binary-star evolutionary models indicates that the system has an age of 4.76E7
years, is in the phase of rapid mass transfer, the second one in the life of
this binary, in a Case-B mass-exchange stage. Donor-subtracted H_alpha profiles
show the presence of double emission formed probably in an optically thin
circumstellar medium, while the variable HeI profile and the H_beta absorption
wings are probably formed in the optically thick circumprimary disc. The model
that best fit the observations shows the system with a relatively large mass
transfer rate of dM/dt = 3.1E-6 M_sun/yr. However, the orbital period remains
relatively stable during almost 15 years. This observation suggests that the
hot-spot mass-loss model proposed by other authors is not adequate in this
case, and that some other mechanism is efficiently removing angular momentum
from the binary. Furthermore, our observations suggest that the DPV phenomenon
could have an important effect in the balance of mass and angular momentum in
the system.

longer than the period we previously measured in 1999, which was itself longer
than the period measured in 1988. A nearly linear jet was observed which varied
little during a rotation cycle in both R and CN images acquired during the 1999

throughout the two apparitions and, under the assumption that the source region
of the jet was near the comet's pole, determined a rotational pole direction of
RA/Dec = 151deg/+59deg from CN measurements and RA/Dec = 173deg/+57deg from
dust measurements (we estimate a circular uncertainty of 3deg for CN and 4deg
for dust). Different combinations of effects likely bias both gas and dust
solutions and we elected to average these solutions for a final pole of RA/Dec
= 162 +/- 11deg/+58 +/- 1deg. Photoelectric photometry was acquired in 1983,
1988, 1999/2000, and 2010/2011. The activity exhibited a steep turn-on ~3
months prior to perihelion (the exact timing of which varies) and a relatively
smooth decline after perihelion. The activity during the 1999 and 2010
apparitions was similar; limited data in 1983 and 1988 were systematically
higher and the difference cannot be explained entirely by the smaller
perihelion distance. We measured a ""typical"" composition, in agreement with
previous investigators. Monte Carlo numerical modeling with our pole solution
best replicated the observed coma morphology for a source region located near a
comet latitude of +80deg and having a radius of ~10deg. Our model reproduced
the seasonal changes in activity, suggesting that the majority of Tempel 2's

that disappear in the course of their motion. Our calculation is based on a
fractional reaction-subdiffusion equation derived from a continuous time random
walk model of the system. Contrary to an earlier method valid only in one
dimension (d=1), the equation is applicable in any Euclidean dimension d and
elucidates the interplay between anomalous subdiffusive transport, the
irreversible evanescence reaction and the dimension in which both the traps and
the target are embedded. Explicit results for the survival probability of the
target are obtained for a density \rho(t) of traps which decays (i)
exponentially and (ii) as a power law. In the former case, the target has a
finite asymptotic survival probability in all integer dimensions, whereas in
the latter case there are several regimes where the values of the decay
exponent for \rho(t) and the anomalous diffusion exponent of the traps
determine whether or not the target has a chance of eternal survival in one,
two and three dimensions.

methylation state of the DNA is typically inherited from parent to daughter
cells. While the chemical bond between the methyl group and the DNA is very
strong, changes to the methylation state do occur and are observed to occur
rapidly in response to external stimulus. The loss of methylation can be active
where enzyme physically breaks the bond, or passive where on cell division the
newly constructed strand of DNA is not properly inherited.
  Here we present a mathematical model of single locus passive demethylation
for a dividing population of cells. The model describes the heterogenity in the
population expected from passive mechanisms. We see that even when the site
specific probabilities of passive demethylation are independent, conservation
of methylation on the inherited strand gives rise to site-site correlations of
the methylation state. We then extend the model to incorporate correlations
between sites in the locus for demethylation rates. Biologically, correlations
in demethylation rates might correspond to locus wide changes such as the
inability of methyltransferase to access the locus. We also look at the effects
of selection on the multicellular population.
  The model of passive demethylation not only provides a tool for measurement
of parameters in loci-specific cases where passive demethylation is the
dominant mechanism, but also provides a baseline in the search for active
mechanisms. The model tells us that there are states of methylation
inaccessible by passive mechanisms. Observation of these states constitutes
evidence of active mechanisms, either de novo methylation or enzymatic
demethylation. We also see that selection and passive demethylation combined
can give rise to a stable heterogeneous distribution of gene methylation states
in a population.

The
minimal regulatory designs giving rise to oscillations have been implemented
synthetically and studied by mathematical modeling. However, most of the
available analyses generally neglect the coupling of regulatory circuits with
the cellular ""chassis"" in which the circuits are embedded. For example, the
intracellular macromolecular composition of fast-growing bacteria changes with
growth rate. As a consequence, important parameters of gene expression, such as
ribosome concentration or cell volume, are growth-rate dependent, ultimately
coupling the dynamics of genetic circuits with cell physiology. This work
addresses the effects of growth rate on the dynamics of a paradigmatic example
of genetic oscillator, the repressilator. Making use of empirical growth-rate
dependences of parameters in bacteria, we show that the repressilator dynamics
can switch between oscillations and convergence to a fixed point depending on
the cellular state of growth, and thus on the nutrients it is fed. The physical
support of the circuit (type of plasmid or gene positions on the chromosome)
also plays an important role in determining the oscillation stability and the
growth-rate dependence of period and amplitude. This analysis has potential
application in the field of synthetic biology, and suggests that the coupling
between endogenous genetic oscillators and cell physiology can have substantial
consequences for their functionality.

are observed to undergo irregular, presumably accretion-generated, optical
outbursts that result in a several magnitude rise of the optical flux. EX Lupi
was observed to optically erupt in 2008 January, triggering Chandra ACIS ToO
observations shortly thereafter. We find very strong evidence that most of the
X-ray emission in the first few months after the optical outburst is generated
by accretion of circumstellar material onto the stellar photosphere.
Specifically, we find a strong correlation between the decreasing optical and
X-ray fluxes following the peak of the outburst in the optical, which suggests
that these observed declines in both the optical and X-ray fluxes are the
result of declining accretion rate. In addition, in our models of the X-ray
spectrum, we find strong evidence for a ~0.4 keV plasma component, as expected
for accretion shocks on low-mass, pre-main sequence stars. From 2008 March
through October, this cool plasma component appears to fade as EX Lupi returns
to its quiescent level in the optical, consistent with a decrease in the
overall emission measure of accretion shock-generated plasma. The overall small
increase of the X-ray flux during the optical outburst of EX Lupi is similar to
what was observed in previous X-ray observations of the 2005 optical outburst
of the EX Lupi-type star V1118 Ori but contrasts with the large increase of the

over-densities of X-Ray emission. These results provide evidence that the
baryon fraction exceeds the universal average, which we had initially hoped to
study. We have yet to confirm or deny the existence of clumping in these
regions, which could explain such over-abundance of X-Ray emission. This
project offers a framework of efficient, automated processing techniques to
""clean"" images of noise from the mechanics of the telescope, background
radiation from local sources such as the solar wind, and more distant sources
such as background AGN. The galaxy cluster studied in this project contains
high levels of contamination due to its line-of-sight position close to the
dust- and star-filled arms of the Milky Way galaxy. Rigorous spectral model
fitting of the cluster employ multiple parameters dedicated to accounting for
these contaminations. The framework created from this analysis technique will
provide the opportunity to expand this analysis to any nearby galaxy cluster,
such as the Virgo, Coma, and Ophiuchus Clusters. This research should provide
significant insight into how matter, both baryonic and dark matter, is
distributed throughout diffuse cluster systems, as well as give clues to the

is motivated by the application of controlled source electromagnetic
exploration, where the unknown is the subsurface electrical resistivity and the
data are time resolved surface measurements of the magnetic field. The
algorithm presented in this paper considers inversion in one and two
dimensions. The reduced model is obtained with rational interpolation in the
frequency (Laplace) domain and a rational Krylov subspace projection method. It
amounts to a nonlinear mapping from the function space of the unknown
resistivity to the small dimensional space of the parameters of the reduced
model. We use this mapping as a nonlinear preconditioner for the Gauss-Newton
iterative solution of the inverse problem. The advantage of the inversion
algorithm is twofold. First, the nonlinear preconditioner resolves most of the
nonlinearity of the problem. Thus the iterations are less likely to get stuck
in local minima and the convergence is fast. Second, the inversion is
computationally efficient because it avoids repeated accurate simulations of
the time-domain response. We study the stability of the inversion algorithm for
various rational Krylov subspaces, and assess its performance with numerical
experiments.

on the characteristics of single events [Corral et al Nature Phys 6, 693,

constitutes a natural way to describe each event, and further, that the PDI
statistics yields a robust law for the occurrence of tropical cyclones in terms
of a power law. In this context, methods of fitting these distributions are
discussed. As an important extension to this work we introduce a distribution
function that models the whole range of the PDI density (excluding
incompleteness effects at the smallest values), the gamma distribution,
consisting in a power-law with an exponential decay at the tail. The
characteristic scale of this decay, represented by the cutoff parameter,
provides very valuable information on the finiteness size of the basin, via the
largest values of the PDIs that the basin can sustain. We use the gamma fit to
evaluate the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) on the occurrence of
extreme PDI values, for which we find an increase around 50 % in the values of
these basin-wide events for a 0.49 degC SST average difference. ...

is E(B-V)=0.115+-0.004, in good agreement with previous estimates, but we
evidence a pattern of differential reddening in the cluster area. The stars in
the western half are more reddened than in the southwest quadrant by 0.03-0.04
magnitudes. We find that the helium abundances measured on low-resolution
spectra are systematically lower by ~0.25 dex than the measurements based on
higher resolution. No difference in helium abundance is detected between
OmegaCentauri and three comparison clusters, and the stars in the range
11500-20000K follow a trend with temperature, which probably reflects a
variable efficiency of the diffusion processes. There is mild evidence that two
families of extreme HB (EHB) stars (Teff>20000K) could exist, as observed in
the field, with ~15% of the objects being helium depleted by a factor of ten
with respect to the main population. The distribution of helium abundance above
30000K is bimodal, but we detect a fraction of He-poor objects lower than
previous investigations. The observations are consistent with these being stars
evolving off the HB. Their spatial distribution is not uniform, but this
asymmetric distribution is only marginally significative. We also find that EHB
stars with anomalously high spectroscopic mass could be present in
OmegaCentauri, as previously found in other clusters. The derived
temperature-color relation reveals that stars hotter than 11000K are fainter
than the expectations of the canonical models in the U band, while no anomaly
is detected in B and V. This behavior, not observed in NGC6752, is a new

interactions on a scale rho ~ 0.3 fm, much smaller than the hadronic size R ~ 1
fm. These short-distance interactions influence the intrinsic transverse
momentum distributions of partons and their correlations at a low normalization
point. We study this phenomenon in an effective description of low-energy
dynamics based on chiral constituent quark degrees of freedom, which refers to
the large-N_c limit of QCD. The nucleon is obtained as a system of constituent
quarks and antiquarks moving in a self-consistent classical chiral field
(chiral quark-soliton model). The calculated distributions of constituent
quarks/antiquarks are matched with QCD partons at the scale rho^{-2}. The p_T
distribution of valence quarks is localized at p_T^2 ~ R^{-2} and roughly of
Gaussian shape. The sea quark distribution exhibits a would-be power-like tail
~1/p_T^2 extending up to the chiral symmetry-breaking scale. Such behavior is
seen in the flavor-singlet unpolarized and nonsinglet polarized sea. The
high-momentum tails are the result of short-range correlations between sea
quarks in the nucleon's light-cone wave function, analogous to NN correlations
in nuclei. The nucleon wave function contains correlated pairs of transverse
size rho << R with sigma- and pi-like quantum numbers, whose internal wave
functions become identical at p_T^2 ~ rho^{-2} (restoration of chiral
symmetry). These features are model-independent and represent an effect of
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the nucleon's partonic structure. Our
results have numerous implications for the P_T distributions of particles
produced in hard scattering processes. The nonperturbative parton correlations
predicted here could be observed in particle correlations between the current
and target fragmentation regions of DIS.

scenario for exotic spin liquid phases with deconfined spinons. Doping, i.e.
the introduction of mobile holes, has been considered within the QDM framework
and partially studied. A fundamental issue is the possible existence of a
superconducting phase in such systems and its properties. For this purpose, the
question of the statistics of the mobile holes (or ""holons"") shall be addressed
first. Such issues are studied in details in this paper for generic doped QDM
defined on the most common two-dimensional lattices (square, triangular,
honeycomb, kagome,...) and involving general resonant loops. We prove a general
""statistical transmutation"" symmetry of such doped QDM by using composite
operators of dimers and holes. This exact transformation enables to define
duality equivalence classes (or families) of doped QDM, and provides the
analytic framework to analyze dynamical statistical transmutations. We discuss
various possible superconducting phases of the system. In particular, the
possibility of an exotic superconducting phase originating from the
condensation of (bosonic) charge-e holons is examined. A numerical evidence of
such a superconducting phase is presented in the case of the triangular
lattice, by introducing a novel gauge-invariant holon Green's function. We also
make the connection with a Bose-Hubbard model on the kagome lattice which gives
rise, as an effective model in the limit of strong interactions, to a doped QDM

secure key distribution, random access coding, and randomness generation - in a
scenario where no assumption on the internal working of the devices used in the
protocol is made, except their dimension. These protocols offer two main
advantages: first, their implementation is often less demanding than
fully-device-independent protocols. Second, they are more secure than their
device-dependent counterparts. Their classical analogous is represented by
random access codes, which provide a general framework for describing one-sided
classical communication tasks. We discuss conditions under which detection
inefficiencies can be exploited by a malicious provider to fake the performance
of semi-device-independent quantum and classical protocols - and how to prevent
it.

revealed that coronal spectral line profiles are sometimes asymmetric, with a
faint enhancement in the blue wing on the order of 100 km/s. These asymmetries
could be important since they may be subtle, yet diagnostically useful
signatures of coronal heating or solar wind acceleration processes. It has also
been suggested that they are signatures of chromospheric jets supplying mass
and energy to the corona. Until now, however, there have been no studies of the
physical properties of the plasma producing the asymmetries. Here we identify
regions of asymmetric profiles in the outflows of AR 10978 using an asymmetric
Gaussian function and extract the intensities of the faint component using
multiple Gaussian fits. We then derive the temperature structure and chemical
composition of the plasma producing the asymmetries. We find that the
asymmetries are dependent on temperature, and are clearer and stronger in
coronal lines. The temperature distribution peaks around 1.4-1.8 MK with an
emission measure at least an order of magnitude larger than that at 0.6 MK. The
first ionization potential bias is found to be 3-5, implying that the high
speed component of the outflows may also contribute to the slow speed wind.
Observations and models indicate that it takes time for plasma to evolve to a
coronal composition, suggesting that the material is trapped on closed loops
before escaping, perhaps by interchange reconnection. The results, therefore,
identify the plasma producing the asymmetries as having a coronal origin.

liquid, gas, and plasma. In college, we learned that there are much more than
four states of matter. For example, there are ferromagnetic states as revealed
by the phenomenon of magnetization and superfluid states as defined by the
phenomenon of zero-viscosity. The various phases in our colorful world are so
rich that it is amazing that they can be understood systematically by the
symmetry breaking theory of Landau. In this paper, we will review the progress
in last 20 -- 30 years, during which we discovered that there are even more
interesting phases that are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory. We discuss
new ""topological"" phenomena, such as topological degeneracy, that reveal the
existence of those new phases - topologically ordered phases. Just like
zero-viscosity defines the superfluid order, the new ""topological"" phenomena
define the topological order at macroscopic level. As a new type of order,
topological order requires a new mathematical frame work, such as fusion
category and group cohomology, to describe it. More recently, we find that, at
microscopical level, topological order is due to long-range quantum
entanglements, just like fermion superfluid is due to fermion-pair
condensation. Long-range quantum entanglements lead to many amazing emergent
phenomena, such as fractional quantum numbers, fractional/non-Abelian
statistics, and perfect conducting boundary channels. Long-range quantum
entanglements can even provide a unified origin of light and electrons (or more
generally, gauge interactions and Fermi statistics): light waves (gauge fields)
are fluctuations of long-range entanglements, and electrons (fermions) are
defects of long-range entanglements.

approach to ideal theory. For this we emphasize the order of divisibility in
factorization and use it as a medium for relating algebra to topology 1.
Replacing principal ideals and their intersections by equivalence classes and
their collections respectively, we transform integral divisorial ideals into
B-ideals in order to provide an order-theoretic frame for treating
decomposition dispensing with addition. The idea of a B-ideal is connected
closely with generalized-algebraicty originated from semantics for programme
languages. 2. Since B-ideals constitute a complete lattice, we can utilize the
fact that decomposition, which means that each element can be decomposed into
the join of all elements way-below it, is equivalent to complete
distributivity. B-ideals with decomposition theorems in themselves do not
depend on algebraic structures and can be applied to any poset 3. Closed-set
lattice is cotopology based on multiplication and independent of a partioular
prime in the sense of pointless topology by Ehresmann. It differs from Zariski
topology in using prime-powers rather than primes so that multiplicity in
algebra acquires geometric meaning. 4. Factorial group is also a free module
with multiplication instead of addition. Hence poset-theoretic constructions
have corresponding algebraic analoques. They are introduced based on Noether's
set-theoretic approach but quotient is within like a subset rather than
outside.

system using ab initio and related methods, focusing on the origin and nature
of magnetic ordering and the MIT. The rotation and tilting of OsO6 octahedra in
the GdFeO3 structure result in moderate narrowing the band width of the t_{2g}
manifold, but sufficient to induce flattening of bands and AFM order within the
local spin density approximation (LSDA), where it remains metallic but with a
deep pseudogap. Including on-site Coulomb repulsion U, at U_c ~2 eV a MIT
occurs only in the AFM state. Effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the band
structure seem minor as expected for a half-filled $t_{2g}^{3}$ shell, but SOC
doubles the critical value U_c necessary to open a gap and also leads to large
magnetocrystalline energy differences in spite of normal orbital moments no
greater than 0.1$\mu_B$. Our results are consistent with a Slater MIT driven by
magnetic order, induced by a combination of structurally-induced band narrowing
and moderate Coulomb repulsion, with SOC necessary for a full picture. Strong
p-d hybridization reduces the moment, and when bootstrapped by the reduced
Hund's rule coupling (proportional to the moment) gives a calculated moment of
~1 $\mu_B$, consistent with the observed moment and only a third of the formal
$d^3$ value. We raise and discuss one important question: since this AFM
ordering is at q=0 (in the 20 atom cell) where nesting is a moot issue, what is

In the parent compound EuCoO3, the low spin (LS)-high spin (HS) transition
takes place at temperatures so high that the chemical decomposition prevents
its direct observation. The substitution of Eu3+ for Ca2+ in this system shifts
the LS-HS transition to lower temperatures. The energy gap associated with this

octahedral to pyramidal thereby locally creating magnetically active sites

generically close. We then study minimum entangling power with respect to other

an intrinsically fault-tolerant entangling device that will always transform

radio-loud AGNs that considers radio galaxies as non-beamed parent populations
of blazars. Five of the six NLS1s have (i) extended radio luminosities
suggesting jet kinetic powers of >~10^44 erg/s, which is sufficient to make
jets escape from hosts' dense environments, (ii) black holes of >~10^7 solar
mass, which can generate the necessary jet powers from near-Eddington mass
accretion, and (iii) two-sided radio structures at kpc scales, requiring
expansion rates of ~0.01c--0.3c and kinematic ages of >~10^7 years. On the
other hand, most typical NLS1s would be driven by black holes of <~10^7 solar

may originate in a small window of opportunity during the final stage of the
NLS1 phase just before growing into broad-line AGNs.

a better representation by integrating these two models together. To this end,
this paper proposes a novel coding algorithm, called Locality-Constrained
Collaborative Representation (LCCR), which improves the robustness and
discrimination of data representation by introducing a kind of local
consistency. The locality term derives from a biologic observation that the
similar inputs have similar code. The objective function of LCCR has an
analytical solution, and it does not involve local minima. The empirical
studies based on four public facial databases, ORL, AR, Extended Yale B, and
Multiple PIE, show that LCCR is promising in recognizing human faces from
frontal views with varying expression and illumination, as well as various
corruptions and occlusions.

  Meta-Mining",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The notion of meta-mining has appeared recently and extends the traditional
meta-learning in two ways. First it does not learn meta-models that provide
support only for the learning algorithm selection task but ones that support
the whole data-mining process. In addition it abandons the so called black-box
approach to algorithm description followed in meta-learning. Now in addition to
the datasets, algorithms also have descriptors, workflows as well. For the
latter two these descriptions are semantic, describing properties of the
algorithms. With the availability of descriptors both for datasets and data
mining workflows the traditional modelling techniques followed in
meta-learning, typically based on classification and regression algorithms, are
no longer appropriate. Instead we are faced with a problem the nature of which
is much more similar to the problems that appear in recommendation systems. The
most important meta-mining requirements are that suggestions should use only
datasets and workflows descriptors and the cold-start problem, e.g. providing
workflow suggestions for new datasets.
  In this paper we take a different view on the meta-mining modelling problem
and treat it as a recommender problem. In order to account for the meta-mining
specificities we derive a novel metric-based-learning recommender approach. Our
method learns two homogeneous metrics, one in the dataset and one in the
workflow space, and a heterogeneous one in the dataset-workflow space. All
learned metrics reflect similarities established from the dataset-workflow
preference matrix. We demonstrate our method on meta-mining over biological
(microarray datasets) problems. The application of our method is not limited to
the meta-mining problem, its formulations is general enough so that it can be
applied on problems with similar requirements.

used to improve the performance of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) by (in
effect) adjusting the sample covariances of the estimates in the state space.
In this work an additional auxiliary technique, called residual nudging, is
proposed to monitor and, if necessary, adjust the residual norms of state
estimates in the observation space. In an EnKF with residual nudging, if the
residual norm of an analysis is larger than a pre-specified value, then the
analysis is replaced by a new one whose residual norm is no larger than a
pre-specified value. Otherwise the analysis is considered as a reasonable
estimate and no change is made. A rule for choosing the pre-specified value is
suggested. Based on this rule, the corresponding new state estimates are
explicitly derived in case of linear observations. Numerical experiments in the
40-dimensional Lorenz 96 model show that introducing residual nudging to an
EnKF may improve its accuracy and/or enhance its stability against filter
divergence, especially in the small ensemble scenario.

calculations at low P\'eclet number (Pe) on the advection-diffusion problem for
the nutrients. We show that the mean rate of feeding as well as its
fluctuations in time depend only on the swimming modes of the squirmer up to
order Pe^(3/2), even when no swimming occurs on average, while the influence of
non-swimming modes comes in only at order Pe^2. We also show that generically
we expect a phase delay between feeding and swimming of 1/8th of a period.
Numerical computations for illustrative strokes at finite Pe confirm
quantitatively our analytical results linking swimming and feeding. We finally
derive, and use, an adjoint-based optimization algorithm to determine the
optimal unsteady strokes maximizing feeding rate for a fixed energy budget. The
overall optimal feeder is always the optimal steady swimmer. Within the set of
time-periodic strokes, the optimal feeding strokes are found to be equivalent
to those optimizing periodic swimming for all values of the P\'eclet number,

We find that there is a critical value of the orbital eccentricity below which
all the stellar debris remains bound to the black hole. For high but
sub-critical eccentricities, all the stellar mass is accreted onto the black
hole in a finite time, causing a significant deviation from the canonical
$t^{-5/3}$ mass fallback rate. When a star is on a moderately eccentric orbit
and its pericenter distance is deeply inside the tidal disruption radius, there
can be several orbit crossings of the debris streams due to relativistic
precession. This dissipates orbital energy in shocks, allowing for rapid
circularization of the debris streams and formation of an accretion disk. The
resultant accretion rate greatly exceeds the Eddington rate and differs
strongly from the canonical rate of $t^{-5/3}$. By contrast, there is little
dissipation due to orbital crossings for the equivalent simulation with a
purely Newtonian potential. This shows that general relativistic precession is
crucial for accretion disk formation via circularization of stellar debris from
stars on moderately eccentric orbits.

On the base of ab-initio band structure calculations and an analysis of various

tendency as originating from a competition between antiferromagnetic direct
nearest-neighbor d-d exchange and ferromagnetic superexchange via S p states
which leads to the change of the sign of the nearest neighbor interaction
depending on the radius of a M ion. It is shown that other important

exchange. We suggest that strong magneto-elastic coupling is most probably

constitutes the prototype model of a correlated charge fluctuating quantum dot.
The two reservoirs are held at different chemical potentials---the difference
being the bias voltage---and different temperatures; we discuss the transport
through as well as the occupancy of the single level dot. First, we show
analytically that in the steady state the reservoir temperatures in competition
with the other energy scales act as infrared cutoffs. This is rather intuitive
but, depending on the parameter regime under consideration, leads to a
surprisingly rich variety of power laws in the current as a function of the
temperatures and the bias voltage with different interaction dependent
exponents. Next we clarify how finite reservoir temperatures affect the
dynamics. They allow to tune the interplay of the two frequencies
characterizing the oscillatory part of the time evolution of the model at zero
temperature. For the exponentially decaying part we disentangle the
contributions of the level-lead hybridization and the temperatures to the decay
rates. We identify a coherent-to-incoherent transition in the long time
dynamics as the temperature is raised. It occurs at an interaction dependent
critical temperature. Finally, taking different temperatures in the reservoirs
we discuss the relaxation dynamics of a temperature gradient driven current.

which harbours a supermassive black hole of mass 6.4x10^9 M_sun, whose activity
is responsible for the extended (80 kpc) radio lobes that surround the galaxy.
The energy generated by matter falling onto the central black hole is ejected
and transferred to the intra-cluster medium via a relativistic jet and
morphologically complex systems of buoyant bubbles, which rise towards the
edges of the extended halo. Here we present the first observations made with
the new Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) of M87 at frequencies down to 20 MHz.
Images of M87 were produced at low radio frequencies never explored before at
these high spatial resolution and dynamic range. To disentangle different
synchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age and
energetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of M87 extended
radio-halo using these observations together with archival data. We do not find
any sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears well
confined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium. A continuous
injection of relativistic electrons is the model that best fits our data, and
provides a scenario in which the lobes are still supplied by fresh relativistic
particles from the active galactic nuclei. We suggest that the discrepancy
between the low-frequency radio-spectral slope in the core and in the halo
implies a strong adiabatic expansion of the plasma as soon as it leaves the
core area. The extended halo has an equipartition magnetic field strength of
~10 uG, which increases to ~13 uG in the zones where the particle flows are
more active. The continuous injection model for synchrotron ageing provides an
age for the halo of ~40 Myr, which in turn provides a jet kinetic power of
6-10x10^44 erg/s.

constellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), and associated
with the energetic Vela pulsar (PSR B0833-45). Extended very-high-energy (VHE)
$\gamma$-ray emission (HESS $\mathrm{J0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered using
the H.E.S.S. experiment in 2004. The VHE $\gamma$-ray emission was found to be
coincident with a region of X-ray emission discovered with ${\it ROSAT}$ above
1.5 keV (the so-called \textit{Vela X cocoon}): a filamentary structure
extending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of Vela X. A deeper
observation of the entire Vela X nebula region, also including larger offsets
from the cocoon, has been performed with H.E.S.S. This re-observation was
carried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from the
Vela X region at TeV energies and to investigate its spectral properties. In
order to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from the
very extended Vela X region, a multivariate analysis method combining three
complementary reconstruction techniques of Cherenkov-shower images is applied
for the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. The analysis is performed with the
On/Off background method, which estimates the background from separate
observations pointing away from Vela X; towards regions free of $\gamma$-ray
sources but with comparable observation conditions. The $\gamma$-ray surface
brightness over the large Vela X region reveals that the detection of
non-thermal VHE $\gamma$-ray emission from the PWN HESS $\mathrm{J0835\mhyphen
455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ around

(GC) Terzan 5, extending out to ~2.5' from the cluster centre. This emission
may arise from synchrotron radiation (SR) by energetic leptons being injected
into the cluster by the resident millisecond pulsar (MSP) population that
interact with the cluster field. These leptons may also be reaccelerated in
shocks created by collisions of pulsar winds, and may interact with bright
starlight and cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, yielding gamma rays at
very high energies (VHE) through the inverse Compton (IC) process. In the GeV
range, Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has detected a population of GCs, very
plausibly including Terzan 5, their spectral properties and energetics being
consistent with cumulative magnetospheric emission from a population of MSPs.
H.E.S.S. has furthermore detected a VHE excess in the direction of Terzan 5.
One may derive constraints on the number of MSPs, N_tot, and the radial
profiles of the GC B-field, stellar energy density, as well as the diffusion
coefficient using the spatially-resolved X-ray, high-energy (HE), and VHE
fluxes. If the Fermi LAT flux is due to magnetospheric processes, it will scale
with the number of visible gamma-ray MSPs, N_vis. The HE spectrum therefore
provides an independent way of constraining the number of MSPs (since N_tot >=
N_vis). Consequently, the synthesis of available multiwavelength data presents
a unique opportunity to constrain several parameters of the GC Terzan 5.

\gamma' precipitates in an fcc Co \gamma matrix, analogous to Ni3Al in Ni-based
systems. Unlike Ni3Al however, experimental observations of Co3(Al,W) suggest
that it is not a stable phase at 1173K. Here, we perform an extensive series of
density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the \gamma' Co3(Al,W) phase
stability, including point defect energetics and finite-temperature
contributions. We first confirm and extend previous DFT calculations of the
metastability of L12 Co3(Al0.5W0.5) \gamma' at 0K with respect to HCP Co, B2
CoAl, and D019 Co3W using the special quasi-random structure (SQS) approach to
describe the Al/W solid solution, employing several exchange/correlation
functionals, structures with varying degrees of disorder, and newly developed
larger SQS. We expand the validity of this conclusion by considering the
formation of antisite and vacancy point defects, predicting defect formation
energies similar in magnitude to Ni3Al. However, in contrast to the Ni3Al
system, we find that substituting Co on Al sites is thermodynamically favorable
at 0K, consistent with experimental observation of Co excess and Al deficiency
in \gamma' with respect to the Co3(Al0.5W0.5) composition. Lastly, we consider
vibrational, electronic, and magnetic contributions to the free energy, finding
that they promote the stability of \gamma', making the phase thermodynamically
competitive with the convex hull at elevated temperature. Surprisingly, this is
due to the relatively small finite-temperature contributions of one of the
\gamma' decomposition products, B2 CoAl, effectively destabilizing the Co,
CoAl, and Co3W three phase mixture, thus stabilizing the \gamma' phase.

study the morphological structures of the shock patterns, the statistical
properties of shocked cells, and the correlations between the cosmological
shock waves appearing at different scales and the properties of the haloes
harbouring them. The shocks in the simulation can be split into two broad
classes: internal weak shocks related with evolutionary events within haloes,
and external strong shocks associated with large-scale events. The shock
distribution function contains information on the abundances and strength of
the different shocks, and it can be fitted by a double power law with a break
in the slope around a Mach number of 20. We introduce a generalised scaling
relation that correlates the average Mach numbers within the virial radius of
haloes and their virial masses. In this plane, haloes occupy different areas
according to their early evolutionary histories: those with a quiet evolution
have an almost constant Mach number independently of their masses, whereas
haloes undergoing significant merger events very early in their evolution show
a linear dependence with their masses. At high redshift, the halo distribution
in this scaling relation forms a L-like pattern that changes due to the
evolution of the haloes. The analysis of the propagation speed and size of the
shock waves around haloes could give some hints on the formation time and main

intra-component interactions for both components is considered. Due to the
existence of inter-component interaction, there appear several quantum phases,
such as the superfluid, paired superfluid, and counterflow superfluid phases.
We find that the transition from superfluid (SF) to Mott insulator (MI) with
even filling factors can be of the first order for a wide range of the chemical
potential. We calculate the excitation spectra as a useful probe to identify
the quantum phases and the SF-to-MI transitions. In the excitation spectra of
the SF phase, there are two gapless modes and a few gapful modes, which
respectively correspond to phase and amplitude fluctuations of the order
parameters. At the SF-to-MI transition point, we show that the energy gaps of
certain amplitude modes reach zero for the second-order transition while they
remain finite for the first-order one. Since the excitation spectrum can be
measured by the Bragg scattering, we calculate the dynamical structure factor
by using the linear response theory. We consider three types of density
fluctuations, and show that the density fluctuations are coupled to different
excitation branches in different quantum phases.

time scales. Especially rapid flares with flux doubling time scales of the
order of minutes have been puzzling for quite some time. Many modeling attempts
use the well known linear relations for the cooling and emission processes in
the jet in a steady-state scenario, albeit the obvious strongly time-dependent
nature of flares. Due to the feedback of self-produced radiation with
additional scattering by relativistic electrons, the synchrotron-self Compton
(SSC) effect is inherently time-dependent. Although this feedback is usually
implemented in numerical treatments, only recently an analytical analysis of
the effects of this nonlinear behaviour has been performed. Here, we report our
results concerning the effect of the time-dependent SSC on the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of blazars. We calculated analytically the synchrotron and
the SSC component, giving remarkably different spectral features compared to
the standard linear approach. Adding an external photon field to the original
setting, we could implement quite easily the effect of an additional external
Compton (EC) cooling, since such strong external photon fields are observed in
flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ), a subclass of blazars. Calculating the
resulting flux due to the EC cooling, we were able to show that the resulting
inverse Compton component strongly depends on the free parameters, and that SSC
could potentially have a strong effect in FSRQs, contrary to what is usually
assumed.

demonstrate, using ab initio density functional calculations, that the
stabilization of a high spin state of an iron porphyrin (FeP) molecule can be

the substrate increases Fe-N bond lengths in FeP and hence a switching to a
high spin state (S=2) from a low spin state (S=1) is achieved. A ferromagnetic
exchange interaction is established through a direct exchange between Fe and
substrate magnetic atoms as well as through an indirect exchange via the N
atoms in FeP. The mechanism of exchange interaction is further analyzed by
considering structural models constructed from ab initio calculations. Finally,
we illustrate the possibility of detecting a change in the molecular spin state

the discovery of several unidentified or ""dark"" sources in the TeV gamma-ray
band without X-ray counterparts; and it is also finding confirmation in the
recent discoveries at GeV gamma rays. Moreover, these consequences could be

assuming only the electron beam to be transversely polarized, which is

axial-vector ($A$) type interactions. We then consider new physics of general

discuss implications with longitudinal polarization as well. The generalized

on the interactions for the generalized spin bases with realistic integrated

the requirement of existence of a solution, i.e. the absence of a nonintegrable

the critical point at which a transition to a different flow regime takes

relative to radial distance (in metre). The minimum average power density from
individual base station in the town was about 47uW/sq m while the average
maximum was about 1.5mW/sq m. Our result showed that average power density of a
base station decreased with increase in distance (away from base station) and
that radiation intensity varies from one base station to another even at the
same distance away. Our result (obtained signature of power density variation
from data) was also compared the with an 'expected' signature. It was found
that radiation from external sources (indicative) interfered with the reference
base station and accounted for the deviation observed in this study. Finally,

mechanical model is used in which magnetic particles are arranged on the sites

close-packed lattices. By this we extend our previous approach [Ivaneyko D. et
al., Macromolecular Theory and Simulations, 2011, 20, 411] which used only a
simple cubic lattice for describing the spatial distribution of the particles.
The magneto-induced deformation and the Young's modulus of MSEs are calculated
as functions of the strength of the external magnetic field. We show that the
magneto-mechanical behaviour of MSEs is very sensitive to the spatial
distribution of the magnetic particles. MSEs can demonstrate either uniaxial
expansion or contraction along the magnetic field and the Young's modulus can
be an increasing or decreasing function of the strength of the magnetic field
depending on the spatial distribution of the magnetic particles.

ultracompact minihalos must be constrained. On the other hand, the formation of
these objects has very tight relation with the primordial curvature
perturbations on smaller scale, so the fraction of ultracompact minihalos is
very important for modern cosmology. In previous works, the studies are focused
on the dark matter annihilation for these objects. But if the dark matter is
not annihilated, the dark matter decay is another important possible case. On
the other hand, the abundance of ultracompact minihalos is related to many
other parameters, such as the mass of dark matter, the decay channels and the
density profile of dark matter halo. One of the important aspects of this work
is that we investigate the $\gamma$-ray signals from nearby ultracompact
minihalos due to dark matter decay and another important aspect is to study in
detail how the different decay channels and density profiles affect the
constraints on the abundance of ultracompact minihalos.

about 8 Msun. Because of the young age of the progenitors, the ejecta may
eventually interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM) via highly energetic
processes detectable in the radio, X-ray, ultraviolet (UV) and, sometimes, in
the optical domains. In this paper we present ultraviolet, optical and near
infrared observations of five type II SNe, namely SNe 2009dd, 2007pk, 2010aj,
1995ad, and 1996W. Together with few other SNe they form a group of moderately
luminous type II events. We collected photometry and spectroscopy with several
telescopes in order to construct well-sampled light curves and spectral
evolutions from the photospheric to the nebular phases. Both photometry and
spectroscopy indicate a degree of heterogeneity in this sample. The light
curves have luminous peak magnitudes ($-16.95<M_{B}<-18.70$). The ejected
masses of ^56\ni for three SNe span a wide range of values
($2.8\times10^{-2}$Msun$<$M(\ni)$<1.4\times10^{-1}$Msun), while for a fourth
(SN2010aj) we could determine a stringent upper limit ($7\times10^{-3}$Msun).
Clues of interaction, such as the presence of high velocity (HV) features of
the Balmer lines, are visible in the photospheric spectra of SNe 2009dd and
1996W. For SN2007pk we observe a spectral transition from a type IIn to a
standard type II SN. Modelling the observations of SNe 2009dd, 2010aj and
1995ad with radiation hydrodynamics codes, we infer kinetic plus thermal
energies of about 0.2-0.5 foe, initial radii of 2-5$\times10^{13}$ cm and
ejected masses of $\sim$5.0-9.5 Msun. These values suggest moderate-mass,
super-asymptotic giant branch (SAGB) or red super-giants (RSG) stars as SN
precursors, in analogy with other luminous type IIP SNe 2007od and 2009bw.

planets from Venus to Saturn. Due to close encounters, some of them achieve
high inclinations and eccentricities which, in turn, lead to relatively high
velocity impacts on Venus, Earth, and Mars. We statistically analyze all close

on how the presence of defects and temperature change the average properties of

friction force of the system when defects are considered. As expected, defects
change locally the potential profile and thus affect the friction force. But
the presence of defects also changes the probability distribution function of
the tip slip length and thus the mean friction force. We corroborated both
effects for different values of temperature, external load, dragging velocity
and damping. We show also a comparison of the effects of surface defects and
surface disorder on the dynamics of the system.

recently observed for nematic liquid crystal (LC) EBBA doped by multi-walled

reorientation of LC in an electric field. This feature is explained by
electro-hydrodynamically stimulated dispergation of MWCNTs in LC and by the
formation of a percolation MWCNT network which acts as a spatially distributed
surface stabilizing the planar state of the LC. This mechanism is confirmed by
the absence of memory in the EBBA/MWCNT composites, whose original structure is
fixed by a polymer. The observed effect suggests new operation modes for the

derived from long-term observations of the relative sunspot number and
microwave emission at frequency of 2.80 GHz. A series of solar quasi-periodic
cycles with multi-timescales are registered. These cycles can be classified
into 3 classes: (1) strong PLC (PLC is defined as the solar cycle with a period
very close to the ones of some planetary motions, named as planetary-like
cycle) which is related strongly with planetary motions, including 9 periodic
modes with relatively short period (P<12 yr), and related to the motions of the
inner planets and of Jupiter; (2) weak PLC, which is related weakly to
planetary motions, including 2 periodic modes with relatively long period (P>12
yr), and possibly related to the motions of outer planets; (3) non-PLC, which
so far has no obvious evidence to show the relationship with any planetary
motions. Among planets, Jupiter plays a key role in most periodic modes by its
sidereal motion or spring tidal motions with other planets. Among planetary
motions, the spring tidal motion of the inner planets and of Jupiter dominates
the formation of most PLCs. The relationships between multi-timescale solar
periodic modes and the planetary motions will help us to understand the
essential natures and prediction of solar activities.

geometry. It can in particular be used to decide whether a system of n
homogeneous equations in n variables is satisfiable (the resultant is a
polynomial in the system's coefficients which vanishes if and only if the
system is satisfiable). In this paper, we investigate the complexity of
computing the multivariate resultant.
  First, we study the complexity of testing the multivariate resultant for
zero. Our main result is that this problem is NP-hard under deterministic
reductions in any characteristic, for systems of low-degree polynomials with
coefficients in the ground field (rather than in an extension). In
characteristic zero, we observe that this problem is in the Arthur-Merlin class
AM if the generalized Riemann hypothesis holds true, while the best known upper
bound in positive characteristic remains PSPACE.
  Second, we study the classical algorithms to compute the resultant. They
usually rely on the computation of the determinant of an exponential-size
matrix, known as Macaulay matrix. We show that this matrix belongs to a class
of succinctly representable matrices, for which testing the determinant for
zero is proved PSPACE-complete. This means that improving Canny's PSPACE upper
bound requires either to look at the fine structure of the Macaulay matrix to
find an ad hoc algorithm for computing its determinant, or to use altogether
different techniques.

real-time allocation and pricing decisions as the supply of the good arrives in
an online manner, without knowing the entire supply in advance. These
allocation and pricing decisions get complicated when buyers have some global
constraints. In this work, we consider a multi-unit model where buyers have
global {\em budget} constraints, and the supply arrives in an online manner.
Our main contribution is to show that for this setting there is an
individually-rational, incentive-compatible and Pareto-optimal auction that
allocates these units and calculates prices on the fly, without knowledge of
the total supply. We do so by showing that the Adaptive Clinching Auction
satisfies a {\em supply-monotonicity} property.
  We also analyze and discuss, using examples, how the insights gained by the
allocation and payment rule can be applied to design better ad allocation
heuristics in practice. Finally, while our main technical result concerns
multi-unit supply, we propose a formal model of online supply that captures
scenarios beyond multi-unit supply and has applications to sponsored search. We
conjecture that our results for multi-unit auctions can be extended to these
more general models.

not well understood. There is no evidence for active accretion disks in PNe
making it difficult to decide which of several proposed jet formation scenarios
may be correct. A handful of wide binary central stars of PNe are known to have
accreted carbon and slow neutron capture (s-process) enhanced material, the
immediate progenitors of barium stars, however no close binary analogues are
known to have passed through a common-envelope (CE) phase. Here we present
spectroscopy of The Necklace taken near lightcurve minimum that for the first
time reveals a carbon-rich (C/O > 1) companion, a carbon dwarf, in a post-CE
central star. As unevolved stars do not produce carbon, the chemical
enhancement of the secondary can only be explained by accretion from the
primary. Accretion most likely happened prior to the CE phase via wind
accretion as not enough material can be accreted during the short CE phase. The
pair of jets in The Necklace, which are observed to be older than the PN, are
therefore likely to have been launched from an accretion disk around the
companion during this early accretion phase. This discovery adds significant
weight to the emerging scenario that jets in post-CE PNe are primarily launched
by an accretion disk around a main-sequence companion before the CE phase.

measuring the NaI and CO (and Halpha kinematics from a previous study) at the

been able to make meaningful comparisons between the ionized, neutral and

We interpret this as originating in counter-rotating or perhaps inflowing

with kinematics consistent with that of Halpha. On the northern side, the CO
kinematics appear to trace more static clouds in the inner halo that could be
pre-existing or tidal in origin. We find no evidence that NaI absorption is
kinematically associated with the outflow. We conclude that a combination of
lack of velocity resolution and confusion of due to the high inclination of the
system is acting to prevent detection. Thus, in the search for neutral outflows
from galaxies, the signature high velocity components may easily be missed in
observations at low spectral resolution and/or sensitivity, and particularly so

different energy dependences in their lag spectra. We also find evidence for a
signature from the broad Fe K line in the high frequency lag spectrum. We use
Monte Carlo simulations to show how the lag and coherence measurements respond
to the addition of Poisson noise and to dilution by other components. With our
better understanding of these effects on the lag, we show that the lag-energy
spectra can be modelled with a scenario in which low frequency hard lags are
produced by a compact corona responding to accretion rate fluctuations
propagating through an optically thick accretion disc, and the high frequency
soft lags are produced by short light-travel delay associated with reflection
of coronal power-law photons off the disc.

function of fermion-boson coupling strength. As an application we calculate the
drag force which is exerted by the BEC on the impurity moving with constant

effects in quasi 1D quantum wire models. Such models get characterized by equal
coupling strength superpositions of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
interactions of dimensionless magnitude $a$ under the influence of in-plane
magnetic fields of magnitude $B$. Besides the wavenumber $k$ relying on the 1D
electron, one accounts for the $s=\pm $ 1 - factors in the front of the square
root term of the energy. Electronic structure properties of quasi 1D
semiconductor heterostructures like InAs quantum wires can then be readily
discussed. Indeed, resorting to the 2D rotation matrix provided by competing
displacements working along the Ox-axis opens the way to derive precession
angles one looks for, as shown recently. Proceeding further, we have to resort
reasonably to some extra conditions concerning the general selection of the
$k$-wavenumber via $kL=1$, where $L$ stands for the nanometer length scale of
the quantum wire. We shall also account for rescaled wavenumbers, which opens
the way to extrapolations towards imaginary and complex realizations. The
parameter dependence of the precession angles is characterized, in general, by
interplays between admissible and forbidden regions, but large monotony
intervals are also in order.

generate pairs of precoders and pilot sequences that are Pareto optimal in the

symbolic data into numerical data using 23 popular encodings and then apply
popular transformations such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) etc. and export
it. The ability of exporting (both encoding files and transform files) as a
MATLAB .m file gives the user an option to apply variety of techniques of DSP.
User can also do window analysis (both sliding in forward and backward
directions and stagnant) with different size windows and search for meaningful
spectral pattern with the help of exported MATLAB file in a dynamic manner by
choosing time delay in the plot using Biospectrogram. Random encodings and user
choice encoding allows software to search for many possibilities in spectral

two-parton correlations in the proton, that cannot be disentangled with 4-jet
measurements in proton-proton collisions alone. To this end, we analyze in
detail the structure of 2GPDs in the nucleus (A), we calculate in the
independent nucleon approximation all contributions to the double hard four-jet
cross section in pA, and we determine corrections arising from the nuclear
dependence of single parton distribution functions. We then outline an

All three of these are motivated by the physics of triaxial rather than
spherical collapse. A comparison of the resulting mass function with N-body

motivated by the physics of spherical collapse, leads to many more massive
halos than seen in simulations. The same model is also in excellent agreement
with N-body results for the linear halo bias, especially at the high mass end
where the traditional peak-background split argument applied to the mass
function fit is known to underpredict the measured bias by ~10%. In the

of the computation has no need for data communications. Given the Dirichlet
data of the solution on a domain boundary, a local boundary integral equation
(BIE) will be established over the boundary of a local region formed by a

Dirichlet Green's function for the whole sphere, the resulting BIE will involve
only Dirichlet data (solution value) over the hemisphere surface, but over the

result, a local method of finding the DtN mapping is obtained, which can be
used to find all the Neumann data on the whole domain boundary in a parallel

an integral representation using both the Dirichlet and Neumann data over the

cosmic-ray driven electron-induced reaction (CRE) mechanism of
halogen-containing molecules for the ozone hole. And observed spatial and time
correlations between polar ozone loss or stratospheric cooling and cosmic rays
have shown strong evidence of the CRE mechanism [Q.-B. Lu, Phys. Rep. 487,
141-167(2010)]. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were also long-known greenhouse
gases but were thought to play only a minor role in climate change. However,
recent observations have shown evidence of the saturation in greenhouse effect
of non-CFC gases. A new evaluation has shown that halocarbons alone (mainly
CFCs) could account for the rise of 0.5~0.6 deg C in global surface temperature
since 1950, leading to the striking conclusion that not CO2 but CFCs were the
major culprit for global warming in the late half of the 20th century [Q.-B.
Lu, J. Cosmology 8, 1846-1862(2010)]. Surprizingly, a recent paper [J.-W.
Grooss and R. Muller, Atmos. Environ. 45, 3508-3514(2011)] has criticized these
new findings by presenting ""ACE-FTS satellite data"". Here, I show that there
exist serious problems with such ""ACE-FTS satellite data"" because the satellite
has essentially not covered the Antarctic vortex in the presented months
(especially winter months during which most effective CRE reactions are
expected) and that the criticisms do not agree with the scientific facts in the
literature. Instead, real data from multiple satellites provide strong evidence
of the CRE mechanism. So far, the CRE mechanism is the only one that reproduces

formation and growth of early clusters in quenched/aged dilute binary alloys, a
phenomenon typically outside the scope of molecular dynamics time scales. We
show that formation of early sub-critical clusters is triggered by the stress
relaxation effect of quenched-in defects, such as dislocations, on the energy
barrier and the critical size for nucleation. In particular, through analysis
of system energetics, we demonstrate that the growth of sub-critical clusters
into overcritical sizes occurs due to the fact that highly strained areas in
the lattice locally reduce or even eliminate the free energy barrier for a
first-order transition.

  It turns out that all $p_T$-distributions and the mass spectrum obtained in
