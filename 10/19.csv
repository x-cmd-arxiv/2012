Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III.
The catalog includes all BOSS objects that were targeted as quasar candidates
during the survey, are spectrocopically confirmed as quasars via visual
inspection, have luminosities Mi[z=2]<-20.5 (in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with
H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_{\rm M}$ = 0.3, and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ = 0.7) and
either display at least one emission line with full width at half maximum
(FWHM) larger than 500 km/s or, if not, have interesting/complex absorption
features. It includes as well, known quasars (mostly from SDSS-I and II) that
were reobserved by BOSS. This catalog contains 87,822 quasars (78,086 are new
discoveries) detected over 3,275 deg$^{2}$ with robust identification and
redshift measured by a combination of principal component eigenspectra newly
derived from a training set of 8,632 spectra from SDSS-DR7. The number of
quasars with $z>2.15$ (61,931) is ~2.8 times larger than the number of z>2.15
quasars previously known. Redshifts and FWHMs are provided for the strongest
emission lines (CIV, CIII], MgII). The catalog identifies 7,533 broad
absorption line quasars and gives their characteristics. For each object the
catalog presents five-band (u,g,r,i,z) CCD-based photometry with typical
accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology and selection method.
The catalog also contains X-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emission
properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys.

The dispersion relation of the modes is calculated systematically from a

shown to lead to a strong mixing between the Bogoliubov-Anderson bosons of the
neutron superfluid and the longitudinal crystal lattice phonons. In addition,
the speed of the transverse shear mode is greatly reduced as a large fraction
of superfluid neutrons are entrained by nuclei. Not only does the much smaller
velocity of the transverse mode increase the specific heat of the inner crust,
but it also decreases its electron thermal conductivity. These results may
impact our interpretation of the thermal relaxation in accreting neutron stars.
Due to strong mixing, the mean free path of the superfluid mode is found to be
greatly reduced. Our results for the collective mode dispersion relations and
their damping may also have implications for neutron star seismology.

protocols. We present two schemes to generate addressable continuous-variable
cluster states from quadrature squeezed cylindrically polarized modes. By
including polarization in addition to the transverse spatial degree of freedom,
elementary cluster states can be created in which four cluster nodes
co-propagate within one paraxial vector beam. This approach is fundamentally
compatible with existing time-multiplexed schemes that have been used to create
the largest cluster states to date. We implement a proof-of-principle
experiment of one of the proposed schemes and verify its feasibility by
measuring the quantum correlations between the different nodes of the cluster
state.

the analysis is a set of Spitzer-IRS spectra, supplemented by groundbased 3-5
micron spectra, Spitzer and NIR photometry, optical spectroscopy and radio
data. The sources' SEDs and spectral indices are consistent with embedded YSOs;
prominent silicate absorption is observed in the spectra of at least ten
sources, silicate emission is observed towards four sources. PAH emission is
detected towards all but two sources. Based on band ratios (in particular the
strength of the 11.3 micron and the weakness of the 8.6 micron bands) PAH
emission towards SMC YSOs is dominated by predominantly small neutral grains.
Ice absorption is observed towards fourteen sources in the SMC. The comparison
of H2O and CO2 ice column densities for SMC, LMC and Galactic samples suggests
that there is a significant H2O column density threshold for the detection of
CO2 ice. This supports the scenario proposed by Oliveira et al. (2011), where
the reduced shielding in metal-poor environments depletes the H2O column
density in the outer regions of the YSO envelopes. No CO ice is detected
towards the SMC sources. Emission due to pure-rotational 0-0 transitions of H2
is detected towards the majority of SMC sources, allowing us to estimate
rotational temperatures and column densities. All but one source are
spectroscopically confirmed as SMC YSOs. Of the 33 YSOs identified in the SMC,
30 sources populate different stages of massive stellar evolution. The
remaining three sources are classified as intermediate-mass YSOs with a thick
dusty disc and a tenuous envelope still present. We propose one of the sources
is a D-type symbiotic system, based on the presence of Raman, H and He emission
lines in the optical spectrum, and silicate emission in the IRS-spectrum. This
would be the first dust-rich symbiotic system identified in the SMC. (abridged)

severely limit the information rate of the system and pose a serious challenge
for the detection systems. Moreover, simple solutions for phase noise tracking
such as PLL either require low phase noise or otherwise require many pilot
symbols which reduce the effective data rate. In the last decade we have
witnessed a significant amount of research done on joint estimation and
decoding of phase noise and coded information. These algorithms are based on
the factor graph representation of the joint posterior distribution. The
framework proposed in [5], allows the design of efficient message passing
algorithms which incorporate both the code graph and the channel graph. The use
of LDPC or Turbo decoders, as part of iterative message passing schemes, allows
the receiver to operate in low SNR regions while requiring less pilot symbols.
In this paper we propose a multiple hypotheses algorithm for joint detection
and estimation of coded information in a strong phase noise channel. We also
present a low complexity mixture reduction procedure which maintains very good

of Seyfert galaxies by collecting a large statistical spectroscopic sample of
Seyfert 2 and Intermediate-type Seyfert galaxies having a high signal-to-noise
ratio in order to take advantage of a high number of emission-lines to be
accurately measured. 2153 Seyfert 2 and 521 Intermediate-type Seyfert spectra
were selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey - Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7) with a
diagnostic diagram based on the oxygen emission-line ratios. All the
emission-lines, broad components included, were measured by means of a
self-developed code, after the subtraction of the stellar component. Physical
parameters, such as internal reddening, ionization parameter, temperature,
density, gas and stellar velocity dispersion were determined for each object.
Furthermore, we estimated mass and radius of the NLR, kinetic energy of the
ionized gas, and black-hole accretion rate. From the emission-line analysis and
the estimated physical properties, it appears that the NLR is similar in
Seyfert 2 and Intermediate-Seyfert galaxies. The only differences, lower
extinction, gas kinematics in general not dominated by the host galaxy
gravitational potential and higher percentage of [O III]5007 blue asymmetries
in Intermediate-Seyfert can be ascribed to an effect of inclination of our line

Attention is drawn to the mechanism(s) by which the relic abundance of

current constraints, including the discovery of a new particle consistent with

remaining viable models may be difficult to probe with next generation direct
dark matter searches. Relatively low fine-tuning and good direct detection
prospects are still possible in NUHM scenarios.

shows an abrupt decrease at TS = 86 K for H < 3 T. The low temperature
transition is first-order in nature as suggested by the hysteresis in M(T) and
exothermic/endothermic peaks in differential thermal analysis for cooling and
warming cycles. The anomaly at TS is attributed to a structural transition from
orthorhombic to monoclinic phase. The magnetic entropy change is negative at TC
but changes to positive at TS. Thermopower (Q) is negative from 350 K to 20 K,
shows a rapid decrease at TC and a small cusp around TS in zero field. The MTEP
reaches a maximum value of 25% for deltaH = 3 T around TC which is much higher

between MTEP and magnetoresistance, and between delta Sm and Delta Q are found

significantly by $p_{t,trig}$ but may be correlated to some extent with an

direct interaction between these two planets. It is due to the excitation of
Venus' orbit at Jupiter's precession frequency g5. We use a multipolar model
that is not expanded with respect to Mercury's eccentricity, but because of the
proximity of Mercury and Venus, the Hamiltonian is expanded up to order 20 and
more in the ratio of semimajor axis. When the effects of Venus' inclination are

problem with applications to digital filter design, subset selection for linear

continuous relaxation of a mixed integer formulation, and an optimized diagonal
relaxation that exploits a simple special case of the problem. For the
continuous relaxation, an absolute upper bound on the optimal cost is derived,
suggesting that the continuous relaxation tends to be a relatively poor
approximation. In computational experiments, diagonal relaxations often provide
stronger bounds than continuous relaxations and can greatly reduce the
complexity of a branch-and-bound solution, even in instances that are not
particularly close to diagonal. Similar gains are observed with respect to the
mixed integer programming solver CPLEX. Motivated by these results, the
approximation properties of the diagonal relaxation are analyzed. In
particular, bounds on the approximation ratio are established in terms of the
eigenvalues of the matrix defining the quadratic constraint, and also in the

biology because cooperation can be undermined by selfish cheaters who gain an
advantage in the short run, while compromising the long-term viability of the
population. Evolutionary game theory has shown that under certain conditions,
cooperation nonetheless evolves stably, for example if players have the
opportunity to punish cheaters that benefit from a public good yet refuse to
pay into the common pool. However, punishment has remained enigmatic because it
is costly, and difficult to maintain. On the other hand, cooperation emerges
naturally in the Public Goods game if the synergy of the public good (the
factor multiplying the public good investment) is sufficiently high. In terms
of this synergy parameter, the transition from defection to cooperation can be
viewed as a phase transition with the synergy as the critical parameter. We
show here that punishment reduces the critical value at which cooperation
occurs, but also creates the possibility of meta-stable phase transitions,
where populations can ""tunnel"" into the cooperating phase below the critical
value. At the same time, cooperating populations are unstable even above the
critical value, because a group of defectors that are large enough can
""nucleate"" such a transition. We study the mean-field theoretical predictions
via agent-based simulations of finite populations using an evolutionary
approach where the decisions to cooperate or to punish are encoded genetically
in terms of evolvable probabilities. We recover the theoretical predictions and
demonstrate that the population shows hysteresis, as expected in systems that
exhibit super-heating and super-cooling. We conclude that punishment can
stabilize populations of cooperators below the critical point, but it is a
two-edged sword: it can also stabilize defectors above the critical point.

the steady state flux space is known for its flexibility and convenience of
carrying out different purposes, simply by alternating constraints or objective
functions, or appending post processes. Recently the concept of a non-linear
constraint based on the second thermodynamic law, known as ""Loop Law"", is
challenging current sampling algorithms which will inevitably give rise to the
internal loops. A generalized method is proposed here to eradicate the
probability of the appearance of internal loops during sampling process. Based
on Artificial Centered Hit and Run (ACHR) method, each step of the new sampling
process will avoid entering ""loop-forming"" subspaces. This method has been
applied on the metabolic network of Helicobacter pylori with three different
objective functions: uniform sampling, optimizing biomass synthesis, optimizing
biomass synthesis efficiency over resources ingested. Comparison between
results from the new method and conventional ACHR method shows effective
elimination of loop fluxes without affecting non-loop fluxes.

supernova (CCSN) cores is a key facilitator of explosions. Unfortunately, much
of this work has necessarily been performed assuming axisymmetry and it remains
unclear whether or not this compromises those results. In this work, we present
analyses of simplified two- and three-dimensional CCSN models with the goal of
comparing the multidimensional hydrodynamics in setups that differ only in
dimension. Not surprisingly, we find many differences between 2D and 3D models.
While some differences are subtle and perhaps not crucial to understanding the
explosion mechanism, others are quite dramatic and make interpreting 2D CCSN
models problematic. In particular, we find that imposing axisymmetry
artificially produces excess power at the largest spatial scales, power that
has been deemed critical in the success of previous explosion models and has
been attributed solely to the standing accretion shock instability.
Nevertheless, our 3D models, which have an order of magnitude less power on
large scales compared to 2D models, explode earlier. Since we see explosions
earlier in 3D than in 2D, the vigorous sloshing associated with the large scale
power in 2D models is either not critical in any dimension or the explosion
mechanism operates differently in 2D and 3D. Possibly related to the earlier
explosions in 3D, we find that about 25% of the accreted material spends more
time in the gain region in 3D than in 2D, being exposed to more integrated
heating and reaching higher peak entropies, an effect we associate with the
differing characters of turbulence in 2D and 3D. Finally, we discuss a simple
model for the runaway growth of buoyant bubbles that is able to quantitatively
account for the growth of the shock radius and predicts a critical luminosity
relation.

magnetic excitations in the intermediate-coupling regime for the so-called

models obtained in strong-coupling calculations. We discuss the characteristic
features of the magnetic excitation spectrum that can lead to conclusive

include spurious entropy generation resulting from discreteness effects, poor
load balancing and increased communication overhead which spoil the excellent
scaling in massively parallel grid codes.
  We propose the use of the collisionless Boltzmann moment equations as a means
to model collisionless material as a fluid on the mesh, implementing it into
the massively parallel FLASH AMR code. This approach, which we term
""collisionless stellar hydrodynamics"" enables us to do away with the
particle-mesh approach. Since the parallelisation scheme is identical to that
used for the hydrodynamics, it preserves the excellent scaling of the FLASH
code already demonstrated on peta-flop machines.
  We find the classic hydrodynamic equations and Boltzmann moment equations can
be reconciled under specific conditions, allowing us to generate analytic
solutions for collisionless systems using conventional test problems. We
confirm the validity of our approach using a suite of demanding test problems,

the pre-main sequence star AS 209, spanning more than an order of magnitude in
wavelength from 0.88 to 9.8 mm. The disk was observed with sub-arcsecond
angular resolution (0.2""-0.5"") to investigate radial variations in its dust
properties. At longer wavelengths, the disk emission structure is notably more
compact, providing model-independent evidence for changes in the grain
properties across the disk. We find that physical models which reproduce the
disk emission require a radial dependence of the dust opacity \kappa_{\nu}.
Assuming that the observed wavelength-dependent structure can be attributed to
radial variations in the dust opacity spectral index (\beta), we find that
\beta(R) increases from \beta<0.5 at \sim20 AU to \beta>1.5 for R>80 AU,
inconsistent with a constant value of \beta\ across the disk (at the 10\sigma\
level). Furthermore, if radial variations of \kappa_{\nu} are caused by
particle growth, we find that the maximum size of the particle-size
distribution (a_{max}) increases from sub-millimeter-sized grains in the outer
disk (R>70 AU) to millimeter and centimeter-sized grains in the inner disk
regions (R< 70 AU). We compare our observational constraint on a_{max}(R) with
predictions from physical models of dust evolution in proto-planetary disks.
For the dust composition and particle-size distribution investigated here, our
observational constraints on a_{max}(R) are consistent with models where the
maximum grain size is limited by radial drift.

models where lepton number is promoted to an (approximate) U(1)_R symmetry.
Such a symmetry has interesting implications for naturalness, as well as
flavor- and CP-violation, among others. Interestingly, it makes large sneutrino
vacuum expectation values phenomenologically viable, so that a slepton doublet
can play the role of the down-type Higgs. As a result, (some of) the leptons
and neutrinos are incorporated into the chargino and neutralino sectors. This
leads to characteristic decay patterns that can be experimentally tested at the
LHC. The corresponding collider phenomenology is largely determined by the new
approximately conserved quantum number, which is itself closely tied to the
presence of ""leptonic R-parity violation"". We find rather loose bounds on the
first and second generation squarks, arising from a combination of suppressed
production rates together with relatively small signal efficiencies of the
current searches. Naturalness would indicate that such a framework should be
discovered in the near future, perhaps through spectacular signals exhibiting
the lepto-quark nature of the third generation squarks. The presence of fully
visible decays, in addition to decay chains involving large missing energy (in
the form of neutrinos) could give handles to access the details of the spectrum
of new particles, if excesses over SM background were to be observed. The scale
of neutrino masses is intimately tied to the source of U(1)_R breaking, thus
opening a window into the R-breaking sector through neutrino physics. Further
theoretical aspects of the model have been presented in a recent companion

cadherin-based adhesions, primary mouse keratinocytes within a colony appear to
act independently, with significant traction forces extending throughout the
colony. In contrast, with strong cadherin-based adhesions, keratinocytes in a
cohesive colony localize traction forces to the colony periphery. Through
genetic or antibody-mediated loss of cadherin expression or function, we show
that cadherin-based adhesions are essential for this mechanical cooperativity.
A minimal physical model in which cell--cell adhesions modulate the physical
cohesion between contractile cells is sufficient to recreate the spatial
rearrangement of traction forces observed experimentally with varying strength
of cadherin-based adhesions. This work defines the importance of cadherin-based
cell--cell adhesions in coordinating mechanical activity of epithelial cells

obtained with HST NICMOS. Uniquely for NICMOS transit spectroscopy, a companion
star of similar properties to XO-2 is present in the field of view. We derive
improved star and planet parameters through a photometric white-light analysis.
We show a clear correlation of the spectrum noise with instrumental parameters,
in particular the angle of the spectral trace on the detector. An MCMC method
using a decorrelation from instrumental parameters is used to extract the
planetary spectrum. Spectra derived independently from each of the 3 visits
have a RMS of 430, 510, and 1000 ppm respectively. The same analysis is
performed on the companion star after numerical injection of a transit with a
depth constant at all wavelengths. The extracted spectra exhibit residuals of
similar amplitude as for XO-2, which represent the level of remaining NICMOS
systematics. This shows that extracting planetary spectra is at the limit of
NICMOS' capability. We derive a spectrum for the planet XO-2b using the
companion star as a reference. The derived spectrum can be represented by a
theoretical model including atmospheric water vapor or by a flat spectrum
model. We derive a 3-sigma upper limit of 1570 ppm on the presence of water
vapor absorption in the atmosphere of XO-2b. In an appendix, we perform a
similar analysis for the gas giant planet XO-1b.

current decay with a high sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model.
Nearly all theoretical predictions and all experimental measurements so far
have assumed a $K^{\ast 0}$ P-wave that decays into the $K^+\pi^-$ final state.
In this paper the addition of an S-wave within the $K^+\pi^-$ system of $B^0
\to K^{\ast 0}\ell^+\ell^-$ and the subsequent impact of this on the angular
distribution of the final state particles is explored. The inclusion of the
S-wave causes a distinction between the values of the angular observables
obtained from counting experiments and those obtained from fits to the angular
distribution. The effect of a non-zero S-wave on an angular analysis of $B^0
\to K^{\ast 0}\ell^+\ell^-$ is assessed as a function of dataset size and the
relative size of the S-wave amplitude. An S-wave contribution, equivalent to
what is measured in $B^0 \to J/\psi K^{\ast 0}$ at BaBar, leads to a
significant bias on the angular observables for datasets of above 200 signal
decays. Any future experimental analysis of the $K^+\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$ final
state will have to take the S-wave contribution into account.

gravity field data obtained during the Cassini-Huygens mission, implies an
internal mass distribution that may be incompatible with complete
differentiation. This suggests that Titan may have a mixed ice/rock core,
possibly consistent with slow accretion in a gas-starved disk, which may
initially spare Titan from widespread ice melting and subsequent
differentiation. A partially differentiated Titan, however, must still
efficiently remove radiogenic heat over geologic time. We argue that
compositional heterogeneity in the major Saturnian satellites indicates that
Titan formed from planetesimals with disparate densities. The resulting
compositional anomalies would quickly redistribute to form a vertical density
gradient that would oppose thermal convection. We use elements of the theory of
double-diffusive convection to create a parameterized model for the thermal
evolution of ice/rock mixtures with a stabilizing compositional gradient.
Simulations are performed for a wide range of initial conditions to account for
large uncertainties in material properties and accretionary processes.
Ultimately, for realistic density gradients, double-diffusive convection in the
ice/rock interior can delay, but not prevent, ice melting and differentiation,
even if a substantial fraction of potassium is leached from the rock component.
Consequently, Titan is not partially differentiated.

construction of a complex irreducible rational and simply connected surface and
an unramified morphism of geometric degree 3 (and hence which is not an

if this surface is affine or not, or if its invertible regular functions are

from the Wide Angle ROSAT Pointed Survey (WARPS) and quantify its evolution.
WARPS is a serendipitous survey of the central region of ROSAT pointed
observations and was carried out in two phases (WARPS-I and WARPS-II). The
results here are based on a final sample of 124 clusters, complete above a flux
limit of 6.5 10E-15 erg/s/cm2, with members out to redshift z ~ 1.05, and a sky
coverage of 70.9 deg2. We find significant evidence for negative evolution of
the XLF, which complements the majority of X-ray cluster surveys. To quantify
the suggested evolution, we perform a maximum likelihood analysis and conclude
that the evolution is driven by a decreasing number density of high luminosity
clusters with redshift, while the bulk of the cluster population remains nearly
unchanged out to redshift z ~ 1.1, as expected in a low density Universe. The
results are found to be insensitive to a variety of sources of systematic
uncertainty that affect the measurement of the XLF and determination of the
survey selection function. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the XLF to fully
account for uncertainties in the local XLF on the measured evolution, and find
that the detected evolution remains significant at the 95% level. We observe a
significant excess of clusters in the WARPS at 0.1 < z < 0.3 and LX ~ 2 10E42
erg/s compared with the reference low-redshift XLF, or our Bayesian fit to the
WARPS data. We find that the excess cannot be explained by sample variance, or
Eddington bias, and is unlikely to be due to problems with the survey selection
function.

networks. The classic edge configuration model or Chung-Lu model can generate
an undirected graph with any desired degree distribution. This serves as a good
null model to compare algorithms or perform experimental studies. Furthermore,
there are scalable algorithms that implement these models and they are
invaluable in the study of graphs. However, networks in the real-world are
often directed, and have a significant proportion of reciprocal edges. A
stronger relation exists between two nodes when they each point to one another
(reciprocal edge) as compared to when only one points to the other (one-way
edge). Despite their importance, reciprocal edges have been disregarded by most
directed graph models.
  We propose a null model for directed graphs inspired by the Chung-Lu model
that matches the in-, out-, and reciprocal-degree distributions of the real
graphs. Our algorithm is scalable and requires $O(m)$ random numbers to

that satisfies the non-negative constraint and maximum principles on general
computational grids. The governing equations for the concentration of reactants
and product are written in terms of tensorial diffusion-reaction equations. %
We restrict our studies to fast irreversible bimolecular reactions. If one
assumes that the reaction is diffusion-limited and all chemical species have
the same diffusion coefficient, one can employ a linear transformation to
rewrite the governing equations in terms of invariants, which are unaffected by
the reaction. This results in two uncoupled tensorial diffusion equations in
terms of these invariants, which are solved using a novel non-negative solver
for tensorial diffusion-type equations. The concentrations of the reactants and
the product are then calculated from invariants using algebraic manipulations.
The novel aspect of the proposed computational framework is that it will always
produce physically meaningful non-negative values for the concentrations of all
chemical species. Several representative numerical examples are presented to
illustrate the robustness, convergence, and the numerical performance of the
proposed computational framework. We will also compare the proposed framework
with other popular formulations. In particular, we will show that the Galerkin
formulation (which is the standard single-field formulation) does not produce
reliable solutions, and the reason can be attributed to the fact that the
single-field formulation does not guarantee non-negative solutions. We will
also show that the clipping procedure (which produces non-negative solutions
but is considered as a variational crime) does not give accurate results when
compared with the proposed computational framework.

QCD matter responds to energy loss in a pattern consistent with that expected

three advantages: first, the controller parameters are flexible enough to adapt
themselves to different vehicle speeds; second, the model is backward adaptive

estimator coefficients without explicit exchange of the parameters; third, it
can accurately model the system even when the correlation between two
successive channel samples becomes as low as 0.05. Our simulation results show
that our proposed method can reduce the required feedback by several kilobits
per second for vehicle speeds up to 20 km/h (channel tracker) and 10 km/h

confinement of a radiatively driven, massive-star wind. The specific parameters
are chosen to represent the prototypical slowly rotating magnetic O star
\theta^1 Ori C, for which centrifugal and other dynamical effects of rotation
are negligible. The computed global structure in latitude and radius resembles
that found in previous 2D simulations, with unimpeded outflow along open field
lines near the magnetic poles, and a complex equatorial belt of inner wind
trapping by closed loops near the stellar surface, giving way to outflow above
the Alfv\'{e}n radius. In contrast to this previous 2D work, the 3D simulation
described here now also shows how this complex structure fragments in azimuth,
forming distinct clumps of closed loop infall within the Alfv\'{e}n radius,
transitioning in the outer wind to radial spokes of enhanced density with
characteristic azimuthal separation of $15-20 \degr$. Applying these results in
a 3D code for line radiative transfer, we show that emission from the
associated 3D `dynamical magnetosphere' matches well the observed H\alpha
emission seen from \theta^1 Ori C, fitting both its dynamic spectrum over
rotational phase, as well as the observed level of cycle to cycle stochastic
variation. Comparison with previously developed 2D models for Balmer emission
from a dynamical magnetosphere generally confirms that time-averaging over 2D
snapshots can be a good proxy for the spatial averaging over 3D azimuthal wind
structure. Nevertheless, fully 3D simulations will still be needed to model the
emission from magnetospheres with non-dipole field components, such as
suggested by asymmetric features seen in the H\alpha equivalent-width curve of

sets cover an 8'x45' region of the sky. Our measurement is the cross-power
spectrum between the IR and X-ray data. The cross-power signal between the IRAC
maps at 3.6 um and 4.5 um and the Chandra [0.5-2] keV data has been detected,
at angular scales 20'', with an overall significance of 3.8 sigma and 5.6
sigma, respectively. At the same time we find no evidence of significant
cross-correlations at the harder Chandra bands. The cross-correlation signal is
produced by individual IR sources with 3.6 um and 4.5 um magnitudes m_AB 25-26

the large scale power of the CIB fluctuations is correlated with the spatial
power spectrum of the X-ray fluctuations. If this correlation is attributed to
emission from accretion processes at both IR and X-ray wavelengths, this
implies a much higher fraction of accreting black holes than among the known
populations. We discuss the various possible origins for the cross-power signal
and show that neither local foregrounds nor the known remaining normal galaxies

results are an important new constraint on theoretical modeling of the near-IR

algorithm of SMCHR is based on lazy clause generation, where a new clause for

orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). We denote the OMMP with the parameter $M$ as
OMMP(M) where $M\geq 1$ is an integer. The main difference between OMP and
OMMP(M) is that OMMP(M) selects $M$ atoms per iteration, while OMP only adds
one atom to the optimal atom set. In this paper, we study the performance of
orthogonal multi-matching pursuit (OMMP) under RIP. In particular, we show
that, when the measurement matrix A satisfies $(9s, 1/10)$-RIP, there exists an
absolutely constant $M_0\leq 8$ so that OMMP(M_0) can recover $s$-sparse signal
within $s$ iterations. We furthermore prove that, for slowly-decaying
$s$-sparse signal, OMMP(M) can recover s-sparse signal within $O(\frac{s}{M})$
iterations for a large class of $M$. In particular, for $M=s^a$ with $a\in
[0,1/2]$, OMMP(M) can recover slowly-decaying $s$-sparse signal within
$O(s^{1-a})$ iterations. The result implies that OMMP can reduce the
computational complexity heavily.

of state (EoS) $w(a)=-\alpha/(\beta a^{-n}+1)$, which includes the generalized
Chaplygin gas model (gGg) as its special case, where $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $n$
are three positive numbers. It is clear that this model reduces to the gCg
model with EoS $w(a)=-B_s/(B_s+(1-B_s)a^{-3(1+\alpha)})$, when $\alpha=1$,
$\beta=(1-B_s)/B_s$ and $n=3(1+\alpha)$. By combination the cold dark matter
and the cosmological constant, one can coin a EoS of unified dark fluid in the
form of $w(a)=-1/(1+(1-\Omega_{\Lambda})a^{-3}/\Omega_{\Lambda})$. With this
observations, our proposed EoS provides a possible deviation from $\Lambda$CDM
model when the model parameters $\alpha$ and $n$ deviate from 1 and 3
respectively. By using the currently available cosmic observations from type Ia
supernovae (SN Ia) Union2.1, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic
microwave background radiation (CMB), we test the viability of this model and
detect the possible devotion from the $\Lambda$CDM model. The results show that
the new UDF model fits the cosmic observation as well as that of the
$\Lambda$CDM model and no deviation is found from the $\Lambda$CDM model in
$3\sigma$ confidence level. However, our new UDF model can give a non-zero
sound speed, as a contrast, which is zero for the $\Lambda$CDM model. We expect
the large structure formation information can distinct the new UDF model from
the $\Lambda$CDM model.

this seems the right thing to do, the relative error after background
subtraction improves when more time is spent counting the measurement with the

based on the construction of the Verma modules and finding auxiliary oscillator

that, with the usual tensor term that is employed in the Skyrme interaction
(and that allows us to separate the like-nucleon and the neutron-proton tensor
contributions), we can describe the evolution of the N=28 neutron gap in
calcium isotopes. We propose to include a tensor and a tensor-isospin term in
finite-range interactions of Gogny type. The parameters of the two tensor terms
allow us to treat separately the like-nucleon and the neutron-proton
contributions. Two parameterizations of the tensor terms have been chosen to
reproduce different neutron single-particle properties in the 48Ca nucleus and
the energy of the first 0- state in the 16O nucleus. By employing these two
parameterizations we analyze the evolution of the N=14, 28, and 90 neutron
energy gaps in oxygen, calcium and tin isotopes, respectively. We show that the
combination of the parameters governing the like-nucleon contribution is
crucial to correctly reproduce the experimental (where available) or
shell-model trends for the evolution of the three neutron gaps under study.

consists in to take a Bethe mean-field solution obtained with a maximum
spanning tree (MST) of pairwise mutual information, referred to as the
\emph{Bethe reference point}, for further perturbation procedures. We consider
three different ways following this idea: in the first one, we select and
calibrate iteratively the optimal links to be added starting from the Bethe
reference point; the second one is based on the observation that the natural
gradient can be computed analytically at the Bethe point; in the third one,
assuming no local field and using low temperature expansion we develop a dual
loop joint model based on a well chosen fundamental cycle basis. We indeed
identify a subclass of planar models, which we refer to as \emph{Bethe-dual
graph models}, having possibly many loops, but characterized by a singly
connected dual factor graph, for which the partition function and the linear
response can be computed exactly in respectively O(N) and $O(N^2)$ operations,
thanks to a dual weight propagation (DWP) message passing procedure that we set
up. When restricted to this subclass of models, the inverse Ising problem being
convex, becomes tractable at any temperature. Experimental tests on various
datasets with refined $L_0$ or $L_1$ regularization procedures indicate that
these approaches may be competitive and useful alternatives to existing ones.

time-dependent problems in PTQM, e.g., those with a time-dependent

illuminate our proposal by examining a proper mapping from a time-dependent

Schr\""odinger equation in conventional quantum mechanics. The rich structure of
the proper mapping hints that time-dependent PTQM can be a fruitful extension
of conventional quantum mechanics. Under our proposed framework, we further
study in detail the Berry phase generation in a class of
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric two-level systems. It is found that a closed path in
the parameter space of PTQM is often associated with an open path in a properly
mapped problem in conventional quantum mechanics. In one interesting case we
further interpret the Berry phase as the flux of a continuously tunable
fictitious magnetic monopole, thus highlighting the difference between PTQM and
conventional quantum mechanics despite the existence of a proper mapping
between them.

transitions as x increases. On the basis of density functional theory

suggest that Ir0.75Ch2 is the parent compound for the present superconductors.

the ground state of a one-dimensional quantum field theory. The partial
transpose rho_A^{T_2} of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem A=A_1 U A_2
is explicitly constructed as an imaginary-time path integral and from this the
replicated traces Tr (rho_A^{T_2})^n are obtained. The logarithmic negativity
E= log||rho_A^{T_2}|| is then the continuation to n->1 of the traces of the
even powers. For pure states, this procedure reproduces the known results. We
then apply this method to conformally invariant field theories in several
different physical situations for infinite and finite systems and without or
with boundaries. In particular, in the case of two adjacent intervals of
lengths L1, L2 in an infinite system, we derive the result E\sim(c/4) ln(L1
L2/(L1+L2)), where c is the central charge. For the more complicated case of
two disjoint intervals, we show that the negativity depends only on the
harmonic ratio of the four end-points and so is manifestly scale invariant. We
explicitly calculate the scale-invariant functions for the replicated traces in
the case of the CFT for the free compactified boson, but we have not so far
been able to obtain the n->1 continuation for the negativity even in the limit
of large compactification radius. We have checked all our findings against
exact numerical results for the harmonic chain which is described by a
non-compactified free boson.

gradual substitution of Ge for Ga in FeGa$_{3-y}$Ge$_{y}$ yields metallic
conduction at a very small level of $y = 0.006$, then induces weak

$\mu_{B}$/Fe and a Curie temperature $T_{C}= 3.3$ K, which continues increasing
to $T_{C} = 75$ K as doping reaches $y = 0.41$. The emergence of the FM state
is accompanied by quantum critical behavior as observed in the specific heat,
$C/T \propto -$ln$T$, and in the magnetic susceptibility, $M/B \propto
T^{-4/3}$. At $y= 0.09$, the specific heat divided by temperature $C/T$ reaches
a large value of 70 mJ/K$^{2}$molFe, twice as large as that reported on
FeSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_{x}$ for $x_{c}= 0.37$ and Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Sb$_{2}$ for
$x_{c}=0.3$ at their respective FM quantum critical points. The critical
concentration $y_{c}=0.13$ in FeGa$_{3-y}$Ge$_{y}$ is quite small, despite the
fact that its band gap is one order of magnitude larger than those in FeSi and
FeSb$_{2}$. In contrast, no FM state emerges by substituting Co for Fe in
Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Ga$_{3}$ in the whole range $0 \leq x \leq 1$, although both
types of substitution should dope electrons into FeGa$_{3}$. The FM instability

induced by the disturbance of the Fe 3d - Ga 4p hybridization.

a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms, have attracted a great deal of interest in
recent years. Specifically, the fact that electrons in graphene behave as
massless relativistic particles gives rise to unconventional phenomena such as
Klein tunneling, the anomalous quantum Hall effect, and strain-induced
pseudo-magnetic fields. Graphene edge states play a crucial role in the
understanding and use of these electronic properties. However, the coarse or
impure nature of the edges hampers the ability to directly probe the edge
states and their band structure. Perhaps the best example is the edge states on
the bearded edge (also called the Klein edge) that have thus far never been
observed - because such an edge is unstable in graphene. Here, we use the
optical equivalent of graphene - a photonic honeycomb lattice - to
experimentally and theoretically study edge states and their properties. We
directly image the edge states on both the zig-zag and bearded edges of this
photonic graphene, measure their dispersion properties, and most importantly,
find a new type of edge state: one residing on the bearded edge which was
unknown and cannot be explained through conventional tight-binding theory. Such
a new edge state lies near the van-Hove singularity in the edge band structure
and can be classified as a Tamm state lacking any surface defect. Our photonic
system offers the opportunity to probe new graphene-related phenomena that are
difficult or impossible to access in conventional carbon-based graphene. Edge
states in graphene-type structures play the central role in achieving photonic
topological insulation, in which light can propagate along the edges of
photonic structures without any parasitic scattering whatsoever.

computing these width measures on semi-complete digraphs, via degree orderings.
Using the new technique we are able to reprove the main results of [2, 9] in a

we present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for both cutwidth and
pathwidth, faster and simpler than the previously known ones; the most
significant improvement is in case of pathwidth, where instead of previously
known O(OPT)-approximation in fixed-parameter tractable time [6] we obtain a
constant-factor approximation in polynomial time. Secondly, by exploiting the
new set of obstacles for cutwidth and pathwidth, we show that topological
containment and immersion in semi-complete digraphs can be tested in
single-exponential fixed-parameter tractable time. Finally, we present how the
new approach can be used to obtain exact fixed-parameter tractable algorithms
for cutwidth and pathwidth, with single- exponential running time dependency on
the optimal width.

bringing no advantages with respect to known techniques. Moreover, we explain
that the use of a 'vortex' mode (orbital angular momentum OAM l = 1) at one of
the transmit antennas is not necessary to encode different channels since only
different patterns -or similarly different pointing angles- of the transmit
antennas are required. Finally, we identify why this MIMO transmission allowed
decoding of two signals despite being line-of-sight. This is due to the large
separation between the receiving antennas, which places the transmit antennas
in the near-field Fresnel region of the receiving 'array'. This strongly limits
the application of this technique in practice, since, for a fixed separation
between receiving antennas, the detectable signal power from any additional
vortex mode decays at least as 1/r^4.

to time interpolate intervals before and after the source as a polynomial. This

and a retrograde rotation with a spin vector between -70 and -90 deg ecliptic

the hot sub-solar region- shows that there may be large variations in roughness
on the surface along the equatorial zone of 1999 RQ36, but further measurements

relatively few observations is one of the crucial issues in science. One
approach to this problem is Gaussian graphical modeling, which describes
conditional independence of variables through the presence or absence of edges
in the underlying graph. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient
Bayesian framework for Gaussian graphical model determination which is a
trans-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach based on a
continuous-time birth-death process. We cover the theory and computational
details of the method. It is easy to implement and computationally feasible for
high-dimensional graphs. We show our method outperforms alternative Bayesian
approaches in terms of convergence, mixing in the graph space and computing
time. Unlike frequentist approaches, it gives a principled and, in practice,
sensible approach for structure learning. We illustrate the efficiency of the
method on a broad range of simulated data. We then apply the method on
large-scale real applications from human and mammary gland gene expression
studies to show its empirical usefulness. In addition, we implemented the
method in the R package BDgraph which is freely available at

of spin angular momentum through a solid, preferably at frequencies reaching
the so far unexplored terahertz (THz) regime. Here, we demonstrate, by
experiment and theory, that the temporal shape of femtosecond spin-current
bursts can be manipulated by using specifically designed magnetic
heterostructures. A laser pulse is employed to drive spins from a ferromagnetic
Fe thin film into a nonmagnetic cap layer that has either low (Ru) or high (Au)
electron mobility. The resulting transient spin current is detected by means of
an ultrafast, contactless amperemeter based on the inverse spin Hall effect
that converts the spin flow into a THz electromagnetic pulse. We find that the
Ru cap layer yields a considerably longer spin-current pulse because electrons
are injected in Ru d states that have a much smaller mobility than Au sp
states. Thus, spin current pulses and the resulting THz transients can be
shaped by tailoring magnetic heterostructures, which opens the door for
engineering high-speed spintronic devices as well as broadband THz emitters in
particular covering the elusive range from 5 to 10THz.

within a simple model regarding the ground state atom as a small perturber that
is bound by a low-energy scattering process with the Rydberg electron [C. H.
Greene et al, Phys. Rev. Lett., 85: 2458 (2000)]. Besides the good agreement
between theory and the experiment concerning the vibrational states of the

lifetime of the molecule is clearly reduced as compared to the bare Rydberg
atom [B. Butscher et al, J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 44, 184004 (2011)].

the vibrational ground state of the molecule in a quantum-classical framework.
We show that the Rydberg wave function is continuously detuned by the presence
of the moving ground state atom and that the timescale on which the detuning
significantly exceeds the natural linewidth is in good agreement with the
observed reduced lifetimes of the Rydberg molecule.

which the number of nodes with out-degree zero converges in distribution to a

with compact support that have at most polynomial rates of decay to zero.

unknown scatterer is hosted by a possibly inhomogeneous background. The
approach is `hybrid' in that it merges a qualitative and a quantitative method
to optimize the way of exploiting the a priori information on the background
within the inversion procedure, thus improving the quality of the
reconstruction and reducing the data amount necessary for a satisfactory
result. In the qualitative step, this a priori knowledge is utilized to
implement the linear sampling method in its near-field formulation for an
inhomogeneous background, in order to identify the region where the scatterer
is located. On the other hand, the same a priori information is also encoded in
the quantitative step by extending and applying the contrast source inversion
method to what we call the `inhomogeneous Lippmann-Schwinger equation': the
latter is a generalization of the classical Lippmann-Schwinger equation to the
case of an inhomogeneous background, and in our paper is deduced from the
differential formulation of the direct scattering problem to provide the
reconstruction algorithm with an appropriate theoretical basis. Then, the point
values of the refractive index are computed only in the region identified by
the linear sampling method at the previous step. The effectiveness of this
hybrid approach is supported by numerical simulations presented at the end of
the paper.

Theorem as a product of Virtue Ethics.
  The Fundamental Theorem was developed in mathematics to establish a `theory'
that underpinned the Black-Scholes-Merton approach to pricing derivatives. In
doing this, the Fundamental Theorem unified a number of different approaches in
financial economics, this strengthened the status of neo-classical economics
based on Consequentialist Ethics. We present an alternative to this narrative.

Their frequent occurrence as well as the fact that more than 70 (Schneider et

noteably the telluric companion of alpha Centauri B (Dumusque et al. 2012) -
make them interesting targets in the search for habitable worlds. Recent
studies (Eggl et al. 2012b, Forgan 2012) have shown, that despite the
variations in gravitational and radiative environment, there are indeed
circumstellar regions where planets can stay within habitable insolation limits
on secular dynamical timescales. In this article we provide habitable zones for
19 near S-Type binary systems from the Hipparchos and WDS catalogues with
semimajor axes between 1 and 100 AU. Hereby, we accounted for the combined
dynamical and radiative influence of the second star on the Earth-like planet.
Out of the 19 systems presented, 17 offer dynamically stable habitable zones
around at least one component. The 17 potentially habitable systems contain 5
F, 3 G, 7 K and 16 M class stars. As their proximity to the Solar System (d <
31 pc) makes the selected binary stars exquisite targets for observational
campaigns, we offer estimates on radial velocity, astrometric and transit
signatures produced by habitable Earth-like planets in eccentric circumstellar
orbits.

daily and monthly temperature observations. Our aim is to better understand and
quantify the statistics of temperature records in the context of global
warming. Similar to earlier work we employ a simple mathematical model of
independent and identically distributed random variables with a linearly
growing expectation value. This model proved to be useful in predicting the
increase (decrease) in upper (lower) temperature records in a warming climate.
Using both station and re-analysis data from Europe and the United States we
further investigate the statistics of temperature records and the validity of
this model. The most important new contribution in this article is an analysis
of the statistics of record values for our simple model and European reanalysis
data. We estimate how much the mean values and the distributions of record
temperatures are affected by the large scale warming trend. In this context we
consider both the values of records that occur at a certain time and the values
of records that have a certain record number in the series of record events. We
compare the observational data both to simple analytical computations and
numerical simulations. We find that it is more difficult to describe the values
of record breaking temperatures within the framework of our linear drift model.
Observations from the summer months fit well into the model with Gaussian
random variables under the observed linear warming, in the sense that record
breaking temperatures are more extreme in the summer. In winter however a
significant asymmetry of the daily temperature distribution hides the effect of
the slow warming trends. Therefore very extreme cold records are still possible
in winter. This effect is even more pronounced if one considers only data from
subpolar regions.

heavy flavor quarkonia production is thought to be uniquely sensitive to the

Heavy quark production has been studied by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC via
measurements of single leptons from semi-leptonic decays, in both the electron
channel at mid-rapidity and in the muon channel at forward rapidity. Large
suppression and azimuthal anisotropy of single electrons have been observed in
Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. These results suggest a large energy loss and
strong flow of the heavy quarks in the hot, dense matter. The PHENIX experiment
has also measured J/psi production in p + p, d+Au, Cu+Cu, and Au+Au collisions
at energies up to 200 GeV. In central Au+Au at 200 GeV, more suppression is
observed at forward rapidity than at central rapidity. This can be interpreted
either as a sign of quark recombination, or as a hint of additional cold
nuclear matter effects. Selected PHENIX results on open heavy flavor and heavy

piezoelectric properties of ZnO nanowires as calculated under uniaxial loading.
An important point to our work is that we have utilized two types of surface
treatments, those of charge compensation and surface passivation, to eliminate
the polarization divergence that otherwise occurs due to the polar (0001)
surfaces of ZnO. In doing so, we find that if appropriate surface treatments
are utilized, the elastic modulus and the piezoelectric properties for ZnO
nanowires having a variety of axial and surface orientations are all reduced as
compared to the bulk value as a result of polarization-reduction in the polar
[0001] direction. The reduction in effective piezoelectric constant is found to
be independent of the expansion or contraction of the polar (0001) surface in
response to surface stresses. Instead, the surface polarization and thus
effective piezoelectric constant is substantially reduced due to a reduction in
the bond length of the Zn-O dimer closest to the polar (0001) surface.
Furthermore, depending on the nanowire axial orientation, we find in the
absence of surface treatment that the piezoelectric properties of ZnO are
either effectively lost due to unphysical transformations from the wurtzite to
non-piezoelectric d-BCT phases, or also become smaller with decreasing nanowire
size. The overall implication of this study is that if enhancement of the
piezoelectric properties of ZnO is desired, then continued miniaturization of
square or nearly square cross section ZnO wires to the nanometer scale is not
likely to achieve this result.

put in contact with an auxiliary system A and the coherent control can directly
affect only A. The system S is controlled 'indirectly' through the interaction
with A. The system S is said to be indirectly controllable if every unitary
transformation can be performed on the state of S with this scheme. The
indirect controllability of S will depend on the `dynamical Lie algebra' L
characterizing the dynamics of the total system S+A and on the initial state of
the auxiliary system A. In this paper we describe this characterization
exactly.
  A natural assumption is that the auxiliary system A is minimal which means
that there is no part of A which is uncoupled to S, and we denote by n_A the
dimension of such a minimal A, which we assume to be fully controllable. We
show that, if n_A is greater than or equal to 3, indirect controllability of S
is verified if and only if complete controllability of the total system S+A is

having complete controllability. The exact condition for that to happen is
given in terms of a Lie algebra L_S which describes the evolution on the system
S only. We prove that indirect controllability is verified if and only if
L_S=u(n_S), and the initial state of the auxiliary system A is pure.

any quantity characterizing the system -- equilibrium or non-equilibrium -- can
be computed for arbitrary potentials. To consider dynamical quantities we
compute the asymptotic limit of the Fokker-Planck equation, and show that it
becomes restricted to the low-dimensional manifolds connected by ""sticky""

in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) such as collision avoidance,
cooperative driving, congestion avoidance, and traffic optimization. Due to the
vulnerable nature of wireless communication against interference and
intentional jamming, ITS face new challenges to ensure the reliability and the
safety of the overall system. In this paper, we expose a class of stealthy
attacks -- Stuck in Traffic (SiT) attacks -- that aim to cause congestion by
exploiting how drivers make decisions based on smart traffic signs. An attacker
mounting a SiT attack solves a Markov Decision Process problem to find
optimal/suboptimal attack policies in which he/she interferes with a
well-chosen subset of signals that are based on the state of the system. We
apply Approximate Policy Iteration (API) algorithms to derive potent attack
policies. We evaluate their performance on a number of systems and compare them

performs its function correctly in time. A usual way to achieve a high
reliability, is to design redundant systems that contain several replicas of
the same subsystem or component. State space methods for dependability analysis
may suffer of the state space explosion problem in such a kind of situation.
Combinatorial models, on the other hand, require the simplified assumption of
statistical independence; however, in case of redundant systems, this does not
guarantee a reduced number of modeled elements. In order to provide a more
compact system representation, parametric system modeling has been investigated
in the literature, in such a way that a set of replicas of a given subsystem is
parameterized so that only one representative instance is explicitly included.
While modeling aspects can be suitably addressed by these approaches,
analytical tools working on parametric characterizations are often more
difficult to be defined and the standard approach is to 'unfold' the parametric
model, in order to exploit standard analysis algorithms working at the unfolded
'ground' level. Moreover, parameterized combinatorial methods still require the
statistical independence assumption. In the present paper we consider the
formalism of Parametric Fault Tree (PFT) and we show how it can be related to
Probabilistic Horn Abduction (PHA). Since PHA is a framework where both
modeling and analysis can be performed in a restricted first-order language, we
aim at showing that converting a PFT into a PHA knowledge base will allow an
approach to dependability analysis directly exploiting parametric
representation. We will show that classical qualitative and quantitative
dependability measures can be characterized within PHA. Furthermore, additional
modeling aspects (such as noisy gates and local dependencies) as well as
additional reliability measures (such as posterior probability analysis) can be
naturally addressed by this conversion. A simple example of a multi-processor
system with several replicated units is used to illustrate the approach.

networks (DBNs) and dynamic graphical models (DGMs). While most methods to
triangulate such networks use some form of constrained elimination scheme based
on properties of the underlying directed graph, we find it useful to view
triangulation and elimination using properties only of the resulting undirected
graph, obtained after the moralization step. We first briefly introduce the
Graphical model toolkit (GMTK) and its notion of dynamic graphical models, one
that slightly extends the standard notion of a DBN. We next introduce the
'boundary algorithm', a method to find the best boundary between partitions in
a dynamic model. We find that using this algorithm, the notions of forward- and
backward-interface become moot - namely, the size and fill-in of the best
forward- and backward- interface are identical. Moreover, we observe that
finding a good partition boundary allows for constrained elimination orders
(and therefore graph triangulations) that are not possible using standard
slice-by-slice constrained eliminations. More interestingly, with certain
boundaries it is possible to obtain constrained elimination schemes that lie
outside the space of possible triangulations using only unconstrained
elimination. Lastly, we report triangulation results on invented graphs,
standard DBNs from the literature, novel DBNs used in speech recognition
research systems, and also random graphs. Using a number of different
triangulation quality measures (max clique size, state-space, etc.), we find
that with our boundary algorithm the triangulation quality can dramatically
improve.

thus requiring inference whose complexity is exponential in w. In this paper,
we investigate performance of w-cutset sampling over a range of w values and
measure the accuracy of w-cutset sampling as a function of w. Our experiments
demonstrate that the cutset sampling idea is quite powerful showing that an

large number of tiny, cheap computational devices physically distributed in an

One of the central questions in sensor networks is what to do with the data,
i.e., how to reason with it and how to communicate it. This paper argues that
the lessons of the UAI community, in particular that one should produce and
communicate beliefs rather than raw sensor values, are highly relevant to
sensor networks. We contend that loopy belief propagation is particularly well
suited to communicating beliefs in sensor networks, due to its compact
implementation and distributed nature. We investigate the ability of loopy
belief propagation to function under the stressful conditions likely to prevail
in sensor networks. Our experiments show that it performs well and degrades
gracefully. It converges to appropriate beliefs even in highly asynchronous
settings where some nodes communicate far less frequently than others; it
continues to function if some nodes fail to participate in the propagation
process; and it can track changes in the environment that occur while beliefs
are propagating. As a result, we believe that sensor networks present an
important application opportunity for UAI.

Empirical study over two datasets of movie ratings shows that appropriate
modeling of the distinction between user preferences and ratings improves the
performance substantially and consistently. Specifically, the proposed

variables while preserving their most relevant characteristics is fundamental
for the analysis of complex data. Specifically, given a co-occurrence matrix of
two variables, one often seeks a compact representation of one variable which
preserves information about the other variable. We have recently introduced
``Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction' [GT-2003], a method that extracts
continuous reduced dimensional features whose measurements (i.e., expectation
values) capture maximal mutual information among the variables. However, such
measurements often capture information that is irrelevant for a given task.
Widely known examples are illumination conditions, which are irrelevant as
features for face recognition, writing style which is irrelevant as a feature
for content classification, and intonation which is irrelevant as a feature for
speech recognition. Such irrelevance cannot be deduced apriori, since it
depends on the details of the task, and is thus inherently ill defined in the
purely unsupervised case. Separating relevant from irrelevant features can be
achieved using additional side data that contains such irrelevant structures.
This approach was taken in [CT-2002], extending the information bottleneck
method, which uses clustering to compress the data. Here we use this
side-information framework to identify features whose measurements are
maximally informative for the original data set, but carry as little
information as possible on a side data set. In statistical terms this can be
understood as extracting statistics which are maximally sufficient for the

undirected models offer complementary properties in model construction,
expressing conditional independencies, expressing arbitrary factorizations of
joint distributions, and formulating message-passing inference algorithms. We
show that the strengths of these two representations can be combined in a
single type of graphical model called a 'factor graph'. Every Bayesian network
or MRF can be easily converted to a factor graph that expresses the same
conditional independencies, expresses the same factorization of the joint
distribution, and can be used for probabilistic inference through application
of a single, simple message-passing algorithm. In contrast to chain graphs,
where message-passing is implemented on a hypergraph, message-passing can be
directly implemented on the factor graph. We describe a modified 'Bayes-ball'
algorithm for establishing conditional independence in factor graphs, and we
show that factor graphs form a strict superset of Bayesian networks and MRFs.
In particular, we give an example of a commonly-used 'mixture of experts' model
fragment, whose independencies cannot be represented in a Bayesian network or
an MRF, but can be represented in a factor graph. We finish by giving examples

probabilities, or MPE (a special case of MAP), the time and space complexity of
structural solutions for MAP are not only exponential in the network treewidth,
but in a larger parameter known as the ""constrained"" treewidth. In practice,
this means that computing MAP can be orders of magnitude more expensive than
computing posterior probabilities or MPE. This paper introduces a new, simple
upper bound on the probability of a MAP solution, which admits a tradeoff
between the bound quality and the time needed to compute it. The bound is shown
to be generally much tighter than those of other methods of comparable
complexity. We use this proposed upper bound to develop a branch-and-bound

the search algorithm is able to solve many problems that are far beyond the

from the General Systems Problem Solving developed by G. Klir. It is a data
driven methodology based on systems behavior rather than on structural
knowledge. It is a very useful tool for both the modeling and the prediction of
those systems for which no previous structural knowledge is available. FIR
reasoning is based on pattern rules synthesized from the available data. The
size of the pattern rule base can be very large making the prediction process
quite difficult. In order to reduce the size of the pattern rule base, it is
possible to automatically extract classical Sugeno fuzzy rules starting from
the set of pattern rules. The Sugeno rule base preserves pattern rules
knowledge as much as possible. In this process some information is lost but
robustness is considerably increased. In the forecasting process either the
pattern rule base or the Sugeno fuzzy rule base can be used. The first option
is desirable when the computational resources make it possible to deal with the
overall pattern rule base or when the extracted fuzzy rules are not accurate
enough due to uncertainty associated to the original data. In the second
option, the prediction process is done by means of the classical Sugeno
inference system. If the amount of uncertainty associated to the data is small,
the predictions obtained using the Sugeno fuzzy rule base will be very
accurate. In this paper a mixed pattern/fuzzy rules strategy is proposed to
deal with uncertainty in such a way that the best of both perspectives is used.
Areas in the data space with a higher level of uncertainty are identified by
means of the so-called error models. The prediction process in these areas
makes use of a mixed pattern/fuzzy rules scheme, whereas areas identified with
a lower level of uncertainty only use the Sugeno fuzzy rule base. The proposed
strategy is applied to a real biomedical system, i.e., the central nervous
system control of the cardiovascular system.

consistency and uniform consistency. Uniform consistency is in general
preferred to pointwise consistency because the former allows us to control the
worst case error bounds with a finite sample size. In the sense of pointwise
consistency, several reliable causal inference algorithms have been established

been used in information filtering applications. Both approaches have their
strengths and weaknesses which is why researchers have developed hybrid
systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to unify CF and CBF in a
probabilistic framework, named collaborative ensemble learning. It uses
probabilistic SVMs to model each user's profile (as CBF does).At the prediction
phase, it combines a society OF users profiles, represented by their respective
SVM models, to predict an active users preferences(the CF idea).The combination
scheme is embedded in a probabilistic framework and retains an intuitive
explanation.Moreover, collaborative ensemble learning does not require a global
training stage and thus can incrementally incorporate new data.We report
results based on two data sets. For the Reuters-21578 text data set, we
simulate user ratings under the assumption that each user is interested in only
one category. In the second experiment, we use users' opinions on a set of 642
art images that were collected through a web-based survey. For both data sets,
collaborative ensemble achieved excellent performance in terms of
recommendation accuracy.

diagnosis of a system, data mining, clustering and so on. In spite of their

clarified, because the models are nonidentifiable and non-regular. In a
Bayesian network, the set of its parameter for a smaller model is an analytic
set with singularities in the space of large ones. Because of these
singularities, the Fisher information matrices are not positive definite. In
other words, the mathematical foundation for learning was not constructed. In
recent years, however, we have developed a method to analyze non-regular models
using algebraic geometry. This method revealed the relation between the models
singularities and its statistical properties. In this paper, applying this
method to Bayesian networks with latent variables, we clarify the order of the
stochastic complexities.Our result claims that the upper bound of those is
smaller than the dimension of the parameter space. This means that the Bayesian
generalization error is also far smaller than that of regular model, and that
Schwarzs model selection criterion BIC needs to be improved for Bayesian

optimization equations and unclear inference quality in various models, it is
not widely used as a generic approximate inference algorithm. In this paper, we
discuss a generalized mean field theory on variational approximation to a broad
class of intractable distributions using a rich set of tractable distributions
via constrained optimization over distribution spaces. We present a class of
generalized mean field (GMF) algorithms for approximate inference in complex
exponential family models, which entails limiting the optimization over the
class of cluster-factorizable distributions. GMF is a generic method requiring
no model-specific derivations. It factors a complex model into a set of
disjoint variable clusters, and uses a set of canonical fix-point equations to
iteratively update the cluster distributions, and converge to locally optimal
cluster marginals that preserve the original dependency structure within each
cluster, hence, fully decomposed the overall inference problem. We empirically
analyzed the effect of different tractable family (clusters of different
granularity) on inference quality, and compared GMF with BP on several
canonical models. Possible extension to higher-order MF approximation is also
discussed.

This is a difficult decision problem, requiring the probability of being
outside of the current known map. To estimate this probability, we model the
structure of a ""typical"" environment as a hidden Markov model that generates
sequences of views observed by a robot navigating through the environment. A
Dirichlet prior over structural models is learned from previously explored
environments. Whenever a robot explores a new environment, the posterior over
the model is estimated by Dirichlet hyperparameters. Our approach is
implemented and tested in the context of multi-robot map merging, a
particularly difficult instance of the revisiting problem. Experiments with

computational and statistical reasons, to identify a good model. In this paper,
we consider a solution to this problem, suitable for domains where many
variables have similar behavior. Our method is based on a new class of models,
which we call module networks. A module network explicitly represents the
notion of a module - a set of variables that have the same parents in the
network and share the same conditional probability distribution. We define the
semantics of module networks, and describe an algorithm that learns a module
network from data. The algorithm learns both the partitioning of the variables
into modules and the dependency structure between the variables. We evaluate
our algorithm on synthetic data, and on real data in the domains of gene

generalize better than Bayesian networks, and that the learned module network

important limitation of traditional Bayesian networks is that they are
propositional, and thus cannot represent relations between multiple similar
objects in multiple contexts. Several researchers have thus proposed
first-order languages to describe such networks. Namely, one very successful
example of this approach are the Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs), that
combine Bayesian networks with relational database technology. The key
difficulty that we had to address when designing CLP(cal{BN}) is that logic
based representations use ground terms to denote objects. With probabilitic
data, we need to be able to uniquely represent an object whose value we are not
sure about. We use {sl Skolem functions} as unique new symbols that uniquely
represent objects with unknown value. The semantics of CLP(cal{BN}) programs
then naturally follow from the general framework of constraint logic
programming, as applied to a specific domain where we have probabilistic data.
This paper introduces and defines CLP(cal{BN}), and it describes an
