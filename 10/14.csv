that redistribution can lead to sustainable growth in a society. The human
capital dynamics of each agent is described by a stochastic multiplicative
process which, in the long run, leads to the destruction of individual human
capital and the extinction of the individualistic society. When agents are
linked by fully-redistributive taxation the situation might turn to individual
growth in the long run. We consider that a government collects a proportion of
income and reduces it by a fraction as costs for administration (efficiency
losses). The remaining public good is equally redistributed to all agents. We
derive conditions under which the destruction of human capital can be turned
into sustainable growth, despite the losses from the random growth process and
despite the administrative costs. Sustainable growth is induced by
redistribution. This effect could be explained by a simple portfolio-effect
which re-balances individual stochastic processes.
  The findings are verified for three different tax schemes: proportional tax,
taking proportional more from the rich, and proportionally more from the poor.
We discuss which of these tax schemes is optimal with respect to maximize
growth under a fixed rate of administrative costs, or with respect to maximize
the governmental income. This leads us to some general conclusions about
governmental decisions, the relation to public good games, and the use of
taxation in a risk taking society.

constant-round concurrent zero-knowledge protocols in the plain model.
Resolving this question is known to require non-black-box techniques.
  We consider non-black-box techniques for zero-knowledge based on knowledge
assumptions, a line of thinking initiated by the work of Hada and Tanaka
(CRYPTO 1998). Prior to our work, it was not known whether knowledge
assumptions could be used for achieving security in the concurrent setting, due
to a number of significant limitations that we discuss here. Nevertheless, we
obtain the following results:
  1. We obtain the first constant round concurrent zero-knowledge argument for
\textbf{NP} in the plain model based on a new variant of knowledge of exponent
assumption. Furthermore, our construction avoids the inefficiency inherent in
previous non-black-box techniques such that those of Barak (FOCS 2001); we
obtain our result through an efficient protocol compiler.
  2. Unlike Hada and Tanaka, we do not require a knowledge assumption to argue
the soundness of our protocol. Instead, we use a discrete log like assumption,
which we call Diffie-Hellman Logarithm Assumption, to prove the soundness of
our protocol.
  3. We give evidence that our new variant of knowledge of exponent assumption
is in fact plausible. In particular, we show that our assumption holds in the
generic group model.
  4. Knowledge assumptions are especially delicate assumptions whose
plausibility may be hard to gauge. We give a novel framework to express
knowledge assumptions in a more flexible way, which may allow for formulation
of plausible assumptions and exploration of their impact and application in
cryptography.

(a) a steady increase in the number of references per article over the period

while in others reflects longer articles and (b) an increase in all fields in
the fraction of older, foundational references since the 1980s, with no obvious

the meso level we explore current (2006-2010) referencing behavior of different
categories of authors (21,562 total) within each field, based on their academic
age, productivity and collaborative practices. Contrary to some previous
findings and expectations we find that senior researchers use references at the

same references in multiple papers). High Modified Price Index (MPI, which
measures the speed of the research front more accurately than the traditional

productive researchers and especially those who collaborate more use a
significantly lower fraction of foundational references and have much higher
MPI and lower re-citation rates, i.e., they are the ones pushing the research

sub-clusters experience core collapse much earlier than virialized
solo-clusters, which have similar properties of the merger remnant of the
assembling clusters. As a consequence it seems that the assembling clusters
result in efficient multiple collisions of stars in the cluster core. We
performed a series of $N$-body simulations of ensemble and solitary clusters
including stellar collisions and found that the efficiency of multiple
collisions between stars are suppressed if sub-clusters assemble after they
experience core collapse individually. In this case, sub-clusters form their
own multiple collision stars which experienced a few collisions, but they fail
to collide with each other after their host sub-clusters assemble. The multiple
collision stars scatter each other and escape, and furthermore the central
density of the remnant clusters had already been depleted for the stars to
experience more collisions. On the other hand, if sub-clusters assemble before
they experience core collapse, the multiple collisions of stars proceed
efficiently in the remnant cluster, and the collision products are more massive
than virialized solo-clusters and comparable in mass to cold solo-clusters.

droplets composed by a mixture of water and surfactant (SDS, Sodium Dodecyl

  When a droplet is released on a plate heated above a given temperature a thin
layer of vapor isolates the droplet from the plate. The droplet levitates over
the plate. This is called the Leidenfrost effect.
  In this work we study the influence of the addition of a surfactant on the
Leidenfrost phenomenon. As the droplet evaporates the concentration of SDS
rises up to two orders of magnitude over the Critical Micelle Concentration
(CMC). An unexpected and violent explosive behavior is observed. The video
presents several explosions taken with a high speed camera (IDT-N4 at 30000
fps). All the presented experiments were performed on a plate heated at
300{\deg}C. On the other hand, the initial quantity of SDS was tuned in two
ways: (i) by varying the initial concentration of SDS and (ii) by varying the
initial size of the droplet. By measuring the volume of the droplet just before
the explosion, we were able to estimate the final concentration of SDS. We
found that the explosion always occurs around a critical concentration, about
100 times the CMC.
  The droplets have also been studied just before the explosion. By isolating
the droplet on a cold plate just before the explosion, we evidenced the
presence of a shell surrounding a liquid core.
  We conclude that above a critical concentration a solid shell is formed. This
leads to an increase of pressure into the droplet until the shell breaks. The
release of the pressure is accompanied by a violent explosion, and in some
cases foaming.

clustered version of \er random graphs with clusters $V_1, V_2,..., V_k$ where
the probability $p$, of an edge connecting nodes within a cluster $V_i$ is
higher than $p'$, the probability of an edge connecting nodes in distinct

O(p^2)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes), \textsc{Max-LPA} detects the

results, we conjecture that \textsc{Max-LPA} can correctly and quickly identify

mesons in nuclei, in this paper we present a short review of recent
developments concerning the interaction of vector mesons with baryons and with
nuclei from a modern perspective using the local hidden gauge formalism for the
interaction of vector mesons. We present results for the vector baryon
interaction and in particular for the resonances which appear as composite
states, dynamically generated from the interaction of vector mesons with
baryons, taking also the mixing of these states with pseudoscalars and baryons
into account. We then venture into the charm sector, reporting on hidden charm
baryon states around 4400 MeV, generated from the interaction of vector mesons
and baryons with charm, which have a strong repercussion on the properties of
the $J/\Psi N$ interaction.
  We also address the interaction of $K^*$ with nuclei and make suggestions to
measure the predicted huge width in the medium by means of the transparency
ratio. The formalism is extended to study the phenomenon of $J/\psi$
suppression in nuclei via $J/\psi$ photoproduction reactions.

control policies for controllable nonlinear diffusion processes, with the goal
of obtaining maximally-informative observations about parameters of interest.
More precisely, we maximize the expected Fisher information for the parameter
obtained over the duration of the experiment, conditional on observations made
up to that time. We propose to accomplish this with a two-step strategy: when
the full state vector of the diffusion process is observable continuously, we
formulate this as an optimal control problem and apply numerical techniques
from stochastic optimal control to solve it. When observations are incomplete,
infrequent, or noisy, we propose using standard filtering techniques to first
estimate the state of the system, then apply the optimal control policy using
the posterior expectation of the state. We assess the effectiveness of these
methods in 3 situations: a paradigmatic bistable model from statistical
physics, a model of action potential generation in neurons, and a model of a
simple ecological system.

temporal correlations. While sparse coding has been proposed as an efficient
strategy employed by neural systems to encode sensory stimuli, the underlying
mechanisms are still not well understood. Most previous approaches model the
neural dynamics by the sparse representation dictionary itself and compute the
representation coefficients offline. In reality, faced with the challenge of
constantly changing stimuli, neurons must compute the sparse representations
dynamically in an online fashion. Here, we describe a leaky linearized Bregman
iteration (LLBI) algorithm which computes the time varying sparse
representations using a biologically motivated network of leaky rectifying
neurons. Compared to previous attempt of dynamic sparse coding, LLBI exploits
the temporal correlation of stimuli and demonstrate better performance both in
representation error and the smoothness of temporal evolution of sparse
coefficients.

  simulations",,,"10.1016/j.jcp.2013.03.006",,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Common time-explicit numerical methods for kinetic simulations of plasmas in
the low-collisions limit fall into two classes of algorithms: momentum
conserving and energy conserving. Each has certain drawbacks. The PIC algorithm
does not conserve total energy, which may lead to spurious numerical heating
(grid heating). Its overall accuracy is at most second due to the nature of the
force interpolation between grid and particle position. Energy-conserving
algorithms do not exhibit grid heating, but because their formulation uses
potentials, computationally undesirable matrix inversions may be necessary. In
addition, compared to PIC algorithms for the same accuracy, these algorithms
have higher numerical noise due to the restricted choice of particle shapes.
Here we formulate time-explicit, finite-size particle algorithms using
particular reductions of the particle distribution function. These reductions
are used in two variational principles, a Lagrangian-based and a
Hamiltonian-based in conjunction with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The
Lagrangian formulations here generalize previous such formulations. The
Hamiltonian formulation is presented here for the first time. Many drawbacks of
the two classes of particle methods are mitigated. For example, restrictions on
particle shapes are relaxed in energy conserving algorithms, which allows to
decrease the numerical noise in these methods. The Hamiltonian formulation of
particle algorithms is done in terms of fields instead of potentials, thus
avoiding solving Poisson's equation. An algorithm that conserves both energy
and momentum is presented. Other features of the algorithms include a natural
way to perform coordinate transformations, the use of various time integrating
methods, and the ability to increase the overall accuracy beyond second order,
including all generalizations.

allowed parameter space the SM-like Higgs boson can easily be 125 GeV in the

(ii) The di-photon Higgs signal rate in the nMSSM and constrained MSSM is

enhanced in the MSSM and NMSSM; (iii) The NMSSM may allow for a lighter
top-squark than the MSSM, which can thus ameliorate the fine-tuning problem.

the bottle with an open hand, causing the bottom of the bottle to break open.
We investigate the source of the catastrophic cracking through the use of
high-speed video and an accelerometer. Upon closer inspection, it is obvious
that the acceleration caused by hitting the top of the bottle is followed by
the formation of bubbles near the bottom. The nearly instantaneous acceleration
creates an area of low pressure on the bottom of the bottle where cavitation
bubbles form. Moments later, the cavitation bubbles collapse at roughly 10
times the speed of formation, causing the bottle to break. The accelerometer
data shows that the bottle is broken after the bubbles collapse and that the
magnitude of the bubble collapse is greater than the initial impact. This fluid
dynamics video highlights that this trick will not work if the bottle is empty
nor if it is filled with a carbonated fluid because the vapor bubbles fill with
the CO2 dissolved in the liquid, preventing the bubbles from collapsing. A
modified cavitation number, including the acceleration of the fluid (a), vapor
pressure (Pv), and depth of the fluid column (h), is derived to determine when
cavity inception occurs. Through experimentation, visible cavitation bubbles
form when the cavitation number is less than 0.5. The experiments, based on the
modified cavitation number, reveal that the easiest way to break a glass bottle
with your bare hands is to fill it with a non-carbonated, high vapor pressure
fluid, and strike it hard.

nature, has been formulated as a gauge theory of the Weyl-Cartan-Yang-Mills
type. The present text offers commentaries on the articles from the most
prominent proponents of the theory. In the early 1960s, the gauge idea was
successfully applied to the Poincar\'e group of spacetime symmetries and to the
related conserved energy-momentum and angular momentum currents. The resulting
theory, the Poincar\'e gauge theory, encompasses Einstein's general relativity
as well as the teleparallel theory of gravity as subcases. The spacetime
structure is enriched by Cartan's torsion, and the new theory can accommodate
fermionic matter and its spin in a perfectly natural way. This guided tour
starts from special relativity and leads, in its first part, to general
relativity and its gauge type extensions \`a la Weyl and Cartan. Subsequent
stopping points are the theories of Yang-Mills and Utiyama and, as a particular
vantage point, the theory of Sciama and Kibble. Later, the Poincar\'e gauge
theory and its generalizations are explored and special topics, such as its
Hamiltonian formulation and exact solutions, are studied. This guide to the
literature on classical gauge theories of gravity is intended to be a
stimulating introduction to the subject.

transforming the observations signals into an adequate representation using

both exhibit a continuous transition. Here we show that the order of the
transition where ensemble inequivalence may occur is related to the symmetry

the magnitude of the superconducting gap within the large hole pocket is
relatively small and angle dependent, we interpret the INS data in the
superconducting state as a renormalization of the particle-hole continuum

be reasonably well described by both the sign changing symmetry of the

which so far has been established only for the fully-connected infinite-range
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising spin-glass model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 1034
(1999)]. Here we study both avalanche and magnetization jump distributions
triggered by an external magnetic field, as well as internal field
distributions in the short-range Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass for various
space dimensions between 2 and 8, as well as the fixed-connectivity mean-field
Viana-Bray model. Our numerical results, obtained on systems of unprecedented
size, demonstrate that self-organized criticality is recovered only in the
strict limit of a diverging number of neighbors, and is not a generic property
of spin-glass models in finite space dimensions.

recorded a pellet passing through a soap bubble. We investigate the dynamics
that allow for a rigid body to pass through a hemispherical soap film without
rupturing it. In this fluid dynamics video spheres were dropped from rest above
a hemispherical soap film. At impact, the soap film stretches into a cavity
around the sphere. As the sphere continues to descend, the film cavity pinches
off and the film returns to its initial hemispherical shape. Upon closer
observation of the film-sphere-air interface, the stability of the soap film
appears to arise through a balance between the forces of the sphere inertia and
the film tension. Therefore the relevant experimental parameter is the Weber
number: We=rho*2*g*h*R*sigma, where R is the sphere radius and h is the height
that the sphere is dropped from. We vary the sphere radius and velocity to
provide a range of Weber numbers in order to investigate the dependence of film
stability. Three subtly distinct regimes arise across the observed experimental
range of Weber numbers. The first regime is demonstrated (We<3200) by a cavity
shape that resembles a catenoid which pinches off both near the sphere and the
hemispherical surface. The second regime is demonstrated (3200<We<6100) by a
uniformly narrowing cavity resembling an inverted cone that pinches off near
the sphere. The third regime initially appears similar to the second but the
greater sphere inertia (6100<We) elongates the cavity shape and causes
pinch-off and cavity collapse to be non-uniform in nature.

GMCs in total, based on wide field and high sensitivity CO(J=3-2) observations
with a spatial resolution of 100 pc using the ASTE 10 m telescope. Employing
archival optical data, we identify 75 young stellar groups (YSGs) from the
excess of the surface stellar density, and estimate their ages by comparing
with stellar evolution models. A spatial comparison among the GMCs, YSGs, and
HII regions enable us to classify GMCs into four categories: Type A showing no
sign of massive star formation (SF), Type B being associated only with HII
regions, Type C with both HII regions and <10 Myr-old YSGs and Type-D with both
HII regions and 10--30 Myr YSGs. Out of 65 GMCs (discarding those at the edges
of the observed fields), 1 (1%), 13 (20%), 29 (45%), and 22 (34%) are Types A,
B, C, and D, respectively. We interpret these categories as stages in a GMC
evolutionary sequence. Assuming that the timescale for each evolutionary stage
is proportional to the number of GMCs, the lifetime of a GMC with a mass >10^5
Mo is estimated to be 20--40 Myr. In addition, we find that the dense gas
fraction as traced by the CO(J=3-2)/CO(J=1-0) ratio is enhanced around SF
regions. This confirms a scenario where dense gas is preferentially formed
around previously generated stars, and will be the fuel for the next stellar
generation. In this way, massive SF gradually propagates in a GMC until gas is
exhausted.

family of all odd cycles of length at most $k$ and let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the
family of all odd cycles. Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits \cite{ESi1} conjectured that
for every family $\mathcal{F}$ of bipartite graphs, there exists $k$ such that
$\ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{C}_k} \sim \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup
\mathcal{C}}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. This conjecture was proved by
Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits when $\mathcal{F} = \{C_4\}$, and for certain families
of even cycles in \cite{KSV}. In this paper, we give a general approach to the
conjecture using Scott's sparse regularity lemma. Our approach proves the
conjecture for complete bipartite graphs $K_{2,t}$ and $K_{3,3}$: we obtain
more strongly that for any odd $k \geq 5$, \[ \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \{C_k\}}
\sim \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{C}}\] and we show further that the
extremal graphs can be made bipartite by deleting very few edges. In contrast,
this formula does not extend to triangles -- the case $k = 3$ -- and we give an
algebraic construction for odd $t \geq 3$ of $K_{2,t}$-free $C_3$-free graphs
with substantially more edges than an extremal $K_{2,t}$-free bipartite graph
on $n$ vertices. Our general approach to the Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits conjecture is
effective based on some reasonable assumptions on the maximum number of edges
in an $m$ by $n$ bipartite $\mathcal{F}$-free graph.

cosmological constant problem - Phys. Rev. D82 (2010) 044006. One of the
elements of the solution is the chameleonic behaviour of the Einstein frame
dilaton: the mass of the dilaton is an increasing function of the matter
density. In that model, a proper structure of the string-frame form factors in
the strong coupling region of string theory is assumed. In particular, a
stabilizing potential of the string frame dilaton is present and it is supposed
to be the result of a quantum calculation. Our main purpose in this article is
to point out that the lagrangian of the chameleonic model for the dilaton can
be embedded, to a large extent, in heterotic-M-theory. We illustrate some
theoretical grounds that support the ansatz about the form factors. In this
paper, we break bulk supersymmetry with a massive sterile spinor field (i.e. a
bulk neutrino field) and, under certain assumptions about the full M-theory
action, we point out the Casimir origin of the stabilizing potential for the
string frame dilaton (particular attention is dedicated to the role of the
conformal transformations involved). Moreover, we point out the similarity
between the string frame dark matter lagrangian and a Ginzburg-Landau
lagrangian with sterile neutrino pairs playing the role of dark matter
particles. However, more research efforts are necessary to connect the bulk
spinor (neutrino) lagrangian with the Ginzburg-Landau lagrangian through direct
calculations. A phenomenological test of these ideas is definitely required.
