at the insulator metal transition (IMT). Discontinuous jumps to lower voltages
in the current voltage characteristic (IV) followed by an approximately
constant voltage progression for high currents indicate an electrical breakdown
of the device. In addition, the IV curve shows hysteresis and a training
effect, i.e. the subsequent IV loops are different from the first IV loop after
thermal cycling. Low temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) reveals
that the electrical breakdown over the whole device is caused by the formation
of electro-thermal domains (ETDs), i.e. the current and temperature
redistribution in the device. On the contrary, at the nanoscale, the electrical
breakdown causes the IMT of individual domains. In a numerical model we
considered these domains as a network of resistors and we were able to
reproduce the electro-thermal breakdown as well as the hysteresis and the
training effect in the IVs.

  Given a closed spin manifold M with fundamental group G, Stephan Stolz
introduced the positive scalar curvature exact sequence, in analogy to the
surgery exact sequence in topology. It calculates a structure group of metrics
of positive scalar curvature on M (the object we want to understand) in terms
of spin-bordism of BG and a somewhat mysterious group R(G).
  Higson and Roe introduced a K-theory exact sequence in coarse geometry which
contains the Baum-Connes assembly map, with one crucial term K(D*G) canonically
associated to G. The K-theory groups in question are the home of interesting
index invariants and secondary invariants, in particular the rho-class in
K_*(D*G) of a metric of positive scalar curvature on a spin manifold.
  One of our main results is the construction of a map from the Stolz exact
sequence to the Higson-Roe exact sequence (commuting with all arrows), using
coarse index theory throughout.
  Our main tool are two index theorems, which we believe to be of independent
interest. The first is an index theorem of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer type. Here,
assume that Y is a compact spin manifold with boundary, with a Riemannian
metric g which is of positive scalar curvature when restricted to the boundary
(and with fundamental group G). Because the Dirac operator on the boundary is
invertible, one constructs a delocalized APS-index in K_* (D*G). We then show
that this class equals the rho-class of the boundary.
  The second theorem equates a partitioned manifold rho-class of a positive
scalar curvature metric to the rho-class of the partitioning hypersurface.

attracted much attention over the last two decades: in particular, for the

the constraint satisfaction problem and the quantified constraint satisfaction
problem, respectively. These two fragments are in fact the only ones for which
there is currently no known complexity classification. All other syntactic
fragments can be easily classified, either directly or using Schaefer's
dichotomy theorems for SAT and QSAT, with the exception of the positive
equality free fragment. This outstanding fragment can also be classified and
enjoys a tetrachotomy: according to the model, the corresponding model checking
problem is either tractable, NP-complete, co-NP-complete or Pspace-complete.
Moreover, the complexity drop is always witnessed by a generic solving
algorithm which uses quantifier relativisation. Furthermore, its complexity is
characterised by algebraic means: the presence or absence of specific
surjective hyper-operations among those that preserve the model characterise
the complexity.

Three body collisions between carriers and both phonons and impurities are

they should emerge in relaxation processes as they allow for large energy
transfers. As pointed out in Ref. \onlinecite{Song2012PRL}, this is the case in
undoped graphene where the small Fermi surface drastically restricts the
allowed phonon energy in ordinary collisions. Using electrical heating and
sensitive noise thermometry we report on SC-cooling in diffusive monolayer
graphene. At low carrier density and high phonon temperature the Joule power
$P$ obeys a $P\propto T_e^3$ law as a function of electronic temperature $T_e$.
It overrules the linear law expected for ordinary collisions which has recently
been observed in resistivity measurements. The cubic law is characteristic of

graphene below the Bloch-Gr\""{u}neisen temperature. These supercollisions are
important for applications of graphene in bolometry and photo-detection.

Their performance is tested on the total and high occupied orbital energies, as
well as the electric moments of selected diatomic molecules. The new
functionals, along with the Hartree-Fock and non-hybrid functionals, are
employed for finite-difference calculations, which are basis-independent. Basis
set errors in the total energy and electric moments are calculated for the
6-311G, 6-311G++G(3df,3pd) and AUG-cc-pVnZ (n=3,4,6) basis sets used in
conjunction with the Hartree-Fock and conventional density functional methods.
A comparison between the results of the finite-difference local ""hybrid"" and
basis set nonlocal hybrid functional shows that total energies of local and
nonlocal hybrid functionals agree to within the basis set error. Discrepancies
for multipole moments are larger in magnitude when compared to the basis set
errors, but still reasonably small (smaller than errors produced by the 6-311G
basis set). Thus, we recommend using the new local ""hybrid"" functionals
whenever the accuracy is expected to be sufficient, because they require a
solution of just differential Kohn-Sham equations, instead of
integro-differential ones in the case of hybrid functionals.

sub-structures of permutations, called sub-permutations, bijectively map to
sub-trees of binary increasing trees. This opens a powerful tool set to study
enumerative and probabilistic properties of sub-permutations and to investigate
the relationships between 'local' and 'global' features using the concept of
pattern avoidance. First, given a pattern {\mu}, we study how the avoidance of
{\mu} in a permutation {\pi} affects the presence of other patterns in the
sub-permutations of {\pi}. More precisely, considering patterns of length 3, we
solve instances of the following problem: given a class of permutations K and a
pattern {\mu}, we ask for the number of permutations $\pi \in Av_n(\mu)$ whose
sub-permutations in K satisfy certain additional constraints on their size.
Second, we study the probability for a generic pattern to be contained in a
random permutation {\pi} of size n without being present in the
sub-permutations of {\pi} generated by the entry $1 \leq k \leq n$. These
theoretical results can be useful to define efficient randomized pattern-search
procedures based on classical algorithms of pattern-recognition, while the
general problem of pattern-search is NP-complete.

complex biological systems. However, despite the rich information embedded in
these networks, they face important data quality challenges of noise and
incompleteness that adversely affect the results obtained from their analysis.
Here, we explore the use of the concept of common neighborhood similarity
(CNS), which is a form of local structure in networks, to address these issues.
Although several CNS measures have been proposed in the literature, an
understanding of their relative efficacies for the analysis of interaction
networks has been lacking. We follow the framework of graph transformation to
convert the given interaction network into a transformed network corresponding
to a variety of CNS measures evaluated. The effectiveness of each measure is
then estimated by comparing the quality of protein function predictions
obtained from its corresponding transformed network with those from the
original network. Using a large set of S. cerevisiae interactions, and a set of
136 GO terms, we find that several of the transformed networks produce more
accurate predictions than those obtained from the original network. In
particular, the $HC.cont$ measure proposed here performs particularly well for
this task. Further investigation reveals that the two major factors
contributing to this improvement are the abilities of CNS measures, especially
$HC.cont$, to prune out noisy edges and introduce new links between
functionally related proteins.

in which the low energy supersymmetric theory contains the particle content of
three 27 dimensional representations of the underlying E6 gauge group, plus two
extra right-handed neutrinos predicted from F and D flatness. The resulting TeV
scale effective theory resembles either the E6SSM or the NMSSM+, depending on
whether an additional Abelian gauge group does or does not survive. However
there are novel features compared to both these models as follows: (i) If the
additional Abelian gauge group is unbroken then it can have a weaker gauge
coupling than in the E6SSM; (ii) If the additional Abelian gauge group is
broken then non-perturbative effects can violate the scale invariance of the
NMSSM+ leading to a generalised model; (iii) Unification is achieved not at the
field theory level but at the F-theory level since the gauge couplings are
split by flux effects, negating the need for any additional doublet states
which are usually required; (iv) Proton decay is suppressed by the geometric
coupling suppression of a singlet state, a mechanism peculiar to F-theory,
which effectively suppresses the coupling of the exotic charge -1/3 colour

leptoquarks, providing characteristic and striking signatures at the LHC.

atmosphere models are often not capable of fully explaining the spectra and
luminosity of the sources. A particularly challenging component of the
atmosphere models is the formation and properties of condensate cloud layers,
which fundamentally impact the energetics, opacity, and evolution of the
planets.
  Here we present a suite of techniques that can be used to estimate the level
of rotational modulations these planets may show. We propose that the
time--resolved observations of such periodic photometric and spectroscopic
variations of extrasolar planets due to their rotation can be used as a
powerful tool to probe the heterogeneity of their optical surfaces. We address
and discuss the following questions: a) what planet properties can be deduced
from the light curve and/or spectra, and in particular can we determine
rotation periods, spot--coverage, spot colors, spot spectra; b) what is the
optimal configuration of instrument/wavelength/temporal sampling required for
these measurements; and, c) can principal component analysis be used to invert
the light curve and deduce the surface map of the planet.
  Our simulations describe the expected spectral differences between
homogeneous (clear or cloudy) and patchy atmospheres, outline the significance
of the dominant absorption features of water, methane, and CO and provide a
method to distinguish these two types of atmospheres. Simulated photometry from
current and future instruments is used to estimate the level of detectable
photometric variations. We conclude that future instruments will be able to
recover not only the rotation periods, cloud cover, cloud colors and spectra
but even cloud evolution. We also show that a longitudinal map of the planet's
atmosphere can be deduced from its disk--integrated light curves.

cyclomatic number. Let H be a graph of order p >= 4 and cyclomatic number v(H)

in n: If H has cyclomatic number v(H) = 1; then rb(Kn;H) is linear in n: We

between subsystems and propose a distributed control scheme capable to
guarantee asymptotic stability and satisfaction of constraints on system inputs

enables plug-and-play (PnP) operations, meaning that (i) the addition or
removal of subsystems triggers the design of local controllers associated to
successors to the subsystem only and (ii) the synthesis of a local controller
for a subsystem requires information only from predecessors of the subsystem
and it can be performed using only local computational resources. Our method
hinges on local tube MPC controllers based on robust control invariant sets and
it advances the PnP design procedure proposed in Riverso et al., 2012 in
several directions. Quite notably, using recent results in the computation of
robust control invariant sets, we show how critical steps in the design of a
local controller can be solved through linear programming. Finally, an
application of the proposed control design procedure to frequency control in
power networks is presented.

An A-tms is a vector y indexed by elements in A. The A-truncated K-moment
problem (A-TKMP) studies whether a given A-tms y admits a K-measure or not.
This paper proposes a numerical algorithm for solving A-TKMPs. It is based on
finding a flat extension of y by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite
relaxations {(SDR)_k} for a moment optimization problem, whose objective R is
generated in a certain randomized way. If y admits no K-measures and R[x]_A is
K-full, then (SDR)_k is infeasible for all K big enough, which gives a
certificate for the nonexistence of representing measures. If y admits a
K-measure, then for almost all generated R, we prove that: i) we can
asymptotically get a flat extension of y by solving the hierarchy {(SDR)_k\};
ii) under a general condition that is almost sufficient and necessary, we can
get a flat extension of y by solving (SDR)_k for some k; this occurred in all
our numerical experiments; iii) the obtained flat extensions admit a r-atomic
K-measure with r <= |A|. The decomposition problems for completely positive
matrices and sums of even powers of real linear forms, and the standard
truncated K-moment problems, are special cases of A-TKMPs, and hence can be
solved numerically by this algorithm.

There remain profound open questions regarding the universality of observed
phenomena and the character of precursor fluctuations above the superconducting
(SC) transition temperature (T_c). For single-CuO_2-layer La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4
(LSCO) and Bi_2(Sr,La)_2CuO_{6+\delta} (Bi2201), some experiments seem to
indicate an onset of SC fluctuations at very high temperatures (2-3 times
T_c^{max}, the T_c value at optimal hole concentration p), whereas other
measurements suggest that fluctuations are confined to the immediate vicinity
of T_c(p). Here we use torque magnetization to resolve this conundrum by
systematically studying LSCO, Bi2201 and HgBa_2CuO_{4+\delta} (Hg1201). The
latter is a more ideal single-layer compound, featuring high structural
symmetry, minimal disorder, and T_c^{max} = 97 K, a value more than twice those
of LSCO and Bi2201. We find in all three cases that SC diamagnetism vanishes in
an unusual exponential fashion above T_c, and at a rapid rate that is
universal. Furthermore, the high characteristic fluctuation temperatures of
LSCO and Bi2201 closely track T_c(p) of Hg1201. These observations suggest
that, rather than being indicative of SC diamagnetism, the fluctuations at high
temperatures in the low-T_c^{max} compounds are associated with a competing
order. This picture is further supported by an analysis of available results
for double-layer cuprates.

the form $4n+3$ than of the form $4n+1$. The general phenomenon, which is
referred to as Chebyshev's bias, is that primes tend to be biased in their
distribution among the different residue classes $\bmod q$. It is known that
this phenomenon has a strong relation with the low-lying zeros of the
associated $L$-functions, that is if these $L$-functions have zeros close to
the real line, then it will result in a lower bias. According to this principle
one might believe that the most biased prime number race we will ever find is
the Li$(x)$ versus $\pi(x)$ race, since the Riemann zeta function is the
$L$-function of rank one having the highest first zero. This race has density
0.99999973..., and we study the question of whether this is the highest
possible density. We will show that it is not the case, in fact there exists
prime number races whose density can be arbitrarily close to 1. An example of
race whose density exceeds the above number is the race between quadratic
residues and non-residues modulo 4849845, for which the density is
0.999999928... We also give fairly general criteria to decide whether a prime
number race is highly biased or not. Our main result depends on the General
Riemann Hypothesis and on a hypothesis on the multiplicity of the zeros of a
certain Dedekind zeta function. We also derive more precise results under a
linear independence hypothesis.

evolution of cooperation in sizable groups. The multiplication factor in this
game can characterize the investment return from the public good, which may be
variable depending on the interactive environment in realistic situations.
Instead of using the same universal value, here we consider that the
multiplication factor in each group is updated based on the differences between
the local and global interactive environments in the spatial public goods game,
but meanwhile limited to within a certain range. We find that the adaptive and
bounded investment returns can significantly promote cooperation. In
particular, full cooperation can be achieved for high feedback strength when
appropriate limitation is set for the investment return. Also, we show that the
fraction of cooperators in the whole population can become larger if the lower
and upper limits of the multiplication factor are increased. Furthermore, in
comparison to the traditionally spatial public goods game where the
multiplication factor in each group is identical and fixed, we find that
cooperation can be better promoted if the multiplication factor is constrained
to adjust between one and the group size in our model. Our results highlight
the importance of the locally adaptive and bounded investment returns for the
emergence and dominance of cooperative behavior in structured populations.

In the literature, it has been extensively and successfully applied to various

this penalization principle to a linear regression model with a

an oracle property. However, the penalized estimators for the incidental

is an interesting partial consistency phenomenon: the structural parameters are
consistently estimated while the incidental ones cannot. For the structural
parameters, also considered is an alternative two-step penalized estimator,
which has fewer possible asymptotic distributions and thus is more suitable for
statistical inferences. We further extend the methods and results to the case
where the dimension of the structural parameter vector diverges with but slower

construction of correlators, via three-dimensional topological field theory,
satisfies the consistency conditions to oriented world sheets with defect
lines. We also derive a classifying algebra for defects. This is a semisimple
commutative associative algebra over the complex numbers whose one-dimensional
representations are in bijection with the topological defect lines of the
theory.
  Then we relax the semisimplicity condition of rational conformal field theory
and consider a larger class of categories, containing non-semisimple ones, that
is relevant for logarithmic conformal field theory. We obtain, for any
finite-dimensional factorizable ribbon Hopf algebra H, a family of symmetric
commutative Frobenius algebras in the category of bimodules over H. For any
such Frobenius algebra, which can be constructed as a coend, we associate to
any Riemann surface a morphism in the bimodule category. We prove that this
morphism is invariant under a projective action of the mapping class group of

correlators of bulk fields of a full conformal field theory whose chiral data

cliques such that each vertex is contained in at most k cliques. The smallest k
for which G admits a k-clique covering is called local clique cover number of G
and is denoted by $lcc(G)$. Local clique cover number can be viewed as the
local counterpart of the clique cover number which is equal to the minimum
total number of cliques covering all edges. In this paper, several aspects of
the problem are studied and its relationships to other well-known problems are
discussed. Moreover, the local clique cover number of claw-free graphs and its
subclasses are notably investigated. In particular, it is proved that local
clique cover number of every claw-free graph is at most $c\Delta / \log\Delta$,
where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph and $c$ is a universal
constant. It is also shown that the bound is tight, up to a constant factor.
Furthermore, it is established that local clique number of the linear interval
graphs is bounded by $\log\Delta + 1/2 \log \log\Delta + O(1)$. Finally, as a
by-product, a new Bollobas-type inequality is obtained for the intersecting

usually assumed just to provide a finite population size. Recently, however,
agent-based models have pointed out that resource limitation may modify the
original structure of the interactions and allow for the survival of
unconditional cooperators in well-mixed populations. Here, we present
analytical simplified versions of two types of agent-based models recently
published: one in which the limiting resource constrains the ability of
reproduction of individuals but not their survival, and a second one where the
limiting resource is necessary for both reproduction and survival. One finds
that the analytical models display, with a few differences, the same
qualitative behavior of the more complex agent-based models. In addition, the
analytical models allow us to expand the study and identify the dimensionless
parameters governing the final fate of the system, such as coexistence of
cooperators and defectors, or dominance of defectors or of cooperators. We

smallest integer r such that A can be written as A=UV where U is mxr and V is

Computing this quantity is NP-hard in general and it is thus important to find
efficient bounding techniques especially in the context of the aforementioned
applications. In this paper we propose a new lower bound on the nonnegative
rank which, unlike most existing lower bounds, does not explicitly rely on the
matrix sparsity pattern and applies to nonnegative matrices with arbitrary
support. The idea involves computing a certain nuclear norm with nonnegativity
constraints which allows to lower bound the nonnegative rank, in the same way
the standard nuclear norm gives lower bounds on the standard rank. Our lower
bound is expressed as the solution of a copositive programming problem and can
be relaxed to obtain polynomial-time computable lower bounds using semidefinite
programming. We compare our lower bound with existing ones, and we show
examples of matrices where our lower bound performs better than currently known

post-linear formalism of General Relativity to the multidimensional case. The
total emitted energy, as well as its angular and frequency distribution are
discussed in detail. In terms of the gravitational radius r_S of the collision
energy, the impact parameter b and the Lorentz factor in the CM frame, the
leading order radiation efficiency in the Lab frame is shown to be of order
(r_S/b)^{3(d+1)} gamma_{cm} for d=0, 1 and of order (r_S/b)^{3(d+1)}
gamma_{cm}^{2d-3} for d>1, up to a known d-dependent coefficient and a ln
gamma_{cm} factor for d=2, while the characteristic frequency of the radiation
is gamma/b. The contribution of the low frequency part of the radiation (soft
gravitons) to the total radiated energy is shown to be negligible for all
values of d. The domain of validity of the classical result is discussed.
Finally, it is shown that within the region of validity of our approach the
efficiency can obtain unnatural values greater than one, which is interpreted
to mean that the peripheral ultra-planckian collisions should be strongly

in the Milky Way or other galaxies. We utilize Spitzer IRAC images of 7 nearby

flat or rising mid-IR spectral energy distributions towards longer mid-infrared

not known to be background sources. Based on our estimates for the expected

that most of these candidates are not dust enshrouded massive stars, with an
expectation of only 6+-6 surviving candidates. Since we would detect true
analogs of {\eta} Car for roughly 200 years post-eruption, this implies that
the rate of eruptions like {\eta} Car is less than the ccSN rate. It is
possible, however, that every M > 40 M_sun star undergoes such eruptions given

further analysis and follow-up observations, and there is no barrier to

stellar black holes on a capture orbit with a very high eccentricity have been
wrongly assumed to be lost for the system after an intense burst of radiation,
which has been described as a ""direct plunge"". We prove that these very
eccentric capture orbits spend actually a similar number of cycles in a
LISA-like detector as those with lower eccentricities if the central MBH is
spinning. Although the rates are higher for high-eccentricity EMRIs, the spin
also enhances the rates of lower-eccentricity EMRIs. This last kind have
received more attention because of the fact that high-eccentricity EMRIs were
thought to be direct plunges and thus negligible. On the other hand, recent
work on stellar dynamics has demonstrated that there seems to be a complot in
phase space acting on these lower-eccentricity captures, since their rates
decrease significantly by the presence of a blockade in the rate at which
orbital angular momenta change takes place. This so-called ""Schwarzschild
barrier"" is a result of the impact of relativistic precession on to the stellar
potential torques, and thus it affects the enhancement on lower-eccentricity
EMRIs that one would expect from resonant relaxation. We confirm and quantify
the existence of this barrier using a statitical sample of 2,500
direct-summation N-body simulations using both a post-Newtonian but also, and
for the first time, a geodesic approximation for the relativistic orbits. The
existence of the barrier prevents ""traditional EMRIs"" from approaching the
central MBH, but if the central MBH is spinning the rate will be anyway
dominated by highly-eccentric extreme-mass ratio inspirals, which insolently
ignore the presence of the barrier, because they are driven by two-body

motions associated with the characteristic evolutionary stages that were also
identified in previous works: A quasi-periodic modulation by prompt postshock
convection is followed by a phase of relative quiescence before growing
amplitudes signal violent hydrodynamical activity due to convection and the
standing accretion shock instability during the accretion period of the stalled
shock. Finally, a high-frequency, low-amplitude variation from proto-neutron
star (PNS) convection below the neutrinosphere appears superimposed on the
low-frequency trend associated with the aspherical expansion of the SN shock
after the onset of the explosion. Relativistic effects in combination with
detailed neutrino transport are shown to be essential for quantitative
predictions of the GW frequency evolution and energy spectrum, because they
determine the structure of the PNS surface layer and its characteristic g-mode
frequency. Burst-like high-frequency activity phases, correlated with sudden
luminosity increase and spectral hardening of electron (anti-)neutrino emission
for some 10ms, are discovered as new features after the onset of the explosion.
They correspond to intermittent episodes of anisotropic accretion by the PNS in
the case of fallback SNe. We find stronger signals for more massive progenitors
with large accretion rates. The typical frequencies are higher for massive
PNSs, though the time-integrated spectrum also strongly depends on the model
dynamics.

metastability of the electroweak vacuum, although the uncertainties are still
significant. The true vacuum is many orders of magnitude deeper than ours and
the barrier separating the two is tiny compared to the depth of the well. This
raises a cosmological question: how did the Higgs field get trapped in the
shallow minimum and why did it stay there during inflation? The Higgs initial
conditions before inflation must be fine--tuned to about one part in 10^8 in
order for the Higgs field to end up in the right vacuum. In this note, we show
that these problems can be resolved if there is a small positive coupling

galactic disk formed in a comprehensive high-resolution (3.8 pc) simulation.
Our new implementation of stellar feedback includes ionizing radiation as well
as supernova explosions, and we handle ionizing radiation by solving the
radiative transfer equation rather than by a subgrid model. Photoheating by
stellar radiation stabilizes gas against Jeans fragmentation, reducing the star
formation rate. Because we have self-consistently calculated the location of
ionized gas, we are able to make spatially-resolved mock observations of star
formation tracers, such as H-alpha emission. We can also observe how stellar
feedback manifests itself in the correlation between ionized and molecular gas.
Applying our techniques to the disk in a galactic halo of 2.3e11 Msun, we find
that the correlation between star formation rate density (estimated from mock
H-alpha emission) and molecular hydrogen density shows large scatter,
especially at high resolutions of <~ 75 pc that are comparable to the size of
giant molecular clouds (GMCs). This is because an aperture of GMC size captures
only particular stages of GMC evolution, and because H-alpha traces hot gas
around star-forming regions and is displaced from the molecular hydrogen peaks
themselves. By examining the evolving environment around star clusters, we
speculate that the breakdown of the traditional star formation laws of the
Kennicutt-Schmidt type at small scales is further aided by a combination of
stars drifting from their birthplaces, and molecular clouds being dispersed via
stellar feedback.

  dynamics on neural variability",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural variability plays a central role in neural coding and neuronal network
dynamics. Unreliability of synaptic transmission is a major source of neural
variability: synaptic neurotransmitter vesicles are released probabilistically
in response to presynaptic spikes and are recovered stochastically in time. The
stochastic dynamics of this process interacts with variability in the arrival
times of presynaptic spikes to shape the variability of the postsynaptic
response. We use continuous time Markov chain methods to analyze a model of
short term synaptic depression with stochastic vesicle dynamics coupled with
three different models of presynaptic spiking: one model in which the timing of
presynaptic spikes are modeled as a Poisson process, one in which spikes occur
more regularly than a Poisson process and one in which spikes occur more
irregularly. We use this analysis to investigate how variability in a
presynaptic spike train is transformed by short term synaptic depression and
stochastic vesicle dynamics to determine the variability of the postsynaptic
response to a presynaptic spike train. We find that regular presynaptic spiking
increases the average rate at which vesicles are released, that the number of
vesicles released over a time window is more variable for smaller time windows
than for larger time windows, and that fast presynaptic spiking gives rise to
Poisson-like variability of the postsynaptic response even when presynaptic
spike times are highly non-Poisson. Our results complement and extend
previously reported theoretical results and provide possible explanations for
some trends observed in recorded data.

address the experience of an infalling observer and discuss the recent fuzzball

complementarity which postulate asymptotic observers experience a hot membrane
while infalling ones pass freely through the horizon, fuzzball complementarity
postulates that fine-grained operators experience the details of the fuzzball

balance between the transcription speed, the folding and unfolding rates of the

effect of negative feedback accounting for binding to metabolites, which are
themselves the products of genes that are being regulated. For a range of
transcription rates negative feedback suppresses gene expression by nearly 10
fold. Negative feedback speeds the gene expression response time, and
suppresses the change of steady state protein concentration by half relative to
that without feedback, when there is a modest spike in DNA concentration. A

an issue for the voxel-based model since the entire Pareto surface could be
generated regardless the specific form of the objective function as long as it
satisfies certain mathematical conditions; 2) A larger Pareto surface is
explored by adjusting voxel-dependent parameters than by adjusting
organ-dependent parameters, possibly allowing for the generation of plans with
better trade-offs among different clinical objectives; 3) Adjusting voxel
weighting factors is preferred to adjusting the voxel reference doses since the
Pareto optimality can be maintained.

Fix
$0<p<r<1$ and take $G\sim G(n,p)$, the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with edge
density $p$, conditioned to have at least as many triangles as the typical
$G(n,r)$. Is $G$ close in cut-distance to a typical $G(n,r)$? Via a beautiful
new framework for large deviation principles in $G(n,p)$, Chatterjee and
Varadhan gave bounds on the replica symmetric phase, the region of $(p,r)$
where the answer is positive. They further showed that for any small enough $p$
there are at least two phase transitions as $r$ varies.
  We settle this question by identifying the replica symmetric phase for
triangles and more generally for any fixed $d$-regular graph. By analyzing the
variational problem arising from the framework of Chatterjee and Varadhan we
show that the replica symmetry phase consists of all $(p,r)$ such that
$(r^d,h_p(r))$ lies on the convex minorant of $x\mapsto h_p(x^{1/d})$ where
$h_p$ is the rate function of a binomial with parameter $p$. In particular, the
answer for triangles involves $h_p(\sqrt{x})$ rather than the natural guess of
$h_p(x^{1/3})$ where symmetry was previously known. Analogous results are
obtained for linear hypergraphs as well as the setting where the largest
eigenvalue of $G\sim G(n,p)$ is conditioned to exceed the typical value of the
largest eigenvalue of $G(n,r)$. Building on the work of Chatterjee and Diaconis
(2012) we obtain additional results on a class of exponential random graphs

give a short alternative proof of a graph homomorphism inequality due to Kahn

allowing interventions to be initiated that promote development and improve

markers can be observed late in the first year of life. Many of these studies
involved extensive frame-by-frame video observation and analysis of a child's
natural behavior. Although non-intrusive, these methods are extremely
time-intensive and require a high level of observer training; thus, they are
impractical for clinical and large population research purposes. Diagnostic
measures for ASD are available for infants but are only accurate when used by
specialists experienced in early diagnosis. This work is a first milestone in a
long-term multidisciplinary project that aims at helping clinicians and general

We focus on providing computer vision tools to measure and identify ASD
behavioral markers based on components of the Autism Observation Scale for
Infants (AOSI). In particular, we develop algorithms to measure three critical
AOSI activities that assess visual attention. We augment these AOSI activities
with an additional test that analyzes asymmetrical patterns in unsupported

facial features, while the gait analysis relies on joint foreground
segmentation and 2D body pose estimation in video. We show results that provide

Finding potentially discoverable and non-excluded regions of model parameter

effort in studying the consequences of Higgs mass bounds, upper limits on rare
$B$-meson decays, and limits on relic dark matter density on constrained
models, aiming at predicting superpartner masses, and establishing likelihood
of SUSY models compared to that of the Standard Model vis-\'a-vis experimental
data. In this paper a framework for efficient search for discoverable,
non-excluded regions of different SUSY spaces giving specific experimental
signature of interest is presented. The method employs an improved Markov Chain

to guide search for viable models. Existing experimental and theoretical bounds
as well as the LHC discovery potential are taken into account. This includes
recent bounds on relic dark matter density, the Higgs sector and rare

millisecond pulsar J1713+0747 cause this excess error. These changes appear to
be uncorrelated from one pulse period to the next. The resulting time of
arrival variations are correlated across a wide frequency range and are
observed with different backend processors on different days, confirming that
they are intrinsic in origin and not an instrumental effect or caused by
strongly frequency dependent interstellar scattering. Centroids of single
pulses show an rms phase variation \approx 40 microsec, which dominates the
timing error and is the same phase jitter phenomenon long known in slower
spinning, canonical pulsars. We show that the amplitude modulations of single
pulses are modestly correlated with their arrival time fluctuations. We also
demonstrate that single-pulse variations are completely consistent with arrival
time variations of pulse profiles obtained by integrating N pulses such that
the arrival time error decreases proportional to 1/\sqrt{N}. We investigate
methods for correcting times of arrival for these pulse shape changes,
including multi-component TOA fitting and principal component analysis. These
techniques are not found to improve the timing precision of the observations.
We conclude that when pulse shape changes dominate timing errors, the timing
precision of PSR J1713+0747 can be only improved by averaging over a larger

Hard X-ray (HXR) spikes refer to fine time structures on timescales
of seconds to milliseconds in high-energy HXR emission profiles during solar
flare eruptions. Aims. We present a preliminary statistical investigation of
temporal and spectral properties of HXR spikes. Methods. Using a three-sigma
spike selection rule, we detected 184 spikes in 94 out of 322 flares with
significant counts at given photon energies, which were detected from
demodulated HXR light curves obtained by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar
Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). About one fifth of these spikes are also
detected at photon energies higher than 100 keV. Results. The statistical
properties of the spikes are as follows. (1) HXR spikes are produced in both
impulsive flares and long-duration flares with nearly the same occurrence
rates. Ninety percent of the spikes occur during the rise phase of the flares,
and about 70% occur around the peak times of the flares. (2) The time durations
of the spikes vary from 0.2 to 2 s, with the mean being 1.0 s, which is not
dependent on photon energies. The spikes exhibit symmetric time profiles with
no significant difference between rise and decay times. (3) Among the most
energetic spikes, nearly all of them have harder count spectra than their
underlying slow-varying components. There is also a weak indication that spikes
exhibiting time lags in high-energy emissions tend to have harder spectra than
spikes with time lags in low-energy emissions.

supports refinement mechanism that enables stepwise modeling and verification
of a system. By using refinement, the complexity of verification can be spread
and mitigated. In common development using Event-B, a specification written in
a natural language is examined before modeling in order to plan the modeling
and refinement strategy. After that, starting from a simple abstract model,
concrete models in several different abstraction levels are constructed by
gradually introducing complex structures and concepts. Although users of
Event-B have to plan how to abstract the specification for the construction of
each model, guidelines for such a planning have not been suggested.
Specifically, some elements in a model often require that other elements are
included in the model because of semantics constraints of Event-B. As such
requirements introduces many elements at once, non-experts of Event-B often
make refinement rough though rough refinement does not mitigate the complexity
of verification well. In response to the problem, a method is proposed to plan
what models are constructed in each abstraction level. The method calculates
plans that mitigate the complexity well considering the semantics constraints
of Event-B and the relationships between elements in a system.

keypoints that can be used for matching an object in different images. At
first, an object is trained with different aspects for finding best keypoints.
The object can be recognized in the other images by using achieved keypoints.
Then, a robust segmentation algorithm is used to detect the object with full

defined to merge the regions in image with the assistance of keypoints. The
results show that the proposed approach is reliable for object detection and

demodulation code was applied to hard X-ray light curves in several energy
bands observed by RHESSI. Hard X-ray spikes were selected from the demodulated
flare light curves. We measured the spike duration, the energy-dependent time
delay, and count spectral index of these spikes. We also located the hard X-ray
source emitting these spikes from RHESSI mapping that was coordinated with
imaging observations in visible and UV wavelengths. We identify quickly varying
structures of <1 s during the rise of hard X-rays in five flares. These hard
X-ray spikes can be observed at photon energies over 100 keV. They exhibit
sharp rise and decay with a duration (FWHM) of less than 1 s. Energy-dependent
time lags are present in some spikes. It is seen that the spikes exhibit harder
spectra than underlying components, typically by 0.5 in the spectral index when
they are fitted to power-law distributions. RHESSI clean maps at 25-100 keV
with an integration of 2 s centered on the peak of the spikes suggest that hard
X-ray spikes are primarily emitted by double foot-point sources in magnetic
fields of opposite polarities. With the RHESSI mapping resolution of ~ 4 arsec,
the hard X-ray spike maps do not exhibit detectable difference in the spatial
structure from sources emitting underlying components. Coordinated
high-resolution imaging UV and infrared observations confirm that hard X-ray
spikes are produced in magnetic structures embedded in the same magnetic
environment of the underlying components. The coordinated high-cadence TRACE UV
observations of one event possibly reveal new structures on spatial scales <1-2
arsec at the time of the spike superposed on the underlying component. They are
probably sources of hard X-ray spikes.

The deviations are relatively large in the boundary layers near the top and

largest velocities at the boundaries and decreases inside the convection zone.
The thickness of the boundary layers, where meridional flow is concentrated,
decreases with rotation rate, so that an advection-dominated regime of dynamos
is not probable in rapidly rotating stars. Angular momentum transport by
convection and by the meridional flow produce differential rotation. The
convective fluxes of angular momentum point radially inward in the case of slow
rotation but change their direction to equatorward and parallel to the rotation
axis as the rotation rate increases. The differential rotation of main-sequence
dwarfs is predicted to vary mildly with rotation rate but increase strongly
with stellar surface temperature. The significance of differential rotation for
dynamos has the opposite tendency to increase with spectral type.

applications that process large amounts of data. One important example
application is large scale similarity search, for which Locality Sensitive
Hashing (LSH) has emerged as the method of choice, specially when the data is
high-dimensional. At its core, LSH is based on hashing the data points to a
number of buckets such that similar points are more likely to map to the same
buckets. To guarantee high search quality, the LSH scheme needs a rather large
number of hash tables. This entails a large space requirement, and in the
distributed setting, with each query requiring a network call per hash bucket
look up, this also entails a big network load. The Entropy LSH scheme proposed
by Panigrahy significantly reduces the number of required hash tables by
looking up a number of query offsets in addition to the query itself. While
this improves the LSH space requirement, it does not help with (and in fact
worsens) the search network efficiency, as now each query offset requires a
network call. In this paper, focusing on the Euclidian space under $l_2$ norm
and building up on Entropy LSH, we propose the distributed Layered LSH scheme,
and prove that it exponentially decreases the network cost, while maintaining a
good load balance between different machines. Our experiments also verify that
our scheme results in a significant network traffic reduction that brings about
large runtime improvement in real world applications.

dust in massive star forming regions. NGC 4214 is a nearby dwarf galaxy with a
large set of ancillary data, ranging from the ultraviolet (UV) to radio,
including maps from SPITZER, HERSCHEL and detections from PLANCK. We mapped
this galaxy with MAMBO at 1.2 mm at the IRAM 30 m telescope. We extract
separate dust emission components for the HII regions (plus their associated
PDRs on pc scales) and for the diffuse dust (on kpc scales). We analyse the
full UV to FIR/submm SED of the galaxy using a radiation transfer model which
self-consistently treats the dust emission from diffuse and SF complexes
components, considering the illumination of diffuse dust both by the
distributed stellar populations, and by escaping light from the HII regions.
While maintaining consistency with the framework of this model we additionally
use a model that provides a detailed description of the dust emission from the
HII regions and their surrounding PDRs on pc scales. Due to the large amount of
available data and previous studies for NGC 4214 very few free parameters
remained in the model fitting process. We achieve a satisfactory fit for the
emission from HII+PDR regions on pc scales, with the exception of the emission
at 8\mi, which is underpredicted by the model. For the diffuse emission we
achieve a good fit if we assume that about 30-70% of the emission escaping the
HII+PDR regions is able to leave the galaxy without passing through a diffuse
ISM, which is not an unlikely scenario for a dwarf galaxy which has recently
undergone a nuclear starburst. We determine a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 350-390
which is close to the expected value based on the metallicity.

lengths of 6 mm electrons were efficiently transported along the narrow gas

processes of galaxies in the early universe. However only a few of these
distant objects are known to this date. The costs of building and operating a
10-metre class telescope limit the number of facilities and, thus, the
available observation time. Therefore an efficient selection of candidates is
mandatory. This paper presents a new approach to select quasar candidates with
high redshift (z>4.8) based on photometric catalogues. We have chosen to use
the z>4.8 limit for our approach because the dominant Lyman alpha emission line
of a quasar can only be found in the Sloan i and z-band filters. As part of the
candidate selection approach, a photometric redshift estimator is presented,
too. Three of the 120,000 generated candidates have been spectroscopically
analysed in follow-up observations and a new z=5.0 quasar was found. This
result is consistent with the estimated detection ratio of about 50 per cent
and we expect 60,000 high-redshift quasars to be part of our candidate sample.

an unusual relation between the BCS coupling constant and the order parameter.
This feature results from the properties of the states localized on the
graphite surfaces. In a description including only the nearest neighbour
coupling of the graphene layers, the surface states are topologically protected
and have a flat band dispersion. We show that including higher order couplings
destroys this flat band character and leads to a particle-hole symmetry
breaking quadratic dispersion with a large effective mass. Employing this
dispersion, we then show its effect on superconductivity and find two regimes
of parameters, depending on the relation between the strength of the coupling
constant and the details of the quadratic dispersion. For low coupling
strengths, superconductivity is localized on the surfaces, but the order
parameter is exponentially suppressed as in a conventional BCS superconductor,
whereas for large coupling strengths we obtain surface superconductivity with a
linear relation between the order parameter and the coupling constant. Our
results may explain the recent findings of graphite superconductivity with a
relatively high transition temperature.

only a tiny fraction of the pressure required to support the cavities. This
finding implies additional pressure support in the lobes from heavy particles

dilute solution, have been shown to be governed by the same universality class.
On the other hand, self-avoiding walks interacting via nearest-neighbour
contacts (ISAW) and self-avoiding trails interacting via multiply-visited sites
(ISAT) are two models of the coil-globule, or collapse transition of a polymer
in dilute solution. On the square lattice it has been established numerically
that the collapse transition of each model lies in a different universality
class. The models differ in two substantial ways. They differ in the types of
subsets of random walk configurations utilised (site self-avoidance versus bond
self-avoidance) and in the type of attractive interaction. It is therefore of
some interest to consider self-avoiding trails interacting via nearest
neighbour attraction (INNSAT) in order to ascertain the source for the
difference in the collapse universality class. Using the flatPERM algorithm, we
have performed computer simulations of this model. We present numerical
evidence that the singularity in the free energy of INNSAT at the collapse
transition has a similar exponent to that of the ISAW model rather than the
ISAT model. This would indicate that the type of interaction used in ISAW and
ISAT is the source of the difference in universality class.

optimize sensitivity, spatial resolution and electron-beam coincidence in space

photocathode source, was preliminary characterized with different electrostatic

that is thought to couple the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the ICM,
helping to stabilize cooling flows and govern the evolution of massive
galaxies. However, the prevalence and duty cycle of such AGN outbursts is not
well understood. To this end, we study how cooling is balanced by bubble
heating for complete samples of clusters (the Brightest 55 clusters of
galaxies, hereafter B55, and the HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster Sample,
HIFLUGCS). We find that the radio luminosity of the central galaxy only exceeds
2.5 x 10^30 erg s^-1 Hz^-1 in cooling flow clusters. This result implies a
connection between the central radio source and the ICM, as expected if AGN
feedback is operating. Additionally, we find a duty cycle for radio mode
feedback, the fraction of time that a system possesses bubbles inflated by its
central radio source, of > 69 per cent for B55 and > 63 per cent for HIFLUGCS.
These duty cycles are lower limits since some bubbles are likely missed in
existing images. We used simulations to constrain the bubble power that might
be present and remain undetected in the cooling flow systems without detected
bubbles. Among theses systems, almost all could have significant bubble power.
Therefore, our results imply that the duty cycle of AGN outbursts with the
potential to heat the gas significantly in cooling flow clusters is at least 60
per cent and could approach 100 per cent.

containing spin 1/2 and 7/2 magnetic impurities, obtained recently in Ref. 1 is
exploited to derive the expressions for critical magnetic field
$H_{\mathrm{c}}(T)$ . The credibility of the resulting theoretical equations,
which depend on the magnetic coupling constant $g$ and impurity concentration
$c$, is verified on the experimental data for the following superconducting
alloys: LaCe, ThGd and SmRh$_{4}$B$_{4}$. Good quantitative agreement with
experimental data is found for sufficiently small values of $c$. The
discrepancies between theoretical and experimental values of
$H_{\mathrm{c}}(T)$ for larger values of $c$ in case of LaCe and ThGd are
reduced by introducing the concept of the effective temperature $\tilde{T}$,
which accounts for the Coulomb interactions between the electron gas and
impurity ions.
  At low temperatures, the critical magnetic field is found to increase with
decreasing temperature $T$. This enhancement of the critical magnetic field
provides evidence of the Jaccarino-Peter effect, which was experimentally
observed in the Kondo systems like LaCe, (La$_{1-x}$Ce$_{x}$)Al$_{2}$ and also
in the pseudoternary compounds, including Sn$_{1-x}$Eu$_{x}$Mo$_{6}$S$_{8}$,

superconductor perturbed by magnetic impurities was also studied. On this
grounds, by analyzing the dependence of superconducting transition temperature
$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ on ${\mathcal H}$ of (La$_{1-x}$Ce$_{x}$)Al$_{2}$, we have
shown, that for certain parameter values, external magnetic field compensates
the destructive effect of magnetic impurities.

and [SII], R-band and I-band images were obtained. The new spectra confirm the
original results and are used to constrain the outflow PA at $\sim$

and the outflow is detected in the [SII] images. The detection is firstly in
the form of an elongation of the point spread function along the direction of
the outflow PA. Four faint knot-like features (labelled {\it A-D}) are also
observed to the south-west of 2MASSJ12073347-3932540 along the same PA
suggested by the spectra and the elongation in the PSF. Interestingly, {\it D},
the feature furthest from the source is bow-shaped with the apex pointing away
from 2MASSJ12073347-3932540. A color-color analysis allows us to conclude that
at least feature {\it D} is part of the outflow under investigation while {\it
A} is likely a star or galaxy. Follow-up observations are needed to confirm the
origin of {\it B} and {\it C}. This is a first for a BD, as BD optical outflows

particularly attractive platform for fabricating scalable spin quantum bit
architectures, compatible with current semiconductor technology. The band
structure of the \delta-layers that underpin these devices has been studied
intensely using different theoretical methods, but it has hitherto not been
possible to directly compare these predictions with experimental data. Here we
report the first measurement of the electronic band structure of a \delta-doped
layer below the Si(001) surface by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES). Our measurements confirm the layer to be metallic and give direct
access to the Fermi level position. Surprisingly, the direct observation of the
states is possible despite them being buried far below the surface. Using this
experimental approach, buried states in a wide range of other material systems,
including metallic oxide interfaces, could become accessible to direct
spectroscopic investigations.

we identify three classes of models, characterized by different quantum numbers

so-called top partners. The main result of this classification is that in all
models with moderate tuning a light Higgs, of 125 GeV mass, requires the
presence of light top partners, around 1 TeV. The minimal tuning is comparable
to the one of the most attractive supersymmetric models in particular the ones

relevant new phenomena often emerge as a consequence of their breaking. An
important example is provided by space- and time-translational invariance in
statistical systems, which hold at a coarse-grained scale in equilibrium and
are broken by spatial and temporal boundaries, the former being implemented by
surfaces - unavoidable in real samples - the latter by some initial condition
for the dynamics which causes a non-equilibrium evolution. While the separate
effects of these two boundaries are well understood, we demonstrate here that
additional, unexpected features arise upon approaching the effective edge
formed by their intersection. For this purpose, we focus on the classical
semi-infinite Ising model with spin-flip dynamics evolving out of equilibrium
at its critical point. Considering both subcritical and critical values of the
coupling among surface spins, we present numerical evidence of a scaling regime
with universal features which emerges upon approaching the spatio-temporal edge
and we rationalise these findings within a field-theoretical approach.

programmer to synthesize a sup-interpretation, a function providing an upper-
bound on the size of the output values computed by a program. It consists in a
static space analysis tool without consideration of the time consumption.
Although clearly related, sup-interpretation is independent from termination
since it only provides an upper bound on the terminating computations. First,
we study some undecidable properties of sup-interpretations from a theoretical
point of view. Next, we fix term rewriting systems as our computational model
and we show that a sup-interpretation can be obtained through the use of a
well-known termination technique, the polynomial interpretations. The drawback
is that such a method only applies to total functions (strongly normalizing
programs). To overcome this problem we also study sup-interpretations through
the notion of quasi-interpretation. Quasi-interpretations also suffer from a
drawback that lies in the subterm property. This property drastically restricts
the shape of the considered functions. Again we overcome this problem by
introducing a new notion of interpretations mainly based on the dependency
pairs method. We study the decidability and complexity of the
sup-interpretation synthesis problem for all these three tools over sets of
polynomials. Finally, we take benefit of some previous works on termination and
runtime complexity to infer sup-interpretations.

high-cohesion/low-coupling dogma with metrics of unknown relevance. In this
paper, we study a real structuring case (on the Eclipse platform) to try to
better understand if (some) existing metrics would have helped the software
engineers in the task. Results show that the cohesion and coupling metrics used
in the experiment did not behave as expected and would probably not have helped
the maintainers reach there goal. We also measured another possible
restructuring which is to decrease the number of cyclic dependencies between
modules. Again, the results did not meet expectations.

time-resolution spectrophotometry of the eclipsing nova-like variables SW Sex

single-peaked Balmer and HeII 4686A emission lines that appear to originate
from a region in the disc that lies close to, but downstream of, the bright
spot. The emission-line light curves are consistent with the finding from X-ray
and ultraviolet observations that we predominantly see the flared disc rim and
the unobscured back portion of the disc in these systems. In DW UMa, the HeII
4686A emission line originates from close to the white dwarf and exhibits
flaring. Such flares have been used to argue for magnetically-channelled
accretion, as in the intermediate polars, but the lack of a clear periodicity
in the flares argues for a simpler model in which we are viewing the central
regions of the disc through the non-uniform upper edge of a flared disc rim. We
also observe narrow, blue-shifted, transient absorption features in the Balmer
lines of DW UMa, which we attribute to blobs of material ejected from the
system, possibly by a magnetic propeller, that happen to be passing between us

combination of dominant bright-spot emission and a self-occulting disc. We also

detecting the earliest stages of protostellar evolution where the source itself

Class I objects the dominant radio emission mechanism is expected to be
free-free, however unlike massive YSOs the way in which this radio emission is
produced remains a subject of debate. As larger samples of radio YSOs become
available the relationship between the radio luminosity of the Class 0/I
population and their wider global properties is now being clarified.
Furthermore, the broader scientific applications of such samples are also

equidistant or random level spacing are presented. The results are then
compared either to particle-particle random phase approximation (ppRPA) in the
normal phase or quasi-particle random phase approximation (QRPA) in the

reproducing the exact case although some differences are seen in the superfluid

excited states in the vicinity of the normal-superfluid phase transition, which
might explain the difficult in detecting collective pairing phenomena as for
example the Giant Pairing Vibration. The shortcoming of QRPA can be traced back
to the breaking of particle number that is used to incorporate pairing. A
method, based on direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the space of two
quasi-particle projected onto good particle number is shown to improve the
description of pair transfer probabilities in superfluid systems.

to describe the outliers at the low multipoles in the WMAP data. Apart from the
CMB angular power spectrum, these features can also alter the matter power
spectrum and, thereby, the formation of the large scale structure. Carrying out
a complete numerical analysis, we investigate the effects of primordial
features on the formation rates of the halos. We consider a few different
inflationary models that lead to features in the scalar power spectrum and an
improved fit to the CMB data, and analyze the corresponding imprints on the
formation of halos. Performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis with the
WMAP seven year data and the SDSS halo power spectrum from LRG DR7 for the
models of our interest, we arrive at the parameter space of the models allowed
by the data. We illustrate that, inflationary potentials, such as the quadratic
potential with sinusoidal modulations and the axion monodromy model, which
generate certain repeated, oscillatory features in the inflationary
perturbation spectrum, do not induce a substantial difference in the number
density of halos at their best fit values, when compared with, say, a nearly
scale invariant spectrum as is generated by the standard quadratic potential.
However, we find that the number density and the formation rates of halos
change by about 13-22% for halo masses ranging over 10^4-10^14 solar mass, for
potential parameters that lie within 2-sigma around the best fit values arrived
at from the aforesaid joint constraints. We briefly discuss the implications of
our results.

characterized by electron-vibration coupling, to describe electron transfer and
localization at zero temperature, aiming to examine the process of polaron
formation in this system. In particular we focus on comparing a semiclassical
approach that describes nuclear motion in this many vibronic-states system on
the Ehrenfest dynamics level to a numerically exact fully quantum calculation
based on the Bonca-Trugman method [J. Bon\v{c}a and S. A. Trugman, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 75, 2566 (1995)]. In both approaches, thermal relaxation in the nuclear
subspace is implemented in equivalent approximate ways: In the Ehrenfest
calculation the uncoupled (to the electronic subsystem) motion of the classical
(harmonic) oscillator is simply damped as would be implied by coupling to a
markovian zero temperature bath. In the quantum calculation, thermal relaxation
is implemented by augmenting the Liouville equation for the oscillator density
matrix with kinetic terms that account for the same relaxation. In both cases
we calculate the probability to trap the electron in a polaron cage and the
probability that it escapes to infinity. Comparing these calculations, we find
that while both result in similar long time yields for these processes, the
Ehrenfest-dynamics based calculation fails to account for the correct timescale
for the polaron formation. This failure results, as usual, from the fact that
at the early stage of polaron formation the classical nuclear dynamics takes
place on an unphysical average potential surface that reflects the
otherwise-distributed electronic population in the system, while the quantum
calculation accounts fully for correlations between the electronic and
vibrational subsystems.

at neck and at break are referred to the macroscopic properties. The structure
is characterized by an average thickness of amorphous layers in isotropic
melt-crystallized linear high density polyethylene which is chosen as an
example. The square of the neck draw ratio is equal to the product of the
square of the draw ratio at break and the chain ends collision probability.
This probability in its turn is proportional to the average thickness of
amorphous layers in the isotropic material. The neck draw ratio is a parameter
of order. Polymers with flexible chains are solutions in solid state as well as
in melt, the interacting ends of a marked chain serving as a solvent. At
critical polymerization degree all the phases are identical. This research is
an important contribution to the molecular theory of polymer liquids. It has
been found that the melt viscosity vs the molecular weight of linear
flexible-chain polymer follows the power law with the 3.4-exponent within the

levels. In this work we improve such an analysis removing some approximations
that have been implicitly used in our previous works and obtaining the
corrected expressions for the formulas of the horizon's area quantization and
the number of quanta of area and hence also for Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, its
sub-leading corrections and the number of micro-states, i.e. quantities which
are fundamental to realize the underlying quantum gravity theory, like
functions of the QNMs quantum ""overtone"" number n and, in turn, of the BH
quantum excited level. An approximation concerning the maximum value of n is
also corrected. On the other hand, our previous results were strictly corrected
only for scalar and gravitational perturbations. Here we show that the
discussion holds also for vector perturbations. The analysis is totally
consistent with the general conviction that BHs result in highly excited states
representing both the ""hydrogen atom"" and the ""quasi-thermal emission"" in
quantum gravity. Our BH model is somewhat similar to the semi-classical Bohr's
model of the structure of a hydrogen atom. The thermal approximation of
previous results in the literature is consistent with the results in this

translating high-level vector operations into an intermediate vector bytecode,
cphVB enables specialized vector engines to efficiently execute the vector
operations.
  The primary success parameters are to maintain a complete abstraction from
low-level details and to provide efficient code execution across different,
modern, processors. We evaluate the presented design through a setup that
targets multi-core CPU architectures. We evaluate the performance of the
implementation using Python implementations of well-known algorithms: a jacobi
solver, a kNN search, a shallow water simulation and a synthetic stencil
simulation. All demonstrate good performance.

  spacetime","13 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1210.7535",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyse the power counting renormalizability of the quantum field theory
of Einstein or Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in D+2 dimensional Lifshitz
spacetime. We show the spectral dimension becomes 2+(D/z) at the UV region
where z is the critical exponent. Since it is larger than two, the quantum
theory of Einstein gravity is not power counting renormalizable. For the pure
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where Lifshitz spacetime is allowed only when
the parameters are fine tuned, it happens that the graviton modes do not
propagate and the quantum field theory is accidentally renormalizable when
z>=D. Another method is discretizing the radial coordinate which changes the
spectral dimension to 1+(D/z) at the UV region. Since our four dimensional
spacetime is continuous, the four dimensional Lorentz symmetry is recovered at
the low energy and the power counting renormalizability is still kept for z>=D,
if the spacetime near the null singularity in Lifshitz spacetime is modified
into AdS spacetime and the discrete radial direction is compactified like a
brane world scenario. We also comment on the AdS/CFT correspondence.

to the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. Single dish
observations were performed with the Itapetinga radio telescope at 7 mm, and
the contribution of the SgrA complex that surrounds SgrA* was subtracted and
used as instantaneous calibrator. The observations were alternated every 10 min
with those of the HII region SrgB2, which was also used as a calibrator. The
reliability of the detections was tested comparing them with simultaneous
observations using interferometric techniques. During the observing period we
detected a continuous increase in the SgrA* flux density starting in 2008, as
well as variability in timescales of days and strong intraday fluctuations. We
investigated if the continuous increase in flux density is compatible with
free-free emission from the tail of the disrupted compact cloud that is falling
towards SgrA* and concluded that the increase is most probably intrinsic to
SgrA*. Statistical analysis of the light curve using Stellingwerf and Structure
Function methods revealed the existence of two minima, 156 +/- 10 and 220 +/-
10 days. The same statistical tests applied to a simulated light curve
constructed from two quadratic sinusoidal functions superimposed to random
variability reproduced very well the results obtained with the real light
curve, if the periods were 57 and 156 days. Moreover, when a daily sampling was
used in the simulated light curve, it was possible to reproduce the 2.3 GHz
structure function obtained by Falcke in 1999, which revealed the 57 days
period, while the 106 periodicity found by Zhao et al in 2001 could be a
resonance of this period.

related to Computer Aided Engineering (CAE). The free software packages include
software that can build a three dimensional solid model, programs that can mesh
a geometry, software for carrying out Finite Element Analysis (FEA), programs
that can carry out image processing etc. Present work has two goals: 1) To give
a brief description of CAELinux 2) To demonstrate that CAELinux could be useful
for Computer Aided Engineering, using an example of the three dimensional
reconstruction of a pig liver from a stack of CT-scan images. One can note that
instead of using CAELinux, using commercial software for reconstructing the
liver would cost a lot of money. One can also note that CAELinux is a free and
open source operating system and all software packages that are included in the
operating system are also free. Hence one can conclude that CAELinux could be a
very useful tool in application areas like surgical simulation which require
three dimensional reconstructions of biological organs. Also, one can see that
CAELinux could be a very useful tool for Computer Aided Engineering, in
general.

suitable for the analysis of high resolution spectra of hydrogen-deficient
post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) objects hotter than 50000 K, migrating
along the constant luminosity branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD).
The grid was calculated with CMFGEN, a state-of-the-art stellar atmosphere code
that properly treats the stellar winds, accounting for expanding atmospheres in
non-LTE, line blanketing, soft X-rays, and wind clumping. We include many ionic
species that have been previously neglected. Our uniform set of models fills a
niche in an important parameter regime, i.e., high effective temperatures, high
surface gravities, and a range of mass-loss values. The grid constitutes a
general tool to facilitate determination of the stellar parameters and line
identifications and to interpret morphological changes of the stellar spectrum
as stars evolve through the central star of planetary nebula (CSPN) phase. We
show the effect of major physical parameters on spectral lines in the far-UV,
UV, and optical regimes. We analyse UV and far-UV spectra of the central star
of NGC 6905 using the grid to constrain its physical parameters, and proceed to
further explore other parameters not taken in consideration in the grid. This
application shows that the grid can be used to constrain the main photospheric
and wind parameters, as a first step towards a detailed analysis. The full grid
of synthetic spectra, comprising far-UV, UV, optical, and IR spectral regions,
is available on-line.
