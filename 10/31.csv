superconformal field theories (SCFT$_5$) arising from a near horizon geometry

solution interpolating between the SCFT with $E_1$ symmetry and the new

shocks, but conclusive evidence is lacking. Aims: New data from ground-based
gamma-ray telescopes and the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope are used to test this hypothesis. A simple model for gamma-ray
production efficiency is compared with measured gamma-ray luminosities of SNRs,
and the GeV to TeV fluxes ratios of SNRs are examined for correlations with SNR
ages. Methods: The supernova explosion is modeled as an expanding spherical
shell of material that sweeps up matter from the surrounding interstellar
medium (ISM). The accumulated kinetic energy of the shell, which provides the
energy available for nonthermal particle acceleration, changes when matter is
swept up from the ISM and the SNR shell decelerates. A fraction of this energy
is assumed to be converted into the energy of cosmic-ray electrons or protons.
Three different particle radiation processes---nuclear pion-production
interactions, nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung, and Compton scattering---are
considered. Results: The efficiencies for gamma-ray production by these three
processes are compared with gamma-ray luminosities of SNRs. Our results suggest
that SNRs become less gamma-ray luminous at >~ 10^4 yr, and are consistent with
the hypothesis that supernova remnants accelerate cosmic rays with an
efficiency of ~10% for the dissipation of kinetic energy into nonthermal cosmic
rays. Weak evidence for an increasing GeV to TeV flux ratio with SNR age is
found.

communications, time reference, and geolocation. In its most basic form an
oscillator consists of a resonator driven on-resonance, through feedback, to
create a periodic signal sustained by a static energy source. The generation of
a stable frequency, the basic function of oscillators, is typically achieved by
increasing the amplitude of motion of the resonator while remaining within its
linear, harmonic, regime. Contrary to this conventional paradigm, in this
Letter we show that by operating the oscillator at special points in the
resonators anharmonic regime we can overcome fundamental limitations of
oscillator performance due to thermodynamic noise as well as practical
limitations due to noise from the sustaining circuit. We develop a
comprehensive model that accounts for the major contributions to the phase
noise of the nonlinear oscillator. Using a nanoelectromechanical system

that are too rarified to be described by the Navier-Stokes equations. However,
generally they are far too computationally expensive to be applied for systems
that are governed by continuum hydrodynamics. In this paper, we introduce a
massively parallelized test-particle based kinetic Monte Carlo code that is
capable of modeling the phase space evolution of an arbitrarily sized system
that is free to move in and out of the continuum limit. Using particle mean
free paths which are small with respect to the characteristic length scale of
the simulated system, we retrieve continuum behavior, while non-equilibrium
effects are observed when the mean free path is increased. To demonstrate the
ability of our code to reproduce hydrodynamic solutions, we apply a test-suite
of classic hydrodynamic shock problems. Simulations using tens of millions of
test-particles are found to reproduce the analytical solutions well.

RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which mediate RNA interference.
RISC-formation is dependent on a shared pool of Argonaute proteins and RISC
loading factors, and is thus susceptible to competition among small RNAs for
loading. We present a mathematical model that aims to understand how small RNA
competition for the PTR resources affects target gene repression. We discuss
that small RNA activity is limited by RISC-formation, RISC-degradation and the
availability of Argonautes. Together, these observations explain a number of
PTR saturation effects encountered experimentally. We show that different
competition conditions for RISC-loading result in different signatures of PTR
activity determined also by the amount of RISC-recycling taking place. In
particular, we find that the small RNAs less efficient at RISC-formation, using
fewer resources of the PTR pathway, can perform in the low RISC-recycling range
equally well as their more effective counterparts. Additionally, we predict a
novel signature of PTR in target expression levels. Under conditions of low
RISC-loading efficiency and high RISC-recycling, the variation in target levels
increases linearly with the target transcription rate. Furthermore, we show
that RISC-recycling determines the effect that Argonaute scarcity conditions
have on target expression variation. Our observations taken together offer a
framework of predictions which can be used in order to infer from experimental
data the particular characteristics of underlying PTR activity.

recognize movement and the ability to keep an upright standing position - can
function only with using precise measurements of the short time intervals.
Other features that these abilities share are that all three are crucial for
the survival and - despite this - they are turned off simultaneously during
sleep. Instead, presumably, if turning each of them off periodically for a
resetting is unavoidable, then doing this one at a time would be the
evolutionary choice, if that were possible. This hints that all three abilities
share the same time-interval measuring mechanism and this mechanism is what
cannot work without a periodical resetting. Another indication that such a
mechanism is shared across the whole nervous system is the ubiquity of
Pavlovian conditioning. A high level theory is proposed about how such a
measuring mechanism must be implemented, in the simplest way, from the point of
view of the data management, and how duration can be measured by resonance. If
the theory is true it could explain the purpose of the observed changes of the
firing frequency of cortical neurons, why periodic sleeping is an unavoidable
necessity and what might be the cause of the different stages of sleep and of
yawning. The theory provides simpler and less speculative explanations of a
number of the experimental results than interpretations by the existing
theories (the two-stage model of memory consolidation etc.).

effects of magnetic twist on stable magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves is poorly
understood because they are seldom studied for relevant cases. The goal of this
work is to study the fingerprints of magnetic twist on stable transverse kink
oscillations. We numerically calculated the eigenmodes of propagating and
standing MHD waves for a model of a loop with magnetic twist. The azimuthal
component of the magnetic field was assumed to be small in comparison to the
longitudinal component. We did not consider resonantly damped modes or kink
instabilities in our analysis. For a nonconstant twist the frequencies of the
MHD wave modes are split, which has important consequences for standing waves.
This is different from the degenerated situation for equilibrium models with
constant twist, which are characterised by an azimuthal component of the
magnetic field that linearly increases with the radial coordinate. In the
presence of twist standing kink solutions are characterised by a change in
polarisation of the transverse displacement along the tube. For weak twist, and
in the thin tube approximation, the frequency of standing modes is unaltered
and the tube oscillates at the kink speed of the corresponding straight tube.
The change in polarisation is linearly proportional to the degree of twist.
This has implications with regard to observations of kink modes, since the
detection of this variation in polarisation can be used as an indirect method
to estimate the twist in oscillating loops.

architectures as environmental factors are varied, which for immersed biofilms
includes the shear rate of the surrounding flow. Here we modify an established
agent-based biofilm model to include affine flow, and employ it to analyse the
growth of surface roughness of single-species, three-dimensional biofilms. We
find linear growth laws for surface geometry in both horizontal and vertical
directions, and measure the thickness of the active surface layer, which is
shown to anti-correlate with roughness. Flow is shown to monotonically reduce
surface roughness without affecting the thickness of the active layer. We argue
that the rapid roughening is due to non-local surface interactions mediated by
the nutrient field, which are curtailed when advection competes with diffusion.
We further argue the need for simplified models to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms coupling flow to growth.

4 or more significant phase-locked harmonic modes which persist only when
driven sufficiently strongly. They also merge when two or more at different
frequencies are driven sequentially. However, the final stable KEEN state that
emerges is highly sensitive to their relative order of excitation. KEEN waves
also interact quite strongly with electron plasma waves (EPW) especially when
their harmonics are close to being resonant with the EPW frequency at the same
k. The common assumption that whenever sufficiently large amplitude coherent
laser energy is present in an unmagnetized plasma, EPWs and IAWs are the only

(appearing in CS theory) in a natural way. This paper proposes using these
statistics for analyzing random compressed sensing matrices, in the
non-asymptotic regime (relevant to practice). The aim is to address certain
pessimisms of ""worst-case"" restricted isometry analyses, as observed by both
Blanchard & Dossal, et. al.
  We show how U-statistics can obtain ""average-case"" analyses, by relating to
statistical restricted isometry property (StRIP) type recovery guarantees.
However unlike standard StRIP, random signal models are not required; the
analysis here holds in the almost sure (probabilistic) sense. For
Gaussian/bounded entry matrices, we show that both l1-minimization and LASSO
essentially require on the order of k \cdot [\log((n-k)/u) + \sqrt{2(k/n)
\log(n/k)}] measurements to respectively recover at least 1-5u fraction, and
1-4u fraction, of the signals. Noisy conditions are considered. Empirical
evidence suggests our analysis to compare well to Donoho & Tanner's recent
large deviation bounds for l0/l1-equivalence, in the regime of block lengths
1000-3000 with high undersampling (50-150 measurements); similar system sizes
are found in recent CS implementation.

sampled.

companion paper the same analytical tool is adopted differently - here we
perform non-asymptotic ""worst-case"" analysis.
  Simple union bounds are a natural choice for ""worst-case"" analyses, however
their tightness is an issue (and questioned in previous works). Here we focus
on a theoretical U-statistical result, which potentially allows us to prove
that these union bounds are tight. To our knowledge, this kind of (powerful)
result is completely new in the context of CS. This general result applies to a
wide variety of parameters, and is related to (Stein-Chen) Poisson
approximation. In this paper, we consider i) restricted isometries, and ii)
mutual coherence. For the bounded case, we show that k-th order restricted
isometry constants have tight union bounds, when the measurements m =
\mathcal{O}(k (1 + \log(n/k))). Here we require the restricted isometries to
grow linearly in k, however we conjecture that this result can be improved to
allow them to be fixed. Also, we show that mutual coherence (with the standard
estimate \sqrt{(4\log n)/m}) have very tight union bounds.
  For coherence, the normalization complicates general discussion, and we
consider only Gaussian and Bernoulli cases here.

size and the particular spin-wave mode that can be explained by the theory of
intralayer transverse-spin-pumping. The effective Landau-Lifshitz damping is
measured optically in individual, isolated nanomagnets as small as 100 nm. The
measurements are accomplished by use of a novel heterodyne magneto-optical
microwave microscope with unprecedented sensitivity. Experimental data reveal
multiple standing spin-wave modes that we identify by use of micromagnetic
modeling as having either localized or delocalized character, described
generically as end- and center-modes. The damping parameter of the two modes
depends on both the size of the nanomagnet as well as the particular spin-wave
mode that is excited, with values that are enhanced by as much as 40% relative
to that measured for an extended film. Contrary to expectations based on the ad
hoc consideration of lithography-induced edge damage, the damping for the
end-mode decreases as the size of the nanomagnet decreases. The data agree with
the theory for damping caused by the flow of intralayer transverse
spin-currents driven by the magnetization curvature. These results have serious
implications for the performance of nanoscale spintronic devices such as
spin-torque-transfer magnetic random access memory.

exploring their dual field theory renormalization group flows. We find a
universal flow deforming superconformal theories on D3-branes at Calabi-Yau

the baryonic branch of the Klebanov-Strassler theory, as well as the

information processing. By interacting them with laser beams they are, somehow,
easy to manipulate, which makes them an excellent choice for the production of
nonclassical states of their vibrational motion, the reconstruction of
quasiprobability distribution functions, the production of quantum gates, etc.
However, most of these effects have been produced in the so-called low
intensity regime, this is, when the Rabi frequency is much smaller than the
trap frequency. Because of the possibility to produce faster quantum gates in
other regimes it is of importance to study this system in a more complete
manner, which is the motivation for this contribution. We start by studying the
way ions are trapped in Paul traps in and review the basic mechanisms of
trapping. Then we show how the problem may be completely solved for trapping
states; i.e., we find eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian. We show how in the
low intensity regime Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings interactions may
be obtained, without using the rotating wave approximation and analyze the
medium and high intensity regimes were dispersive Hamiltonians are produced.
The traditional approach is also studied and used for the generation of
non-classical states of the vibrational of the vibrational wavefunction. In
particular, we show how to add and subtract vibrational quanta to an initial
state, how to produce specific superpositions of number states and how to
generate NOON states for the two-dimensional vibration of the ion. It is also
shown how squeezing may be measured. The time dependent problem is studied by
using Lewis-Ermakov methods, we give a solution to the problem when the time
dependence of the trap is considered and also analyze an specific time
dependence that produces squeezing of the initial vibrational wave function.

inflation which avoids treating the fluctuations of the ""waterfall"" field as if
they were small perturbations about a classical trajectory. We quantize only
the waterfall field, treating it as a free quantum field with a time-dependent
$m^2$, which evolves from positive values to tachyonic values. Although this
potential has no minimum, we think it captures the important dynamics that
occurs as $m^2$ goes through zero, at which time a large spike in the density
perturbations is generated. We assume that the time-delay formalism provides an
accurate approximation to the density perturbations, and proceed to calculate
the power spectrum of the time delay fluctuations. While the evolution of the
field is linear, the time delay is a nonlinear function to which all modes
contribute. Using the Gaussian probability distribution of the mode amplitudes,
we express the time-delay power spectrum as an integral which can be carried
out numerically. We use this method to calculate numerically the spectrum of
density perturbations created in hybrid inflation models for a wide range of
parameters. A characteristic of the spectrum is the appearance of a spike at
small length scales, which can be used to relate the model parameters to
observational data. It is conceivable that this spike could seed the formation
of black holes that can evolve to become the supermassive black holes found at
the centers of galaxies.

orthogonal wavelet filterbanks, called graph- QMF, for arbitrary undirected
weighted graphs. In that formulation we first designed ""one-dimensional""
two-channel filterbanks on bipartite graphs, and then extended them to
""multi-dimensional"" separable two-channel filterbanks for arbitrary graphs via
a bipartite subgraph decomposition. We specifically designed wavelet filters
based on the spectral decomposition of the graph, and stated necessary and
sufficient conditions for a two-channel graph filter-bank on bipartite graphs
to provide aliasing-cancellation, perfect reconstruction and orthogonal set of
basis (orthogonality). While, the exact graph-QMF designs satisfy all the above
conditions, they are not exactly k-hop localized on the graph. In this paper,
we relax the condition of orthogonality to design a biorthogonal pair of
graph-wavelets that can have compact spatial spread and still satisfy the
perfect reconstruction conditions. The design is analogous to the standard
Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau's (CDF) construction of factorizing a maximally-flat
Daubechies half-band filter. Preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed
filterbanks can be useful for both standard signal processing applications as
well as for signals defined on arbitrary graphs.

arcsecond-scale resolution column density data for IRDCs and demonstrate the
potential of such data in measuring the density variance - sonic Mach number
relation in molecular clouds. We combine near-infrared data from the
UKIDSS/Galactic Plane Survey with mid-infrared data from the Spitzer/GLIMPSE

examine the linewidths of the IRDCs using 13CO line emission data from the
FCRAO/Galactic Ring Survey and derive a column density - sonic Mach number
relation for them. For comparison, we also examine the relation in a sample of
nearby molecular clouds. The presented column density mapping technique
provides a very capable, temperature independent tool for mapping IRDCs over
the column density range equivalent to A_V=1-100 mag at a resolution of 2"".
Using the data provided by the technique, we present the first direct
measurement of the relationship between the column density dispersion,
\sigma_{N/<N>}, and sonic Mach number, M_s, in molecular clouds. We detect
correlation between the variables with about 3-sigma confidence. We derive the
relation \sigma_{N/<N>} = (0.047 \pm 0.016) Ms, which is suggestive of the
correlation coefficient between the volume density and sonic Mach number,
\sigma_{\rho/<\rho>} = (0.20^{+0.37}_{-0.22}) Ms, in which the quoted
uncertainties indicate the 3-sigma range. When coupled with the results of
recent numerical works, the existence of the correlation supports the picture
of weak correlation between the magnetic field strength and density in
molecular clouds (i.e., B ~ \rho^{0.5}).

The scaling of two-photon nonlinearity at single-photon resonance shows a
non-monotonic behaviour with an increasing number of few identical 2LAs. The
two-photon nonlinearity decays monotonically with an increasing number of atoms
for incident photons detuned from single-photon resonance. Single-photon
transport in two 2LAs is similar to that in a single V-type three-level atom

transmitted photons are bunched together in a V-type 3LA, while their

wave-like distortion at out-of-eclipse is modeled with two separate spots on
the more massive star, which is also confirmed by the Ca {\sc ii} K and H
emission lines in its spectra. Locations of the components in the mass-radius
and mass-effective temperature planes were compared with the well-determined
eclipsing binaries' low-mass components as well as with the theoretical models.
While the primary star's radius is consistent with the main-sequence stars, the
radius of the less massive component appears to be 2.8 times larger than that
of the main-sequence models. Comparison of the radii of low-mass stars with the
models reveals that the observationally determined radii begin to deviate from
the models with a mass of 0.27 \Msun and suddenly reaches to maximum deviation
at a mass of 0.34 \Msun. Then, the deviations begin to decrease up to the solar
mass. The maximum deviation seen at a mass of about 0.34 \Msun is very close to
the mass of fully convective stars as suggested by theoretical studies. A third
star in the direction of the eclipsing pair has been detected from our VRI
images. The observed infrared excess of the binary is most probably arisen from
this star which may be radiated mostly in the infrared bands.

spin-polarized Gaffnian, which we call the ""spin-singlet Gaffnian"" (SSG). In
this paper we present evidence demonstrating that the SSG corresponds to the
ground state of a certain local Hamiltonian, which we explicitly construct,
and, further, we provide a relatively simple analytic expression for the unique
ground-state wave functions, which we define as the zero energy eigenstates of
that local Hamiltonian. In addition, we have determined a certain nonunitary,
rational conformal field theory which provides an underlying description of the
SSG and we thus conclude that the SSG is ungapped in the thermodynamic limit.
In order to verify our construction, we implement two recently proposed
techniques for the analysis of fractional quantum Hall trial states: The ""spin

curve shows both primary and secondary eclipses, along with a strong reflection
effect from the M dwarf; no intrinsic light contribution is detected from the
cool companion. The orbital period is 0.1185079936 +/- 0.0000000009 days, or
about three hours. Analysis of our time-series spectroscopy reveals a velocity
semi-amplitude of K_1 = 71.6 +/- 1.7 km/s for the sdB and best-fitting
atmospheric parameters of Teff = 28900 +/- 500 K, log g = 5.64 +/- 0.06, and

modeling the light curve, the best-fitting model has an sdB mass of 0.45 Msun
and a cool companion mass of 0.12 Msun. These results are roughly consistent
with a canonical-mass sdB and M dwarf separated by a ~ 0.84 Rsun. We find no
evidence of pulsations in the light curve and limit the amplitude of rapid
photometric oscillations to < 0.08%. Using 15 years of eclipse timings, we

emissions as they break out in the dense circumstellar medium around the

low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LL GRBs). Here, we investigate the high energy
neutrino and gamma-ray counterparts of such a class of SNe. Just beyond the
shock breakout radius, particle acceleration in the collisionless shock starts
to operate in the presence of breakout photons. We show that protons may be
accelerated to sufficiently high energies and produce high energy neutrinos and
gamma rays via the photomeson interaction. These neutrinos and gamma rays may
be detectable from 10 Mpc away by IceCube/KM3Net as multi-TeV transients almost
simultaneously with the X-ray burst emission, and even from 100 Mpc away with
follow-up observations by CTA using a wide-field sky monitor like Swift as a
trigger. A statistical technique using a stacking approach could also be
possible for the detection, with the aid of the SN optical/infrared
counterparts. Such multi-messenger observations offer the possibility to probe
the transition of relativistic shocks from radiation-mediated to collisionless
ones, and would also constrain the mechanisms of particle acceleration and
emission in LL GRBs.

core-neutrino luminosity. Our results show that asymmetric mass ejection caused
by hydrodynamic instabilities can accelerate the neutron star (NS) up to recoil
velocities of more than 700 km/s by the ""gravitational tug-boat mechanism"",
which is enough to explain most observed pulsar velocities. The associated NS
spin periods are about 100 ms to 8 s without any correlation between spin and
kick magnitudes or directions. This suggests that faster spins and a possible
spin-kick alignment might require angular momentum in the progenitor core prior
to collapse. Our simulations for the first time demonstrate a clear correlation
between the size of the NS kick and anisotropic ejection of heavy elements
created by explosive burning behind the shock. In the case of large NS kicks
the explosion is significantly stronger opposite to the kick vector. Therefore
the bulk of the Fe-group elements, in particular nickel, is ejected mostly in
large clumps against the kick direction. This contrasts with the case of low
recoil velocity, where the Ni-rich lumps are more isotropically distributed.
Intermediate-mass nuclei heavier than Si (like Ca and Ti) also exhibit a
significant enhancement in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of fast NS
motion, while the distribution of C, O, and Ne is not affected, and that of Mg
only marginally. Mapping the spatial distribution of the heavy elements in SN
remnants with identified pulsar motion may offer an important diagnostic test
of the kick mechanism. Different from kick scenarios based on anisotropic
neutrino emission, our hydrodynamical acceleration model predicts enhanced
ejection of Fe-group elements and of their nuclear precursors in the direction
opposite to the NS recoil. (abridged)

minor axis of this well known superwind source. The cap has been detected in
optical line emission and X-ray emission and therefore provides an important
probe of the wind energetics. In order to investigate the ionization source of
the cap, we observed it with the Kyoto3DII Fabry-Perot instrument mounted on
the Subaru Telescope. Deep continuum, Ha, [NII]6583/Ha, and [SII]6716,6731/Ha
maps were obtained with sub-arcsecond resolution. The superior spatial
resolution compared to earlier studies reveals a number of bright Ha emitting
clouds within the cap. The emission line widths (< 100 km s^-1 FWHM) and line
ratios in the newly identified knots are most reasonably explained by slow to
moderate shocks velocities (v_shock = 40--80 km s^-1) driven by a fast wind
into dense clouds. The momentum input from the M82 nuclear starburst region is
enough to produce the observed shock. Consequently, earlier claims of
photoionization by the central starburst are ruled out because they cannot
explain the observed fluxes of the densest knots unless the UV escape fraction
is very high (f_esc > 60%), i.e., an order of magnitude higher than observed in
dwarf galaxies to date. Using these results, we discuss the evolutionary
history of the M82 superwind. Future UV/X-ray surveys are expected to confirm
that the temperature of the gas is consistent with our moderate shock model.

have provided support to the idea that mergers of compact binaries containing
either two neutron stars (NSs) or an NS and a black hole (BH) may constitute
the central engine of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). The merger of such
compact binaries is expected to lead to the production of a spinning BH
surrounded by an accreting torus. Several mechanisms can extract energy from
this system and power the SGRBs. Here we connect observations and numerical
simulations of compact binary mergers, and use the current sample of SGRBs with
measured energies to constrain the mass of their powering tori. By comparing
the masses of the tori with the results of fully general-relativistic
simulations, we are able to infer the properties of the binary progenitors
which yield SGRBs. By assuming a constant efficiency in converting torus mass
into jet energy, epsilon_{jet}=10%, we find that most of the tori have masses
smaller than 0.01M_{sun}, favoring ""high-mass"" binary NSs mergers, i.e.,
binaries with total masses >~1.5 the maximum mass of an isolated NS. This has
important consequences for the gravitational-wave signals that may be detected
in association with SGRBs, since ""high-mass"" systems do not form a long-lived
hypermassive NS after the merger. While NS-BH systems cannot be excluded to be
the engine of at least some of the SGRBs, the BH would need to have an initial
spin of ~0.9, or higher.

dynamical interactions in globular clusters. We find that in dense, massive
clusters, 16-61% of the BH-NS binaries formed by interactions with existing BH
binaries will undergo mergers driven by the emission of gravitational
radiation. If the BHs are retained by the cluster after merging with a NS, the
BHs acquire subsequent NS companions and undergo several mergers. Thus, the
merger rate depends critically upon whether or not the BH is retained by the
cluster after the merger. Results from numerical relativity suggest that kick
imparted to a ~7 M_sun BH after it merges with a NS will greatly exceed the
cluster's escape velocity. In this case, the models suggest that the majority
of BH-NS mergers in globular clusters occur within 4 Gyrs of the cluster's
formation and would be unobservable by Advanced LIGO. For more massive BHs, on
the other hand, the post merger kick is suppressed and the BH is retained.
Models with 35 M_sun BHs predict Advanced LIGO detection rates in the range
0.04 - 0.7 per year. On the pessimistic end of this range, BH-NS mergers
resulting from binary-single star interactions in globular clusters could
account for an interesting fraction of all BH-NS mergers. On the optimistic
end, this channel may dominate the rate of detectable BH-NS mergers.

FGS over a time span of more than nine years; which is an addition to the
12,000 star hours previously analyzed by Schlichting et al. (2009). Our search
for stellar occultations by small Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) yielded one new
candidate event corresponding to a body with a 530 +/-70m radius at a distance
of about 40AU. Using bootstrap simulations, we estimate a probability of approx
5%, that this event is due to random statistical fluctuations within the new
data set. Combining this new event with the single KBO occultation reported by
Schlichting et al. (2009) we arrive at the following results: 1) The ecliptic
latitudes of 6.6 deg and 14.4 deg of the two events are consistent with the
observed inclination distribution of larger, 100km-sized KBOs. 2) Assuming that
small, sub-km sized KBOs have the same ecliptic latitude distribution as their
larger counterparts, we find an ecliptic surface density of KBOs with radii
larger than 250m of N(r>250m) = 1.1^{+1.5}_{-0.7} x 10^7 deg^{-2}; if sub-km
sized KBOs have instead a uniform ecliptic latitude distribution for -20 deg <
b< 20 deg then N(r>250m) = 4.4^{+5.8}_{-2.8} x 10^6 deg^{-2}. This is the best
measurement of the surface density of sub-km sized KBOs to date. 3) Assuming
the KBO size distribution can be well described by a single power law given by
N(>r) \propto r^{1-q}, where N(>r) is the number of KBOs with radii greater
than r, and q is the power law index, we find q=3.8+/-0.2 for a KBO ecliptic
latitude distribution that follows the observed distribution for larger, 100-km
sized KBOs. 4) Regardless of the exact power law, our results suggest that
small KBOs are numerous enough to satisfy the required supply rate for the
Jupiter family comets. (Abridged)

that the minimax error of second kind over alpha-tests stays asymptotically

sharp asymptotics of the minimax error of second kind at the separation rate.
For adaptation over both beta and M in that context, it is known that a
loglog-penalty over the separation rate for rho is necessary for a nonzero
asymptotic power. Here, following an example in nonparametric estimation
related to the Pinsker constant, we investigate the adaptation problem over the

the sharp risk asymptotics can be replicated in that adaptive setting, if rho
tends to zero slower than the separation rate. The penalty for adaptation here

quadratic Stark susceptibility, which we determined using the Dalgarno-Lewis

below Li-donor ionization threshold, relevant to the Stark-tuning electron spin
resonance experiments. To obtain the generalized Stark susceptibilities at
arbitrary fields, we propose a new variational wave function which reproduces
the exact results in the low-field limit. With the calculated susceptibilities
at hand, we are able to predict and analyze several important physical effects.
First, we observe that the energy level shifts due to the quadratic Stark
effect for Li donors in Si are equivalent to, and can be mapped onto, those
produced by an external stress.
  Second, we demonstrate that the Stark effect anisotropy, combined with the
unique valley-orbit splitting of a Li donor in Si, spin-orbit interaction and
specially tuned external stress, may lead to a very strong modulation of the
donor spin $g$-factor by the electric field. Third, we investigate the
influence of random strains on the $g$-factor shifts and quantify the random
strain limits and requirements to Si material purity necessary to observe the
$g$-factor Stark shifts experimentally. Finally, we discuss possible
implications of our results for quantum information processing with Li spin
qubits in Si.

objects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponential
and a general Sersic function. The aim of this analysis is to look for
signatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies and
compare them to kinematic properties. Using Sersic index from single component
fits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- and
early-type galaxies, is not recommended. Assuming that objects with n>3 are
slow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability to
correctly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previously
classified as ellipticals). We show that exponential sub-components, as well as
light profiles fitted with only a single component of a low Sersic index, can
be linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. The
median disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,
respectively. Similarly, the median Sersic indices of the bulge (general Sersic
component) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. Overall,
discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-type
galaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-total
light ratios. Discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent to
the total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. The decomposition into
discs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separation
between fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a
59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. Kinematics (i.e.
projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influence
of the inclination effects.

medium. The Horsehead WHISPER project, a millimeter unbiased line survey at two
positions, namely the photo-dissociation region (PDR) and the nearby shielded
core, revealed a consistent set of eight unidentified lines toward the PDR
position. Six of them are detected with a signal-to-noise ratio from 6 to 19,
while the two last ones are tentatively detected. Mostly noise appears at the
same frequency toward the dense core, located less than 40"" away. We
simultaneously fit 1) the rotational and centrifugal distortion constants of a
linear rotor, and 2) the Gaussian line shapes located at the eight predicted
frequencies. The observed lines can be accurately fitted with a linear rotor
model, implying a 1Sigma ground electronic state. The deduced rotational
constant value is Be= 11244.9512 +/- 0.0015 MHz, close to that of l-C3H. We
thus associate the lines to the l-C3H+ hydrocarbon cation, which enables us to
constrain the chemistry of small hydrocarbons. A rotational diagram is then
used to infer the excitation temperature and the column density. We finally
compare the abundance to the results of the Meudon PDR photochemical model.

to explain observed dynamics than in the case of spiral galaxies, however there
are some instances where Newtonian gravity and the observable mass are
insufficient to explain their observed structure and kinematics. Such is the
case of NGC 4649, a massive elliptical galaxy in the Virgo cluster for which
recent studies report a high fraction of dark matter, 0.78 at $4R_e$. However
this galaxy has been studied within the MOND hypothesis, where a good agreement
with the observed values of velocity dispersion is found. Using a MONDian
gravity force law, here we model this galaxy as a self-consistent gravitational
equilibrium dynamical system. This force law reproduces the MOND phenomenology
in the $a<a_{0}$ regime, and reduces to the Newtonian case when $a>a_{0}$.
Within the MONDian $a<a_{0}$ scales, centrifugal equilibrium or dispersion
velocities become independent of radius, and show a direct proportionality to
the fourth root of the total baryonic mass, $V^{4}\propto(M G a_{0})$. We find
that the recent detailed observations of the surface brightness profile and the
velocity dispersion profile for this galaxy are consistent with the
phenomenology expected in MONDian theories of modified gravity, without the
need of invoking the presence of any hypothetical dark matter.

inflation is driven by the Higgs sector of the Standard Model. The Higgs sector
can support early-universe inflation if it has a large nonminimal coupling to
the Ricci spacetime curvature scalar. At energies relevant to such an
inflationary epoch, the Goldstone modes of the Higgs sector remain in the
spectrum in renormalizable gauges, and hence their effects should be included
in the model's dynamics. We analyze the multifield dynamics of Higgs inflation
and find that the multifield effects damp out rapidly after the onset of
inflation, because of the gauge symmetry among the scalar fields in this model.
Predictions from Higgs inflation for observable quantities, such as the
spectral index of the power spectrum of primordial perturbations, therefore
revert to their familiar single-field form, in excellent agreement with recent
measurements. The methods we develop here may be applied to any multifield
model with nonminimal couplings in which the ${\cal N}$ fields obey an $SO

renormalization group, exact diagonalization, Schwinger boson mean field
theory, quantum Monte-Carlo and series expansion, we explore the parameter
space of this model in the regime of all-antiferromagnetic exchange. In
contrast to unfrustrated four-leg tubes we uncover a rich phase diagram. Apart
from the Luttinger liquid fixed point in the limit of decoupled legs, this
comprises several gapped ground states, namely a plaquette, an incommensurate,
and an antiferromagnetic quasi spin-2 chain phase. The transitions between
these phases are analyzed in terms of total energy and static structure factor
calculations and are found to be of (weak) first order. Despite the absence of
long range order in the quantum case, remarkable similarities to the classical
phase diagram are uncovered, with the exception of the icommensurate regime,
which is strongly renormalized by quantum fluctuations. In the limit of large
leg exchange the tube exhibits a deconfinement cross-over from gapped magnon
like excitations to spinons.

creates pixel-based models of the varying point spread function (PSF) in
individual image exposures. It fits PSF-convolved two-component (disk plus
bulge) models, to measure the ellipticity of each galaxy, with bayesian
marginalisation over model nuisance parameters of galaxy position, size,

the alignment of the multiple measurements. We discuss the effects of noise

zigzag nanotubes, (8,0) and (5,0), show stronger binding energies for the Na
atom (-2.1 eV and -2.6 eV respectively), as compared to metallic SWCNTs with
armchair and chiral geometries. The single Na atom can further adsorb up to six
hydrogen molecules with a relatively constant binding energy of -0.26
eV/H$_{2}$. Mulliken population analysis shows that positively charged Na atoms
with 0.82$e$ charge transfer to nearest carbon atoms which polarizes the SWCNT
leading to local dipole moments. This charge-induced dipole interaction is
responsible for the higher hydrogen uptake of Na-coated SWCNTs. The transition
state search shows that diffusion barrier of Na-atom on the SWCNT between two
adjoining C-C rings is 0.35 eV. We also investigate the clustering of Na atoms
to find out the maximum weight percentage adsorption of H$_{2}$ molecules. At
high Na coverage, we show that Na-coated SWCNTs can adsorb 9.2-11.28 wt %
hydrogen. Our analysis shows that, although indeed Na-coated SWCNTs present
potential material for the hydrogen storage, care should be taken to avoid Na
atoms clustering on support material at elevated temperature and pressure, to
achieve higher hydrogen capacity.

exoplanets, but the question of whether shocks develop lingers. Specifically,
it reduces to whether continuous flow in a closed loop may become supersonic
and if some portions of the supersonic flow steepen into shocks. We first
demonstrate that continuous, supersonic flow may exist in two flavors:
isentropic and non-isentropic, with shocks being included in the latter class
of solutions. Supersonic flow is a necessary but insufficient condition for
shocks to develop. The development of a shock requires the characteristics of
neighboring points in a flow to intersect. We demonstrate that the intersection
of characteristics may be quantified via knowledge of the Mach number. Finally,
we examine 3D simulations of hot Jovian atmospheres and demonstrate that shock
formation is expected to occur mostly on the dayside hemisphere, upstream of
the substellar point, because the enhanced temperatures near the substellar
point provide a natural pressure barrier for the returning flow. Understanding
the role of shocks in irradiated exoplanetary atmospheres is relevant to
correctly modeling observables such as the peak offsets of infrared phase

comprising 42 antenna elements with 6-m diameter dishes. We characterize the
antenna optical accuracy using two-antenna interferometry and radio holography.
The distortion of each telescope relative to the average is small, with RMS
differences of 1 percent of beam peak value. Holography provides images of dish
illumination pattern, allowing characterization of as-built mirror surfaces.
The ATA dishes can experience mm-scale distortions across -2 meter lengths due
to mounting stresses or solar radiation. Experimental RMS errors are 0.7 mm at
night and 3 mm under worst case solar illumination. For frequencies 4, 10, and
15 GHz, the nighttime values indicate sensitivity losses of 1, 10 and 20
percent, respectively. The ATA.s exceptional wide-bandwidth permits
observations over a continuous range 0.5 to 11.2 GHz, and future retrofits may
increase this range to 15 GHz. Beam patterns show a slowly varying focus
frequency dependence. We probe the antenna optical gain and beam pattern
stability as a function of focus and observation frequency, concluding that ATA
can produce high fidelity images over a decade of simultaneous observation
frequencies. In the day, the antenna sensitivity and pointing accuracy are
affected. We find that at frequencies greater than 5 GHz, daytime observations
greater than 5 GHz will suffer some sensitivity loss and it may be necessary to
make antenna pointing corrections on a 1 to 2 hourly basis.

have potential applications in various areas of science. The polarization
characteristics of LSPR in addition to spectroscopic tuning can be suitably

have been studied here using a novel combination of Muller-matrix polarimetry
with the T-matrix matrix approach for silver nano-rods to show unprecedented
control and sensitivity to local refractive index variations. The study carried
out over various aspect ratios for a constant equal volume sphere radius shows
the presence of longitu- dinal (dipolar and quadrupolar) and transverse
(dipolar) resonances; arising due to differential contribution of
polarizabilities in two directions. The overlap regions of these resonances and
the resonances themselves exhibit enhanced retardance and diattenuation
respectively. The spectral and amplitude tunability of these polarimetric
parameters through the aspect ratios to span from the minimum to maximum ([0,
1] in the case of diattenuation and [0, {\pi}] in the case of retardance)
presents a novel result that could be used to tailor systems for study of
biological media. On the other hand, the high sensitivity of diattenuation dip
(caused by equal contribution of polarizabilities) could be possibly used for
medium characterization and bio-sensing or bio-imaging studies.

the assumption of uniform stochastic emission processes for different power-law
indices of their power spectra. For sufficiently shallow slopes (power-law
indices beta < 1), the flux distributions (histograms) of the resulting

slopes (beta > 1), the flux distributions become multi-modal. This finding
disagrees systematically with results of recent mm/radio observations.
Accordingly, we conclude that the emission from AGN does not necessarily

1000 stars. It is highly probable that this cluster environment influenced
various properties of the solar system like its chemical composition, size and
the orbital parameters of some of its constituting bodies. In the Milky Way,
clusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters
and leaky clusters - each following a unique temporal development in the
mass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in
the range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster
environments as a function of cluster age. N-body methods are used to
investigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions
between cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. Using
the now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age it is
demonstrated that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first
5Myr are so high (initially > 10^5 Msun pc^{-3}) that hardly any discs with
solar system building potential would survive this phase. This makes a
starburst clusters an unlikely environment for the formation of our solar
system. Instead it is highly probable that the solar system formed in a leaky
cluster (often classified as OB association). It is demonstrated that an
encounter determining the characteristic properties existing in our solar
systems most likely happened very early on (< 2Myr) in its formation history
and that after 5Myr the likelihood of a solar-type star experiencing such an
encounter in a leaky cluster is negligible even if it was still part of the
bound remnant. This explains why the solar system could develop and maintain
its high circularity later in its development.

the ALICE detector in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sNN=2.76$ TeV. Jets are
reconstructed from charged particles using the anti-\kt jet algorithm. The
transverse momentum of tracks is measured down to 150 MeV/$c$ which gives
access to the low \pt fragments of the jet. The background from soft particle
production is determined for each event and subtracted. The remaining influence
of underlying event fluctuations is quantified by embedding different probes
into heavy-ion data. The reconstructed transverse momentum spectrum is
corrected for background fluctuations by unfolding. We observe a strong
suppression in central events of inclusive jets reconstructed with radii of 0.2
and 0.3. The fragmentation bias on jets introduced by requiring a high \pt
leading particle which rejects jets with a soft fragmentation pattern is
equivalent for central and peripheral events.

teleportation. It is demonstrated that the presence of strong nonlocal memory
effects, which arise from initial correlations between the environments of the

amount of initial correlations within the environment affects the fidelity of
the protocol, and find that for a moderate amount of correlations the fidelity
exceeds the one of the previously known optimal teleportation protocol without

harnessing noisy quantum systems for quantum communication and that

a 3D solvent), which is experimentally feasible, for instance, by (optical)

oblateness is a more challenging measurement than the diameter, since the
signal amplitude is a few milli-arcseconds. It is a relative measurement, then
not affected by the pixel scale calibration required by the diameter
measurement. But the results are strongly dependent on the state of instrument

investigates fault diagnosis in the model space instead of in the signal space.
Learning in the model space is implemented by fitting a series of models using
a series of signal segments selected with a rolling window. By investigating
the learning techniques in the fitted model space, faulty models can be
discriminated from healthy models using one-class learning algorithm. The
framework enables us to construct fault library when unknown faults occur,
which can be regarded as cognitive fault isolation. This paper also
theoretically investigates how to measure the pairwise distance between two
models in the model space and incorporates the model distance into the learning
algorithm in the model space. The results on three benchmark applications and
one simulated model for the Barcelona water distribution network have confirmed
the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

consider various markers of criticality and illustrate how they should perform

sizes we are able to show that, over a limited range of avalanche sizes which
we precisely identify, the distribution has scale free properties but is not a
power law. This suggests that it would be inappropriate to dismiss a system as
not being critical purely based on an inability to rigorously fit a power law
distribution as has been recently advocated. In assessing whether a system,
especially a finite-size one, is critical it is thus important to consider
other possible markers. We illustrate one of these by showing the divergence of
susceptibility as the critical point of the system is approached. Finally, we
provide evidence that power laws may underlie other observables of the system,
that may be more amenable to robust experimental assessment.

this scenario using a suite of self-consistent hydrodynamic simulations of a

disk stellar/gas surface densities and the spin parameter of its host halo. A
clear anti-correlation between the surface densities and the halo spin
parameter, lambda, is found. That is, as the halo spin parameter increases, the
disk cutoff radius at which the stellar surface density drops below 0.1
Msun/pc^2 monotonically increases, while the average stellar surface density of
the disk within that radius decreases. The ratio of the average stellar surface
density for the case of lambda=0.03 to that for the case of lambda=0.14 reaches
more than 15. We demonstrate that the result is robust against variations in

study the case of uniaxially symmetric objects. Conditions for zero backward
and forward scattering are found for a general uniaxial bi-anisotropic particle
and specialized for all fundamental classes of bi-anisotropic particles: omega,
""moving"", chiral, and Tellegen particles. Possibility for zero total scattering
is also discussed for aforementioned cases. The scattering pattern and
polarization of the scattered wave are also determined for each particle class.
In particular, we analyze the interplay between different scattering mechanisms
and show that in some cases it is possible to compensate scattering from a
polarizable particle by appropriate magneto-electric coupling. Examples of
particles providing zero backscattering and zero forward scattering are
presented and studied numerically.

processes serve as basic building blocks for the implementation of quantum
optical experiments: type-II PDC enables the efficient creation of quantum
states such as photon-number states and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-states
(EPR-states). FC gives rise to technologies enabling efficient atom-photon
coupling, ultrafast pulse gates and enhanced detection schemes. However,
despite their widespread deployment, their theoretical treatment remains
challenging. Especially the multi-photon components in the high-gain regime as
well as the explicit time-dependence of the involved Hamiltonians hamper an
efficient theoretical description of these nonlinear optical processes.
  In this paper, we investigate these effects and put forward two models that
enable a full description of FC and type-II PDC in the high-gain regime. We
present a rigorous numerical model relying on the solution of coupled
integro-differential equations that covers the complete dynamics of the
process. As an alternative, we develop a simplified model that, at the expense
of neglecting time-ordering effects, enables an analytical solution.
  While the simplified model approximates the correct solution with high
fidelity in a broad parameter range, sufficient for many experimental
situations, such as FC with low efficiency, entangled photon-pair generation
and the heralding of single photons from type-II PDC, our investigations reveal
that the rigorous model predicts a decreased performance for FC processes in
quantum pulse gate applications and an enhanced EPR-state generation rate
during type-II PDC, when EPR squeezing values above 12 dB are considered.

still frequently perceived to be based on \textit{ad hoc} assumptions, rather
than a rigorous derivation from quantum mechanics. Starting from the adiabatic
connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem, an exact expression for the
electronic exchange-correlation energy, we demonstrate that the pairwise
interatomic dispersion energy for an arbitrary collection of isotropic
polarizable dipoles emerges from the second-order expansion of the ACFD
formula. Moreover, for a system of quantum harmonic oscillators coupled through
a dipole--dipole potential, we prove the equivalence between the full
interaction energy obtained from the Hamiltonian diagonalization and the ACFD
correlation energy in the random-phase approximation. This property makes the
Hamiltonian diagonalization an efficient method for the calculation of the
many-body dispersion energy. In addition, we show that the switching function
used to damp the dispersion interaction at short distances arises from a
short-range screened Coulomb potential, whose role is to account for the
spatial spread of the individual atomic dipole moments. By using the ACFD
formula we gain a deeper understanding of the approximations made in the
interatomic pairwise approaches, providing a powerful formalism for further
development of accurate and efficient methods for the calculation of the

two spatial dimensions and interacting with lasers. We find phonon bands with
non-trivial topological properties, which are caused by the breaking of time
reversal symmetry induced by the lasers. We investigate the appearance of edge
modes, as well as their robustness against perturbations. Long-range hopping of
phonons caused by the Coulomb interaction gives rise to flat bands which,
together with induced phonon-phonon interactions, can be used to produce and
explore strongly correlated states. Furthermore, some of these ideas can also
be implemented with cold atoms in optical lattices.

significantly advance nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. They would combine
transport and optical characteristics in a nanoscale device, which can operate
in the fundamental single-electron and single-photon regime. III-V materials,
such as direct bandgap gallium-arsenide, are excellent candidates for such
optical segments. However, interfacing them with silicon during crystal growth
is a major challenge, because of the lattice mismatch, different expansion
coefficients and the formation of anti-phase boundaries. Here, we demonstrate a
silicon nanowire with an integrated gallium-arsenide segment. We precisely
control the catalyst composition and surface chemistry to obtain
dislocation-free interfaces. The integration of gallium-arsenide of high
optical quality with silicon is enabled by short gallium phosphide buffers. We
anticipate that such hybrid silicon/III-V nanowires open practical routes for
quantum information devices, where for instance electronic and photonic quantum
bits are manipulated in a III-V segment and stored in a silicon section.

commonly considered to be diffuse emission arising from strong interactions of

population of individual pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe) could be responsible for
the detected TeV emission. Here we show that the Starburst environment plays a
critical role in the TeV emission from Starburst PWNe, and perform the first
detailed calculations for this scenario. Our approach is based on the measured
star-formation rates in the Starburst nuclei of NGC 253 and M 82, assumed
pulsar birth periods and a simple model for the injection of non-thermal
particles. The two-zone model applied here takes into account the high
far-infrared radiation field, and different densities and magnetic fields in
the PWNe and the Starburst regions, as well as particle escape. We confirm that
PWNe can make a significant contribution to the TeV fluxes, provided that the
injection spectrum of particles is rather hard and that the average pulsar
birth period is rather short (~35 ms). The PWN contribution should lead to a
distinct spectral feature which can be probed by future instruments such as

doping counteracting on strain induced enhancement of Kohn anomaly, which leads
to an overall stiffening of zone boundary K1 phonon mode whose softening under

network of single-crystalline $\alpha$-PbO platelets and the formation of the
native point defects in $\alpha$-PbO crystal lattice are studied using first
principles calculations. The $\alpha$-PbO lattice consists of coupled layers
interaction between which is too low to produce high efficiency interlayer
charge transfer. In practice, the polycrystalline nature of $\alpha$-PbO causes
the formation of lattice defects in such a high concentration that
defect-related conductivity becomes the dominant factor in the interlayer
charge transition. We found that the formation energy for the O vacancies is
low, such vacancies are occupied by two electrons in the zero charge state and
tend to donate their electrons to the Pb vacancies that leads to ionization of
both vacancies.The vacancies introduce localized states in the band gap which
can affect charge transport. The O vacancy forms a defect state at 1.03 eV
above the valence band which can act as a deep trap for electrons, while the Pb
vacancy forms a shallow trap for holes located just 0.1 eV above the valence
band. Charge de-trapping from O vacancies can be accounted for the
experimentally found dark current decay in ITO/PbO/Au structures.

area spectrum. Using this formalism and a theorem we prove in this paper, we
briefly show the procedure to calculate the quantum corrections to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. One can do this by two steps. First, one can
calculate the ""naive"" black hole degeneracy without the projection constraint
(in case of the U(1) symmetry reduced framework) or the SU(2) invariant
subspace constraint (in case of the fully SU(2) framework). Second, then one
can impose the projection constraint or the SU(2) invariant subspace
constraint, obtaining logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy. In this paper, we focus on the first step and show that we obtain
infinite relations between the area spectrum and the naive black hole
degeneracy. Promoting the naive black hole degeneracy into its approximation,
we obtain the full solution to the infinite relations.

S. Peirce, is the common inner syntax of quantum mechanics and string theory. A
relation may be represented by a spinor and the Cartan-Penrose connection of
spinor to geometry, allows to abstract geometry from a calculus of
relations-spinors, reviving Wheeler\textquoteright{}s pregeometry. With a
single spinor related to the null cone of Minkowski space-time, we search for
the geometry emerging when we entangle a left-handed spinor and a right-handed
spinor. We find that the quantum entanglement generates an extra dimension and
the distance in the extra dimension is measured by the amount of entanglement.
The emerging geometry corresponds to a Milne space-time, with two branes
coexisting in the extra dimension. One brane hosts left-handed particles (our
brane), while the other brane hosts right-handed particles. A distinct
phenomenology accompanies our proposal. During the brane collision all points
are causally connected, making less pressing the inflationary scenario. The
left-right symmetry is achieved with having two ""mirror"" branes and the
neutrino appears as the ideal mediator between the branes. We may revisit also
the dark matter, dark energy issues, with everything on the other brane and in
the bulk appearing ""dark"" to us. If biohomochirality is due to parity
violation, we anticipate that the life-forms in the other brane demonstrate
opposite chiralities. Our scheme brings closer logic - quantum theory - string
theory -- geometry -- cosmology, while space-time, rather than an abstract and
a apriori construction, appears as the outcome of a quantum logical act.

equivalent to a Pais-Uhlenbeck scalar field. With the help of this equivalence,
we can determine natural interactions of this field with scalars and fermions.
Since the theory has a global U(1) symmetry, we have the usual conserved
current of the charged fields, thanks to which the dynamics of the scalar field
is not modified by the interactions. We use this fact to consistently quantize
the theory even in the presence of interactions. We argue that such a degree of
freedom can only be excited by gravitational effects like the inflationary era
of the early universe and may play the role of dark energy in the form of an
effective cosmological constant whose value is linked to the inflation scale.

deterministic or statistical, is characterized by similarity exponents and a
function of scaled variable, called the scaling function. In the present paper,
we address mainly the self-similarity in the limit of early stage, as~opposed
to the latter one, and also consider the scaling functions that decay or grow
algebraically, as~opposed to the rapidly decaying functions such as Gaussian or
error function. In particular, in~the case of simple diffusion, our symmetry
analysis shows a mathematical mechanism by which the rapidly decaying scaling
functions are generated by other polynomial scaling functions. While~the former
is adapted to the self-similarity in the late-stage processes, the latter is
adapted to the early stages. This paper sheds some light on the internal
structure of the family of self-similarities generated by a simple diffusion
equation.
  Then, we present an example of self-similarity for the late stage whose
scaling function has power-law tail, and also several cases of self-similarity
for the early stages. These examples show the utility of self-similarity to a
wider range of phenomena other than the late stage behaviors with rapidly
decaying scaling function

that by using entangled particles from the source it would be possible to
determine which slit a particle goes through while still preserving the
interference pattern in the Young two slit experiment. In 2000, Kim et al used
spontaneous parametric down conversion to prepare entangled photons as their
source, and almost achieved this. In 2012, Menzel et al. experimentally
succeeded in doing this. When the source emits entangled particle pairs, the
traversed slit is inferred from measurement of the entangled particle location
by using triangulation. The violation of complementarity breaches the
prevailing probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, and benefits the
Bohm pilot wave theory.
