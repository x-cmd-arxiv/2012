Gei{\ss}-Leclerc-Schr\""oer prove that all cluster variables in a cluster
algebra are irreducible elements. Furthermore, they provide two necessary
conditions for a cluster algebra to be a unique factorization domain, namely
the irreducibility and the coprimality of the initial exchange polynomials.
  We present a sufficient condition for a cluster algebra to be a unique
factorization domain in terms of primary decompositions of certain ideals
generated by initial cluster variables and initial exchange polynomials. As an
application, the criterion enables us to decide which coefficient-free cluster
algebras of Dynkin type A, D or E are unique factorization domains. Moreover,
it yields a normal form for irreducible elements in cluster algebras that
satisfy the condition. Proof techniques include methods from commutative
algebra.
  In addition, we state a conjecture about the range of application of the
criterion.

practical precoder design problems such as multi-cell coordinated linear

allows linearly polarized plasmonic waves to propagate along the chain. In this
paper, we consider how these waves are altered by an anisotropic host (such as
a nematic liquid crystal) or an applied magnetic field. In a liquid crystalline
host, with principal axis (director) oriented either parallel or perpendicular
to the chain, we find that the dispersion relations of both the longitudinal
($L$) and transverse ($T$) modes are significantly altered relative to those of
an isotropic host. Furthermore, when the director is perpendicular to the
chain, the doubly degenerate $T$ branch is split by the anisotropy of the host
material. With an applied magnetic field ${\bf B}$ parallel to the chain, the
propagating transverse modes are circularly polarized, and the left and right
circularly polarized branches have slightly different dispersion relations. As
a result, if a linearly polarized transverse wave is launched along the chain,
it undergoes Faraday rotation. For parameters approximating that of a typical
metal and for a field of 2T, the Faraday rotation is of order 1$^o$ per ten
interparticle spacings, even taking into account single-particle damping. If
${\bf B}$ is perpendicular to the chain, one of the $T$ branches mixes with the
$L$ branch to form two elliptically polarized branches. Our calculations
include single-particle damping and can, in principle, be generalized to
include radiation damping. The present work suggests that the dispersion
relations of plasmonic waves on chain of nanoparticles can be controlled by
immersing the chain in a nematic liquid crystal and varying the director axis,
or by applying a magnetic field.

for the hot subdwarf (0.48 M_sun), although a white dwarf mass as low as 0.75

subdwarf mass of ~0.48 M_sun, the total mass of the system reaches the
Chandrasekhar mass limit at 1.35 M_sun and would exceed it for a subdwarf mass

experimental anomaly observed at LSND. We define a particular model that could
also explain the MiniBooNE excess consistently with the data at other neutrino
experiments (radiative muon capture at TRIUMF, T2K, or single photon at NOMAD).
The key ingredients are (i) its long lifetime (\tau_h\approx 3-7x10^{-9} s),
which introduces a 1/E dependence with the event energy, and (ii) its Dirac
nature, which implies a photon preferably emitted opposite to the beam
direction and further reduces the event energy at MiniBooNE. We show that these
neutrinos are mostly produced through electromagnetic interactions with nuclei,
and that T2K observations force BR(\nu_h -> \nu_\tau\gamma) \le 0.01 \approx
BR(\nu_h -> \nu_\mu\gamma). The scenario implies then the presence of a second
sterile neutrino \nu_{h'} which is lighter, longer lived and less mixed with
the standard flavors than \nu_h. Since such particle would be copiously
produced in air showers through (\nu_h -> \nu_{h'}\gamma) decays, we comment on
the possible contamination that its photon-mediated elastic interactions with

bright molecular emission over faint emission extended over large areas. This
relative quantity is largely independent of the amount of molecular gas and of
any conventional, pre-conceived structures, such as cores, clumps, or giant
molecular clouds. The structured molecular gas traced by higher BDI is located
continuously along the spiral arms in the Milky Way in the longitude-velocity

flows through the spiral arms. Although the high-BDI gas generally coincides
with H II regions, there is also some high-BDI gas with no/little signature of
ongoing star formation. These results support a possible evolutionary sequence

anisotropy of the radiation field that illuminates each point within the
medium, and this may in principle influence the scattering line polarization
that results from the induced atomic level polarization. Here we analyze the
emergent linear polarization profiles of the Ca II infrared triplet after
solving the radiative transfer problem of scattering polarization in
time-dependent hydrodynamical models of the solar chromosphere, taking into
account the impact of the plasma macroscopic velocity on the atomic level
polarization. We discuss the influence that the velocity and temperature shocks
in the considered chromospheric models have on the temporal evolution of the
scattering polarization signals of the Ca II infrared lines, as well as on the
temporally averaged profiles. Our results indicate that the increase of the
linear polarization amplitudes caused by macroscopic velocity gradients may be
significant in realistic situations. We also study the effect of the
integration time, the microturbulent velocity and the photospheric dynamical
conditions, and discuss the feasibility of observing with large-aperture
telescopes the temporal variation of the scattering polarization profiles.
Finally, we explore the possibility of using the differential Hanle effect in
the IR triplet of Ca II with the intention of avoiding the characterization of
the zero-field polarization to infer magnetic fields in dynamic situations.

integrate-and-fire neurons, suggesting that HDA may serve as a model of neural
computation. We show that the numerical performance of HDA is on par with
existing algorithms. In the asymptotic regime the representation error of HDA

by a decaying system or by an accelerated charge in the N=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory, led to a striking result: the 'supergravity backreaction',
which is supposed to describe the energy density at infinitely strong coupling,
yields exactly the same result as at zero coupling, that is, it shows no trace
of quantum broadening. We argue that this is not a real property of the
radiation at strong coupling, but an artifact of the backreaction calculation,
which is unable to faithfully capture the space-time distribution of the
radiation. This becomes obvious in the case of a decaying system ('virtual
photon'), for which the backreaction is tantamount to computing a three-point
function in the conformal gauge theory, which is independent of the coupling
since protected by symmetries. Whereas this non-renormalization property is
specific to the conformal N=4 SYM theory, we argue that the failure of the
three-point function to provide a local measurement is in fact generic: it
holds in any field theory with non-trivial interactions. To properly study a
localized distribution, one should rather compute a four-point function, as
standard in deep inelastic scattering. We substantiate these considerations
with studies of the radiation produced by the decay of a time-like photon at
both weak and strong coupling. We show that by computing four-point functions,
in perturbation theory at weak coupling and, respectively, from Witten diagrams
at strong coupling, one can follow the quantum evolution and thus demonstrate
the broadening of the energy distribution. This broadening is slow when the
coupling is weak but it proceeds as fast as possible in the limit of a strong
coupling.

  2.1, corrected typos",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study shared randomness in the context of multi-party number-in-hand
communication protocols in the simultaneous message passing model. We show that
with three or more players, shared randomness exhibits new interesting
properties that have no direct analogues in the two-party case.
  First, we demonstrate a hierarchy of modes of shared randomness, with the
usual shared randomness where all parties access the same random string as the
strongest form in the hierarchy. We show exponential separations between its
levels, and some of our bounds may be of independent interest. For example, we
show that the equality function can be solved by a protocol of constant length
using the weakest form of shared randomness, which we call ""XOR-shared
randomness.""
  Second, we show that quantum communication cannot replace shared randomness
in the k-party case, where k >= 3 is any constant. We demonstrate a promise
function GP_k that can be computed by a classical protocol of constant length
when (the strongest form of) shared randomness is available, but any quantum
protocol without shared randomness must send n^Omega(1) qubits to compute it.
Moreover, the quantum complexity of GP_k remains n^Omega(1) even if the ""second
strongest"" mode of shared randomness is available. While a somewhat similar
separation was already known in the two-party case, in the multi-party case our
statement is qualitatively stronger:
  * In the two-party case, only a relational communication problem with similar
properties is known.
  * In the two-party case, the gap between the two complexities of a problem
can be at most exponential, as it is known that 2^(O(c)) log n qubits can
always replace shared randomness in any c-bit protocol. Our bounds imply that
with quantum communication alone, in general, it is not possible to simulate
efficiently even a three-bit three-party classical protocol that uses shared
randomness.

We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that

altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles. This
model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of
photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy
atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium. The composition at the lower
boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of
the lower atmosphere. We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 microbar
level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included
above this level. We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected
species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with
the rapidly escaping H and H+. This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms
and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and
ionization rates. We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up
to at least 3 Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly
lower altitudes. We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and
find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on
the assumed heating efficiencies...

In addition to probing the temperature and density profiles in the
thermosphere, they have implications for the properties of the lower
atmosphere. Fits to the observations with a simple empirical model and a direct
comparison with a more complex hydrodynamic model constrain the mean
temperature and ionization state of the atmosphere, and imply that the optical
depth of the extended thermosphere of the planet in the atomic resonance lines
is significant. In particular, it is sufficient to explain the observed transit
depths in the H I 1216 A line. The detection of O at high altitudes implies
that the minimum mass loss rate from the planet is approximately 6e6 kg/s. The
mass loss rate based on our hydrodynamic model is higher than this and implies
that diffusive separation is prevented for neutral species with a mass lower
than about 130 amu by the escape of H. Heavy ions are transported to the upper
atmosphere by Coulomb collisions with H+ and their presence does not provide as
strong constraints on the mass loss rate as the detection of heavy neutral
atoms. Models of the upper atmosphere with solar composition and heating based
on the average solar X-ray and EUV flux agree broadly with the observations but
tend to underestimate the transit depths in the O I, C II, and Si III lines.
This suggests that the temperature and/or elemental abundances in the

circuit using such a ""brute force"" approach is rather time-consuming and
inefficient because the connectivity in neural circuits is sparse. Instead, we
propose to measure a post-synaptic neuron's voltage while stimulating
sequentially random subsets of multiple potentially pre-synaptic neurons. To
reconstruct these synaptic connections from the recorded voltage we apply a
decoding algorithm recently developed for compressive sensing. Compared to the
brute force approach, our method promises significant time savings that grow
with the size of the circuit. We use computer simulations to find optimal
stimulation parameters and explore the feasibility of our reconstruction method

integration. Multineuronal stimulation allows reconstructing synaptic
connectivity just from the spiking activity of post-synaptic neurons, even when
sub-threshold voltage is unavailable. By using calcium indicators,

the electrostatic potential. Its linearization and a first smoothing reveal
this potential to be the sum of the shielded Coulomb potentials of the
individual particles. Smoothing this sum yields the classical Vlasovian
expression including initial conditions in Landau contour calculations of
Langmuir wave growth or damping. The theory is extended to accommodate a
correct description of trapping or chaos due to Langmuir waves. In the linear
regime, the amplitude of such a wave is found to be ruled by Landau growth or
damping and by spontaneous emission. Using the shielded potential, the
collisional diffusion coefficient is computed for the first time by a
convergent expression including the correct calculation of deflections for all
impact parameters. Shielding and collisional transport are found to be two
related aspects of the repulsive deflections of electrons.

consider the computational complexity of the invariants arising from an
elementary family of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras: quantum doubles of
finite groups (denoted D(G), for a group G). Regarding algorithms for these
invariants, we develop quantum circuits for the quantum Fourier transform over
D(G); in general, we show that when one can uniformly and efficiently carry out
the quantum Fourier transform over the centralizers Z(g) of the elements of G,
one can efficiently carry out the quantum Fourier transform over D(G). We apply
these results to the symmetric groups to yield efficient circuits for the
quantum Fourier transform over D(S_n). With such a Fourier transform, it is
straightforward to obtain additive approximation algorithms for the related
link invariant. Additionally, we show that certain D(G) invariants (such as
D(A_n) invariants) are BPP-hard to additively approximate, SBP-hard to
multiplicatively approximate, and #P-hard to exactly evaluate. Finally, we make
partial progress on the question of simulating anyonic computation in groups
uniformly as a function of the group size. In this direction, we provide
efficient quantum circuits for the Clebsch-Gordan transform over D(G) for
""fluxon"" irreps, i.e., irreps of D(G) characterized by a conjugacy class of G.
For general irreps, i.e., those which are associated with a conjugacy class of
G and an irrep of a centralizer, we present an efficient implementation under
certain conditions such as when there is an efficient Clebsch-Gordan transform
over the centralizers. We remark that this also provides a simulation of
certain anyonic models of quantum computation, even in circumstances where the

not overcome the particular difficulty that Turing was concerned about, which

are thought to grow by accreting mass from their surroundings through
large-scale virial shocks. Due to electron acceleration in such a shock, it
should appear as a $\gamma$-ray, hard X-ray, and radio ring, elongated towards
the large-scale filaments feeding the cluster, coincident with a cutoff in the
thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal. However, no such signature was found
until now, and the very existence of cluster virial shocks has remained a
theory. We find preliminary evidence for a large, $\sim 5$ Mpc minor axis
$\gamma$-ray ring around the Coma cluster, elongated towards the large scale
filament connecting Coma and Abell 1367, detected at the nominal $2.7\sigma$
confidence level ($5.1\sigma$ using control signal simulations). The
$\gamma$-ray ring correlates both with a synchrotron signal and with the SZ
cutoff, but not with Galactic tracers. The $\gamma$-ray and radio signatures
agree with analytic and numerical predictions, if the shock deposits $\sim 1\%$
of the thermal energy in relativistic electrons over a Hubble time, and $\sim
1\%$ in magnetic fields. The implied inverse-Compton and synchrotron cumulative
emission from similar shocks can significantly contribute to the diffuse
extragalactic $\gamma$-ray and low frequency radio backgrounds. Our results, if
confirmed, reveal the prolate structure of the hot gas in Coma, the feeding
pattern of the cluster, and properties of the surrounding large scale voids and

the old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 in which we study in detail the solar-type
hard binaries and blue stragglers of the cluster, here we investigate the
dynamical evolution of NGC 188 through a sophisticated N-body model. We employ
the observed binary properties of the young (150 Myr) open cluster M35, where
possible, to guide our choices for parameters of the initial binary population.
At 7 Gyr the main-sequence solar-type hard-binary population in the model
matches that of NGC 188 in both binary frequency and distributions of orbital
parameters. This agreement between the model and observations is in a large
part due to the similarities between the NGC 188 and M35 solar-type binaries.
Indeed, among the 7 Gyr main-sequence binaries in the model, only those with
P>1000 days show potentially observable evidence for modifications by dynamical
encounters. This emphasizes the importance of defining accurate initial
conditions for star cluster models, which we propose is best accomplished
through comparisons with observations of young open clusters like M35.
Furthermore, this suggests that observations of the present-day binaries in
even old open clusters can provide valuable information on their primordial
binary populations. However, despite the model's successes at matching the true
cluster, the model underproduces blue stragglers and produces an overabundance
of long-period circular main-sequence--white-dwarf binaries as compared to NGC
188. We conclude that improvements in the physics of mass transfer and common
envelope may in fact solve both discrepancies with the observations. This
project highlights the unique accessibility of open clusters to both
comprehensive observational surveys and full-scale N-body simulations, and
underscores the importance of open clusters to the study of star cluster
dynamics.

simple prediction scheme, a cosmic emulator, for the c-M relation as a function
of cosmological parameters for wCDM models. The emulator is constructed from 37
individual models, with three nested N-body gravity-only simulations carried
out for each model. The mass range covered by the emulator is 2 x 10^{12} M_sun
< M <10^{15} M_sun with a corresponding redshift range of z=0 -1. Over this
range of mass and redshift, as well as the variation of cosmological parameters
studied, the mean halo concentration varies from c ~ 2 to c ~ 8. The
distribution of the concentration at fixed mass is Gaussian with a standard
deviation of one-third of the mean value, almost independent of cosmology,
mass, and redshift over the ranges probed by the simulations. We compare
results from the emulator with previously derived heuristic analytic fits for
the c-M relation, finding that they underestimate the halo concentration at
high masses. Using the emulator to investigate the cosmology dependence of the
c-M relation over the currently allowable range of values, we find -- not
surprisingly -- that \sigma_8 and \omega_m influence it considerably, but also
that the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, has a substantial effect.
In general, the concentration of lower-mass halos is more sensitive to changes
in cosmological parameters as compared to cluster mass halos.

relativistic heavy ion collision is explored by simulating the chemical
evolution of a hadron gas. Beginning with a chemically equilibrated gas at an
initial temperature of 170 MeV, the chemical composition of a representative
hydrodynamic cell is followed throughout the hadronic stage. The cell's volume
changes with time according to a parameterization that mimics a
three-dimensional hydrodynamic expansion. The chemical evolution includes both
annihilation and regeneration of baryons, consistent with detailed balance.
During the hadronic stage, the number of baryons drops by approximately $40\%$
for the case where there is no net baryonic charge. When the calculations are
performed without the baryon regenerating processes, e.g. $5\pi\rightarrow
p\bar{p}$, the loss of baryons was found to be closer to $50\%$. After
accounting for annihilation, yields are consistent with measurements from the
ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. Baryon annihilation is shown to alter the
extracted chemical breakup temperature by significantly changing the $p/\pi$
ratio. Assuming that annihilation cross sections are independent of the
strangeness and isospin of the annihilating baryon and anti-baryon, the loss of
strange baryons from annihilation is found to be similar.

responsible for the existence of a Fermi surface and the consequent presence of
low energy spectral weight over a finite range of momenta. We investigate the
extent to which this effect occurs in strongly interacting quantum matter with
a holographic dual. We obtain the low energy current-current spectral weight in
two holographic frameworks at finite density: systems exhibiting semi-local
quantum criticality (with a low temperature entropy density vanishing like s ~
T^eta), and a probe D3/D5 system. For the semi-local theory with 0 < eta < 2 we
find a sharp discontinuity in the transverse spectral weight at a nonzero
momentum k_*. The case eta = 1 is found to have additional symmetries and is
soluble even at nonzero temperature. We show that this case exhibits a robust
linear in temperature resistivity in the presence of random charged impurities.
For the probe D3/D5 system we find an analytic expression for the low energy
spectral weight as a function of momentum. The spectral weight is supported
below a specific momentum k_* and is exponentially suppressed at higher
momenta.

with a dynamical system, online, in order to improve estimation of the state of

problems, such as those arising in weather forecasting. To gain understanding
of filters in applications such as these, it is hence of interest to study
their behaviour when applied to infinite dimensional dynamical systems. This
motivates study of the problem of accuracy and stability of 3DVAR filters for
the Navier-Stokes equation.
  We work in the limit of high frequency observations and derive continuous
time filters. This leads to a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE)
for state estimation, in the form of a damped-driven Navier-Stokes equation,
with mean-reversion to the signal, and spatially-correlated time-white noise.
Both forward and pullback accuracy and stability results are proved for this
SPDE, showing in particular that when enough low Fourier modes are observed,
and when the model uncertainty is larger than the data uncertainty in these
modes (variance inflation), then the filter can lock on to a small
neighbourhood of the true signal, recovering from order one initial error, if
the error in the observations modes is small. Numerical examples are given to
illustrate the theory.

global type are suitable Hopf algebras F_q[G] or U_q(g) over C[q,q^{-1}]. Any
such quantization yields a structure of Poisson group on G, and one of Lie
bialgebra on g : correspondingly, one has dual Poisson groups G^* and a dual
Lie bialgebra g^*. In this context, we introduce suitable notions of quantum
subgroup and of quantum homogeneous space, in three versions: weak, proper and
strict (also called ""flat"" in the literature). The last two notions only apply
to those subgroups which are coisotropic, and those homogeneous spaces which
are Poisson quotients; the first one instead has no restrictions.
  The global quantum duality principle (GQDP) - cf. [F. Gavarini, ""The global
quantum duality principle"", J. Reine Angew. Math. 612 (2007), 17-33] -
associates with any global quantization of G, or of g, a global quantization of
g^*, or of G^*. In this paper we present a similar GQDP for quantum subgroups
or quantum homogeneous spaces. Roughly speaking, this associates with every
quantum subgroup, resp. quantum homogeneous space, of G, a quantum homogeneous
space, resp. a quantum subgroup, of G^*. The construction is tailored after
four parallel paths - according to the different ways one has to algebraically
describe a subgroup or a homogeneous space - and is ""functorial"", in a natural
sense.
  Remarkably enough, the output of the constructions are always quantizations
of proper type. More precisely, the output is related to the input as follows:
the former is the coisotropic dual of the coisotropic interior of the latter -
a fact that extends the occurrence of Poisson duality in the GQDP for quantum
groups. Finally, when the input is a strict quantization then the output is
strict too - so the special role of strict quantizations is respected.
  We end the paper with some examples and application.

high-throughput sequencing of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) in avian genomes.
We collected sequence data from UCE loci for 32 members of Neoaves and one
outgroup (chicken) and analyzed data sets that differed in their amount of
missing data. An alignment of 1,541 loci that allowed missing data was 87%
complete and resulted in a highly resolved phylogeny with broad agreement
between the Bayesian and maximum-likelihood (ML) trees. Although results from
the 100% complete matrix of 416 UCE loci were similar, the Bayesian and ML
trees differed to a greater extent in this analysis, suggesting that increasing
from 416 to 1,541 loci led to increased stability and resolution of the tree.

phenotypically divergent bird families, such as tropicbirds (Phaethontidae) and
the sunbittern (Eurypygidae) as well as between bustards (Otididae) and turacos

the non-monophyly of raptorial birds in the hawk and falcon families. Although

qubits including the Cooper-pair box and transmon, selection rules dramatically
restrict the contributions to dispersive level shifts {\chi}. By contrast,
without selection rules many virtual transitions contribute to {\chi} and can
produce sizable dispersive shifts even at large detuning. We present theory for
a generic multi-level qudit capacitively coupled to one or multiple harmonic
modes, and give general expressions for the effective Hamiltonian in second and
fourth order perturbation theory. Applying our results to the fluxonium system,
we show that the absence of strong selection rules explains the surprisingly
large dispersive shifts observed in experiments and also leads to the
prediction of a two-photon vacuum Rabi splitting. Quantitative predictions from
our theory are in good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of

models. Based on a particular choice of potential for the nonlocal
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we establish the orbital stability of a class of
parameter-dependent solutions to the nonlocal problem for certain parameter
regimes. Numerical results corroborate the analytical stability results and
lead to predictions about the stability of the class of solutions for parameter
values outside of the purview of the theory established in this paper.

restudied as a real-world example of showing discontinuous percolation
transitions (PTs). Because a larger cluster is less mobile in Brownian motion,
it comes into contact with other clusters less frequently. Thus, the formation
of a giant cluster is suppressed in the DLCA process. All clusters grow
continuously with respect to time, but the largest cluster grows drastically
with respect to the number of cluster merging events. Here, we study the
discontinuous PT occurring in the DLCA model in more general dimensions such as
two, three, and four dimensions. PTs are also studied for a generalized
velocity, which scales with cluster size $s$ as $v_{s} \propto s^{\eta}$. For
Brownian motion of hard spheres in three dimensions, the mean relative speed
scales as $s^{-1/2}$ and the collision rate $\sigma v_s$ scales as $\sim
s^{1/6}$. We find numerically that the PT type changes from discontinuous to
continuous as $\eta$ crosses over a tricritical point $\eta_{c} \approx 1.2$
(in two dimensions), $\eta_{c} \approx 0.8$ (in three dimensions), and
$\eta_{c} \approx 0.4$ (in four dimensions). We illustrate the root of this
crossover behavior from the perspective of the heterogeneity of cluster-size
distribution. Finally, we study the reaction-limited cluster aggregation (RLCA)
model in the Brownian process, in which cluster merging takes place with finite
probability $r$. We find that the PTs in two and three dimensions are
discontinuous even for small $r$ such as $r=10^{-3}$, but are continuous in
four dimensions.

complexity or both when dealing with sequences due to the use of data
structures for tabled subgoals and answers and the need to copy terms into and
from the table area. This symptom can be seen in not only B-Prolog, which uses
hash tables, but also systems that use tries such as XSB and YAP. In this
paper, we apply hash-consing to tabling structured data in B-Prolog. While
hash-consing can reduce the space consumption when sharing is effective, it
does not change the time complexity. We enhance hash-consing with two
techniques, called input sharing and hash code memoization, for reducing the
time complexity by avoiding computing hash codes for certain terms. The
improved system is able to eliminate the extra linear factor in the old system
for processing sequences, thus significantly enhancing the scalability of
applications such as language parsing and bio-sequence analysis applications.
We confirm this improvement with experimental results.

intergalactic gas in galaxy groups. We carry out a series of high-resolution,
3D simulations of AGN jets moving through an external medium with a constant
density in order to develop a general formula for the radius of curvature of
the jets, and to determine how accurately the density of the intra-group medium
(IGM) can be measured. Our simulations produce curved jets ending in bright
radio lobes with an extended trail of low surface brightness radio emission.
The radius of curvature of the jets varies with time by only about 25%. The
radio trail seen in our simulations is typically not detected in known sources,
but may be detectable in lower resolution radio observations. The length of
this tail can be used to determine the age of the AGN. We also use our
simulation data to derive a formula for the kinetic luminosity of observed jets
in terms of the radius of curvature and jet pressure. In characterizing how
well observations can measure the IGM density, we find that the limited
resolution of typical radio observations leads to a systematic under-estimate
of the density of about 50%. The unknown angles between the observer and the
direction of jet propagation and direction of AGN motion through the IGM leads
to an uncertainty of about 50% in estimates of the IGM density. Previous
conclusions drawn using these sources, indicating that galaxy groups contain
significant reservoirs of baryons in their IGM, are still valid when
considering this level of uncertainty. In addition, we model the X-ray emission
expected from bent-double radio sources. We find that known sources in
reasonably dense environments should be detectable in ~100 ks Chandra
observations. X-ray observations of these sources would place constraints on
the IGM density and AGN velocity that are complementary to radio observations.

make two important contributions. Firstly, for the single-snapshot framework,
we gain further insights into partially connected collaboration networks

of a family of topologies with regular structure. Secondly, we explore the
estimation problem by adding the dimension of time, where the goal is to
estimate a time-varying signal in a power-constrained network. To model the
time dynamics, we consider the stationary Gaussian process with exponential
covariance (sometimes referred to as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) as our
representative signal. For such a signal, we show that it is always beneficial
to sample as frequently as possible, despite the fact that the samples get
increasingly noisy due to the power-constrained nature of the problem.

electrons transferred from the dopants to picene molecules. The charge transfer
leads to a softening of Raman scattering peaks, which enables us to determine
the number of transferred electrons. From this we have identified that three
electrons are transferred to each picene molecule in the superconducting
doped-picene solids. Second, we report the pressure dependence of Tc in 7 and

while the 18 K phase exhibits a positive pressure-dependence which cannot be

selectively the K3picene sample exhibiting 18 K superconducting transition. The
discovery of suitable way for preparing K3picene with Tc = 18 K may facilitate

features of outcomes in social networked markets. First, a highly right-skewed,
non-Gaussian distribution of the number of times competing alternatives are
selected at a point in time. Second, there is turnover in the rankings of
popularity over time. We show here that such outcomes can arise either when
there is no alternative which exhibits inherent superiority in its attributes,
or when agents find it very difficult to discern any differences in quality
amongst the alternatives which are available so that it is as if no superiority

rank-size distribution of choices at a point in time, and on the life spans of
the most popular choices. We show that a key influence on outcomes is the
extent to which the network follows a hierarchical structure. It is the social
network properties of the markets, the meso-level structure, which determine

two-dimensional density and velocity profiles of the eccentric gas disk
exterior to the gap opened up by the embedded planet in the quasi-steady state.
We then apply the secular perturbation theory and incorporate the gas drag to
estimate the dust velocity and density on the secular timescale. The
dust-to-gas ratio of the unperturbed disk is simply assumed to be 0.01. In our
fiducial disk model with the planet at 5 AU, we find that 0.01 cm- to 1 m-sized
dust particles are well coupled to the gas. Consequently, the particles behave
similarly to the gas and exhibit asymmetric dynamics as a result of eccentric
orbits. The dust surface density is enhanced around the apocenter of the disk.
However, for the case of a low-density gaseous disk (termed ""transition disk""
henceforth in this work) harboring the planet at 100 AU, the azimuthal
distributions of dust of various sizes can deviate significantly. Overall, the
asymmetric structure exhibits a phase correlation between the gas velocity
fields and dust density distribution. Therefore, our study potentially provides
a reality check as to whether an asymmetric disk gap detected at sub-millimeter

on nonmonotonic logic programs and efficient solvers. To enable access to
external information, HEX-programs extend programs with external atoms, which
allow for a bidirectional communication between the logic program and external
sources of computation (e.g., description logic reasoners and Web resources).
Current solvers evaluate HEX-programs by a translation to ASP itself, in which
values of external atoms are guessed and verified after the ordinary answer set
computation. This elegant approach does not scale with the number of external
accesses in general, in particular in presence of nondeterminism (which is
instrumental for ASP). In this paper, we present a novel, native algorithm for
evaluating HEX-programs which uses learning techniques. In particular, we
extend conflict-driven ASP solving techniques, which prevent the solver from
running into the same conflict again, from ordinary to HEX-programs. We show
how to gain additional knowledge from external source evaluations and how to
use it in a conflict-driven algorithm. We first target the uninformed case,
i.e., when we have no extra information on external sources, and then extend
our approach to the case where additional meta-information is available.
Experiments show that learning from external sources can significantly decrease
both the runtime and the number of considered candidate compatible sets.

methods, this results from a modification to the underlying propagator, and
does not require explicit orthogonalization, analytic continuation, transient

Large-Scale Structure, and obtain an approximate expression for the matter
power spectrum in full order of the expansion. This method allows us to expand
any random function in terms of an orthonormal bases in space of random
functions in such a way that the first order of the expansion expresses the
Gaussian distribution, and others are the deviation from the Gaussianity. It is
proved that the Wiener Hermite expansion is mathematically equivalent with the
$\Gamma$-expansion approach in the Renormalized Perturbation Theory (RPT).
While an exponential behavior in the high-$k$ limit has been proved for the
mass density and velocity fluctuations of Dark Matter in the RPT, we reprove
the behavior in the context of the Wiener Hermite expansion using the result of
Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT). We propose a new approximate expression for
the matter power spectrum which interpolates the low-$k$ expression
corresponding to 1-loop level in SPT and the high-$k$ expression obtained by
taking a high-$k$ limit of the WH expansion. The validity of our prescription
is specifically verified by comparing with the 2-loop solutions of the SPT. The
proposed power spectrum agrees with the result of $N$-body simulation with the
accuracy better than 1% or 2% in a range of the BAO scales, where the wave
number is about $k= 0.2 \sim 0.4$ $h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ at $z=0.5-3.0$. This
accuracy is comparable to or slightly less than the ones in the Closure Theory

double integrals are involved in our solution.

develop a theoretical framework that relates the time-dependent quantum
dynamics of electrons to the frequency-dependent conductivity. The electron
mobility is then calculated through a relaxation time approximation that
accounts for quantum localization corrections beyond Boltzmann theory, and
allows us to efficiently address the interplay between highly conducting states
in the band range and localized states induced by disorder in the band tails.
The emergence of a ""transient localization"" phenomenon is shown to be a general
feature of organic semiconductors, that is compatible with the bandlike
temperature dependence of the mobility observed in pure compounds. Carrier
trapping by extrinsic disorder causes a crossover to a thermally activated
behavior at low temperature, which is progressively suppressed upon increasing
the carrier concentration, as is commonly observed in organic field-effect
transistors. Our results establish a direct connection between the localization
of the electronic states and their conductive properties, formalizing
phenomenological considerations that are commonly used in the literature.

fractionation between materials carrying boron incorporated in trigonally and
tetrahedrally coordinated sites, but the mechanisms responsible for producing
the observed isotopic signatures are poorly known. In order to understand the
boron isotope fractionation processes and to obtain a better interpretation of
the experimental data and isotopic signatures observed in natural samples, we
use first principles calculations based on density functional theory in
conjunction with ab initio molecular dynamics and a new pseudofrequency
analysis method to investigate the B isotope fractionation between B-bearing
minerals (such as tourmaline and micas) and aqueous fluids containing H_3BO_3
and H_4BO_4- species. We confirm the experimental finding that the isotope
fractionation is mainly driven by the coordination of the fractionating boron
atoms and have found in addition that the strength of the produced isotopic
signature is strongly correlated with the B-O bond length. We also demonstrate
the ability of our computational scheme to predict the isotopic signatures of
fluids at extreme pressures by showing the consistency of computed
pressure-dependent beta factors with the measured pressure shifts of the B-O
vibrational frequencies of H_3BO_3 and H_4BO_4- in aqueous fluid. The
comparison of the predicted with measured fractionation factors between
boromuscovite and neutral fluid confirms the existence of the admixture of
tetrahedral boron species in neutral fluid at high P and T found
experimentally, which also explains the inconsistency between the various
measurements on the tourmaline-mica system reported in the literature. Our

with a mass of ~2.5 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 1.486 d, recently
discovered by the Kepler space telescope. This star is highly interesting as a
young solar analogue. Aims. We used about 500 days of high-precision,
high-duty-cycle optical photometry collected by Kepler to study the rotation of
the star and the evolution of its photospheric active regions. Methods. We
applied a maximum-entropy light curve inversion technique to model the flux
rotational modulation induced by active regions that consist of dark spots and
bright solar-like faculae with a fixed area ratio. Their configuration was
varied after a fixed time interval to take their evolution into account. Active
regions were used as tracers to study stellar differential rotation, and
planetary occultations were used to constrain the latitude of some spots.
Results. Our modelling approach reproduces the light variations of Kepler-17
with a standard deviation of the residuals comparable with the precision of
Kepler photometry. We find several active longitudes where individual active
regions appear, evolve, and decay with lifetimes comparable to those observed
in the Sun, although the star has a spotted area ~10-15 times larger than the
Sun at the maximum of the 11-yr cycle. Kepler-17 shows a solar-like latitudinal
differential rotation, but the fast spot evolution prevents a precise
determination of its amplitude. Moveover, the star shows a cyclic variation of
the starspot area with a period of 47.1 \pm 4.5 d, particularly evident during
the last 200 days of the observations, similar to the solar Rieger cycles.
Possible effects of the close-in massive planet on stellar photospheric
activity cannot be excluded, but require a long-term monitoring to be
unambiguously detected.

thetanulls of cyclic curves. For non hyperelliptic curves, we write the
equations in terms of thetanulls.
  Fast genus 2 curve arithmetic in the Jacobian of the curve is used in
cryptography and is based on inverting the moduli map for genus 2 curves and on
some other relations on theta functions. We determine similar formulas and
relations for genus 3 hyperelliptic curves and offer an algorithm for how this
can be done for higher genus curves. It is still to be determined whether our
formulas for $g=3$ can be used in cryptographic applications as in $g=2.$

broad continuum in the power spectral density (PSD) with a power-law range of
scaling often identified as an inertial range of magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence. However, both turbulence and discontinuities are present in the
solar wind on these inertial range of scales. We identify and remove these
discontinuities using a method which for the first time does not impose a
characteristic scale on the resultant time-series. The PSD of vector field
fluctuations obtained from at-a point observations is a tensor that can in
principle be anisotropic with scaling exponents that depend on background field
and flow direction. This provides a key test of theories of turbulence. We find
that the removal of discontinuities from the observed time-series can
significantly alter the PSD trace anisotropy. It becomes quasi-isotropic, in
that the observed exponent does not vary with the background field angle once
the discontinuities are removed. This is consistent with the predictions of the
Iroshnikov-Kraichnan model of turbulence. As a consistency check we construct a
surrogate time-series from the observations that is composed solely of
discontinuities. The surrogate provides an estimate of the PSD due solely to
discontinuities and this provides the effective noise-floor produced by
discontinuities for all scales greater than a few ion-cyclotron scales.

Once, Takahashi et al. developed a method for the investigation on the depth
intensity relation of high energy muons in which all the stochastic processes
concerned are taken into account exactly (1983). Now, we make the method by
Takahashi et al. revival for the same purpose of the application to the

to the introduction to the fundamental of our method and some subsequent
results thereby in which the real simulated behaviors of high energy muons from
$10^{12}$eV to $10^{18}$eV, the survival probabilities of high energy and so on
are included. The discussion around the practical application of our method to

probability of high energy muons is concerned, our method gives nearly the same
results to Lipari and Stanev's in some regions and gives the deviated results

dynamics, i.e., an emerging pattern whose typical length scale $L$ increases
with time. The so-called coarsening exponent $n$ characterizes the time
dependence of the scale of the pattern, $L(t)\approx t^n$, and coarsening
dynamics can be described by a diffusion equation for the phase of the pattern.
By means of a multiscale analysis we are able to find the analytical expression
of such diffusion equations. Here, we propose a recipe to implement numerically
the determination of $D(\lambda)$, the phase diffusion coefficient, as a
function of the wavelength $\lambda$ of the base steady state $u_0(x)$. $D$
carries all information about coarsening dynamics and, through the relation
$|D(L)| \simeq L^2 /t$, it allows us to determine the coarsening exponent. The
main conceptual message is that the coarsening exponent is determined without
solving a time-dependent equation, but only by inspecting the periodic
steady-state solutions. This provides a much faster strategy than a forward
time-dependent calculation. We discuss our method for several different PDEs,

approaching zero smoothly: the SV potential introduced by Salamon and Vertse

so that the potentials may be similar to the CWS shape. The range of the SV and
SS potentials scales with the cube root of the mass number of the core like the
nuclear radius itself. For light nuclei a single term of the SV potential (with
a single parameter) is enough for a good description of the neutron-nucleus
interaction. The trajectories are compared with a bench-mark for which the
starting points (belonging to potential depth zero) can be determined
independently. Even the CWS potential is found to conform to this bench-mark if

properties in associating polymer solutions is studied using self-consistent
field lattice model. Only two inhomogeneous morphologies, i.e.,
microfluctuation homogenous (MFH) and micelle morphologies, are observed. If
the system is cooled, the solvent content within the aggregates decreases. When
the spacing of stickers along the backbone is increased the
temperature-dependent range of aggregation in MFH morphology and half-width of
specific heat peak for homogenous solutions-MFH transition increase, and the
symmetry of the peak decreases. However, with increasing spacing of stickers,
the above three corresponding quantities related to micelles behave
differently. It is demonstrated that the broad nature of the observed
transitions can be ascribed to the structural changes which accompany the
replacement of solvents in aggregates by polymer, which is consistent with the
experimental conclusion. It is found that different effect of spacing of
stickers on the two transitions can be interpreted in terms of intrachain and
interchain associations.

including the effect of both the magnetic field gradient and the perpendicular

disk-magnetosphere boundary for the first time. Diamagnetic current modified
MRI produces a non-propagating mode which may lift the plasma from the disk
towards the vertical magnetic field lines. Our model also shows that the
diamagnetic effects play an important role in triggering the MRI. The
instability becomes more powerful with the inclusion of the gradient in the

is physically comprehensible - i.e. such that there is some as-yet undiscovered
true physical theory of everything that is unified. This is an empirically
untestable thesis and thus lies beyond the scope of science. However, this
argument presupposes a conception of science which holds that in science
theories are accepted solely on the basis of evidence. But this conception of
science is untenable. Any fundamental physical theory, in order to be accepted
as a part of theoretical scientific knowledge, must be (1) sufficiently
empirically successful, and (2) sufficiently unified. Given any accepted theory
of physics, endlessly many empirically more successful disunified rivals can
always be concocted - disunified because they assert that different dynamical
laws govern the diverse phenomena to which the theory applies. These disunified
rivals are not considered for a moment in physics, despite their greater
empirical success. This persistent rejection of empirically more successful but
disunified rival theories means, I argue, that a big, highly problematic,
implicit assumption is made by science about the cosmos, to the effect, at
least, that the cosmos is such that all seriously disunified theories are
false. Once this point is recognized, it becomes clear, I argue, that we need a
new conception of science which holds that science makes a hierarchy of
assumptions about the cosmos, these assumptions becoming less and less
substantial as one goes up the hierarchy. One of these assumptions is that the
cosmos is physically comprehensible. Hence the conclusion: improve our ideas
about the nature of science and it becomes apparent that science has
established that the cosmos is physically comprehensible.

remaining particles are on shell. These currents are gauge-dependent and can be
used as ingredients in the unitarity-based approach to computing one-loop

the so-called boundary behavior of the currents as the momentum shift parameter
goes to infinity. With off-shell currents, a new potential problem arises,
namely unphysical poles that depend on the choice of gauge. We identify
conditions under which boundary terms are absent and unphysical poles are
avoided, so that there is a natural recursion relation. In particular, we are
able to choose a gauge in which we construct a valid shift for currents with at
least n - 3 gluons of the same helicity. We derive an analytic formula in the
case where all gluons have the same helicity. As by-products, we prove the
vanishing boundary behavior of general off-shell objects in Feynman gauge, and

distributions through Bayes' rule, imposing posterior regularization is
arguably more direct and in some cases more natural and general. In this paper,
we present regularized Bayesian inference (RegBayes), a novel computational
framework that performs posterior inference with a regularization term on the
desired post-data posterior distribution under an information theoretical
formulation. RegBayes is more flexible than the procedure that elicits expert
knowledge via priors, and it covers both directed Bayesian networks and
undirected Markov networks whose Bayesian formulation results in hybrid chain
graph models. When the regularization is induced from a linear operator on the
posterior distributions, such as the expectation operator, we present a general
convex-analysis theorem to characterize the solution of RegBayes. Furthermore,
we present two concrete examples of RegBayes, infinite latent support vector
machines (iLSVM) and multi-task infinite latent support vector machines

nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features for

representative signal of the global magnetic diurnal variation based on a
spatial distribution in both longitude and latitude of a set of magnetic
stations as well as their magnetic behavior on a time basis. For that, we apply
the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique implemented using gapped
wavelet transform and wavelet correlation. The continuous gapped wavelet and
the wavelet correlation techniques were used to describe the features of the
magnetic variations at Vassouras (Brazil) and other 12 magnetic stations spread
around the terrestrial globe. The aim of this paper is to reconstruct the
original geomagnetic data series of the H-component taking into account only
the diurnal variations with periods of 24 hours on geomagnetically quiet days.
With the developed work, we advance a proposal to reconstruct the baseline for
the quiet day variations (Sq) from the PCA using the correlation wavelet method
to determine the global variation of PCA first mode. The results showed that
this goal was reached and encourage other uses of this approach to different
kinds of analysis.

receiver. The basic idea is to employ an ephemeral cryptographic key to force
the eavesdropper to conduct two operations, at least one of which is
non-linear, in a different order than the desired recipient. Since non-linear
operations are not necessarily commutative, the desired advantage can be
obtained and information-theoretic secrecy achieved even if the eavesdropper is
given the cryptographic key immediately upon transmission completion. In
essence, the lack of knowledge of the key during the short transmission time
inhibits the recording of the signal in such a way that the secret information
can never be extracted from it. The achievable secrecy rates for different
countermeasures that the eavesdropper might employ are evaluated. It is shown
that even in the case of an eavesdropper with uniformly better conditions
(channel and receiver quality) than the intended recipient, a positive secure
rate can be achieved.

  hidden Markov models",,,,,"cs.AI math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an efficient exact algorithm for estimating state sequences from
outputs (or observations) in imprecise hidden Markov models (iHMM), where both
the uncertainty linking one state to the next, and that linking a state to its
output, are represented using coherent lower previsions. The notion of
independence we associate with the credal network representing the iHMM is that
of epistemic irrelevance. We consider as best estimates for state sequences the
(Walley--Sen) maximal sequences for the posterior joint state model conditioned
on the observed output sequence, associated with a gain function that is the
indicator of the state sequence. This corresponds to (and generalises) finding
the state sequence with the highest posterior probability in HMMs with precise
transition and output probabilities (pHMMs). We argue that the computational
complexity is at worst quadratic in the length of the Markov chain, cubic in
the number of states, and essentially linear in the number of maximal state
sequences. For binary iHMMs, we investigate experimentally how the number of
maximal state sequences depends on the model parameters. We also present a
simple toy application in optical character recognition, demonstrating that our
algorithm can be used to robustify the inferences made by precise probability
models.

different inverse coupling parameters are used, $\beta_H=4/g_{H}^2$ for
plaquettes which are purely spacelike, and $\beta_V$ for those which involve
the Euclidean timelike direction. It is shown that when $\beta_H = \infty$ the
partition function becomes, in the Coulomb Gauge, exactly that of a set of
non-interacting 3-d O(4) classical Heisenberg models. Long range order at low
temperatures (weak coupling) has been rigorously proven for this model. It is
shown that the correlation function demonstrating spontaneous magnetization in
the ferromagnetic phase is a continuous function of $g_H$ at $g_H =0$ and
therefore that the spontaneously broken phase enters the ($\beta_H$, $\beta_V$)
phase plane (no step discontinuity at the edge). Once the phase transition line
has entered, it can only exit at another identified edge, which requires the
SU(2) gauge theory within also to have a phase transition at finite $\beta$. A
phase exhibiting spontaneous breaking of the remnant symmetry left after
Coulomb gauge fixing, the relevant symmetry here, is non-confining. Easy
extension to the SU(N) case implies that the continuum limit of
zero-temperature 4-d SU(N) lattice gauge theories is not confining, in other
words gluons by themselves do not produce a confinement.

risk measures, this paper establishes a complete random convex analysis over
random locally convex modules by simultaneously considering the two kinds of
topologies (namely the $(\varepsilon,\lambda)$--topology and the locally
$L^0$-- convex topology). Then, we make use of the advantage of the
$(\varepsilon,\lambda)$--topology and grasp the local property of $L^0$--convex
conditional risk measures to prove that every $L^{0}$--convex
$L^{p}$--conditional risk measure ($1\leq p\leq+\infty$) can be uniquely
extended to an $L^{0}$--convex $L^{p}_{\mathcal{F}}(\mathcal{E})$--conditional
risk measure and that the dual representation theorem of the former can also be
regarded as a special case of that of the latter, which shows that the study of
$L^p$--conditional risk measures can be incorporated into that of
$L^{p}_{\mathcal{F}}(\mathcal{E})$--conditional risk measures. In particular,
in the process we find that combining the countable concatenation hull of a set
and the local property of conditional risk measures is a very useful analytic
skill that may considerably simplify and improve the study of $L^{0}$--convex
conditional risk measures.

was {\it Secular Evolution of Galaxies} I mostly concentrate on nearby
galaxies, which are best suited to study this theme. Of course, the
understanding of stellar populations is intimately connected to understanding
the formation and evolution of galaxies, one of the great outstanding problems
of astronomy. We are currently in a situation where very large observational
advances have been made in recent years. Galaxies have been detected up to a
redshift of 10. A huge effort has to be made so that stellar population theory
can catch up with observations. Since most galaxies are far away, information
about them has to come from stellar population synthesis of integrated light.
Here I will discuss how stellar evolution theory, together with observations in
our Milky Way and Local Group, are used as building blocks to analyze these
integrated stellar populations.
