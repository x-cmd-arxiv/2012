This work aims to provide a model for calculating these high energy scattering

photometric redshifts of these galaxies, the angular correlation function
remains the first diagnostics to establish the clustering properties of the

both hemispheres extending up to $\sim 40$ degrees, without any significant
fluctuations at larger scales. The observed correlation function is well fitted
by a power law function. The notable differences between a northern and

photometry problems and point out to a necessity of performing a better
calibration in the data from southern hemisphere.

core-collapse supernovae or neutron star mergers, neutrino-induced reactions
with nuclei contribute to the nucleosynthesis processes. A number of
terrestrial neutrino detectors are based on inelastic neutrino-nucleus
scattering and modeling of the respective cross sections allow predictions of
the expected detector reaction rates.
  Purpose: To provide a self-consistent microscopic description of
neutrino-nucleus cross sections involving a large pool of Z = 8 - 82 nuclei for
the implementation in models of nucleosynthesis and neutrino detector
simulations.
  Methods: Self-consistent theory framework based on relativistic nuclear
energy density functional is employed to determine the nuclear structure of the
initial state and relevant transitions to excited states induced by neutrinos.
The weak neutrino-nucleus interaction is employed in the current-current form
and a complete set of transition operators is taken into account.
  Results: We perform large-scale calculations of charged-current
neutrino-nucleus cross sections, including those averaged over supernova
neutrino fluxes, for the set of even-even target nuclei from oxygen toward lead
(Z = 8 - 82), spanning N = 8 - 182 (OPb pool). The model calculations include
allowed and forbidden transitions up to J = 5 multipoles.
  Conclusions: The present analysis shows that the self-consistent calculations
result in considerable differences in comparison to previously reported cross
sections, and for a large number of target nuclei the cross sections are
enhanced. Revision in modeling r-process nucleosynthesis based on a
self-consistent description of neutrino-induced reactions would allow an
updated insight into the origin of elements in the Universe and it would
provide the estimate of uncertainties in the calculated element abundance
patterns.

ray-tracing method. We propose a new method to calculate the emergent
Comptonized spectra from the coronae. The spectra of the disk-corona systems
with a modified $\alpha$-magnetic stress show that both the hard X-ray spectral
index and the hard X-ray bolometric correction factor $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm
X,2-10keV}$ increase with the dimensionless mass accretion rate, which are
qualitatively consistent with the observations of active galactic nuclei
(AGNs). The fraction of the power dissipated in the corona decreases with
increasing black hole spin parameter $a$, which leads to lower electron
temperatures of the coronas for rapidly spinning black holes. The X-ray
emission from the coronas surrounding rapidly spinning black holes becomes weak
and soft. The ratio of the X-ray luminosity to the optical/UV luminosity
increases with the viewing angle, while the spectral shape in the X-ray band is
insensitive with the viewing angle. We find that the spectral index in the
infrared waveband depends on the mass accretion rate and the black hole spin
$a$, which deviates from $f_\nu\propto\nu^{1/3}$ expected by the standard thin

integral with a new relativistic measure instead of the Gaussian one

PIMC method is able to reproduce the lattice QCD equation of state at zero
baryon chemical potential at realistic model parameters (i.e. quasiparticle
masses and coupling constant) and also yields valuable insight into the
internal structure of the QGP. Our results indicate that the QGP reveals
quantum liquid-like (rather than gas-like) properties up to the highest
considered temperature of 525 MeV. The pair distribution functions clearly
reflect the existence of gluon-gluon bound states, i.e. glueballs, at
temperatures just above the phase transition, while meson-like $q\bar{q}$ bound
states are not found. The calculated self-diffusion coefficient agrees well
with some estimates of the heavy-quark diffusion constant available from recent
lattice data and also with an analysis of heavy-quark quenching in experiments

estimates. The lattice and heavy-quark-quenching results on the heavy-quark

distance to multi-labeled trees (mul-trees), i.e., gene trees in which multiple
leaves can have the same label. Unlike most previous phylogenetic methods using
gene trees, this method does not assume that gene tree incongruence is caused
by a single, specific biological process, such as gene duplication and loss,
deep coalescence, or lateral gene transfer. We prove that it is NP-hard to
compute the RF distance between two mul-trees, but it is easy to calculate the
generalized RF distance between a mul-tree and a singly-labeled tree. Motivated
by this observation, we formulate the RF supertree problem for mul-trees
(MulRF), which takes a collection of mul-trees and constructs a species tree
that minimizes the total RF distance from the input mul-trees. We present a
fast heuristic algorithm for the MulRF supertree problem. Simulation
experiments demonstrate that the MulRF method produces more accurate species
trees than gene tree parsimony methods when incongruence is caused by gene tree
error, duplications and losses, and/or lateral gene transfer. Furthermore, the
MulRF heuristic runs quickly on data sets containing hundreds of trees with up
to a hundred taxa.

antiferromagnetic order. It is found that there are one acoustic branch
(gapless Goldstone mode) and two gapful optical branches of spin wave
excitations with each in double degeneracy. By examining the non-imaginary
excitation frequency condition, we can determine the corresponding phase
boundary. The exchange couplings between Fe moments in AFe$_{1.5}$Se$_2$ are
derived based on the first-principles total energy calculations. The Fe spin is
found to be $S=3/2$ through computing the antiferromagnetic quantum
fluctuation. And it is further found that a very small spin-orientation
anisotropy can remarkably suppress the antiferromagnetic quantum fluctuation.
The spin dynamical structure factors are calculated and discussed in
association with neutron inelastic scattering experiment.

work of Cartan is superseded by the use of the canonical Spencer sequence while
the work of Vessiot is superseded by the use of the canonical Janet sequence

such a result leads to deep contradictions. Accordingly, the results thus

interest as a flexible and efficient optimization tool for imaging inverse
problems, namely deconvolution and reconstruction under non-smooth convex
regularization. ADMM achieves state-of-the-art speed by adopting a divide and
conquer strategy, wherein a hard problem is split into simpler, efficiently
solvable sub-problems (e.g., using fast Fourier or wavelet transforms, or
simple proximity operators). In deconvolution, one of these sub-problems
involves a matrix inversion (i.e., solving a linear system), which can be done
efficiently (in the discrete Fourier domain) if the observation operator is
circulant, i.e., under periodic boundary conditions. This paper extends
ADMM-based image deconvolution to the more realistic scenario of unknown
boundary, where the observation operator is modeled as the composition of a
convolution (with arbitrary boundary conditions) with a spatial mask that keeps
only pixels that do not depend on the unknown boundary. The proposed approach
also handles, at no extra cost, problems that combine the recovery of missing
pixels (i.e., inpainting) with deconvolution. We show that the resulting
algorithms inherit the convergence guarantees of ADMM and illustrate its
performance on non-periodic deblurring (with and without inpainting of interior
pixels) under total-variation and frame-based regularization.

0.1<z<1.2 identified from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey
fields. Spectra of these systems were obtained using spectrometers on the 6.5m
Magellan and 5m Hale telescopes. These data allow us to constrain the rate of
dry mergers at intermediate redshifts and to test the `hot halo' model for
quenching of star formation. Using virial radii estimated from the correlation
between dynamical and stellar masses published by Leauthaud et al. (2011), we
find that around 1/5 of our candidate pairs are likely to share a common dark
matter halo (our metric for close physical association). These pairs are
divided into red-red, blue-red and blue-blue systems using the rest-frame
colors classification method introduced in Chou et al. (2011). Galaxies
classified as red in our sample have very low star-formation rates, but they
need not be totally quiescent, and hence we refer to them as `damp', rather
than `dry', systems. After correcting for known selection effects, the fraction
of blue-blue pairs is significantly greater than that of red-red and blue-red
pairs. Red-red pairs are almost entirely absent from our sample, suggesting
that damp mergers are rare at z~0.5. Our data supports models with a short
merging timescale (<0.5 Gyr) in which star-formation is enhanced in the early
phase of mergers, but quenched in the late phase. Hot halo models may explain
this behaviour, but only if virial shocks that heat gas are inefficient until
major mergers are nearly complete.

early 1900s. Theory states that as land tides swept by the moon cross fault
lines, stress in the Earth's plates intensifies, increasing the likelihood of
small earthquakes. This paper studied the association of the moon and sun with
larger magnitude earthquakes (magnitude 5 and greater) using a worldwide
dataset from the USGS.
  Initially, the positions of the moon and sun were considered separately. The
moon showed a reduction of 1.74% (95% confidence) in earthquakes when it was 10
hours behind a longitude on earth and a 1.62% increase when it was 6 hours
behind. The sun revealed even weaker associations (<1%). Binning the data in 6
hours quadrants (matching natural tide cycles) reduced the associations
further.
  However, combinations of moon-sun positions displayed significant
associations. Cycling the moon and sun in all possible quadrant permutations
showed a decrease in earthquakes when they were paired together on the East and
West horizons of an earthquake longitude (4.57% and 2.31% reductions). When the
moon and sun were on opposite sides of a longitude, there was often a small
(about 1%) increase in earthquakes.
  Reducing the bin size from 6 hours to 1 hour produced noisy results. By
examining the outliers in the data, a pattern emerged that was independent of
earthquake longitude. The results showed a significant decrease (3.33% less
than expected) in earthquakes when the sun was located near the moon. There was
an increase (2.23%) when the moon and sun were on opposite sides of the Earth.
  The association with earthquakes independent of terrestrial longitude
suggests that the combined moon-sun tidal forces act deep below the Earth's
crust where circumferential forces are weaker.

statistical errors on the shear field to unprecedented levels. In contrast,
systematic errors like those induced by the convolution with the point spread
function (PSF) will not benefit from that scaling effect and will require very
accurate modeling and correction. While numerous methods have been devised to
carry out the PSF correction itself, modeling of the PSF shape and its spatial
variations across the instrument field of view has, so far, attracted much less
attention. This step is nevertheless crucial because the PSF is only known at
star positions while the correction has to be performed at any position on the
sky. A reliable interpolation scheme is therefore mandatory and a popular
approach has been to use low-order bivariate polynomials. In the present paper,
we evaluate four other classical spatial interpolation methods based on splines
(B-splines), inverse distance weighting (IDW), radial basis functions (RBF) and
ordinary Kriging (OK). These methods are tested on the Star-challenge part of
the GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing 2010 (GREAT10) simulated data and
are compared with the classical polynomial fitting (Polyfit). We also test all
our interpolation methods independently of the way the PSF is modeled, by
interpolating the GREAT10 star fields themselves (i.e., the PSF parameters are
known exactly at star positions). We find in that case RBF to be the clear
winner, closely followed by the other local methods, IDW and OK. The global
methods, Polyfit and B-splines, are largely behind, especially in fields with
(ground-based) turbulent PSFs. In fields with non-turbulent PSFs, all
interpolators reach a variance on PSF systematics $\sigma_{sys}^2$ better than
the $1\times10^{-7}$ upper bound expected by future space-based surveys, with
the local interpolators performing better than the global ones.

H$\alpha$ line profiles caused by the presence of a wind-wind collision (WWC)
cavity created by the companion star. Using two-dimensional radiative transfer
models, we find that the wind cavity can qualitatively explain the observed
line profiles around apastron. Regions of the Homunculus which scatter light
that propagated through the WWC cavity show weaker or no H alpha absorption.
Regions scattering light that propagated through a significant portion of the
primary wind show stronger P Cygni absorption. Our models overestimate the H
alpha absorption formed in the primary wind, which we attribute to
photoionization by the companion, not presently included in the models. We can
qualitatively explain the latitudinal changes that occur during periastron,
shedding light on the nature of Eta Car's spectroscopic events. Our models
support the idea that during the brief period of time around periastron when
the primary wind flows unimpeded toward the observer, H alpha absorption occurs
in directions toward the central object and Homunculus SE pole, but not toward
equatorial regions close to the Weigelt blobs. We suggest that observed
latitudinal and azimuthal variations are dominated by the companion star via

rise to the observed excess radio spectrum through synchrotron emission.
However, constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, on

Hawaii. This optical/near-infrared multi-fiber spectrograph targets cosmology
with galaxy surveys, Galactic archaeology, and studies of galaxy/AGN evolution.
Taking advantage of Subaru's wide field of view, which is further extended with
the recently completed Wide Field Corrector, PFS will enable us to carry out
multi-fiber spectroscopy of 2400 targets within 1.3 degree diameter. A
microlens is attached at each fiber entrance for F-ratio transformation into a
larger one so that difficulties of spectrograph design are eased. Fibers are
accurately placed onto target positions by positioners, each of which consists
of two stages of piezo-electric rotary motors, through iterations by using
back-illuminated fiber position measurements with a wide-field metrology
camera. Fibers then carry light to a set of four identical fast-Schmidt
spectrographs with three color arms each: the wavelength ranges from 0.38
{\mu}m to 1.3 {\mu}m will be simultaneously observed with an average resolving
power of 3000. Before and during the era of extremely large telescopes, PFS
will provide the unique capability of obtaining spectra of 2400
cosmological/astrophysical targets simultaneously with an 8-10 meter class

to bear an interior composition consisting of Fe, silicates, and an envelope
(>= 10% by mass) of super-critical water. We report that the mass and radius of

C, SiC, and/or silicates and without a volatile envelope. While the data allow
Fe mass fractions of up to 40%, a wide range of C, SiC and/or silicate mass
fractions are possible. A carbon-rich 55 Cancri e is also plausible if its
protoplanetary disk bore the same composition as its host star, which has been
reported to be carbon-rich. However, more precise estimates of the stellar
elemental abundances and observations of the planetary atmosphere are required
to further constrain its interior composition. The possibility of a C-rich

galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the zCOSMOS-deep redshift survey
within the same redshift interval. These systems contain three to five
spectroscopic galaxies that lie within 500kpc in projected distance (in
physical space) and within 700km/s in velocity. Based on extensive analysis of
mock catalogues that have been generated from the Millennium simulation, we
examine the likely nature of these systems at the time of observation, and what
they will evolve into down to the present epoch. Although few of the ""member""
galaxies are likely to reside in the same halo at the epoch we observe them,
50% of the systems will eventually bring them all into the same halo, and
almost all (93%) will have at least part of the member galaxies in the same
halo by the present epoch. Most of the candidate groups can therefore be
described as ""proto-groups"". An estimate of the overdensities is also
consistent with the idea that these systems are being seen at the start of the
assembly process. We also examine present-day haloes and ask whether their
progenitors would have been seen amongst our candidate groups. For present-day
haloes between 10^14-10^15Msun/h, 35% should have appeared amongst our
candidate groups, and this would have risen to 70% if our survey had been
fully-sampled, so we can conclude that our sample can be taken as
representative of a large fraction of such systems. There is a clear excess of
massive galaxies above 10^10Msun around the locations of the candidate groups
in a large independent COSMOS photo-z sample, but we see no evidence in this
latter data for any colour differentiation with respect to the field. This is
however consistent with the idea that such differentiation arises in satellite
galaxies, as indicated at z<1, if the candidate groups are indeed only starting
to be assembled.

observed to be remarkably constant in the Milky Way and in the Local Group

constant remains poor. Using a combination of extremely high resolution (~ 1
pc) galaxy evolution simulations and molecular line radiative transfer
calculations, we suggest that Xco displays a narrow range of values in the
Galaxy due to the fact that molecular clouds share very similar physical
properties. In our models, this is itself a consequence of stellar feedback
competing against gravitational collapse. GMCs whose lifetimes are regulated by
radiative feedback show a narrow range of surface densities, temperatures and
velocity dispersions with values comparable to those seen in the Milky Way. As
a result, the X-factors from these clouds show reasonable correspondence with
observed data from the Local Group, and a relatively narrow range. On the other
hand, feedback-free clouds collapse to surface densities that are larger than
those seen in the Galaxy, and hence result in X-factors that are systematically
too large compared to the Milky Way's. We conclude that radiative feedback
within GMCs can generate cloud properties similar to those observed in the
Galaxy, and hence a roughly constant Milky Way X-factor in normal, quiescent
clouds.

posteriori selection effects, which combines a candidate-detection stage with a
full Bayesian model-selection and parameter-estimation analysis. We apply this

extending previous analyses by using: (1) adaptive-resolution techniques,
allowing us to probe features of arbitrary size, and (2) optimal filters, which
provide the best possible sensitivity for detecting candidate signatures. We
conclude that the WMAP 7-year data do not favor the addition of either cosmic
textures or bubble collisions to the standard cosmological model, and place
robust constraints on the predicted number of such sources. The expected

The common lore when performing a CMB based cosmological parameter estimation
is to consider that Doppler affects only the $l=1$ multipole, and neglect any
other corrections. In this paper we check the validity of this assumption in
parameter estimation for a Planck-like angular resolution, both for a full-sky
ideal experiment and also when sky cuts are included to model CMB foreground
contaminations with a sky fraction similar to the Planck satellite. Assuming a
simple fiducial cosmological model with five parameters, we simulated CMB
temperature maps of the sky and added aberration and Doppler effects to the
maps. We then analyzed with a MCMC in a Bayesian framework the maps with and
without aberration and Doppler effects in order to assess the ability of
reconstructing the parameters of the fiducial model. Although the correction on
the power spectrum ${C_\ell}$ is larger than the cosmic variance at $\ell>1000$

multi-band imaging survey of five 4 sq. degree fields with two National Optical
Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) 4-meter telescopes at Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo.
For both telescopes, the change of the point-spread-function (PSF) shape across
the focal plane is complicated, and the exposure-to-exposure variation of this
position-dependent PSF change is significant. We overcome this challenge by
modeling the PSF separately for individual exposures and CCDs with principal
component analysis (PCA). We find that stacking these PSFs reproduces the final
PSF pattern on the mosaic image with high fidelity, and the method successfully
separates PSF-induced systematics from gravitational lensing effects. We
calibrate our shears and estimate the errors, utilizing an image simulator,
which generates sheared ground-based galaxy images from deep Hubble Space
Telescope archival data with a realistic atmospheric turbulence model. For
cosmological parameter constraints, we marginalize over shear calibration
error, photometric redshift uncertainty, and the Hubble constant. We use
cosmology-dependent covariances for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis and
find that the role of this varying covariance is critical in our parameter
estimation. Our current non-tomographic analysis alone constrains the
Omega_M-sigma_8 likelihood contour tightly, providing a joint constraint of
Omega_M=0.262+-0.051 and sigma_8=0.868+-0.071. We expect that a future DLS
weak-lensing tomographic study will further tighten these constraints because
explicit treatment of the redshift dependence of cosmic shear more efficiently
breaks the Omega_M-sigma_8 degeneracy. Combining the current results with the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7-year (WMAP7) likelihood data, we obtain
Omega_M=0.278+-0.018 and sigma_8=0.815+-0.020.

Quiver-like Chern-Simons theories, arising from Calabi-Yau manifolds with
branes wrapped on several minimal S^3's, give a dual description of a large
class of toric Calabi-Yau. We use this to derive the refined topological string
amplitudes on a toric Calabi-Yau containing a shrinking P^2 surface. The result
is suggestive of the refined topological vertex formalism for arbitrary toric
Calabi-Yau manifolds in terms of a pair of vertices and a choice of a Morse
flow on the toric graph, determining the vertex decomposition. The dependence
on the flow is reminiscent of the approach to the refined topological string in
upcoming work of Nekrasov and Okounkov. As a byproduct, we show that large N

the refined colored HOMFLY invariants of knots.

the quantum dot and the graphene nanodisk can be switched on and off by
applying a pump laser to the photonic crystal or by adjusting the strength of

associations between two components of a multivariate time series, a topic
addressed in Runge et al. (2012), it is even more important to assess the
strength of their association in a meaningful way. In the present article we
focus on the problem of defining a meaningful coupling strength using
information theoretic measures and demonstrate the short-comings of the
well-known mutual information and transfer entropy. Instead, we propose a
certain time-delayed conditional mutual information, the momentary information
transfer (MIT), as a measure of association that is general, causal and
lag-specific, reflects a well interpretable notion of coupling strength and is
practically computable. MIT is based on the fundamental concept of source
entropy, which we utilize to yield a notion of coupling strength that is,
compared to mutual information and transfer entropy, well interpretable, in
that for many cases it solely depends on the interaction of the two components
at a certain lag. In particular, MIT is thus in many cases able to exclude the
misleading influence of autodependency within a process in an
information-theoretic way. We formalize and prove this idea analytically and
numerically for a general class of nonlinear stochastic processes and
illustrate the potential of MIT on climatological data.

1.5-4.0 kpc in F850LP and F160W images, respectively, regardless of the
observed fields. Stellar surface mass density of the sBzK galaxies is also
comparable to that of the local disk galaxies. However, the intrinsic shape of
sBzK galaxies is not a round disk as seen in the local disk galaxies. By
comparing apparent axial ratio (b/a) distributions of the sBzK galaxies with
those by assuming tri-axial model with axes A>B>C, we found their intrinsic
face-on B/A ratios peak at B/A=0.70 and B/A=0.77-0.79 in the rest-frame UV and
optical, respectively and are statistically more bar-like than that of the
local disk galaxies. The intrinsic edge-on C/A ratios in both rest-frame UV and
optical wavelengths peak at 0.26, which is slightly larger than that of the
local disk galaxies.

In a braneworld scenario, local physics on the brane can depend strongly on the
brane's location within the bulk. Generically, the relevant properties of the
bulk manifold for the physics on/of the brane are neither local nor global, but
depend on the structure of finite regions of the bulk, even for locally
homogeneous and isotropic bulk geometries. In a recent work, various mechanisms
(in a braneworld context) were considered to stabilize the location of a brane
within bulk spaces of non-trivial topology. In this work we elaborate on and
generalize that work by considering additional bulk and brane dimensionalities
as well as different boundary conditions on the bulk scalar field that provides
a Casimir force on the brane, providing further insight on this effect.
  In D=2+1 (D=5+1) we consider both local and global contributions to the
effective potential of a 1-brane (4-brane) wrapped around both the
2-dimensional hyperbolic horn and Euclidean cone, which are used as toy models
of an extra-dimensional manifold. We calculate the total energy due to brane
tension and elastic energy (extrinsic curvature) as well as that due to the
Casimir energy of a bulk scalar satisfying both Dirchlet and Neumann boundary
conditions on the brane. In some cases stable minima of the potential are found
that result from the competition of at least two of the contributions.
Generically, any one of these effects may be sufficient when the bulk space has
less symmetry than the manifolds considered here. We highlight the importance
of the Casimir effect for the purpose of brane stabilization.

star-forming galaxies in the SFR-M* plane. The far-infrared data are used to
derive dust masses, Mdust. Combined with an empirical prescription for the
dependence of the gas-to-dust ratio on metallicity (GDR), the CO luminosities
and Mdust values are used to derive for each galaxy the CO-to-H2 conversion
factor, alpha_co. Like in the local Universe, the value of alpha_co is a factor
of ~5 smaller in starbursts compared to normal star-forming galaxies (SFGs). We
also uncover a relation between alpha_co and dust temperature (Tdust; alpha_co
decreasing with increasing Tdust) as obtained from modified blackbody fits to
the far-infrared data. While the absolute normalization of the alpha_co(Tdust)
relation is uncertain, the global trend is robust against possible systematic
biases in the determination of Mdust, GDR or metallicity. Although we cannot
formally distinguish between a step and a smooth evolution of alpha_co with the
dust temperature, we can conclude that in galaxies of near-solar metallicity, a
critical value of Tdust=30K can be used to determine whether the appropriate
alpha_co is closer to the starburst value (1.0 Msun(K kms pc^2)^-1, if
Tdust>30K) or closer to the Galactic value (4.35 Msun (K kms pc^2)^-1, if
Tdust<30K). This indicator has the great advantage of being less subjective
than visual morphological classifications of mergers/SFGs, which can be
difficult at high z because of the clumpy nature of SFGs. In the absence of
far-infrared data, the offset of a galaxy from the main sequence (i.e.,
log[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFR_MS(M*,z)]) can be used to identify galaxies requiring the
use of an alpha_co conversion factor lower than the Galactic value.

(HFB) theory, we have developed a new calculational tool to find the HFB minima
of odd-A nuclei based on the gradient method and using interactions of Gogny's
form. The HFB minimization includes both time-even and time-odd fields in the
energy functional, avoiding the commonly used ""filling approximation"". Here we
apply the method to calculate neutron pairing gaps in some representative
isotope chains of spherical and deformed nuclei, namely the Z=8,50 and 82
spherical chains and the Z=62 and 92 deformed chains. We find that the gradient
method is quite robust, permitting us to carry out systematic surveys involving
many nuclei. We find that the time-odd field does not have large effect on the
pairing gaps calculated with the Gogny D1S interaction. Typically, adding the
T-odd field as a perturbation increases the pairing gap by ~100 keV, but the
re-minimization brings the gap back down. This outcome is very similar to
results reported for the Skyrme family of nuclear energy density functionals.
Comparing the calculated gaps with the experimental ones, we find that the
theoretical errors have both signs implying that the D1S interaction has a
reasonable overall strength. However, we find some systematic deficiencies
comparing spherical and deformed chains and comparing the lighter chains with
the heavier ones. The gaps for heavy spherical nuclei are too high, while those
for deformed nuclei tend to be too low. The calculated gaps of spherical nuclei
show hardly any A-dependence, contrary to the data. Inclusion of the T-odd
component of the interaction does not change these qualitative findings.

'accidental painting' technique developed by D.A. Siqueiros, a famous Mexican
muralist. We reproduced the technique that he used: pouring layers of paint of
different colors on top of each other. We found that the layers mix, creating
aesthetically pleasing patterns, as a result of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability.
Due to the pigments used to give paints their color, they can have different
densities. When poured on top of each other, if the top layer is denser than
the lower one, the viscous gravity current undergoes unstable as it spread
radially. We photograph the process and produced slowed-down video to visualize
the process.

inputs traverse along individual paths. Each path extracts different features
and is optimized for a specific sub-partition of the input space. By only
computing features for inputs that benefit from them the most, our cost
sensitive tree of classifiers can match the high accuracies of the current
state-of-the-art at a small fraction of the computational cost.

static networks. The threshold is entirely described by the dynamical
parameters defining the average number of instantaneously migrating individuals
and does not depend on the properties of the static network representation.
Remarkably, the diffusion and contagion processes are slower in time-varying
graphs than in their aggregated static counterparts, the mobility threshold
being even two orders of magnitude larger in the first case. The presented
results confirm the importance of considering the time-varying nature of
complex networks.

allowing us to confirm short-term line profile variability. Our new data show
short-term variations in the photospheric lines. On the other hand, purely
circumstellar lines (such as [O I] lines) do not show such rapid variability.
The rotational velocity of HD 50138, V_rot = 90.3 +- 4.3 km/s, and the rotation
period, P = 3.64 +- 1.16 d, were derived from the He II 4026A photospheric

line profile variability is not stellar spots, and it may be caused by
pulsations. In addition, we show that macroturbulence may affect the profiles
of photospheric lines, as is seen for B supergiants. The location of HD 50138

macroturbulence make this star a fascinating object.

resided at a distance from the Sun that exceeded the freeze-out distance of
regular comets by an order of magnitude. A Herschel Space Observatory PACS scan
was taken in mid-2010, in the already inactive state of the nucleus. The albedo
has been found to be surprisingly large (8.1$\pm$0.9%{}), which exceeds the
value known for any other comets. With re-reduction of archive HST images from
1995 and 1996, we confirm that the pre-perihelion albedo resembled that of an
ordinary comet, and was smaller by a factor of two than the post-activity
albedo. Our further observations with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) also
confirmed that the albedo increased significantly by the end of the activity.
We explain these observations by proposing gravitational redeposition of icy
grains towards the end of the activity. This is plausible for such a massive
body in a cold environment, where gas velocity is lowered to the range of the
escape velocity. These observations also show that giant comets are not just

phenomenon of dynamical localization can prevent heating beyond certain
threshold. The dynamical localization is known to occur both at classical
(Fermi-Ulam model) and at quantum levels (kicked rotor). However, it was
believed that driven ergodic systems will always heat without bound. Here, on
the contrary, we report strong evidence of dynamical localization transition in
periodically driven ergodic systems in the thermodynamic limit. This phenomenon
is reminiscent of many-body localization in energy space.

results from subsets of the exposures, the final results of the total exposures
up to 2001 are presented here. Our successive experiments have yielded the
total exposure of 8.19 m^2 sr day at the altitudes of 4.0 - 9.4 g/cm^2. The
performance of the emulsion chambers was examined by accelerator beam tests and
Monte-Carlo simulations, and the on-board calibrations were carried out by
using the flight data. In this work we present the cosmic-ray electron spectrum
in the energy range from 30 GeV to 3 TeV at the top of the atmosphere, which is
well represented by a power-law function with an index of -3.28+-0.10. The
observed data can be also interpreted in terms of diffusive propagation models.
The evidence of cosmic-ray electrons up to 3 TeV suggests the existence of
cosmic-ray electron sources at distances within ~1 kpc and times within ~1x10^5

streams that upon the reliable reception of only a fraction of the total bit
stream, the decoder is able reconstruct the source up to a basic quality.
Reliable reception of later source bits gradually improve the reconstruction
quality. Examples include scalable extensions of H.264/AVC and progressive
image coders such as JPEG2000. To provide an efficient protection for embedded
source bit streams, a concatenated block coding scheme using a minimum mean
distortion criterion was considered in the past. Although, the original design
was shown to achieve better mean distortion characteristics than previous
studies, the proposed coding structure was leading to dramatic quality
fluctuations. In this paper, a modification of the original design is first
presented and then the second order statistics of the distortion is taken into
account in the optimization. More specifically, an extension scheme is proposed
using a minimum distortion variance optimization criterion. This robust system
design is tested for an image transmission scenario. Numerical results show
that the proposed extension achieves significantly lower variance than the
original design, while showing similar mean distortion performance using both
convolutional codes and low density parity check codes.

computer vision technologies, when applied to conventional video footage, still
cannot automatically unveil accurate motions of groups of people or crowds from
the image sequences. We present a novel data collection approach for studying
crowd behavior which uses the increasingly popular low-cost sensor Microsoft
Kinect. The Kinect captures both standard camera data and a three-dimensional
depth map. Our human detection and tracking algorithm is based on agglomerative
clustering of depth data captured from an elevated view - in contrast to the
lateral view used for gesture recognition in Kinect gaming applications. Our
approach transforms local Kinect 3D data to a common world coordinate system in
order to stitch together human trajectories from multiple Kinects, which allows
for a scalable and flexible capturing area. At a testbed with real-world
pedestrian traffic we demonstrate that our approach can provide accurate
trajectories from three Kinects with a Pedestrian Detection Rate of up to 94%
and a Multiple Object Tracking Precision of 4 cm. Using a comprehensive dataset
of 2240 captured human trajectories we calibrate three variations of the Social
Force model. The results of our model validations indicate their particular

fraction. This number, when compared to the binary fraction of the presumed
parent population can give a first handle on the origin of planetary nebulae.
By detecting 27 bona fide central stars in the I band we have found that 30% of
our sample have an I band excess between one and a few sigmas, possibly
denoting companions brighter than M3-4V and with separations smaller than
approximately 1000 AU. By accounting for the undetectable companions, we
determine a de-biased binary fraction of 67-78% for all companions at all
separations. We compare this number to a main sequence binary fraction of
(50+/-4)% determined for spectral types F6V-G2V, appropriate if the progenitors
of today's PN central star population is indeed the F6V-G2V stars. The error on
our estimate could be between 10 and 30%. We conclude that the central star
binary fraction may be larger than expected from the putative parent
population. Using the more sensitive J band of a subset of 11 central stars,
the binary fraction is 54% for companions brighter than approximately M5-6V and
with separations smaller than about 900 AU. De-biassing this number we obtain a
binary fraction of 100-107%. The two numbers should be the same and the
discrepancy is likely due to small number statistics.

investigate the formation of energy gap Eg of graphene nanomesh (GNM) lattices

edge disorder of holes. We find that the sensitivity of Eg to the lattice

dependence of Eg on the neck width is fitted well with the scaling rule
observed in experiments [Liang et al., Nano Lett. 10, 2454 (2010)]. Considering
the transport characteristics of GNM-based structures, we demonstrate that the
use of finite GNM sections in the devices can efficiently improve their
electrical performance (i.e., high ON/OFF current ratio, good current
saturation and negative differential conductance behaviors). Additionally, if
the length of GNM sections is appropriately limited, the detrimental effects of

good explanation of the available experimental data on GNM energy gap and

scale. For this purpose, we studied the ac conductance of a model quantum
conductor, i.e. the quantum RC circuit. Prior to our experimental work, M.
B\""{u}ttiker, H. Thomas and A. Pr\^{e}tre first worked on dynamic mesoscopic
transport in the 1990s. They predicted that the mesoscopic RC circuit can be
described by a quantum capacitance related to the density of states in the
capacitor and a constant charge relaxation resistance value equal to half of
the resistance quantum h/2e^2, when a single mode is transmitted between the
capacitance and a reservoir. By applying a microwave excitation to a gate
located on top of a coherent submicronic quantum dot that is coupled to a
reservoir, we validate this theoretical prediction on the ac conductance of the
quantum RC circuit. Our study demonstrates that the ac conductance is directly
related to the dwell time of electrons in the capacitor. Thereby, we observed a
counterintuitive behavior of a quantum origin: as the transmission of the
single conducting mode decreases, the resistance of the quantum RC circuit
remains constant while the capacitance oscillates.

the sizable charge transfer between the surface and the nanoribbon.

reassembly of fragmented objects having one surface near to plane, on the basis
of the 3D representation of their constituent fragments. The whole process
starts by 3D scanning of the available fragments. The obtained representations
are properly processed so that they can be tested for possible matches. Next,
four novel criteria are introduced, that lead to the determination of pairs of
matching fragments. These criteria have been chosen so as the whole process
imitates the instinctive reassembling method dedicated scholars apply. The
first criterion exploits the volume of the gap between two properly placed
fragments. The second one considers the fragments' overlapping in each possible
matching position. Criteria 3,4 employ principles from calculus of variations
to obtain bounds for the area and the mean curvature of the contact surfaces
and the length of contact curves, which must hold if the two fragments match.
The method has been applied, with great success, both in the reconstruction of
objects artificially broken by the authors and, most importantly, in the
virtual reassembling of parts of wall paintings belonging to the Mycenaic
civilization (c. 1300 B.C.), excavated in a highly fragmented condition in

an electromagnetic field, the charge and current density in a pure state of the

as sources, the microscopic Maxwell equations can be written down for any given
pure state of a many-body system. By employing semi-classical radiation theory
with these sources, the microscopic Maxwell equations can be used to compute
the strong radiation fields produced by interacting charged quantal particles.
For a charged quantal particle, three radiation fields involve only the vector
potential $\mathbf{A}$. This is another example demonstrating the observability
of vector potential. Five radiation fields are perpendicular to the canonical
momentum of a single charged particle. For a group of charged particles, a new
type of radiation field is predicted to be perpendicular to

procedure which requires only a spatial coarse graining. Because the sources of

give up the temporal coarse graining of the current density which is often

find that in the Laughlin state the quasihole performs a coherent constant
rotation around the center, ensuring conservation of angular momentum. This is
distinct to any other regime with higher density, where the quasihole is found
to decay. At a characteristic time, the decay process is reversed, and revivals
of the quasihole can be observed in the density. Measuring the period and
position of the revival can be used as a spectroscopic tool to identify the
strongly correlated phases in systems with a finite number of atoms.

region (NLR) on the optical/UV continuum polarization of active galactic nuclei
(AGN). We have upgraded our previous 3-component model of a thermal Seyfert
nucleus that was composed of an equatorial, optically thin electron disc, a
circumnuclear dusty torus, and a pair of collimated, optically thin electron
winds (Marin et al.2012b). We have added a dusty extension with low optical
depth to the outflows to account for continuum scattering and absorption inside
the NLR. A spectropolarimetric comparison between our AGN models with and
without NLR reprocessing is carried out. It turns out that the NLR can alter
and even suppress the observed polarization dichotomy between type-1 and type-2
AGN. For type-2 AGN, it also significantly decreases the expected percentage of
polarization and alters its spectral shape. While the NLR makes it more
difficult to reproduce the observed polarization in type-1 objects, it helps to
explain spectropolarimetry observations of type-2 objects. Further studies
including clumpy media need to be carried out.

perturbations, but vulnerable against targeted attacks. Robustness analysis
usually simulates the removal of individual or sets of nodes, followed by the
assessment of the inflicted damage. For complex metabolic networks, it has been
suggested that evolutionary pressure may favor robustness against reaction
removal. However, the removal of a reaction and its impact on the network may
as well be interpreted as selective regulation of pathway activities,
suggesting a tradeoff between the efficiency of regulation and vulnerability.
Here, we employ a cascading failure algorithm to simulate the removal of single
and pairs of reactions from the metabolic networks of two organisms, and
estimate the significance of the results using two different null models:
degree preserving and mass-balanced randomization. Our analysis suggests that
evolutionary pressure promotes larger cascades of non-viable reactions, and
thus favors the ability of efficient metabolic regulation at the expense of

based on the master equation for the density matrix, that takes into account
the inter-band Zener transitions induced by the electric field (a quantum
mechanical effect), the electron-defect scattering and the electron-phonon
scattering. In presence of Zener tunnelling the Qm tubes support an electrical
current even when the Fermi energy lies in the forbidden band gap. In absence
of elastic scattering (in high quality samples), the small size of the band gap
of Qm tubes enables Zener tunnelling for realistic values of the the electric
field (above $\sim$ 1 V/\mu m). The presence of a strong elastic scattering (in
low quality samples) further decreases the values of the field required to
observe Zener tunnelling. Indeed, for elastic-scattering lengths of the order
of 50 nm, Zener tunnelling affects the current/voltage characteristic already
in the linear regime. In other words, in quasi-metallic tubes, Zener tunneling

patterns in two solar active regions: a flaring/eruptive, and a flare-quiet
one. We aim to determine whether active regions inject non-neutralized (net)
electric currents in the solar atmosphere, responding to a debate initiated
nearly two decades ago that remains inconclusive. We find that well-formed,
intense magnetic polarity inversion lines (PILs) within active regions are the
only photospheric magnetic structures that support significant net current.
More intense PILs seem to imply stronger non-neutralized current patterns per
polarity. This finding revises previous works that claim frequent injections of
intense non-neutralized currents by most active regions appearing in the solar
disk but also works that altogether rule out injection of non-neutralized
currents. In agreement with previous studies, we also find that magnetically
isolated active regions remain globally current-balanced. In addition, we
confirm and quantify the preference of a given magnetic polarity to follow a
given sense of electric currents, indicating a dominant sense of twist in
active regions. This coherence effect is more pronounced in more compact active
regions with stronger PILs and must be of sub-photospheric origin. Our results
yield a natural explanation of the Lorentz force, invariably generating
velocity and magnetic shear along strong PILs, thus setting a physical context
for the observed pre-eruption evolution in solar active regions.

entangled states is available. Here, we present a unifying framework that
accommodates the present experiments and theoretical protocols for the creation
of multiparticle entanglement via interference. A general representation of the
states that can be created is provided for bosons and fermions, for any
particle number, and for any dimensionality of the entangled degree of freedom.
Using the framework, we derive an upper bound on the generalized Schmidt number
of the states that can be generated, and we establish bounds on the
dimensionality of the manifold of these states. We show that - at the expense
of a smaller success probability - more states can be created with bosons than
with fermions, and give an intuitive interpretation of the state representation
and of the established bounds in terms of superimposed many-particle paths.

the FOV reduces to 25"" x 38"". The spectral coverage in the spectroscopic mode
extends from 530-860 nm with a theoretical spectral resolution R of about

which has become the textbook standard. Within this method, a concise
expression for the additional tidal potential, derived by MacDonald (1964; Rev.
Geophys. 2, 467), is combined with an assumption that the Q factor is
frequency-independent (i.e., that the geometric lag angle is constant in time).
This makes the approach unphysical because MacDonald's derivation of the said
formula was implicitly based on keeping the time lag frequency-independent,
which is equivalent to setting Q to scale as the inverse tidal frequency. The
contradiction requires the MacDonald treatment of both non-resonant and
resonant rotation to be rewritten.
  The non-resonant case was reconsidered by Efroimsky & Williams (2009; CMDA
104, 257), in application to spin modes distant from the major
commensurabilities. We continue this work by introducing the necessary
alterations into the MacDonald-torque-based model of falling into a 1:1
resonance. (For the original version of the model, see Goldreich 1966; AJ 71,
1.)
  We also study the effect of the triaxiality on both circulating and librating
rotation near the synchronous state. Circulating rotation may evolve toward the
libration region or toward a spin rate larger than synchronous
(pseudosynchronous spin). Which behaviour depends on the eccentricity, the
triaxiality of the primary, and the mass ratio of the secondary and primary
bodies. The spin evolution will always stall for the oblate case. For
small-amplitude librations, expressions are derived for the libration
frequency, damping rate, and average orientation.
  However, the stability of pseudosynchronous spin hinges upon the dissipation
model. Makarov and Efroimsky (2012; arXiv:1209.1616) have found that a more
realistic dissipation model than the corrected MacDonald torque makes
pseudosynchronous spin unstable.

fields at high temperature. The standard model of particles is investigated as
a particular example. By using both analytic methods of quantum field theory
and gauge field theory on a lattice, we determine the Abelian (chromo)magnetic
fields in the restored phase of the model at high temperatures $T \geq T_{ew}$.
The fields are stable and temperature dependent, $B = B(T)$. We investigate the
mechanisms of the field stabilization in detail. The screening parameters for
electric and magnetic fields - the Debye, $m_D(B,T),$ and magnetic,
$m_{magn.}(B,T)$, masses - are calculated. It is shown that, in the field
presence, the former one is smaller than at zero field. The magnetic mass of
the (chromo)magnetic fields is determined to be zero, as for usual $U(1)$
magnetic field. We also show that the vacuum magnetization stops at
temperatures below the electroweak phase transition temperature, $T \leq
T_{ew}$, when a scalar condensate creates. These properties make reasonable a
possibility that the intergalactic magnetic fields observed recently were
spontaneously generated in the hot Universe at the reheating epoch due to
vacuum polarization of non-Abelian gauge fields. We present a procedure for
estimating the field strengths $B(T)$ at different temperatures. In particular,
the value of $B(T_{ew}) \sim 10^{14} G$, at $T_{ew}$ is estimated with taking
into consideration the observed intergalactic magnetic field $B_0 \sim 10^{-

extend our analysis into the realm of dynamically important fields. This marks
an important step on which derived mean-field models rely to explain observed
equipartition strength fields. As in previous work, we diagnose turbulent
transport coefficients by means of the test-field method. We derive quenching
functions for the dynamo {\alpha} effect, diamagnetic pumping, and turbulent
diffusivity, which are compared with theoretical expectations. At late times,
we observe the suppression of the vertical wind. Because this potentially
affects the removal of small-scale magnetic helicity, new concerns arise about
circumventing constraints imposed by the conservation of magnetic helicity at
high magnetic Reynolds numbers. While present results cannot safely rule out
this possibility, the issue only becomes important at late stages and is absent
when the dynamo is quenched by the wind itself.

self-acceleration of our universe without use of any type of dark energy. The
virial mass discrepancy is an important problem in cosmology and it can be
explained by dark matter. This is due to our various ways in measurement of the
mass of the galaxy clusters. One of the ways we can measure the mass of a
cluster of galaxies is to measure the galaxy masses and then add them up to
obtain the cluster mass. Another way is to use the virial theorem. Almost in
all clusters the virial mass is bigger than 20-30 times from the observed mass.

models have been shown to belong to the universality class of ""structural
glasses"", with a ""random first-order transition"" (RFOT) characterized by a
discontinuous jump of the order parameter and no latent heat. However, their
behavior in finite dimensions is often drastically different, displaying either
no glassiness at all or a conventional spin-glass transition. We clarify the
physical reasons for this phenomenon and stress the unusual fragility of the
RFOT to short-range fluctuations, associated e.g. with the mere existence of a
finite number of neighbors. Accordingly, the solution of fully connected models
is only predictive in very high dimension whereas, despite being also
mean-field in character, the Bethe approximation provides valuable information
on the behavior of finite-dimensional systems. We suggest that before embarking
on a full-blown account of fluctuations on all scales through computer
simulation or renormalization-group approach, models for structural glasses
should first be tested for the effect of short-range fluctuations and we
discuss ways to do it. Our results indicate that disordered spin models do not
appear to pass the test and are therefore questionable models for investigating
the glass transition in three dimensions. This also highlights how nontrivial
is the first step of deriving an effective theory for the RFOT phenomenology
from a rigorous integration over the short-range fluctuations.

experimental setting. The concept relies on the recent results in auditory
neuroscience showing a possibility to differentiate early anterior
contralateral responses to attended spatial sources. Contemporary
stimuli-driven BCI paradigms benefit mostly from the P300 ERP latencies in so
called ""aha-response"" settings. We show the further enhancement of the
classification results in spatial auditory paradigms by incorporating the N200
latencies, which differentiate the brain responses to lateral, in relation to
the subject head, sound locations in the auditory space. The results reveal
that those early spatial auditory ERPs boost online classification results of
the BCI application. The online BCI experiments with the multi-command BCI
prototype support our research hypothesis with the higher classification
results and the improved information-transfer-rates.

bursting behavior to the low hard 'island' state. In May-June 2009, there was
an exceptionally long 51-d low state. This state was well covered by X-ray
observations and 12 bursts were detected, 9 with the high-throughput RXTE. We
investigate the character of these X-ray bursts and find an interesting change
in their photospheric expansion behavior. At the lowest inferred mass accretion
rates, this expansion becomes very large in 4 bursts and reaches the so-called
superexpansion regime. We speculate that this is due to the geometry of the
inner accretion flow being spherical and a decreasing accretion rate: when the
flow geometry nearest to the neutron star is spherical and the accretion rate
is low, the ram pressure of the accretion disk may become too low to counteract
that of the photospheric expansion. In effect, this may provide a novel means
to probe the accretion flow. Additionally, we observe a peculiar effect: the
well-known cessation of X-ray bursts in the high state is too quick to be
consistent with a transition to stable helium burning. We suggest an
alternative explanation, that the cessation is due to the introduction of a
non-nuclear heat source in the neutron star ocean.

spectral invariants of sequences of locally symmetric spaces. Our main results
are uniform versions of the DeGeorge--Wallach Theorem, of a theorem of Delorme
and various other limit multiplicity theorems.
  A basic idea is to adapt the notion of Benjamini--Schramm convergence
(BS-convergence), originally introduced for sequences of finite graphs of
bounded degree, to sequences of Riemannian manifolds, and analyze the possible
limits. We show that BS-convergence of locally symmetric spaces implies
convergence, in an appropriate sense, of the associated normalized relative
Plancherel measures. This then yields convergence of normalized multiplicities
of unitary representations, Betti numbers and other spectral invariants. On the
other hand, when the corresponding Lie group $G$ is simple and of real rank at
least two, we prove that there is only one possible BS-limit, i.e. when the
volume tends to infinity, locally symmetric spaces always BS-converge to their
universal cover $G/K$. This leads to various general uniform results.
  When restricting to arbitrary sequences of congruence covers of a fixed
arithmetic manifold we prove a strong quantitative version of BS-convergence
which in turn implies upper estimates on the rate of convergence of normalized
Betti numbers in the spirit of Sarnak--Xue.
  An important role in our approach is played by the notion of Invariant Random
Subgroups. For higher rank simple Lie groups $G$, we exploit rigidity theory,
and in particular the Nevo--St\""{u}ck--Zimmer theorem and Kazhdan's property
(T), to obtain a complete understanding of the space of IRSs of $G$.

links a family of particles of initial action S_0(x) to their various positions
x at time t, and a new action, the deterministic action S(x,t;x_0,v_0), which
links a particle in initial position x_0 and initial velocity v_0 to its

convergence of the quantum density and the quantum action, solutions to the
Madelung equations, when the Planck constant h tends to 0. We find two
different solutions which depend on the initial density. In the first case,
where the initial quantum density is a classical density, the quantum density

equations of a set of classical particles whose initial positions are known
only by the initial density. In the second case where initial density converges
to a Dirac density, the density converges to the Dirac function and the quantum

classical mechanics non-discerned particles, which satisfy the statistical
Hamilton-Jacobi-equations and explain the Gibbs paradox, and discerned

zeros have been obtained for several cases. In this paper we use the method
developed before to solve one more special case. We make extensive use of
standard tools in number theory such as characters of finite fields, the Gauss
sums and the Jacobi sums. The problem of finding the weight distribution is
transformed into a problem of evaluating certain character sums over finite
fields, which turns out to be associated with counting the number of points on
some elliptic curves over finite fields. We also treat the special case that
the characteristic of the finite field is 2.

there are no highly efficient algorithms available for solving packing
problems. The two-dimensional bin packing problem is about packing all given
rectangular items, into a minimum size rectangular bin, without overlapping.
The restriction is that the items cannot be rotated. The current paper is
comparing a greedy algorithm with a hybrid genetic algorithm in order to see
which technique is better for the given problem. The algorithms are tested on
different sizes data.

gravity and studied the Heisenberg uncertainty relation of the universe in the
example of $f(R)=R^2$. In this work the Heisenberg uncertainty relation of the
universe is investigated in the general $f(R)$-type gravity where tachyonic
states are avoided. It is shown that, at late times namely the scale factor of
the universe is large, the spacetime becomes classical, and, at early times
namely the scale factor of the universe is small, the quantum effects dominate.

to the logarithmic behavior of time, with respect to the proper time.

commercial buildings when the residents are far away from the access gate of
the house. The system is a simple and reliable touch activated security system
and uses sensor technology to revolutionize the standards of living. The system
provides a best solution to most of the problems faced by house owners in their
daily life. Due to its simple electronic components nature, it is more
adaptable and cost-effective. The system is divided into three units; the power
supply unit which employs the use of both DC battery and mains supply to ensure
constant power supply to the circuit, the trigger unit which is responsible for
activating the alarm unit and designed to have much time and period and
moderate sensitivity in order to reduce the rate of false alarm, and the alarm
amplitude unit which main function is to produce amplitude alarm sound when
triggered by the trigger unit with the aim of producing a large audible sound
that can alert the entire neighborhood or scare an intruder away. The design of
the system was achieved by considering some factors such as economy,
availability of components and research materials, efficiency, compatibility
and portability and also durability in the design process. The performance of
the system after test met design specifications. This system works on the
principle of touch sensor. The general operation of the system and performance
is dependent on the presence of an intruder entering through the door and
touching any part of the door. The overall system was constructed and tested
and it work perfectly.
