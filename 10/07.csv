bring the intrinsic anisotropy and the system is no longer SU(2) invariant. The
anisotropy selects an easy c-axis collinear antiferromagnetic magnetic

  Europhysics Letter. 2011, 94: 028010",,,"physics.soc-ph cs.NI cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is a mainstream idea that scale-free network would be fragile under the
selective attacks. Internet is a typical scale-free network in the real world,
but it never collapses under the selective attacks of computer viruses and
hackers. This phenomenon is different from the deduction of the idea above
because this idea assumes the same cost to delete an arbitrary node. Hence this
paper discusses the behaviors of the scale-free network under the selective
node attack with different cost. Through the experiments on five complex
networks, we show that the scale-free network is possibly robust under the
selective node attacks; furthermore, the more compact the network is, and the
larger the average degree is, then the more robust the network is; With the
same average degrees, the more compact the network is, the more robust the
network is. This result would enrich the theory of the invulnerability of the
network, and can be used to build the robust social, technological and
biological networks, and also has the potential to find the target of drugs.

misunderstood. The paper [1] associates the general failure to build
intelligent thinking machines with current reductionist principles of temporal
coding and advocates for a change in paradigm regarding the brain analogy.
Since fragments of information are stored in proteins which can shift between
several structures to perform their function, the biological substrate is
actively involved in physical computation. The intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of
action potentials and synaptic activities maintain physical interactions within
and between neurons in the brain. During these events the required information
is exchanged between molecular structures (proteins) which store fragments of
information and the generated electric flux which carries and integrates
information in the brain. The entire process of physical interaction explains
how the brain actively creates or experiences meaning. This process of
interaction during an action potential generation can be simply seen as the
moment when the neuron solves a many-body problem. A neuroelectrodynamic theory
shows that the neuron solves equations rather than exclusively computes
functions. With the main focus on temporal patterns, the spike timing dogma
(STD) has neglected important forms of computation which do occur inside
neurons. In addition, artificial neural models have missed the most important
part since the real super-computing power of the brain has its origins in
computations that occur within neurons.

inversions, useful for quasi-phasematching. Microdisk optical cavities also
offer resonance field-enhancement and excellent spatial overlap, resulting in
highly efficient frequency conversion in micrometer-scale volumes. These
devices can be integrated in photonic circuits as compact sources of radiation

functionality for nonlinear semiconductor microdisk resonators, which have been
previously explored for all-optical circuits as switches, signal routers and

structure, the rhombohedral A7 structure, which accommodates lone pairs on each
site. Here we show that the A7 structure can display chemical ordering of Sb
and As, which were previously thought to mix randomly. Our structural
characterization of the compound SbAs is performed by single-crystal and
high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction, and neutron and x-ray pair
distribution function analysis. All least-squares refinements indicate ordering
of Sb and As, resulting in a GeTe-type structure without inversion symmetry.
High-temperature diffraction studies reveal an ordering transition around 550

first-principles calculations, confirm that SbAs is a semimetal, albeit with a
direct band separation larger than that of Sb or As. Because even subtle
substitutions in the semimetals, notably Bi_{1-x}Sb_x, can open semiconducting
energy gaps, a further investigation of the interplay between chemical ordering

few-body systems. It has turned out that $\Lambda(1405)$ can be described by
hadronic dynamics in a modern technology which incorporates coupled channel
unitarity framework and chiral dynamics. The idea of the hadronic $\bar KN$
composite state of $\Lambda(1405)$ is extended to kaonic few-body states. It is
concluded that, due to the fact that $K$ and $N$ have similar interaction
nature in s-wave $\bar K$ couplings, there are few-body quasibound states with
kaons systematically just below the break-up thresholds, like $\bar KNN$, $\bar
KKN$ and $\bar KKK$, as well as $\Lambda(1405)$ as a $\bar KN$ quasibound state

atomic layer deposition (ALD) coating of anodes and cathodes has shown
significant technological promise. ALD further provides well-characterized
model platforms for understanding electrolyte decomposition initiated by
electron tunneling through a passivating layer. First principles calculations
reveal two regimes of electron transfer to adsorbed ethylene carbonate
molecules (EC, a main component of commercial electrolyte) depending on whether
the electrode is alumina-coated. On bare Li metal electrode surfaces, EC
accepts electrons and decomposes within picoseconds. In contrast, constrained
density functional theory calculations in an ultra-high vacuum setting show
that, with the oxide coating, e- tunneling to the adsorbed EC falls within the
non-adiabatic regime. Here the molecular reorganization energy, computed in the
harmonic approximation, plays a key role in slowing down electron transfer. Ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations conducted at liquid EC-electrode
interfaces are consistent with the view that reactions and electron transfer
occur right at the interface. Microgravimetric measurements demonstrate that
the ALD coating decreases electrolyte decomposition and corroborate the
theoretical predictions.

momentum of the galaxy and known rotation curves. When both bulge and disk
density functions are assumed to be smooth and are given a value of zero beyond
the edge of the galaxy, a unique solution is obtained. Moreover, the calculated
density functions show that constant rotation curves are obtained from a nearly
exponential luminosity profile with a dark matter distribution which follows
that of the light emitting matter, without the need for modified Newtonian
dynamics. Experimental detection of molecular hydrogen in spiral galaxies
confirms the presence of a baryonic massive component consistent with the

newly emerging magnetic flux. In the coronal hole, 19 of 22 events have a
single stable polarity which does not change its position in time. In eleven
cases this is the dominant polarity. The dominant flux of the coronal hole form
the largest concentration of magnetic flux in terms of size while the opposite
polarity is distributed in small concentrations. In the coronal hole the number
of magnetic elements of the dominant polarity is four times higher than the
non-dominant one. The supergranulation configuration appears to preserve its
general shape during approximately nine hours of observations although the
large concentrations in the network did evolve and were slightly displaced, and
their strength either increased or decreased. The emission fluctuations seen in
the X-ray bright points are associated with reoccurring magnetic cancellation
in the footpoints. Unique observations of an X-ray jet reveal similar magnetic
behaviour in the footpoints, i.e. cancellation of the opposite polarity
magnetic flux. We found that the magnetic flux cancellation rate during the jet
is much higher than in bright points. Not all magnetic cancellations result in
an X-ray enhancement, suggesting that there is a threshold of the amount of
magnetic flux involved in a cancellation above which brightening would occur at
X-ray temperatures. Our study demonstrates that the magnetic flux in coronal
holes is continuously recycled through magnetic reconnection which is
responsible for the formation of numerous small-scale transient events. The
open magnetic flux forming the coronal-hole phenomenon is largely involved in
these transient features.

dispersed populations through IS. Using the knowledge-based view of the
organization, this work conceptualizes a theory of Crowd Capital to explain
this phenomenon. Crowd Capital is a heterogeneous knowledge resource generated
by an organization, through its use of Crowd Capability, which is defined by
the structure, content, and process by which an organization engages with the
dispersed knowledge of individuals (the Crowd). Our work draws upon a diverse
literature and builds upon numerous examples of practitioner implementations to
support our theorizing. We present a model of Crowd Capital generation in
organizations and discuss the implications of Crowd Capital on organizational

to calculate the total time of project. Our approach helps to control risk
mitigation that is determined using event tree analysis and fault tree

scheduling that makes the project to be implemented within defined plan and
schedule. Finally, adaptive procedure with density (APD) is deployed to get
reasonable feeding buffer time and project buffer time.

smoothness in the mean and covariance process. In particular, there may be

misleading inferences and predictions, with over-smoothing across erratic time

lead to mis-calibration of predictive intervals, which can be substantially too

process for characterizing multivariate mean-covariance changes in continuous

matrix. This process is constructed utilizing latent dictionary functions
evolving in time through nested Gaussian processes and linearly related to the
observed data with a sparse mapping. Using a differential equation

online algorithms for approximate Bayesian inference. The performance is
assessed in simulations and illustrated in a financial application.

an abrupt change occurs in an area monitored by a number of sensors; the

soon as possible. A novel sequential detection rule is proposed that requires
communication from the sensors at random times and transmission of only low-bit
messages, on which the fusion center runs in parallel a CUSUM test. The
second-order asymptotic optimality of the proposed scheme is established both
in discrete and in continuous time. Specifically, it is shown that the
inflicted performance loss (with respect to the optimal detection rule that
uses the complete sensor observations) is asymptotically bounded as the rate of
false alarms goes to 0, for any fixed rate of communication. When the rate of
communication from the sensors is asymptotically low, the proposed scheme
remains first-order asymptotically optimal. Finally, simulation experiments
illustrate its efficiency and its superiority over a decentralized detection
rule that relies on communication at deterministic times.

phase that survives up to a critical temperature must possess, in the ordered
phase, symmetric as well as non-symmetric eigenstates. We predict, and
explicitly show in the fully-connected Ising model in a transverse field, that
these two classes of eigenstates do not overlap in energy, and therefore that
an energy edge exists separating low-energy symmetry-breaking eigenstates from
high-energy symmetry-invariant ones. This energy is actually responsible, as we
show, for the dynamical phase transition displayed by this model under a sudden
large increase of the transverse field. A second situation we consider is the
opposite, where the symmetry-breaking eigenstates are those in the high-energy
sector of the spectrum, whereas the low-energy eigenstates are symmetric. In
that case too a special energy must exist marking the boundary and leading to
unexpected out-of-equilibrium dynamical behavior. An example is the fermionic
repulsive Hubbard model Hamiltonian H. Exploiting the trivial fact that the
high energy spectrum of H is also the low energy one of -H, we conclude that
the high energy eigenstates of the Hubbard model are superfluid. Simulating in
a time-dependent Gutzwiller approximation the time evolution of a high energy
BCS-like trial wave function, we show that a small superconducting order
parameter will actually grow in spite of the repulsive nature of interaction.

barotropic vorticity equation on periodic domains, when nonlinear wave
interactions are studied to leading order in the amplitudes. The solutions to
this set of Diophantine equations are of interest in atmosphere (Rossby waves)
and Tokamak plasmas (drift waves), because they provide the values of the
spectral wavevectors that interact resonantly via three-wave interactions.
These come in ""triads"", i.e., groups of three wavevectors.
  We provide the full solution to the Diophantine equations in the case of
infinite Rossby deformation radius. The method is completely new, and relies on
mapping the unknown variables to rational points on quadratic forms of
""Minkowski"" type. Classical methods invented centuries ago by Fermat, Euler,
Lagrange and Minkowski, are used to classify all solutions to our original
Diophantine equations, thus providing a computational method to generate
numerically all the resonant triads in the system. Our method has a clear
computational advantage over brute-force numerical search: on a 10000^2 grid,
the brute-force search would take 15 years using optimised C++ codes, whereas
our method takes about 40 minutes.
  The method is extended to generate quasi-resonant triads, which are defined
by relaxing the resonant condition on the frequencies, allowing for a small
mismatch. Quasi-resonances are robust with respect to physical perturbations,
unlike exact resonances. Therefore, the new method is really valuable in
practical terms. We show that the set of quasi-resonances form an intricate
network of clusters of connected triads, whose structure depends on the value
of the allowed mismatch. We provide some quantitative comparison between the
clusters' structure and the onset of fully nonlinear turbulence in the
barotropic vorticity equation, and provide perspectives for new research.

has an intuitive geometric interpretation closely related to support vector

slow roll inflection point inflation. The inflaton is the D-flat direction
labelled by the chiral invariant HLN composed of the Higgs(H), slepton(L) and
conjugate sneutrino(N) superfields. The scale of inflation and fine tuning is
set by the conjugate neutrino Majorana mass $M_{\nu^c} \sim 10^6-10^{12}$ GeV.
The cubic term in the (quartic) inflaton potential is dominantly from
superpotential (not soft Susy breaking) couplings. The tuning conditions are
thus insensitive to soft supersymmetry breaking parameters and are generically
much less stringent than for previous `A-term' inflation scenarios controlled
by mass scales $\sim TeV$. WMAP limits on the ratio of tensor to scalar
perturbations limit the scale $M$ controlling inflection point inflation: $M
<7.9 \times 10^{13}$ GeV. `Instant preheating' is operative and dumps the
inflaton energy into MSSM modes giving a high reheat temperature : $T_{rh}
\approx M_{\nu^c}^{3/4}\, 10^{6}$ GeV $\sim 10^{11}- 10^{15} $ GeV. A large
gravitino mass $> 50 $ TeV is therefore required to avoid over closure by
reheat produced gravitinos. `Instant preheating' and NLH inflaton facilitate
production of right handed neutrinos during inflaton decay and thus non-thermal
leptogenesis in addition to thermal leptogenesis. We show that the embedding in
the fully realistic New Minimal Supersymmetric SO(10) GUT requires use of the
heaviest righthanded neutrino mass as the controlling scale but the possibility
of a measurable tensor scalar perturbation ratio seems marginal. We examine the
parametric difficulties remaining.

the skewness of the flux distribution suggests that the variability stems from

GeV to beyond $10^9$ GeV. IceCube sets the scale for future experiments to make
improvements. Strategies for future upgrades will be discussed in three energy
ranges. At the low-energy end, an infill detector to IceCube's DeepCore would
add sensitivity in the energy range from a few to a few tens of GeV with the
primary goal of measuring the neutrino mass hierarchy. In the central energy
range of classical optical neutrino telescopes, next generation detectors are
being pursued in the Mediterranean and at Lake Baikal. The KM3NeT detector in
its full scale would establish a substantial increase in sensitivity over
IceCube. At the highest energies, radio detectors in ice are among the most
promising and pursued technologies to increase exposure at $10^9$ GeV by more
than an order of magnitude compared to IceCube.

structures with finite or infinite polygons as faces and with finite graphs as
vertex-figures, such that their symmetry groups are transitive on the flags.
The present paper and its predecessor describe a complete classification of
regular polygonal complexes in 3-space. In Part I we established basic
structural results for the symmetry groups, discussed operations on their
generators, characterized the complexes with face mirrors as the 2-skeletons of
the regular 4-apeirotopes in 3-space, and fully enumerated the simply
flag-transitive complexes with mirror vector (1,2). In this paper, we complete
the enumeration of all regular polygonal complexes and in particular describe
the simply flag-transitive complexes for the remaining mirror vectors. It is
found that, up to similarity, there are precisely 25 regular polygonal
complexes which are not regular polyhedra, namely 21 simply flag-transitive
complexes and 4 complexes which are 2-skeletons of regular 4-apeirotopes.

composition range from x=0.76 to 2.6. L10-ordered MnxGa films show robust
magnetization, high remanent ratio, giant perpendicular anisotropy, high
intrinsic and extrinsic coercivity, and large energy product, which make this
kind of material favorable for perpendicular magnetic recording,
high-performance spintronic devices and permanent magnet applications. In
contrast, D022-ordered films exhibit lower perpendicular anisotropy and weaker
magnetism. Post-growth annealing MnxGa films studies reveal high
thermal-stability up to 450 oC, and effective tailoring of magnetic properties
can be realized by prolonging annealing at 450 oC. These results would be
helpful for understanding this kind of material and designing new spintronic
devices for specific practical applications.

observational and theoretical difficulties. To find the dense and cold clumps
where massive star formation can take place, we compiled a sample of high
infrared extinction clouds, which were observed previously by us in the 1.2 mm
continuum emission and ammonia. We try to understand the star-formation stages
of the clumps in these high extinction clouds by studying the infall and
outflow properties, the presence of a young stellar object (YSO), and the level
of the CO depletion through a molecular line survey with the IRAM 30m and APEX
12m telescopes. Moreover, we want to know if the cloud morphology, quantified
through the column density contrast between the clump and the clouds, has an
impact on the star formation occurring inside it. We find that the HCO+(1-0)
line is the most sensitive for detecting infalling motions. SiO, an outflow
tracer, was mostly detected toward sources with infall, indicating that infall
is accompanied by collimated outflows. The presence of YSOs within a clump
depends mostly on its column density; no signs of YSOs were found below 4E22
cm-2. Star formation is on the verge of beginning in clouds that have a low
column density contrast; infall is not yet present in the majority of the
clumps. The first signs of ongoing star formation are broadly observed in
clouds where the column density contrast between the clump and the cloud is
higher than two; most clumps show infall and outflow. Finally, the most evolved
clumps are in clouds that have a column density contrast higher than three;
almost all clumps have a YSO, and in many clumps, the infall has already
halted. Hence, the cloud morphology, based on the column density contrast
between the cloud and the clumps, seems to have a direct connection with the
evolutionary stage of the objects forming inside.
