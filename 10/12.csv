interaction in the ~250-600~MeV/c momentum range of nucleons in nuclei, the
existence of two new properties for high-momentum distribution of nucleons in
asymmetric nuclei is suggested. The first property is the approximate scaling
relation between proton and neutron high-momentum distributions weighted by
their relative fractions in the nucleus. The second property is the inverse
proportionality of the strength of the high-momentum distribution of protons
and neutrons to the same relative fractions. Based on these two properties the
high-momentum distribution function for asymmetric nuclei has been modeled and
demonstrated that it describes reasonably well the high-momentum
characteristics of light nuclei. However, the most surprising result is
obtained for neutron rich nuclei with large A, for which a substantial relative
abundance of high-momentum protons as compared to neutrons is predicted. For
example, the model predicts that in Au the relative fraction of protons with
momenta above $k_{F} \sim 260$~MeV/c is 50% more than that of neutrons. Such a
situation may have many implications for different observations in nuclear
physics related to the properties of a proton in neutron rich nuclei.

third party to solve a specific problem. At the same time, no entity wants to
publish its problem data during the solution procedure unless there is a
privacy guarantee. Unlike cryptography and differential privacy based
approaches, the methods based on optimization lack a quantification of the
privacy they can provide. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a
mechanism to quantify the privacy of a broad class of optimization approaches.
In particular, we formally define a one-to-many relation, which relates a given
adversarial observed message to an uncertainty set of the problem data. This
relation quantifies the potential ambiguity on problem data due to the employed
optimization approaches. The privacy definitions are then formalized based on
the uncertainty sets. The properties of the proposed privacy measure is
analyzed. The key ideas are illustrated with examples, including localization,

mapping has paralleled the adoption of genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
for the analysis of complex traits and disease in humans. Under the hypothesis
that many GWAS associations tag non-coding SNPs with small effects, and that
these SNPs exert phenotypic control by modifying gene expression, it has become
common to interpret GWAS associations using eQTL data. To exploit the
mechanistic interpretability of eQTL-GWAS comparisons, an improved
understanding of the genetic architecture and cell type specificity of eQTLs is
required. We address this need by performing an eQTL analysis in four parts:
first we identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types; next we
quantified cell type specific eQTLs across the studies; then we integrated eQTL
data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data sets from the ENCODE project;
finally we built a classifier to predict cell type specific eQTLs. Consistent
with prior studies, we demonstrate that allelic heterogeneity is pervasive at
cis-eQTLs and that cis-eQTLs are often cell type specific. Within and between
cell type eQTL replication is associated with eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of
cell type specific CRE element classes, including enhancer, promoter, and
repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA
binding proteins. Using a random forest classifier including 526 CRE data sets
as features, we successfully predict the cell type specificity of eQTL SNPs in
the absence of gene expression data from the cell type of interest. We
anticipate that such integrative, predictive modeling will improve our ability

algorithms, are increasingly popular inference tools for complex biological
models. Such algorithms proceed by constructing a succession of probability
distributions over the parameter space conditional upon the simulated data

the threshold $\epsilon$. While in theory, the distributions (starting from a
suitably defined prior) will converge towards the unknown posterior as
$\epsilon$ tends to zero, the exact sequence of thresholds can impact upon the
computational efficiency and success of a particular application. In
particular, we show here that the current preferred method of choosing
thresholds as a pre-determined quantile of the distances between simulated and
observed data from the previous population, can lead to the inferred posterior
distribution being very different to the true posterior. Threshold selection
thus remains an important challenge. Here we propose an automated and adaptive

to avoid local minima - a problem that has plagued previous threshold schemes.

models that in theory solve the algorithmically unsolvable, but they are not
physically realizable according to currently accepted physical theories. While
opponents to the hypercomputation movement provide arguments against the
physical realizability of specific models in order to demonstrate this, these
arguments lack the generality to be a satisfactory justification against the
construction of \emph{any} information-processing machine that computes beyond
the universal Turing machine. To this end, I present a more mathematically
concrete challenge to hypercomputability, and will show that one is immediately
led into physical impossibilities, thereby demonstrating the infeasibility of
hypercomputers more generally. This gives impetus to propose and justify a more
plausible starting point for an extension to the classical paradigm that is
physically possible, at least in principle. Instead of attempting to rely on
infinities such as idealized limits of infinite time or numerical precision, or
some other physically unattainable source, one should focus on extending the
classical paradigm to better encapsulate modern computational problems that are
not well-expressed/modeled by the closed-system paradigm of the Turing machine.
I present the first steps toward this goal by considering contemporary
computational problems dealing with intractability and issues surrounding
cyber-physical systems, and argue that a reasonable extension to the classical
paradigm should focus on these issues in order to be practically viable.

quantitative framework for determining the existence, strength, and type of
relationship between high-resolution chromatin structure in terms of DNaseI
hypersensitivity (DHS) and genome-wide gene expression levels in 20 diverse
human cell lines. We show that ~25% of genes show cell-type specific expression
explained by alterations in chromatin structure. We find that distal regions of
chromatin structure (e.g., +/- 200kb) capture more genes with this relationship
than local regions (e.g., +/- 2.5kb), yet the local regions show a more
pronounced effect. By exploiting variation across cell-types, we were capable
of pinpointing the most likely hypersensitive sites related to cell-type
specific expression, which we show have a range of contextual usages. This
quantitative framework is likely applicable to other settings aimed at relating
continuous genomic measurements to gene expression variation.

$H$ up to $10^{20}$ G are considered within the MIT bag model at zero
temperature implying the constraints of total baryon number conservation,
charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium. The pressure anisotropy, exhibiting
in the difference between the pressures along and perpendicular to the field
direction, becomes essential at $H>H_{th}$, with the estimate
$10^{17}<H_{th}\lesssim10^{18}$ G. The longitudinal pressure vanishes in the
critical field $H_c$, which can be somewhat less or larger than $10^{18}$ G,
depending on the total baryon number density and bag pressure. As a result, the
longitudinal instability occurs in strange quark matter, which precludes: (1) a
significant drop in the content of $s$ quarks, which, otherwise, could happen
at $H\sim10^{20}$ G; (2) the appearance of positrons in weak processes in a
narrow interval near $H\sim2\cdot10^{19}$ G (replacing electrons). The
occurrence of the longitudinal instability leaves the possibility only for
electrons to reach a fully polarized state, while for all quark flavors the
polarization remains mild even for the fields near $H_c$. The anisotropic
equation of state is determined under the conditions relevant to the interiors
of magnetars.

hyperbolicity of an n-point discrete metric space. We observe that computing
the Gromov hyperbolicity from a fixed base-point reduces to a (max,min) matrix
product. Hence, using the (max,min) matrix product algorithm by Duan and
Pettie, the fixed base-point hyperbolicity can be determined in O(n^2.69) time.
It follows that the Gromov hyperbolicity can be computed in O(n^3.69) time, and
a 2-approximation can be found in O(n^2.69) time. We also give a (2 log_2

heterogeneous binary agents (individual spin-glass samples) are considered on
the complete graph and also on 2d and 3d regular lattices. The system's
stochastic dynamics is studied by numerical simulations. The dynamics is so
slow that one can meaningfully speak of quasi-equilibrium states. Performing
measurements of correlations in such a quasi-equilibrium state we find that
they are random both as to their sign and absolute value, but on average they
fall off very slowly with distance in all instances that we have studied. This
means that the system is essentially non-local, small changes at one end may
have a strong impact at the other. Correlations and other local quantities are
extremely sensitive to the boundary conditions all across the system, although
this sensitivity disappears upon averaging over the samples or partially
averaging over the agents. The strong, random correlations tend to organize a
large fraction of the agents into strongly correlated clusters that act
together. If we think about this model as a distant metaphor of economic agents
or bank networks, the systemic risk implications of this tendency are clear:
any impact on even a single strongly correlated agent will spread, in an
unforeseeable manner, to the whole system via the strong random correlations.

model of a granular material under controlled normal stress between two
parallel smooth, frictional walls, moving with opposite velocities $\pm$V .
Discrete simulations, which are carried out with the contact dynamics method in
dense assemblies of disks, reveal that, unlike rough walls made of strands of
particles, smooth ones can lead to shear strain localization in the boundary
layer. Specifically, we observe, for decreasing V, first a fluid-like regime
(A), in which the whole granular layer is sheared, with a homogeneous strain
rate except near the walls; then (B) a symmetric velocity profile with a solid
block in the middle and strain localized near the walls and finally (C) a state
with broken symmetry in which the shear rate is confined to one boundary layer,
while the bulk of the material moves together with the opposite wall. Both
transitions are independent of system size and occur for specific values of V .
Transient times are discussed. We show that the first transition, between
regimes A and B, can be deduced from constitutive laws identified for the bulk
material and the boundary layer, while the second one could be associated with
an instability in the behavior of the boundary layer. The boundary zone
constitutive law, however, is observed to depend on the state of the bulk
material nearby.

Compton reflection strength was measured to be in the range 0.2-1.0 depending
on the model used. A moderately strong Fe \ka emission line was detected with
an equivalent width of ~120+/-25 eV and an Fe Kb line was identified with an
equivalent width of ~30+/-20 eV, although we could not rule out contribution
from ionized Fe emission at this energy. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for
soft excess emission. Comparing our results with a 2004 observation from
XMM-Newton we found that either the soft excess has decreased by a factor of
20-30 in 7 years or the photon index has steepened by 0.10 (with no soft excess
present) while the continuum flux in the range 2-10 keV has varied only
minimally (10%). This result could support recent claims that the soft excess
is independent of the X-ray continuum.

this paper, a novel modal analysis method (Ege et al, JSV 325 (4-5), 2009) is
used to identify viscoelastic properties (loss factors, Young's modulus) of
""polyethylene thermoplastic / aluminum"" bilayer plates. The thermoplastic is
chosen for its high loss factors and relative low mass. The experimental method
consists in a high-resolution technique (ESPRIT algorithm) which allows precise
estimations of the viscoelastic properties even in frequency domains with high
modal overlap (high damping or modal density). Experimental loss factors
estimated from impact hammer excitations on the free-free plates highly
corresponds with two theoretical estimations. In the first model (Guyader &

is allowed. Results on several plates with several thicknesses of

  In this paper we present a new algorithm--a convexified version of Maximum

logarithmic factors of known lower bounds for spectral methods, and there is
evidence suggesting that no polynomial time algorithm would do significantly
better.

are observed to remain almost unchanged from photosphere to umbra and are thus
insensitive to parasitic light. It is also shown that the infrared K I 7699
line is suitable for umbral spectroscopy since it is not seriously blended, its
continuum is well defined and it is less influenced by parasitic light as
compared to lines in the visible spectrum, due to the smaller umbral contrast.
Calculations show that the umbral gradient dT/d(tau), required to fit the Ca II
triplet lines, strongly conflicts with the observed profiles of K I 7699, NaD2

correction of parasitic light. It is shown that this discrepancy from the
different line profiles may be removed by adopting an opacity enhancement as
introduced by Zwaan (1974) from a discussion of continuum contrasts alone. The
finally proposed umbral working model is very close to a scaled model of the

SZ signal, but when the SZ signal is scaled to within the radio halo radius the
correlation becomes approximately linear, with reduced intrinsic scatter. We do

Sun's surface) are advected by the zonal flows at depths equal to the widths of
the cells themselves. Here we probe the structure of the meridional circulation
by cross-correlating maps of the Doppler velocity signal using a series of
successively longer time lags between maps. We find that the poleward
meridional flow decreases in amplitude with time lag and reverses direction to
become an equatorward return flow at time lags > 24 hours. These
cross-correlation results are dominated by larger and deeper cells at longer
time lags. (The smaller cells have shorter lifetimes and do not contribute to
the correlated signal at longer time lags.) We determine the characteristic
cell size associated with each time lag by comparing the equatorial zonal flows
measured at different time lags with the zonal flows associated with different
cell sizes from a Fourier analysis. This association gives a characteristic
cell size of ~50 Mm at a 24 hour time lag. This indicates that the poleward
meridional flow returns equatorward at depths > 50 Mm -- just below the base of
the surface shear layer. A substantial and highly significant equatorward flow
(4.6 +/- 0.4 m/s) is found at a time lag of 28 hours corresponding to a depth
of ~70 Mm. This represents one of the first positive detections of the Sun's
meridional return flow and illustrates the power of using supergranules to
probe the Sun's internal dynamics.

inevitably dissipates a nontrivial fraction of the pulsar spin-down power
within a few LC radii. We develop a basic physical picture of reconnection in
this environment and discuss its implications for the observed pulsed gamma-ray
emission. We argue that reconnection proceeds in the plasmoid-dominated regime,
via an hierarchical chain of multiple secondary islands/flux ropes. The
inter-plasmoid reconnection layers are subject to strong synchrotron cooling,
leading to significant plasma compression. Using the conditions of pressure
balance across these current layers, the balance between the heating by
magnetic energy dissipation and synchrotron cooling, and Ampere's law, we
obtain simple estimates for key parameters of the layers --- temperature,
density, and layer thickness. In the comoving frame of the relativistic pulsar
wind just outside of the equatorial current sheet, these basic parameters are
uniquely determined by the strength of the reconnecting upstream magnetic
field. For the case of the Crab pulsar, we find them to be of order 10 GeV,
$10^{13} cm^{-3}$, and 10 cm, respectively. After accounting for the bulk
Doppler boosting due to the pulsar wind, the synchrotron and inverse-Compton
emission from the reconnecting current sheet can explain the observed pulsed
high-energy (GeV) and VHE (~100 GeV) radiation, respectively. Also, we suggest
that the rapid relative motions of the secondary plasmoids in the hierarchical

error-free synthetic data were used to test several methods that each make a
different assumption about how the divergence-free property can be used to
resolve the ambiguity. In this paper this testing is continued with an
examination of the effects of Poisson photon noise and limited instrumental
spatial resolution. We find that all currently available methods based on the
divergence-free property can produce undesirable results when photon noise or
unresolved structure are present in the data. We perform a series of

approach that produces reasonable results in tests using synthetic data. The
first step of this approach involves the global minimisation of a combination
of the absolute value of the approximation for the divergence and a smoothness
constraint, which is designed to minimise the difference between the magnetic
field in neighbouring pixels. In the second step, pixels with measurements
known to be strongly affected by photon noise are revisited with a smoothing

involution of the first kind, with $dim_{Z(R)}R > 4$ and $\Char(Z(R))\neq 2$,
is it true that $S^2=R$? We shall see that in such a ring $R$, $R=S^3$. We
shall bring two possible criteria, each shows when $R=S^2$. The first
criterion: There exist $x,y \in S$ such that $xy-yx \neq 0$ and $xSy \subseteq
S^2$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $S^2=R$. The second criterion: There exist $x,y \in S$
such that $xy+yx \neq 0$ and $xKy \subseteq S^2$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $S^2=R$.
Actually, those results are true without any restriction on the dimension of
$R$ over $Z(R)$. In the special case of matrices (with the transpose involution
and with the symplectic involution) over a field of characteristic not equal to
2, it is not difficult to find, for example, $x,y \in S$ such that $xy-yx \neq

that for matrices the answer is known to be positive. Similar results for

individually detected X-ray sources (potential AGN), is expected to be powered
by X-ray binaries and hot gas. We find, for the first time, evidence of
evolution in the X-ray/SFR relation. Based on X-ray stacking analyses for z<4

properties of galaxy clusters from a multi-wavelength data set spanning from
X-ray spectroscopic and photometric data to gravitational lensing to the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZe). The method relies on two quite non informative
geometrical assumptions: the distributions of total matter or gas are
approximately ellipsoidal and co-aligned; they have different, constant axial
ratios but share the same degree of triaxiality. Weak and strong lensing probe
the features of the total mass distribution in the plane of the sky. X-ray data
measure size and orientation of the gas in the plane of the sky. Comparison
with the SZ amplitude fixes the elongation of the gas along the line of sight.
These constraints are deprojected thanks to Bayesian inference. The mass
distribution is described as a Navarro-Frenk-White halo with arbitrary
orientation, gas density and temperature are modelled with parametric profiles.
We applied the method to Abell 1689. Independently of the priors, the cluster
is massive, M_{200}=(1.3+-0.2)*10^{15}M_sun, and over-concentrated,
c_{200}=8+-1, but still consistent with theoretical predictions. The total
matter is triaxial (minor to major axis ratio ~0.5+-0.1 exploiting priors from
N-body simulations) with the major axis nearly orientated along the line of
sight. The gas is rounder (minor to major axis ratio ~0.6+-0.1) and deviates
from hydrostatic equilibrium. The contribution of non-thermal pressure is

star-forming complexes taken with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) as part of the
Star Formation in Radio Survey (SFRS). Among the sources without evidence for
an AGN, and also having lower frequency radio data, we find a median thermal
fraction at 33GHz of ~76% with a dispersion of ~24%. For all sources resolved
on scales <0.5kpc, the thermal fraction is even larger, being >90%. This
suggests that the rest-frame 33GHz emission provides a sensitive measure of the
ionizing photon rate from young star-forming regions, thus making it a robust
star formation rate indicator. Taking the 33GHz star formation rates as a
reference, we investigate other empirical calibrations relying on different
combinations of warm 24\mu m dust, total infrared (IR; 8-1000\mu m), H\alpha\
line, and far-UV continuum emission. The recipes derived here generally agree
with others found in the literature, albeit with a large dispersion that most
likely stems from a combination of effects. Comparing the 33GHz to total IR
flux ratios as a function of the radio spectral index, measured between 1.7 and
33GHz, we find that the ratio increases as the radio spectral index flattens
which does not appear to be a distance effect. Consequently, the ratio of
non-thermal to total IR emission appears relatively constant, suggesting only
moderate variations in the cosmic-ray electron injection spectrum and ratio of
synchrotron to total cooling processes among star-forming complexes. Assuming
that this trend solely arises from an increase in the thermal fraction sets a
maximum on the scatter of the non-thermal spectral indices among the
star-forming regions of \sigma_\alpha^{NT} < 0.13.

feedback in the analogues of low-redshift galactic disks. In this method, which
we call star-forming molecular cloud (SFMC) particles, we use a ray-tracing
technique to solve the radiative transfer equation for ultraviolet photons
emitted by thousands of distinct particles on the fly. Joined with high
numerical resolution of 3.8 pc, the realistic description of stellar feedback
helps to self-regulate star formation. This new feedback scheme also enables us
to study the escape of ionizing photons from star-forming clumps and from a
galaxy, and to examine the evolving environment of star-forming gas clumps. By
simulating a galactic disk in a halo of 2.3e11 Msun, we find that the average
escape fraction from all radiating sources on the spiral arms (excluding the
central 2.5 kpc) fluctuates between 0.08% and 5.9% during a ~20 Myr period with
a mean value of 1.1%. The flux of escaped photons from these sources is not
strongly beamed, but manifests a large opening angle of more than 60 degree
from the galactic pole. Further, we investigate the escape fraction per SFMC
particle, f_esc(i), and how it evolves as the particle ages. We discover that
the average escape fraction f_esc is dominated by a small number of SFMC
particles with high f_esc(i). On average, the escape fraction from a SFMC
particle rises from 0.27% at its birth to 2.1% at the end of a particle
lifetime, 6 Myrs. This is because SFMC particles drift away from the dense gas
clumps in which they were born, and because the gas around the star-forming
clumps is dispersed by ionizing radiation and supernova feedback. The framework
established in this study brings deeper insight into the physics of photon
escape fraction from an individual star-forming clump, and from a galactic
disk.

confirmed samples of M31 red giant branch stars derived from Keck/DEIMOS
spectroscopic observations. A set of empirical spectroscopic and photometric
M31 membership diagnostics is used to identify and reject foreground and
background contaminants. This enables us to trace the stellar halo of M31 to
larger projected distances and fainter surface brightnesses than previous
photometric studies. The surface brightness profile of M31's halo follows a
power-law with index -2.2 +/- 0.2 and extends to a projected distance of at
least ~175 kpc (~ 2/3 of M31's virial radius), with no evidence of a downward
break at large radii. The best-fit elliptical isophotes have b/a=0.94 with the
major axis of the halo aligned along the minor axis of M31's disk, consistent
with a prolate halo, although the data are also consistent with M31's halo
having spherical symmetry. The fact that tidal debris features are
kinematically cold is used to identify substructure in the spectroscopic fields
out to projected radii of 90 kpc, and investigate the effect of this
substructure on the surface brightness profile. The scatter in the surface
brightness profile is reduced when kinematically identified tidal debris
features in M31 are statistically subtracted; the remaining profile indicates a
comparatively diffuse stellar component to M31's stellar halo exists to large
distances. Beyond 90 kpc, kinematically cold tidal debris features can not be
identified due to small number statistics; nevertheless, the significant
field-to-field variation in surface brightness beyond 90 kpc suggests that the
outermost region of M31's halo is also comprised to a significant degree of
stars stripped from accreted objects.

providing a unique opportunity to test the proposed role of Class I masers as
evolutionary indicators for massive star formation. The millimeter observations
reveal bipolar molecular outflows, traced by 13CO(2-1) emission, associated
with all three Class I maser sources. Two of these sources (including the EGO)
are also associated with 6.7 GHz Class II methanol masers; the Class II masers
are coincident with millimeter continuum cores that exhibit hot core line
emission and drive active outflows, as indicated by the detection of SiO(5-4).
In these cases, the Class I masers are coincident with outflow lobes, and
appear as clear cases of excitation by active outflows. In contrast, the third
Class I source is associated with an ultracompact HII region, and not with
Class II masers. The lack of SiO emission suggests the 13CO outflow is a relic,
consistent with its longer dynamical timescale. Our data show that massive
young stellar objects associated only with Class I masers are not necessarily
young, and provide the first unambiguous evidence that Class I masers may be
excited by both young (hot core) and older (UC HII) MYSOs within the same

parameters of the solar atmosphere during solar flares. Soft X-ray and EUV
observations often show coronal sources near the top of flaring loops, while
hard X-ray emission is mostly observed from chromospheric footpoints. Combining
RHESSI with simultaneous SDO/AIA observations, it is possible for the first
time to determine the density, temperature, and emission profile of the solar
atmosphere over a wide range of heights during a flare, using two independent
methods. Here we analyze a near limb event during the first of three hard X-ray
peaks. The emission measure, temperature, and density of the coronal source is
found using soft X-ray RHESSI images while the chromospheric density is
determined using RHESSI visibility analysis of the hard X-ray footpoints. A
regularized inversion technique is applied to AIA images of the flare to find
the differential emission measure (DEM). Using DEM maps we determine the
emission and temperature structure of the loop, as well as the density, and
compare it with RHESSI results. The soft X-ray and hard X-ray sources are
spatially coincident with the top and bottom of the EUV loop, but the bulk of
the EUV emission originates from a region without co-spatial RHESSI emission.
The temperature analysis along the loop indicates that the hottest plasma is
found near the coronal loop top source. The EUV observations suggest that the
density in the loop legs increases with increasing height while the temperature
remains constant within uncertainties.

of field lines about the axis of twisted magnetic-flux tubes. These methods
estimate the winding rate by finding the values for a set of parameters that
correspond to the minimum of the discrepancy between magnetic-field
measurements and predictions from a twisted flux-tube model. For the flux-tube
model used in the fitting, we assume that the magnetic field is static,
axisymmetric, and does not vary in the vertical direction. Using error-free,
synthetic vector magnetic-field data constructed with models for twisted
magnetic-flux tubes, we test the efficacy of fitting methods at recovering the
true winding rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate how assumptions built into the
flux-tube models used for the fitting influence the accuracy of the
winding-rate estimates. We identify the radial variation of the winding rate
within the flux tube as one assumption that can have a significant impact on
the winding-rate estimates. We show that the errors caused by making a fixed,
incorrect assumption about the radial variation of the winding rate can be
largely avoided by fitting directly for the radial variation of the winding
rate. Other assumptions that we investigate include the lack of variation of
the field in the azimuthal and vertical directions in the flux tube model used
for the fitting, and the inclination, curvature, and location of the flux-tube
axis. When the observed field deviates substantially from the flux-tube model
used for the fitting, we find that the winding-rate estimates can be
unreliable. We conclude that the magnetic-flux tube models used in this
investigation are probably too simple to yield reliable estimates for the
winding rate of the field lines in solar magnetic structures in general, unless
additional information is available to justify the choice of flux-tube model

graphs is proposed to explore possible realizations of emergent manifolds.
Graphs with given numbers of vertices and edges are considered, governed by a
very general Hamiltonian that merely favors graphs with near-constant valency
and local rotational symmetry. The ratio of vertices to edges controls the
dimensionality of the emergent manifold. The model is simulated numerically in
the canonical ensemble for a given vertex to edge ratio, where it is found that
the low-energy states are almost triangulations of two-dimensional manifolds.
The resulting manifold shows topological ""handles"" and surface intersections in
a higher embedding space, as well as non-trivial fractal dimension consistent
with previous spectral analysis, and nonlocal links consistent with models of
disordered locality. The transition to an emergent manifold is first order, and
thus dependent on microscopic structure. Issues involved in interpreting
nearly-fixed valency graphs as Feynman diagrams dual to a triangulated manifold
as in matrix models are discussed. Another interesting phenomenon is that the
entropy of the graphs are super-extensive, a fact known since Erd\H{o}s, which
results in a transition temperature of zero in the limit of infinite system
size: infinite manifolds are always disordered. Aside from a finite universe or
diverging coupling constraints as possible solutions to this problem,
long-range interactions between vertex defects also resolve the problem and
restore a nonzero transition temperature, in a manner similar to that in
low-dimensional condensed-matter systems.

for tidal disruption events (TDEs) to analyze the dependence of these events on
beta, the ratio of the tidal radius to the orbital pericenter. We find,
contrary to most previous work, that the spread in debris energy for a TDE is
largely constant for all beta. This result has important consequences for
optical transient searches targeting TDEs, which we discuss. We quantify
leading-order general relativistic corrections to this spread in energy and
find that they are small. We also examine the role of stellar spin, and find
that a combination of spin-orbit misalignment, rapid rotation, and high beta
may increase the spread in debris energy. Finally, we quantify for the first
time the gravitational wave emission due to the strong compression of a star in
a high-beta TDE. Although this signal is unlikely to be detectable for

VNI/BMS provides a controllable test-bed with sufficient complexity to model
jet modification without confounding results with fluctuations from
hydrodynamics and hadronization. Dijets are examined under the modification of:
the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$; the path length of leading and
sub-leading jets; jet cone angle and the jet-medium interaction mechanism. We
find that $A_j$ is very sensitive to the distance traveled by the secondary

First, a coarse-grained model for the histone-DNA free energy landscape that
incorporates both an elastic free energy barrier and specific histone-DNA bonds
is developed. Next, a theoretical expression for the rate of transitions across
a piecewise linear free energy landscape with multiple minima and maxima is
presented. Then, the model free energy landscape, approximated as a piecewise
linear function, and the theoretical expression for the transition rates are
combined to construct a model for the force-dependent unwinding and re-winding
rates of the nucleosome inner turn. Least-mean-squares fitting of the model
rates to the rates observed in recent experiments rates demonstrates that this
model is able to well describe the force-dependent unwinding and rewinding
rates of the nucleosome inner turn, observed in the recent experiments, except
at the highest forces studied, where an additional ad hoc term is required to
describe the data, which may be interpreted as an indication of an alternate
high-force nucleosome disassembly pathway, that bypasses simple unwinding. The
good agreement between the measurements and the model at lower forces
demonstrates that both specific histone-DNA contacts and an elastic free energy
barrier play essential roles for nucleosome winding and unwinding, and
quantifies their relative contributions.

observed in FeSi: the metallization, the lack of conservation of spectral
weight in optical spectroscopy, and the Curie susceptibility. In particular we
find a very good agreement for the anomalous thermoelectric power. Validated by
this congruence with experiment, we further discuss a new physical picture of
the microscopic nature of the insulator-to-metal crossover. Indeed, we find the
suppression of the Seebeck coefficient to be driven by correlation induced
incoherence. Finally, we compare FeSi to its iso-structural and iso-electronic

  We describe the conditions under which the evolutionary history can be

automatically estimates the number of lineages and their ancestry. We sample
from the joint posterior distribution over trees to identify evolutionary

generating the observed SNV frequency data. When multiple phylogenies are
consistent with a given set of SNV frequencies, PhyloSub represents the
uncertainty in the tumor phylogeny using a partial order plot. Experiments on a
simulated dataset and two real datasets comprising tumor samples from acute
myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients demonstrate that
PhyloSub can infer both linear (or chain) and branching lineages and its
inferences are in good agreement with ground truth, where it is available.

computing that requires substantially fewer initial resources than prior
schemes. Our distillation circuit is based on a family of concatenated quantum
codes that possess a transversal Hadamard operation, enabling each of these
codes to distill the eigenstate of the Hadamard operator. A crucial result of
this design is that low-fidelity magic states can be consumed to purify other
high-fidelity magic states to even higher fidelity, which we call ""multilevel
distillation."" When distilling in the asymptotic regime of infidelity $\epsilon
\rightarrow 0$ for each input magic state, the number of input magic states
consumed on average to yield an output state with infidelity
$O(\epsilon^{2^r})$ approaches $2^r+1$, which comes close to saturating the
conjectured bound in [Phys. Rev. A 86, 052329]. We show numerically that there
exist multilevel protocols such that the average number of magic states
consumed to distill from error rate $\epsilon_{\mathrm{in}} = 0.01$ to
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{out}}$ in the range $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-40}$ is about
$14\log_{10}(1/\epsilon_{\mathrm{out}}) - 40$; the efficiency of multilevel
distillation dominates all other reported protocols when distilling Hadamard
magic states from initial infidelity 0.01 to any final infidelity below
$10^{-7}$. These methods are an important advance for magic-state distillation
circuits in high-performance quantum computing, and they provide insight into
the limitations of nearly resource-optimal quantum error correction.

cancellation with a walking behavior, but is crucial to promote the model's

design offers a relatively uniform response over such a range, and reasonably
well-matched responses in E & H planes. However, given the severe Radio
Frequency Interference in several bands over such wide spectral range, one
desires to selectively reject the corresponding bands. With this view, we have
explored the possibilities of having a multi-band feed antenna spanning a wide

the HERMES/GALAH million star survey, promises to vastly expand our
understanding of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy. This,
however, is contingent on our ability to confidently perform chemical tagging
on such a large data-set. Chemical homogeneity has been observed across a range
of elements within several Galactic open clusters, yet the level to which this
is the case globally, and particularly in comparison to the scatter across
clusters themselves, is not well understood. The patterns of elements in coeval
cluster members, occupying a complex chemical abundance space, are rooted in
the evolution, ultimately the nature of the very late stages, of early
generations of stars. The current astrophysical models of such stages are not
yet sufficient to explain all observations, combining with our significant gaps
in the understanding of star formation, makes this a difficult arena to tackle
theoretically. Here, we describe a robust pair-wise metric used to gauge the
chemical difference between two stellar components. This metric is then applied
to a database of high-resolution literature abundance sources to derive a
function describing the probability that two stars are of common evolutionary
origin. With this cluster probability function, it will be possible to report a
confidence, grounded in empirical observational evidence, with which clusters
are detected, independent of the group finding methods. This formulation is
also used to probe the role of chemical dimensionality, and that of individual
chemical species, on the ability of chemical tagging to differentiate coeval
groups of stars.

in the active region (AR) NOAA 11112 in the vicinity of a huge filament system
on 16 October 2010. SDO/HMI magnetograms reveal the emergence of a bipole
(within the existing AR) 50 hours prior to the flare event. During the
emergence, both the positive and negative sunspots in the bipole show
translational as well as rotational motion. The positive polarity sunspot shows
the significant motion/rotation in the south-westward/clockwise direction and
continuously pushing/sliding the surrounding opposite polarity field region. On
the other hand, the negative polarity sunspot moves/rotates in the
westward/anticlockwise direction. The positive polarity sunspot rotates ~70
deg. within 30 hours, whereas negative polarity ~20 deg. within 10 hours.
SDO/AIA 94 {\AA} EUV images show the emergence of a flux tube in the corona
consistent with the emergence of the bipole in HMI. A high speed plasmoid
ejection (speed~1197 km/s) was observed during the flare impulsive phase, which
suggests the magnetic reconnection of the emerged positive polarity sunspot
with the surrounding opposite polarity field region. The entire AR shows the
positive helicity injection before the flare event. Moreover, the newly
emerging bipole reveal the signature of negative (left-handed) helicity. These
observations provide the unique evidences of the emergence of twisted flux tube
from below the photosphere to coronal heights triggering a flare mainly due to
the interaction between the emerged positive polarity sunspot and a nearby
negative polarity sunspot by the shearing motion of the emerging positive
sunspot towards the negative one. Our observations also strongly support the
idea that the rotation is most likely attributed to the emergence of twisted
magnetic fields, as proposed by recent models.

of a faster coronal wave (decelerating from ~1390 to ~830 km/s) propagating
ahead of a slower wave (decelerating from ~416 to ~166 km/s) towards the
western limb. The dynamic radio spectrum from Sagamore Hill radio telescope
shows the presence of metric type II radio burst, which reveals the presence of
a coronal shock wave (speed~800 km/s). The speed of the faster coronal wave
derived from AIA 211 {\AA} images is found to be comparable to the coronal
shock speed. AIA 171 {\AA} high-cadence observations showed that a coronal
loop, which was located at the distance of ~0.32 Rs to the west of the flaring
region, started to oscillate by the end of the impulsive phase of the flare.
The results indicate that the faster coronal wave may be the first driver of
the transversal oscillations of coronal loop. As the slower wave passed through
the coronal loop, the oscillations became even stronger. There was a plasmoid
eruption observed in EUV and a white-light CME was recorded, having velocity of
~340-350 km/s. STEREO 195 {\AA} images show an EIT wave, propagating in the
same direction of the lower-speed coronal wave observed in AIA, but
decelerating from ~320 to ~254 km/s. These observations reveal the co-existence
of both waves (i.e. coronal Moreton and EIT waves), and type II radio burst
seems to be associated with the coronal Moreton wave.

  --Vacuum/Pseudo-vacuum Representations--",,,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Thinking back the long history of physics, we see that the calculation used
by physicists was nothing but the ordinary calculus. Another word, physicists
have never wrote theories beyond the basic axioms of the calculus. This is not
to declare of the victory of calculus or algebraic topology. On the contrary,
we are thinking that every theory of mathematical physics must suggest new
frontier of ordinary calculus, which are never viewed by classical geometers.
  Weyl algebras or Heisenberg algebras are naturally involved in slightly
extended systems of the algebra of ordinary calculus, and are supported by the
classical notion of phase spaces on which the general mechanics are based. The
theory of deformation quantizations gives a notion of quantization of ""phase
space"". To explain its essence in brief we proposed in the previous note the
notion of $\mu$-regulated algebra.
  In this series, we have introduced elements, called ""vacuums"" to consider the
state vectors and the configuration spaces within the world of extended algebra
of calculus with various expressions. We have found several strange elements,
called polar elements, and an extended notions of vacuums, which were called
pseudo-vacuums in our paper. These are not established notions in mathematical
physics, but we are thinking that these must propose new frontier for
mathematical physics. We are thinking that vacuums and pseudo-vacuums are not
unique, but the function algebra of the configuration spaces must be an algebra
similar to the Frobenius algebra defined by vacuums.
  The point in this note is that to obtain classical pictures one has often to
restrict the expression parameters, and there are two essentially different
expression parameters.

our survey is flux limited and thus biased against fainter objects, the
pseudo-absolute magnitude distribution (pAMD) of SNeIa in a given volume is an
important concern, especially the relative frequency of high to low-luminosity
SNeIa. We find that the pAMD derived from the volume limited Lick Observatory
Supernova Search (LOSS) sample is incompatible with the distribution of SNeIa
in a volume limited (z<0.12) sub sample of the SDSS-II. The LOSS sample
requires far more low-luminosity SNeIa than the SDSS-II can accommodate. Even
though LOSS and SDSS-II have sampled different SNeIa populations, their
volumetric rates are surprisingly similar. Using the same model pAMD adopted in
the SDSS-II SNeIa rate calculation and excluding two high-luminosity SNeIa from
our sample, we derive a rate that is marginally higher than previous
low-redshift determinations. With our full sample and the LOSS pAMD our rate is
more than double the canonical value. We also find that 5 of our 18 SNeIa are
hosted by very low-luminosity (M_B > -16) galaxies, whereas only 1 out 79
nearby SDSS-II SNeIa have such faint hosts. It is possible that previous works
have under-counted either low luminosity SNeIa, SNeIa in low luminosity hosts,
or peculiar SNeIa (sometimes explicitly), and the total SNeIa rate may be
higher than the canonical value.

geometry of Teichm\""uller space after S. Kerckhoff, F. Gardiner and H. Masur.
There is a natural compactification using extremal length geometry introduced
by Gardiner and Masur. The compactification is realized in a certain projective
space. We develop the extremal length geometry in the cone which is defined as
the inverse image of the compactification via the quotient mapping. The
compactification is identified with a subset of the cone by taking an
appropriate lift. The cone contains canonically the space of measured
foliations in the boundary.
  We first extend the geometric intersection number on the space of measured
foliations to the cone, and observe that the restriction of the intersection
number to Teichm\""uller space is represented explicitly by the formula in terms
of the Gromov product with respect to the Teichm\""uller distance. From this
observation, we deduce that the Gromov product extends continuously to the
compactification.
  As an application, we obtain an alternative approach to
Earle-Ivanov-Kra-Markovic-Royden's characterization of isometries. Namely, with
some few exceptions, the isometry group of Teichm\""uller space with respect to
the Teichm\""uller distance is canonically isomorphic to the extended mapping
class group. We also obtain a new realization of Teichm\""uller space, a

avoiding the interference with the users. By applying FLS (Fuzzy Logic System),
the available spectrum utilization is effectively utilized with the help of the
three antecedents namely Spectrum utilization efficiency, Degree of mobility,

anomalies taking place in an environment of interest. From a set of predefined
regions in the environment, a team of autonomous vehicles collects noisy
observations, which a control center processes. The overall objective is to
minimize detection delay while maintaining the false alarm rate below a desired
threshold. We present joint (i) anomaly detection algorithms for the control
center and (ii) vehicle routing policies. For the control center, we propose
parallel cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithms (one for each region) to detect
anomalies from noisy observations. For the vehicles, we propose a stochastic
routing policy, in which the regions to be visited are chosen according to a
probability vector. We study stationary routing policy (the probability vector
is constant) as well as adaptive routing policies (the probability vector
varies in time as a function of the likelihood of regional anomalies). In the
context of stationary policies, we design a performance metric and minimize it
to design an efficient stationary routing policy. Our adaptive policy improves
upon the stationary counterpart by adaptively increasing the selection
probability of regions with high likelihood of anomaly. Finally, we show the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical simulations and a
persistent surveillance experiment.

combinations of entangled information about the production, decay rates and
total decay width of the new boson. In addition, some decay channels show
non-negligible deviation from the SM expectation, such as the $2\sigma$ excess
in the diphoton channel. In the four types (I, II, X and Y) of two Higgs
doublet models, we perform the global $\chi^2$ fit in three scenarios: (i) the
new boson is the light CP-even Higgs boson $h^0$; (ii) it is the heavy CP-even
Higgs boson $H^0$; (iii) the signals are from degenerate $h^0$ and the
pseudoscalar $A^0$. Considering other phenomenological constraints such as
flavor physics, electroweak precision data, and the LEP search for the Higgs

actually provide better or similarly good fit to the data than the SM. All the

performance loss. The block orthogonal property of the codes constructed was
however only shown via simulations. In this paper, we give analytical proofs

Simulation results of the decoding complexity show a 30% reduction in the

at a low anti-neutrino luminosity of $10^{51}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the late stage
of a NDW, the mass of product and nucleosynthesis are changed significantly in
the strong MFs, they are less important than those in the early stage when the

important regulatory roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation by
inhibiting the translation of the mRNA into proteins or otherwise cleaving the
target mRNA. Inferring miRNA targets provides useful information for
understanding the roles of miRNA in biological processes that are potentially
involved in complex diseases. Statistical methodologies for point estimation,
such as the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm,
have been proposed to identify the interactions of miRNA and mRNA based on
sequence and expression data. In this paper, we propose using the Bayesian
LASSO (BLASSO) and the non-negative Bayesian LASSO (nBLASSO) to analyse the
interactions between miRNA and mRNA using expression data. The proposed
Bayesian methods explore the posterior distributions for those parameters
required to model the miRNA-mRNA interactions. These approaches can be used to
observe the inferred effects of the miRNAs on the targets by plotting the
posterior distributions of those parameters. For comparison purposes, the Least
Squares Regression (LSR), Ridge Regression (RR), LASSO, non-negative LASSO
(nLASSO), and the proposed Bayesian approaches were applied to four public
datasets. We concluded that nLASSO and nBLASSO perform best in terms of
sensitivity and specificity. Compared to the point estimate algorithms, which
only provide single estimates for those parameters, the Bayesian methods are
more meaningful and provide credible intervals, which take into account the
uncertainty of the inferred interactions of the miRNA and mRNA. Furthermore,
Bayesian methods naturally provide statistical significance to select
convincing inferred interactions, while point estimate algorithms require a
manually chosen threshold, which is less meaningful, to choose the possible
interactions.

local covariance. Our analysis is a preparatory step towards a full-fledged
quantization scheme for the Maxwell field, which emphasises the affine bundle
structure of the bundle of principal U(1)-connections. As a by-product, our
construction provides a new class of exactly tractable locally covariant
quantum field theories, which are a mild generalization of the linear ones. We
also show the existence of a functorial assignment of linear quantum field
theories to affine ones. The identification of suitable algebra homomorphisms
enables us to induce whole families of physical states (satisfying the
microlocal spectrum condition) for affine quantum field theories by pulling
back quasi-free Hadamard states of the underlying linear theories.

in the fact that the sampling statistics of observations and experiments is
generically biased by the size of the basins of attraction of the processes to
be studied. One has hence to precisely define what one means with statements
like `the brain is critical'.
  We recapitulate the notion of criticality, as originally introduced in
statistical physics for second order phase transitions, turning then to the
discussion of critical dynamical systems. We elucidate in detail the difference
between a 'critical system', viz a system on the verge of a phase transition,
and a 'critical state', viz state with scale-invariant correlations, stressing
the fact that the notion of universality is linked to critical states.
  We then discuss rigorous results for two classes of critical dynamical
systems, the Kauffman net and a vertex routing model, which both have
non-critical states. However, an external observer that samples randomly the
phase space of these two critical models, would find scale invariance. We
denote this phenomenon as 'observational criticality' and discuss its relevance

networks is an important and challenging problem. Sensitivity values are
important in the analysis, modeling and design of chemical networks. They help
in understanding the robustness properties of the system and also in
identifying the key reactions for a given outcome. In a discrete setting, most
of the methods that exist in the literature for the estimation of parameter
sensitivities rely on Monte Carlo simulations along with finite difference
computations. However these methods introduce a bias in the sensitivity
estimate and in most cases the size or direction of the bias remains unknown,
potentially damaging the accuracy of the analysis. In this paper, we use the
random time change representation of Kurtz to derive an exact formula for
parameter sensitivity. This formula allows us to construct an unbiased
estimator for parameter sensitivity, which can be efficiently evaluated using a
suitably devised Monte Carlo scheme. The existing literature contains only one
method to produce such an unbiased estimator. This method was proposed by
Plyasunov and Arkin and it is based on the Girsanov measure transformation. By
taking a couple of examples we compare our method to this existing method. Our
results indicate that our method can be much faster than the existing method
while computing sensitivity with respect to a reaction rate constant which is
small in magnitude. This rate constant could correspond to a reaction which is
slow in the reference time-scale of the system. Since many biological systems
have such slow reactions, our method can be a useful tool for sensitivity
analysis.

a careful analysis of the systematics involved are necessary. Working towards
this goal, we present preliminary lattice results of the ALPHA collaboration
for the $B\to \pi$ form factor $f_+(q^2)$ with $N_{\rm f}=2$ flavours of
$O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions. Our computation uses HQET in the static limit,
pion masses ranging down to $\sim250$ MeV, large volumes with $m_\pi L >4$,
three lattice spacings, and non-perturbative renormalization. We describe the
techniques adopted to reduce the statistical noise (stochastic all-to-all with
full time dilution) and the contamination from excited states (smearing for the
B and the pion). We estimate the size of the chiral and continuum
extrapolations. We discuss the impact our result could have to clarify the
above mentioned discrepancy in the determination of $|V_{\rm ub}|$.

effect in systems of magnetic particles interacting via dipolar interactions.
The ratchet effect consists of directed rotations of the particles in an
oscillating magnetic field, which lacks a net rotating component. Our
investigations are based on Brownian dynamics simulations of such many-particle
systems. We investigate the influence of both, the random and deterministic
contributions to the equations of motion on the ratchet effect. As a main
result, we show that dipolar interactions can have an enhancing as well as a
dampening effect on the ratchet behavior depending on the dipolar coupling
strength of the system under consideration. The enhancement is shown to be
caused by an increase in the effective field on a particle generated by
neighboring magnetic particles, while the dampening is due to restricted
rotational motion in the effective field. Moreover, we find a non-trivial
influence of the short-range, repulsive interaction between the particles.

separation varies in the range of 10 arcsec - 35 arcsec, corresponding to
500-1700 yr. Local density variations within one arc are visible. The
shell/intershell density contrast is typically 4, and the arcs contain some 50%
more dust mass than the smooth envelope. The observed (nested) arcs record the
mass-loss history over the past 16 000 yr, but Rayleigh-Taylor and

Large Telescope during the object's recent favourable apparition in 2011-12.
During the earlier 2008 apparition, a spectrum of the object in the 6000-9000
Angstrom region was obtained with the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope.
Interpretation of the observational results was aided by numerical simulations
of 1000 dynamical clones of 2000 FJ10 up to 10^6 yr in the past and in the
future. The asteroid's spectrum and colours determined by our observations
suggest a taxonomic classification within the S-complex although other
classifications (V, D, E, M, P) cannot be ruled out. On this evidence, it is
unlikely to be a primitive, relatively unaltered remnant from the early history
of the solar system and thus a low priority target for robotic sample return.
Our photometry placed a lower bound of 2 hrs to the asteroid's rotation period.
Its absolute magnitude was estimated to be 21.54+-0.1 which, for a typical
S-complex albedo, translates into a diameter of 130+-20 m. Our dynamical
simulations show that it has likely been an Amor for the past 10^5 yr. Although
currently not Earth-crossing, it will likely become so during the period 50 -
100 kyr in the future. It may have arrived from the inner or central Main Belt
> 1 Myr ago as a former member of a low-inclination S-class asteroid family.
Its relatively slow rotation and large size make it a suitable destination for
a human mission. We show that ballistic Earth-190491-Earth transfer
trajectories with Delta-V < 2 km s^-1 at the asteroid exist between 2052 and

main ISM physical parameters, including the [CII] optical depth, at
unprecedented spatial resolution (~300 pc). We can clearly kinematically
separate the disk from the outflow in all lines. The [CII] and [OI]
distributions are consistent with PDR emission both in the disk and in the
outflow. Surprisingly, in the outflow, the atomic and the ionized gas traced by
the [OIII] line both have a deprojected velocity of ~75 km/s, very similar to
the average velocity of the outflowing cold molecular gas (~ 100 km/s) and
several times smaller than the outflowing material detected in Halpha (~ 600
km/s). This suggests that the cold molecular and neutral atomic gas and the
ionized gas traced by the [OIII] 88 micron line are dynamically coupled to each
other but decoupled from the Halpha emitting gas. We propose a scenario where
cold clouds from the disk are entrained into the outflow by the winds where
they likely evaporate, surviving as small, fairly dense cloudlets (n_H\sim
500-1000 cm^-3, G_0\sim 500- 1000, T_gas\sim300 K). We show that the UV photons
provided by the starburst are sufficient to excite the PDR shells around the
molecular cores. The mass of the neutral atomic gas in the outflow is \gtrsim
5-12x 10^7 M_sun to be compared with that of the molecular gas (3.3 x 10^8
M_sun) and of the Halpha emitting gas (5.8 x 10^6 M_sun). The mass loading
factor, (dM/dt)/SFR, of the molecular plus neutral atomic gas in the outflow is

configuration to guide the positrons onto the sample. The achieved spot size is
$d_{\mathrm{FWHM}}=5.4\,$mm, with a high efficiency over the whole energy

the description of spallation reactions is presented in detail. Compared to the
standard version (INCL4.2), it incorporates several new features, the most
important of which are: (i) the inclusion of cluster production through a
dynamical phase space coalescence model, (ii) the Coulomb deflection for
entering and outgoing charged particles, (iii) the improvement of the treatment
of Pauli blocking and of soft collisions, (iv) the introduction of experimental
threshold values for the emission of particles, (v) the improvement of pion
dynamics, (vi) a detailed procedure for the treatment of light-cluster induced
reactions taking care of the effects of binding energy of the nucleons inside
the incident cluster and of the possible fusion reaction at low energy.
Performances of the new model concerning nucleon-induced reactions are
illustrated. Whenever necessary, the INCL4.6 model is coupled to the ABLA07
deexcitation model and the respective merits of the two models are then
tentatively disentangled. Good agreement is generally obtained in the 200 MeV-2
GeV range. Below 200 MeV and down to a few tens of MeV, the total reaction
cross section is well reproduced and differential cross sections are reasonably
well described. The model is also tested for light-ion induced reactions at low
energy, below 100 MeV incident energy per nucleon. Beyond presenting the update
of the INCL4.2 model, attention has been paid to applications of the new model
to three topics for which some particular aspects are discussed for the first
time: production of clusters heavier than alpha particles, longitudinal residue
recoil velocity and its fluctuations, total reaction cross section and the
residue production cross sections for low energy incident light ions.

instruments of about an order of magnitude. Monte Carlo simulations are a
crucial tool in the design of CTA. The ultimate goal of these simulations is to
find the most cost-effective solution for given physics goals and thus
sensitivity goals or to find, for a given cost, the solution best suited for
different types of targets with CTA. Apart from uncertain component cost
estimates, the main problem in this procedure is the dependence on a huge
number of configuration parameters, both in specifications of individual
telescope types and in the array layout. This is addressed by simulation of a
huge array intended as a superset of many different realistic array layouts,
and also by simulation of array subsets for different telescope parameters.
Different analysis methods -- in use with current installations and extended

time dependent numerical simulation where both the hydrodynamics and the
radiative transfer processes are coupled together. We consider a two-component
accretion flow in which the Keplerian disk is immersed into an accreting
low-angular momentum flow (halo) around a black hole. The soft photons which
originate from the Keplerian disk are inverse-Comptonized by the electrons in
the halo and the region between the centrifugal pressure supported shocks and
the horizon. We run several cases by changing the rate of the Keplerian disk
and see the effects on the shock location and properties of the outflow and the
spectrum. We show that as a result of Comptonization of the Compton cloud, the
cloud becomes cooler with the increase in the Keplerian disk rate. As the
resultant thermal pressure is reduced, the post-shock region collapses and the
outflow rate is also reduced. Since the hard radiation is produced from the
post-shock region, and the spectral slope increases with the reduction of the
electron temperature, the cooling produces softer spectrum. We thus find a
direct correlation between the spectral states and the outflow rates of an
accreting black hole.

automorphic scattering in [U].
  Combining this with a result from [U], we can show that an Dirichlet

can be proven for GNS models since the same technique of proof for standard

all suffer from either stringent lithographic demands that prevent

issues. Using angle resolved photoemission, we have discovered a unique one
dimensional metallic-semiconducting-metallic junction made entirely from
graphene, and produced without chemical functionalization or finite size
patterning. The junction is produced by taking advantage of the inherent,
atomically ordered, substrate-graphene interaction when it is grown on SiC, in
this case when graphene is forced to grow over patterned SiC steps. This
scalable bottomup approach allows us to produce a semiconducting graphene strip
whose width is precisely defined within a few graphene lattice constants, a
level of precision entirely outside modern lithographic limits. The
architecture demonstrated in this work is so robust that variations in the
average electronic band structure of thousands of these patterned ribbons have
little variation over length scales tens of microns long. The semiconducting
graphene has a topologically defined few nanometer wide region with an energy
gap greater than 0.5 eV in an otherwise continuous metallic graphene sheet.
This work demonstrates how the graphene-substrate interaction can be used as a
powerful tool to scalably modify graphene's electronic structure and opens a

(AGN) on non-thermal components of the intracluster medium (ICM). We have
modelled feedback from AGN in cosmological simulations with the adaptive mesh
refinement code ENZO, investigating three types of feedback that are sometimes
called quasar, jet and radio mode. Using a small set of galaxy clusters
simulated at high resolution, we model the injection and evolution of Cosmic
Rays, as well as their effects on the thermal plasma. By comparing, both, the
profiles of thermal gas to observed profiles from the ACCEPT sample, and the
secondary gamma-ray emission to the available upper limits from FERMI, we
discuss how the combined analysis of these two observables can constrain the
energetics and mechanisms of feedback models in clusters. Those modes of AGN
feedback that provide a good match to X-ray observations, yield a gamma-ray
luminosity resulting from secondary cosmic rays that is about below the
available upper limits from FERMI. Moreover, we investigate the injection of
turbulent motions into the ICM from AGN, and the detectability of these motions
via the analysis of line broadening of the Fe XXIII line. In the near future,
deeper observations/upper-limits of non-thermal emissions from galaxy clusters
will yield stringent constraints on the energetics and modes of AGN feedback,
even at early cosmic epochs.

defect nucleation from the surfaces of surface-dominated nanostructure such as
FCC metal nanowires. The approach leads to a criteria that predicts the initial
yield mechanism via either slip or twinning depending on whether the unstable
twinning energy or unstable slip energy is smaller as determined from the
resulting SSF energy curve. The approach is validated through a comparison
between the SSF energy calculation and low-temperature classical molecular
dynamics simulations of copper nanowires with different axial and transverse
surface orientations, and cross sectional geometries. We focus on the effects
of the geometric cross section by studying the transition from slip to twinning
previously predicted in moving from a square to rectangular cross section for
$\ <100\ > /\{100\}$ nanowires, and also for moving from a rhombic to truncated
rhombic cross sectional geometry for $\ <110\ >$ nanowires. \hsp{We also
provide the important demonstration that the criteria is able to predict the
correct deformation mechanism when full dislocation slip is considered
concurrently with partial dislocation slip and twinning. This is done in the
context of rhombic aluminum nanowires which do not show a tensile reorientation
due to full dislocation slip.} We show that the SSF energy criteria
successfully predicts the initial mode of surface-nucleated plasticity at low

one main and k-1 minor strategies. The main strategy describes what happens
when all agents comply, whereas the minor strategies ensure that all other
agents immediately start to co-operate against the agent who first deviates
from the plan. This simplicity is important, as rational agents are an
idealisation. Realistically, agents have to decide on their moves with very
limited resources, and complicated strategies that require exponential--or even

existence of simple strategies that we prove in this paper therefore holds a

reduce detector noise in calibrated images (by subtracting dark-current). Since
accurate measurements of detector dark-current require large telescope

Our goal is to identify properties that enable robust learning of a motor
skill. We measure brain activity during motor sequencing and characterize
network properties based on coherent activity between brain regions. Using
recently developed algorithms to detect time-evolving communities, we find that
the complex reconfiguration patterns of the brain's putative functional modules
that control learning can be described parsimoniously by the combined presence
of a relatively stiff temporal core that is composed primarily of sensorimotor
and visual regions whose connectivity changes little in time and a flexible
temporal periphery that is composed primarily of multimodal association regions
whose connectivity changes frequently. The separation between temporal core and
periphery changes over the course of training and, importantly, is a good
predictor of individual differences in learning success. The core of
dynamically stiff regions exhibits dense connectivity, which is consistent with
notions of core-periphery organization established previously in social
networks. Our results demonstrate that core-periphery organization provides an
insightful way to understand how putative functional modules are linked. This,
in turn, enables the prediction of fundamental human capacities, including the
production of complex goal-directed behavior.

which appears as an axle penetrating the disk, i.e. the jet is a Beltrami flow.
Based on the Beltrami flow model, an analytical expression of a disk-jet system
has been constructed by the method of similarity solution.

framework of irreversible thermodynamics of open systems with matter
creation/annihilation. We consider dark energy and dark matter as an
interacting two component (scalar field and ""ordinary"" dark matter)
cosmological fluid in a homogeneous spatially flat and isotropic
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe. The thermodynamics of open systems
as applied together with the gravitational field equations to the two component
cosmological fluid leads to a generalization of the elementary dark energy-dark
mater interaction theory, in which the decay (creation) pressures are
explicitly considered as parts of the cosmological fluid stress-energy tensor.
Specific models describing coherently oscillating scalar waves, leading to a
high particle production at the beginning of the oscillatory period, and models
with a constant potential energy scalar field are considered. Furthermore,
exact and numerical solutions of the gravitational field equations with dark
energy-dark matter interaction are also obtained.

optomechanics and provides an overview of some of its recent developments and
current areas of focus. It first outlines the basic theory of cavity
optomechanical cooling and gives a brief status report of the experimental
state-of-the-art. It then turns to the deep quantum regime of operation of
optomechanical oscillators and cover selected aspects of quantum state
preparation, control and characterization, including mechanical squeezing and
pulsed optomechanics. This is followed by a discussion of the ""bottom-up""
approach that exploits ultracold atomic samples instead of nanoscale systems.
It concludes with an outlook that concentrates largely on the functionalization
of quantum optomechanical systems and their promise in metrology applications.

Problems into a problem of deciding feasibility of a given system S of linear

solution. We show separate polynomial-time conversions to S, from the
SUBSET-SUM and 3-SAT problems, both of which are NP-Complete. The number of
equations and variables in S is bounded by a polynomial function of the size of
the NP-Complete problem, showing that deciding the feasibility of S is
strongly-NP-Complete. We also show how to apply the approach used for the
SUBSET-SUM problem to decide the feasibility of Integer Linear Programs, as it
involves reducing the coefficient-magnitudes of variables to the logarithm of
their initial values, though the number of variables and equations are
increased.

polyhedra(algebraic polytopes) was defined. These polytopes were determined by
the second coordination sphere of 8-dimensional lattice E8. The ordered
non-crystalline structure is determined by a chain of constructions of
algebraic topology: an algebraic polytope, a homogeneous manifold in a
3-dimensional Euclidean space E3, locally-homogeneous manifold, locally minimal
surface, one-parameter family of helicoids, bundle (cover) with a base of cell
complexes, local-lattice packing of cell complexes into a substructure of E3,
determined by helicoids. The formalism being developed allows one to surmount
restrictions of classical crystallography and to single out a class of ordered
non-crystalline structures, invariant with respect to structures determined by
the lattice E8. The topological stability of such substructures is determined
by their relatedness to Weierstrass' representation, as well as the condition
that the instability index of the surface equals zero. Formation of such
structures corresponds to lifting a configuration degeneracy, and the stability
of a state - to existence of a point of bifurcation.
