theoretically and experimentally at low bacterial concentrations. Considering
the swimmer-tracer hydrodynamic interactions at low-Reynolds number and using a
kinetic theory approach, it is shown that the induced diffusion coefficient is
proportional to the swimmer concentration, their mean velocity and a
coefficient $\beta$, as observed experimentally. The coefficient $\beta$ scales
as the tracer-swimmer cross section times the mean square displacement produced
by single scatterings. The displacements depend on the swimmer propulsion
forces. Considering simple swimmer models (acting on the fluid as two monopoles
or as a force dipole) it is shown that $\beta$ increases for decreasing
swimming efficiencies. Close to solid surfaces the swimming efficiency degrades
and, consequently, the induced diffusion increase. Experiments on W wild-type
{\em Escherichia coli} in a Hele-Shaw cell under buoyant conditions are
performed to measure the induced diffusion on tracers near surfaces. The
modification of the suspension pH vary the swimmers' velocity in a wide range
allowing to extract the $\beta$ coefficient with precision. It is found that
the solid surfaces modify the induced diffusion: decreasing the confinement
height of the cell, $\beta$ increases by a factor 4. The theoretical model
reproduces this increase although there are quantitative differences, probably
attributed to the simplicity of the swimmer models.

disks of differing densities are systematically examined. Gravitational
darkening is the decrease of the effective temperature near the equator and the
corresponding increase near the poles of a star caused by rapid rotation. We
also include the rotational distortion of the star using the Roche Model.
Increasing the disk density increases the optical depths in the equatorial
plane, resulting in the formation of an inner cool region near the equatorial
plane of the disk. High rotation rates result in disks that have temperatures
similar to those of a denser disk, namely cooler overall. However the effect of
increasing rotation produces additional heating in the upper disk due to the
hotter stellar pole. Cool regions in the equatorial plane normally associated
with high density are seen in low density models at high rotation rates.
Gravitational darkening increases the amount of very cool and very hot material
in the disk and decreases the amount of disk material at moderate temperatures.
We also present models which study the effect of gravitational darkening on
hydrostatically-converged disks, in which the temperature structure is
consistent with vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. Because the equatorial
regions become cooler, hydrostatically converged models that include gravity
darkening have smaller vertical scale heights, and $H/R$ is smaller by as much
as 56% near $v_{\rm crit}$. Finally we explore differences in disk temperatures
when alternate formulations of gravitational darkening, which lower the
temperature difference between the pole and the equator, are used.

simply disappear in the system's walls, instead of massively occupying the
cavity ground mode. In the here described approach, this obstacle is overcome
by a fluorescence-induced thermalization mechanism in a dye-filled microcavity.
Experimentally, both the thermalization of the photon gas and, at high photon

remains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connect
observations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scale
structure formation. The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off
rather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models
have tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts
substantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically
occurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient
turbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the
net effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to
locally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less
likely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but
supernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone
cannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback
would accurately predict star formation rates. Star formation rate surface
density correlates well with observed molecular gas surface density, as well as
with other tracers of high density material. Correlation does not, however,
imply causation. It appears that both molecule formation and star formation

in cooling. The basic concept that gravitational instability drives star
formation remains a true guide through the thickets of complexity surrounding
this topic. I finally briefly note that understanding ionization heating and
radiation pressure from the most massive stars will likely require much higher
resolution models (sub-parsec scale) than resolving supernova feedback.

attention in a wide class of continuous parametric estimation problems with
promising results. It has been a subject of research for more than a decade.
Due to the nature of LASSO, the previous analyses have been non-parametric.
This ignores useful information and makes it difficult to compare LASSO to
traditional estimators. In particular, the role of the regularization parameter
and super-resolution properties of LASSO have not been well-understood yet. The
objective of this work is to provide a new insight into this context by
introducing LASSO as a parametric technique of a varying order. This provides
us theoretical expressions for the LASSO-based estimation error and false alarm
rate in the asymptotic case of high SNR and dense grids. For this case, LASSO
is compared to maximum likelihood and conventional beamforming. It is found
that LASSO loses performance due to the regularization term, but the amount of
loss is practically negligible with a proper choice of the regularization
parameter. Thus, we provide suggestions on the selection of the regularization
parameter. Without loss of generality, we present the comparative numerical
results in the context of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation using a sensor
array.

hybridized O 2p and Rh 4d band gap states leading to a red shift of the optical
absorption edge, consistent with previous experimental studies. Since Rh
mono-doping may induce recombination centers, charge-compensated codoping with
Rh and Nb is also explored. This codoping induces an electron transfer from Nb
induced states to Rh 4d states which suppresses the formation of Rh4+, thereby
leading to a reduction in recombination centers and to the formation of more

of band gap states that account for recombination centers makes (Rh,Nb)-
codoped TiO2 a more efficient and stable photocatalyst.

`adequality' with which Fermat approached the problems of the calculus, as well
as its source in the parisotes of Diophantus, and propose a novel reading
thereof. Adequality is a crucial step in Fermat's method of finding maxima,
minima, tangents, and solving other problems that a modern mathematician would
solve using infinitesimal calculus. The method is presented in a series of
short articles in Fermat's collected works. We show that at least some of the
manifestations of adequality amount to variational techniques exploiting a
small, or infinitesimal, variation e. Fermat's treatment of geometric and
physical applications suggests that an aspect of approximation is inherent in
adequality, as well as an aspect of smallness on the part of e. We question the
relevance to understanding Fermat of 19th century dictionary definitions of
parisotes and adaequare, cited by Breger, and take issue with his
interpretation of adequality, including his novel reading of Diophantus, and
his hypothesis concerning alleged tampering with Fermat's texts by Carcavy. We
argue that Fermat relied on Bachet's reading of Diophantus. Diophantus coined
the term parisotes for mathematical purposes and used it to refer to the way in
which 1321/711 is approximately equal to 11/6. Bachet performed a semantic
calque in passing from parisoo to adaequo. We note the similar role of,
respectively, adequality and the Transcendental Law of Homogeneity in the work

During this collapse, weak magnetic seed fields get amplified exponentially by
the small-scale dynamo - a process converting kinetic energy from turbulence
into magnetic energy. We use the Kazantsev theory, which describes the
small-scale dynamo analytically, to study magnetic field amplification for
different turbulent velocity correlation functions. For incompressible
turbulence (Kolmogorov turbulence), we find that the growth rate is
proportional to the square root of the hydrodynamic Reynolds number, Re^(1/2).
In the case of highly compressible turbulence (Burgers turbulence) the growth
rate increases proportional to Re^(1/3). With a detailed chemical network we
are able to follow the chemical evolution and determine the kinetic and
magnetic viscosities (due to Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion) during the collapse
of the halo. This way, we can calculate the growth rate of the small-scale
dynamo quantitatively and predict the evolution of the small-scale magnetic
field. As the magnetic energy is transported to larger scales on the local
eddy-timescale, we obtain an estimate for the magnetic field on the Jeans
scale. Even there, we find that equipartition with the kinetic energy is
reached on small timescales. Dynamically relevant field structures can thus be
expected already during the formation of the first objects in the Universe.

structures other than the ""left-left"" form of the Standard Model. To carry out
the chiral-continuum extrapolation of results from numerical simulations, one
needs to know the quark mass and lattice spacing dependence of the
corresponding B-parameters in the partially quenched theory at least at
next-to-leading order. For simulations using staggered fermions (such as that
we are doing with HYP-smeared valence fermions on the MILC asqtad lattices) one
must determine this dependence using staggered chiral perturbation theory
(SChPT). We have calculated the required dependence in both SU(3) and SU(2)
SChPT, working at next-to-leading order, and we give here an overview of the
methodology and results. The SU(3) SChPT result turns out to be much simpler
than that for the Standard Model B_K operator, due to the absence of chiral
suppression for the new operators. The SU(2) SChPT result turns out to be
closely related to that for B_K: the chiral logarithms are identical, up to an
operator-dependent sign. Our results are also useful for fermions with chiral
symmetry as they provide, in the continuum limit, the partially quenched
generalization of existing continuum results.

asks a server to store a large file. One issue is whether the user can verify
that the server is actually storing the file, and typically a
challenge-response protocol is employed to convince the user that the file is
indeed being stored correctly. The security of these schemes is phrased in
terms of an extractor which will recover or retrieve the file given any
""proving algorithm"" that has a sufficiently high success probability.
  This paper treats proof-of-retrievability schemes in the model of
unconditional security, where an adversary has unlimited computational power.
In this case retrievability of the file can be modelled as error-correction in
a certain code. We provide a general analytical framework for such schemes that
yields exact (non-asymptotic) reductions that precisely quantify conditions for
extraction to succeed as a function of the success probability of a proving
algorithm, and we apply this analysis to several archetypal schemes. In
addition, we provide a new methodology for the analysis of keyed POR schemes in
an unconditionally secure setting, and use it to prove the security of a
modified version of a scheme due to Shacham and Waters under a slightly
restricted attack model, thus providing the first example of a keyed POR scheme
with unconditional security. We also show how classical statistical techniques
can be used to evaluate whether the responses of the prover are accurate enough
to permit successful extraction. Finally, we prove a new lower bound on storage
and communication complexity of POR schemes.

the presence of stochastic torques, modeling the expected perturbations of
turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). We examine
perturbation amplitudes relevant to dead zones in the midplane (conducive to
planet formation in single stars), and find that planetesimal accretion can be
inhibited even in the outer disk (4-10 AU) far from the central binary, a
location previously thought to be a plausible starting point for the formation
of circumbinary planets.

us to rearrange the jet shower into effective emitters. We observe that in the
kinematic regime of the LHC, the corresponding characteristic angle is
comparable to the typical opening angle of high energy jets such that most of
the jet energy is contained within a non-resolvable color coherent inner core.
Thus, a sizable fraction of the jets are unresolved, losing energy as a single

provides a consistent understanding of the present data on reconstructed jet
observables and constitute the basis for future developments.

distributions has attracted much attention, especially in the modeling of data
packet traffic in communication networks. In particular, it is well known that
under suitable assumptions on the source arrival rate, the centered and scaled
cumulative workload process for the underlying processing system can be
approximated by fractional Brownian motion. In many applications one is
interested in the stabilization of the work inflow to the system by modifying
the net input rate, using an appropriate admission control policy. In this work
we study a natural family of admission control policies which keep the
associated scaled cumulative workload asymptotically close to a pre-specified
linear trajectory, uniformly over time. Under such admission control policies
and with natural assumptions on arrival distributions, suitably scaled and
centered cumulative workload processes are shown to converge weakly in the path
space to the solution of a $d$-dimensional stochastic differential equation
(SDE) driven by a Gaussian process. It is shown that the admission control
policy achieves moment stabilization in that the second moment of the solution
to the SDE (averaged over the $d$-stations) is bounded uniformly for all times.
In one special case of control policies, as time approaches infinity, we obtain
a fractional version of a stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that is driven
by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H>1/2$.

and stellar mass-to-light ratio of the globular cluster NGC 2419 to examine the
possibility that this Galactic halo satellite is embedded in a low-mass dark
matter halo. NGC 2419 is a promising target for such a study, since its extreme
Galactocentric distance and large mass would have greatly facilitated the
retention of dark matter. A Markov-Chain Monte Carlo approach is used to
investigate composite dynamical models containing a stellar and a dark matter
component. We find that it is unlikely that a significant amount of dark matter
(less than approx. 6% of the luminous mass inside the tidal limit of the
cluster) can be present if the stars follow an anisotropic Michie model and the
dark matter a double power law model. However, we find that more general
models, derived using a new technique we have developed to compute
non-parametric solutions to the spherical Jeans equation, suggest the presence
of a significant dark matter fraction (approximately twice the stellar mass).
Thus the presence of a dark matter halo around NGC 2419 cannot be fully ruled
out at present, yet any dark matter within the 10 arcmin visible extent of the
cluster must be highly concentrated and cannot exceed 1.1x10^6 Solar masses
(99% confidence), in stark contrast to expectations for a plausible progenitor
halo of this structure.

Our model distinguishes ejecta from the interstellar medium (ISM), and tracks
the ionization age of shocked ejecta, both of which allow for additional
analysis of the simulated remnants. We also include the adiabatic index as a
free parameter, which affects the compressibility of the fluid and emulates the
efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration by shock fronts. In addition to
generating 3-D images of the simulations, we compute line-of-sight projections
through the remnants for comparison against observations of Tycho's SNR and SN
1006. We find that several features observed in these two remnants, such as the
separation between the fluid discontinuities and the presence of ejecta knots
ahead of the forward shock, can be generated by smooth ejecta without any
initial clumpiness. Our results are consistent with SN 1006 being dynamically
younger than Tycho's SNR, and more efficiently accelerating cosmic rays at its

non-detection of a pressure broadened Na feature, we can rule out the presence
of a Na rich atmosphere free of clouds or hazes, although we cannot rule out a

MeV photons in the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the

secondary electron-positron pairs produced by high energy protons interacting
with gamma-rays inside of the GRB jet. We consider both photo-pion and
Bethe-Heitler pair production processes to create secondary electrons and
positrons that then radiate via inverse Compton and synchrotron processes. We
also consider synchrotron radiation from the protons themselves. We calculate
the necessary energy in protons to produce typical Fermi-LAT fluxes of a few
microJy at 100 MeV. For both of the photo-pion and Bethe-Heitler processes, we
find that the required energy in protons is larger than the observed gamma-ray
energy by a factor of a thousand or more. For proton synchrotron, the protons
have a minimum Lorentz factor ~2x10^6. This is much larger than expected if the
protons are accelerated by relativistic collisionless shocks in GRBs. We also
provide estimates of neutrino fluxes expected from photo-hadronic processes.
Although the flux from a single burst is below IceCube detection limits, it may
be possible to rule out photo-hadronic models by adding up the contribution of
several bursts. Therefore, photo-hadronic processes seem an unlikely candidate
for producing the Fermi-LAT radiation during the prompt phase of GRBs.

above which hydrogen self-shielding becomes important are consistent with
analytic calculations and previous work. However, because of diffuse
recombination radiation, whose intensity peaks at the same density, the
transition between highly ionized and self-shielded regions is smoother than
what is usually assumed. We provide fitting functions to the simulated
photoionization rate as a function of density and show that post-processing
simulations with the fitted rates yields results that are in excellent
agreement with the original radiative transfer calculations. The predicted
neutral hydrogen column density distributions agree very well with the
observations. In particular, the simulations reproduce the remarkable lack of
evolution in the column density distribution of Lyman limit and weak damped
Ly\alpha\ systems below z = 3. The evolution of the low column density end is
affected by the increasing importance of collisional ionization with decreasing
redshift. On the other hand, the simulations predict the abundance of strong
damped Ly\alpha\ systems to broadly track the cosmic star formation rate

value of e ~ 0.01; but about a quarter of the pairs possess much higher
eccentricities, up to 0.1 - 0.4. For the low-eccentricity pairs, we are able to
statistically remove the effect of eccentricity to obtain planet masses from
TTV data. These masses, together with those measured by radial velocity, yield
a best fit mass-radius relation M~3 M_E (R/R_E). This corresponds to a constant
surface escape velocity of 20km/s.
  We separate the planets into two distinct groups, ""mid-sized"" (those greater
than 3 R_E), and ""compact"" (those smaller). All mid-sized planets are found to
be less dense than water and therefore contain extensive H/He envelopes, likely
comparable in mass to that of their cores. We argue that these planets have
been significantly sculpted by photoevaporation. Surprisingly, mid-sized
planets are discovered exclusively around stars more massive than 0.8 M_sun.
The compact planets, on the other hand, are often denser than water. Combining
our density measurements with those from radial velocity studies, we find that
hotter compact planets tend to be denser, with the hottest ones reaching rock
density. Moreover, hotter planets tend to be smaller in sizes. These results
can be explained if the compact planets are made of rocky cores overlaid with a
small amount of hydrogen, < 1% in mass, with water contributing little to their
masses or sizes. Photoevaporation has exposed bare rocky cores in cases of the
hottest planets. Our conclusion that these planets are likely not water-worlds

parametrize the initial dynamics through an acceleration law Gamma \propto
r^\mu, with \mu between 1/3 and 1 to represent the range between an extreme
magnetically dominated and a baryonically dominated regime. We compare these
models to several bright Fermi LAT bursts, and show that both the time
integrated and the time resolved spectra, where available, can be well
described by these models. We discuss the parameters which result from these
fits, and discuss the relative merits and shortcomings of the two models.

velocity dispersion, Faber-Jackson, and Fundamental Plane (FP) scaling
relations for massive early-type galaxies (Es). We use a generalized velocity
dispersion, which includes rotation, to be able to compare the location of both
rotationally and pressure supported dEs with those of early and late-type
galaxies. We find that dEs seem to bend the Faber-Jackson relation of Es to
lower velocity dispersions, being the link between Es and dwarf spheroidal
galaxies (dSphs). Regarding the FP relation, we find that dEs are significantly
offset with respect to massive hot stellar systems, and re-casting the FP into
the so-called kappa-space suggests that this offset is related to dEs having a
total mass-to-light ratio higher than Es but still significantly lower than
dSph galaxies. Given a stellar mass-to-light ratio based on the measured line
indices of dEs, the FP offset allows us to infer that the dark matter fraction
within the half light radii of dEs is on average >~ 42% (uncertainties of 17%
in the K band and 20% in the V band), fully consistent with an independent
estimate in an earlier paper in this series. We also find that dEs in the
size-luminosity relation in the near-infrared, like in the optical, are offset
from early-type galaxies, but seem to be consistent with late-type galaxies. We
thus conclude that the scaling relations show that dEs are different from Es,
and that they further strengthen our previous findings that dEs are closer to
and likely formed from late-type galaxies.

galaxies (dEs) in the Virgo cluster and in regions of lower density. We have
found that these galaxies show many properties in common with late-type
galaxies but not with more massive early-types (E/S0). The properties of the
dEs in Virgo show gradients within the cluster. dEs in the outer parts of the
Virgo cluster are kinematically supported by rotation, while those in the
center are supported by the random motions of their stars (i.e. pressure
supported). The rotationally supported dEs have disky isophotes and faint
underlying spiral/irregular substructures, they also show younger ages than
those pressure supported, which have boxy isophotes and are smooth and regular,
without any substructure. We compare the position of these dEs with massive
early-type galaxies in the Faber-Jackson and Fundamental Plane relations, and
we find that, although there is no difference between the position of
rotationally and pressure supported dEs, both deviate from the relations of
massive early-type galaxies in the direction of dwarf spheroidal systems
(dSphs). We have used their offset with respect to the Fundamental Plane of
E/S0 galaxies to estimate their dark matter fraction. All the properties
studied in this work agree with a ram pressure stripping scenario, where
late-type galaxies infall into the cluster, their interaction with the
intergalactic medium blows away their gas and, as a result, they are quenched
in a small amount of time. However, those dEs in the center of the cluster seem
to have been fully transformed leaving no trace of their possible spiral
origin, thus, if that is the case, they must have experienced a more violent
mechanism in combination with ram pressure stripping.

one of the main unknowns in studies of galaxy evolution. Several evidence
suggests that late-type galaxies enter the cluster and are transformed to dwarf
early-type galaxies (dEs). We study the Virgo cluster to understand which
mechanisms are involved in this transformation. We find that the dEs in the
outer parts of Virgo have rotation curves with shapes and amplitudes similar to
late-type galaxies of the same luminosity. These dEs are rotationally
supported, have disky isophotes, and younger ages than those dEs in the center
of Virgo, which are pressure supported, often have boxy isophotes and are
older. Ram pressure stripping, thus, explains the properties of the dEs located
in the outskirts of Virgo. However, the dEs in the central cluster regions,
which have lost their angular momentum, must have suffered a more violent
transformation. A combination of ram pressure stripping and harassment is not
enough to remove the rotation and the spiral/disky structures of these
galaxies. We find that on the the Faber-Jackson and the Fundamental Plane
relations dEs deviate from the trends of massive elliptical galaxies towards
the position of dark matter dominated systems such as the dwarf spheroidal
satellites of the Milky Way and M31. Both, rotationally and pressure supported
dEs, however, populate the same region in these diagrams. This indicates that
dEs have a non-negligible dark matter fraction within their half light radius.

have ignited interest in potential gamma line signatures of dark matter.
Explanations of this line based on dark matter annihilation face a parametric
tension since they often rely on large enhancements of loop-suppressed cross
sections. In this paper, we pursue an alternative possibility that dark matter
gamma lines could arise from ""semi-annihilation"" among multiple dark sector
states. The semi-annihilation reaction with a single final state photon is
typically enhanced relative to ordinary annihilation into photon pairs.
Semi-annihilation allows for a wide range of dark matter masses compared to the
fixed mass value required by annihilation, opening the possibility to explain
potential dark matter signatures at higher energies. The most striking
prediction of semi-annihilation is the presence of multiple gamma lines, with
as many as order N^3 lines possible for N dark sector states, allowing for dark
sector spectroscopy. A smoking gun signature arises in the simplest case of
degenerate dark matter, where a strong semi-annihilation line at 130 GeV would
be accompanied by a weaker annihilation line at 173 GeV. As a proof of
principle, we construct two explicit models of dark matter semi-annihilation,
one based on non-Abelian vector dark matter and the other based on retrofitting
Rayleigh dark matter.

the interface with another material. Such a ""proximity effect"" can have several
manifestations, from order parameter leakage to generated effective
interactions. The resulting combination of induced electron correlations and
their intrinsic dynamics at the surface of the affected material can give rise
to qualitatively new quantum states. For example, the leaking of a
superconducting order parameter into certain Rashba spin-orbit-coupled
materials has been recently identified as a path to creating ""topological

Here we analyze the other aspects of the superconducting proximity effect. The
proximity-induced interactions are a promising path to incompressible quantum
liquids with non-Abelian fractional quasiparticles in topological insulator
quantum wells, which could also find applications in topological quantum
computing. We discuss the operational and design principles of a
heterostructure device that could realize such states. We apply
field-theoretical methods to characterize the properties of induced
interactions via the electron-phonon coupling and Cooper pair tunneling across
the interface. We argue that bound-state Cooper pairs can be stabilized by the
interaction proximity effect inside a topological insulator quantum well at
experimentally observable energy scales. The condensation of spinful triplet
pairs, enabled by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and tunable by gate voltage,
would lead to novel superconducting states and fractional topological

including collapsing stars and pinching fluid interfaces. They are important
for being able to concentrate energy into a small region. Underwater air
bubbles in particular appear in many practical applications, including new
technologies to reduce skin drag on cargo ships. Previous theories show that
just before an air bubble pinches off, the neck looks like a cylinder at its
very smallest point. Unusually, however, the neck approaches this shape so
gradually that the theoretical cylinder solution is not reached in practice;
the singularity spends its entire lifetime in a transient phase. Therefore, in
order to understand the evolution, we study the transient effects in detail.
This paper details the simulation results of bubbles with initial conditions
far from the cylindrical solution: squat, up--down asymmetric neck shapes, with
imposed vertical flow. We find that the asymmetry is transient: the neck
quickly shifts vertically to become up--down symmetric. Importantly, we find
that the resulting symmetric singularity is a blend of the initial top and
bottom sides, with a weighting factor that is tunable by adjusting the airflow
through the neck. This effect should have implications for the later stages of
evolution, including the generation of satellite bubbles and the formation of
the Worthington jet.

give birth to stars that avoid enrichment of their chemical compositions by
massive stars and thereby exhibit a SN Ia-like elemental feature including a
very low [Mg/Fe] (~-1). We highlight the elemental feature of Fe-group elements
for two low-Mg/Fe objects detected in nearby galaxies, and propose the presence
of a class of SNe Ia that yield the low abundance ratios of [Cr,Mn,Ni/Fe]. Our
novel models of chemical evolution reveal that our proposed class of SNe Ia
(slow SNe Ia) is associated with ones exploding on a long timescale after their
stellar birth, and gives a significant impact on the chemical enrichment in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In the Galaxy, on the other hand, this effect is
unseen due to the overwhelming enrichment by the major class of SNe Ia that
explode promptly (prompt SNe Ia) and eject a large amount of Fe-group elements.
This nicely explains the different [Cr,Mn,Ni/Fe] features between the two
galaxies as well as the puzzling feature seen in the LMC stars exhibiting very
low Ca but normal Mg abundances. Furthermore, the corresponding channel of slow

a super-massive black hole (6 billion solar masses) in its center. M 87 is one
of just three radio galaxies known to emit TeV gamma-rays. The structure of its
relativistic plasma jet, which is not pointing towards our line of sight, is
spatially resolved in X-ray (Chandra), optical and radio (VLA/VLBA)
observations. The mechanism and location of the TeV emitting region is one of
the least understood aspects of AGN. In spring 2008 and 2010, the three TeV
observatories VERITAS, MAGIC and H.E.S.S. detected two major TeV flares in
coordinated observations. Simultaneous high-resolution observations at other
wavelengths - radio (2008) and X-rays (2008/2010) - gave evidence that one of
the TeV flares was related to an event in the core region; however, no
common/repeated patterns could be identified so far. VERITAS continued to
monitor M 87 in 2011/2012. The results of these observations are presented.

recovering high-order accuracy from the first $m$ Fourier coefficients of an

fast in $m$. Any method with faster convergence must also be unstable, and in
particular, exponential convergence implies exponential ill-conditioning. This
result is analogous to a recent theorem of Platte, Trefethen & Kuijlaars
concerning recovery from pointwise function values on an equispaced $m$-grid.
The main step in our proof is an estimate for the maximal behaviour of a
polynomial of degree $n$ with bounded $m$-term Fourier series, which is related
to a conjecture of Hrycak & Groechenig. In the second part of the paper we
discuss the implications of our main theorem to polynomial-based interpolation

consider the use of so-called Fourier extensions as an attractive alternative
for this problem. We present numerical results demonstrating rapid convergence

in Si at low temperatures (T) reveals the onset of large, non-Gaussian noise
after cooling from an equilibrium state at a high T with a fixed carrier
density n_s. This behavior, which signifies the falling out of equilibrium of
the 2DES as T->0, is observed for n_s<n_g (n_g - glass transition density). A
protocol where density is changed by a small value \Delta n_s at low T produces
the same results for the noise power spectra. However, a detailed analysis of
the non-Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) of the fluctuations
reveals that \Delta n_s has a qualitatively different and more dramatic effect
than \Delta T, suggesting that \Delta n_s induces strong changes in the free
energy landscape of the system as a result of Coulomb interactions. The results
from a third, waiting-time (t_w) protocol, where n_s is changed temporarily
during t_w by a large amount, demonstrate that non-Gaussian PDFs exhibit
history dependence and an evolution towards a Gaussian distribution as the
system ages and slowly approaches equilibrium. By calculating the power spectra
and higher-order statistics for the noise measured over a wide range of the

in the regime of Ohmic or linear response, i.e. that it is not caused by the

minimal length in any of these lattices, in terms of a basis for the group of

  Bruinier and Yang conjectured a formula for intersection numbers on an

on the ramification of the primitive quartic CM field K. Yang later proved this

consequence, we obtain a formula for a multiple of the denominators of the
Igusa class polynomials for an arbitrary primitive quartic CM field. Our proof
entails studying the Embedding Problem posed by Goren and Lauter and counting

accuracy by considering the degeneracy of the ice rule {\it solely at the
vertex level}. Indeed, his estimate works well for both the three-dimensional
pyrochlore lattice and the two-dimensional six-vertex model, solved by Lieb in
1967. The case of honeycomb artificial spin ice is similar: its pseudo-ice
rule, like the ice rule in Pauling and Lieb's systems, simply extends a
degeneracy which is already present in the vertices to the global ground state.
The anisotropy of the magnetic interaction limits the design of inherently
degenerate vertices in artificial spin ice, and the honeycomb is the only
degenerate array produced so far. In this paper we show how to engineer
artificial spin ice in a virtually infinite variety of degenerate geometries
built out of non-degenerate vertices. In this new class of vertex models, the
residual entropy follows not from a freedom of choice at the vertex level, but
from the nontrivial relative arrangement of the vertices themselves. In such
arrays, loops exist along which not all of the vertices can be chosen in their
lowest energy configuration: these loops are therefore vertex-frustrated since
they contain unhappy vertices. Residual entropy emerges in these lattices as
configurational freedom in allocating the unhappy vertices of the ground state.
These new geometries will finally allow for the fabrication of many novel
extensively degenerate artificial spin ice.

to sufficient abundance of Dirac near-zeromodes. However, dynamical mechanism
leading to breakdown of chiral symmetry should be naturally reflected in chiral
properties of the modes. Here we offer such connection, presenting evidence
that SChSB in QCD proceeds via the appearance of modes exhibiting dynamical
tendency for local chiral polarization. These modes form a band of finite width
Lambda_ch (chiral polarization scale) around the surface of otherwise
anti--polarized Dirac sea, and condense. Lambda_ch characterizes the dynamics
of the breaking phenomenon and can be converted to a quark mass scale, thus
offering conceptual means to determine which quarks of nature are governed by
broken chiral dynamics. It is proposed that, within the context of SU(3) gauge
theories with fundamental Dirac quarks, mode condensation is equivalent to
chiral polarization. This makes Lambda_ch an ""order parameter"" of SChSB, albeit
without local dynamical field representation away from chiral limit. Several
uses of these features, both at zero and finite temperature, are discussed. Our
initial estimates are Lambda_ch~150 MeV (N_f=0), Lambda_ch~80 MeV (N_f=2+1,
physical point), and that the strange quark is too heavy to be crucially
influenced by broken chiral symmetry.

the Ge QD and WL surface in sub-monolayer concentrations, and subsequently
annealed up to temperature of 400 C. Bonding and surface topography were
measured with STM during the annealing process. Mn forms flat islands on the Ge
{105} facet, whose shape and position is guided by the rebonded step
reconstruction. The images show a hybridization of Mn-d band and empty states
of the Ge{105} facet. A statistical analysis of Mn-islands on the QD yields a
slight preference for edge positions, whereas the QD strain field does not
impact Mn-islands. The formation of ultra-small Mn-clusters dominates on the
Ge(001) WL, which contrasts the Mn-interaction with unstrained Ge(001)
surfaces. Annealing (<160 C) leaves the Mn-clusters on the WL unchanged, while
the Mn-islands on the Ge{105} facet undergo a ripening process, followed by a
volume gain attributable to the onset of intermixing with Ge. This is supported
by a statistical analysis of island volume, and size distribution. Increasing
the annealing temperature (220- 375 C) leads to a rapid increase in Mn-surface
diffusion evidenced by the formation of nanometer size clusters, which are
identified as germanide Mn5Ge3 by a mass balance analysis. This reaction is
accompanied by the disappearance of the original Mn-surface structures

positing a spectrum of light higgsinos \lesssim 200 GeV and light top squarks
\lesssim 500 GeV along with very heavy squarks and TeV-scale gluinos. Such
models have low electroweak finetuning and are safe from LHC searches. However,
in the context of the MSSM, they predict too low a value of m(h) and the relic
density of thermally produced higgsino-like WIMPs falls well below dark matter
(DM) measurements. Allowing for high scale soft SUSY breaking Higgs mass
m_{H_u}> m_0 leads to natural cancellations during RG running, and to
radiatively induced low finetuning at the electroweak scale. This model of
radiative natural SUSY (RNS), with large mixing in the top squark sector,
allows for finetuning at the 5-10% level with TeV-scale top squarks and a 125
GeV light Higgs scalar h. If the strong CP problem is solved via the PQ
mechanism, then we expect an axion-higgsino admixture of dark matter, where
either or both the DM particles might be directly detected.

globular cluster stars are presently recognized as the signature of
self-enrichment from now extinct, previous generations of stars. This defines
the multiple population scenario. Since fluorine is also affected by proton
captures, determining its abundance in globular clusters provides new and
complementary clues regarding the nature of these previous generations, and
supplies strong observational constraints to the chemical enrichment
timescales. In this paper we present our results on near-infrared CRIRES
spectroscopic observations of six cool giant stars in NGC 6656 (M22): the main
objective is to derive the F content and its internal variation in this
peculiar cluster, which exhibits significant changes in both light and heavy
element abundances. We detected F variations across our sample beyond the
measurement uncertainties and found that the F abundances are positively
correlated with O and anticorrelated with Na, as expected according to the
multiple population framework. Furthermore, our observations reveal an increase
in the F content between the two different sub-groups, s-process rich and
s-process poor, hosted within M22. The comparison with theoretical models
suggests that asymptotic giant stars with masses between 4 and 5 Msun are
responsible for the observed chemical pattern, confirming evidence from
previous works: the difference in age between the two sub-components in M22
must be not larger than a few hundreds Myr.

field and prove generic results of super-exponential stability for nearby
solutions. Morbidelli and Giorgilli have proved a theorem of stability over
super-exponentially long times if one consider an analytic lagrangian torus,
invariant for an analytic hamiltonian system, with a diophantine translation
vector which admit a sign definite torsion. Then, the solutions of the system
move very little over times which are super-exponentially long with respect to
the inverse of the distance to the invariant torus. The proof is in two steps:
first the construction of a Birkhoff normal form at a high order, then the
application of Nekhoroshev theory. Bounemoura has shown that the second step of
this construction remains valid if the Birkhoff normal form linked to an
elliptic fixed point belongs to a generic set among the formal series. To
obtain a complete result, we also have to establish that most strongly non
resonant elliptic fixed point in a Hamiltonian system admit a Birkhoff normal
form in the set introduced by Bounemoura. We show here that this property is
satisfied generically in the sense of the measure (prevalence) through
infinite-dimensional probe spaces (that is an infinite number of parameter
chosen at random) with methods similar to those developed in a paper of

of the Moon's internal structure and the dynamics of the Earth-Moon system.
Because of the recent improvements of the ground-based laser ranging
facilities, the present LLR measurement accuracy is limited by the
retro-reflectors currently on the lunar surface, which are arrays of small
corner-cubes. Because of lunar librations, the surfaces of these arrays do not,
in general, point directly at the Earth. This effect results in a spread of
arrival times, because each cube that comprises the retroreflector is at a
slightly different distance from the Earth, leading to the reduced ranging
accuracy. Thus, a single, wide aperture corner-cube could have a clear
advantage. In addition, after nearly four decades of successful operations the
retro-reflectors arrays currently on the Moon started to show performance
degradation; as a result, they yield still useful, but much weaker return
signals. Thus, fresh and bright instruments on the lunar surface are needed to
continue precision LLR measurements. We have developed a new retro-reflector
design to enable advanced LLR operations. It is based on a single, hollow
corner cube with a large aperture for which preliminary thermal, mechanical,
and optical design and analysis have been performed. The new instrument will be
able to reach an Earth-Moon range precision of 1-mm in a single pulse while
being subjected to significant thermal variations present on the lunar surface,
and will have low mass to allow robotic deployment. Here we report on our
design results and instrument development effort.

contributions to the rate of this reaction are the direct capture process, two
low lying narrow resonances ($E_{r}=65.1$ and 183 keV) and the low-energy tails
of two broad resonances ($E_{r}=557$ and 677 keV). Previous measurements and
calculations give contradictory results for the direct capture contribution
which in turn increases the uncertainty of the reaction rate. In addition, very
few published cross section data exist for the high energy region that might
affect the interpretation of the direct capture and the contributions of the
broad resonances in the lower energy range. This work aims to address these
issues. The reaction cross section was measured in a wide proton energy range
($E_{c.m.}=345$ - 1700 keV) and at several angles
($\theta_{lab}=0^{\circ},45^{\circ},90^{\circ},135^{\circ}$). The observed
primary $\gamma$-transitions were used as input in an $R$-matrix code in order
to obtain the contribution of the direct capture and the two broad resonances
to the low-energy region. The extrapolated S-factor from the present data is in
good agreement with the existing literature data in the low-energy region. A
new reaction rate was calculated from the combined results of this work and

reported for several $^{18}$F states. We were able to extrapolate the

most existing approaches focus only on avoiding PU activity when making sensing
decisions. Since the myopic sensing strategy results in congestion and poor
throughput, several collision-avoidance sensing approaches were investigated in
the literature. However, they provide limited improvement. A channel-aware
myopic sensing strategy that adapts the reward to the fading channel state
information (CSI) of the SU link is proposed. This CSI varies over the CR
spectrum and from one SU pair to another due to multipath and shadow fading,
thus randomizing sensing decisions and increasing the network throughput. The
proposed joint CSI adaptation at the medium access control (MAC) and physical
layers provides large throughput gain over randomized sensing strategies and/or
conventional adaptive transmission methods. The performance of the proposed

is achieved by the use of a correlated ensemble in which the Large Scale
Structure is common to all realizations while having each an independent halo
population. The correlated ensemble can be stacked, effectively increasing the
halo number density by an arbitrary factor, thus breaking the fundamental limit
in the halo number density given by the haloe mass function. This technique
allows us to compute \textit{local ensemble statistics} of the matter/haloe
distribution at any position in the simulation box, while removing the
intrinsic stochasticity in the halo formation process and directly relating
halo properties to their environment.
  We introduce the \textit{Multum In Parvo} (MIP) correlated ensemble
simulation consisting of 220 realizations on a 32 h$^{-1}$ Mpc box with $256^3$
particles each. This is equivalent in terms of effective volume and number of

  The potential of the technique presented here is illustrated by computing the
local ensemble statistics of the halo ellipticity and halo shape-LSS alignment.
We show that, while there are general trends in the ellipticity and alignment
of haloes with their LSS, there are also significant spatial variations which
has important implications for observational studies of galaxy shape and
alignment.

the fluid staying in the central area of the rotation is pushed up along the
rotation axis, and the upward wind is enhanced. In this coupling mechanism the
rotation gradient is the key; the coupling of the rotation and the upward fluid

confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in SU(3) lattice QCD calculation on
6^4 at beta=5.6 at the quenched level. Notably, the Wilson loop is found to
obey the area law, and the slope parameter corresponding to the string tension
or the confinement force is almost unchanged, even after removing the low-lying
Dirac modes, which are responsible to chiral symmetry breaking. We find also
that the Polyakov loop remains to be almost zero even without the low-lying

indicate that one-to-one correspondence does not hold between confinement and
chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.

variable AGN. Here, we analyze a ~100 ksec archival XMM-Newton observation of
the highly variable AGN, ESO 113-G010 in order to search for lags between hard,
1.5 - 4.5 keV, and soft, 0.3 - 0.9 keV, energy X-ray bands. At the lowest
frequencies available in the lightcurve (<1.5E-4 Hz), we find hard lags where
the power-law dominated hard band lags the soft band (where the reflection
fraction is high). However, at higher frequencies in the range (2-3)E-4 Hz we
find a soft lag of -325 +/- 89 s. The general evolution from hard to soft lags
as the frequency increases is similar to other AGN where soft lags have been
detected. We interpret this soft lag as due to reverberation from the accretion
disk, with the reflection component responding to variability from the X-ray
corona. For a black hole mass of 7E6 M(solar) this corresponds to a
light-crossing time of ~9 R_g/c, however, dilution effects mean that the
intrinsic lag is likely longer than this. Based on recent black hole
mass-scaling for lag properties, the lag amplitude and frequency are more
consistent with a black hole a few times more massive than the best estimates,
though flux-dependent effects could easily add scatter this large.

that connects two Mn sublattices. Therefore, from the viewpoint of DM
interactions, different Mn sublattices are expected to have opposite spin
chirality. Another source is competing isotropic exchange interactions, which
tend to form a spin-spiral texture with the same chirality in both magnetic
sublattices. Thus, there is a conflict between DM and isotropic exchange
interactions, which makes these two sublattices inequivalent and, therefore,
breaks the inversion symmetry. Our theoretical analysis is based on the
low-energy model, derived from the first-principles electronic structure

fluctuation of protein correlated with that of water is presented based on the
generalized Langevin equation and the 3D-RISM/RISM theory of molecular liquids.
The displacement vector of atom positions and their conjugated momentum, are
chosen for the dynamic variables for protein, while the density fields of atoms
and their momentum fields are chosen for water. Projection of other degrees of
freedom onto those dynamic variables using the standard projection operator
method produces essentially two equations which describe the time evolution of
fluctuation concerning the density field of solvent and the conformation of
protein around an equilibrium state, which are coupled with each other. The
equation concerning the protein dynamics is formally akin to that of the
coupled Langevin oscillators, and is a generalization of the latter, to atomic
level. The most intriguing feature of the new equation is that it contains the
variance-covariance matrix as the ""Hessian"" term describing the ""force""
restoring an equilibrium conformation, which is the second moment of the
fluctuation of atom positions. The ""Hessian"" matrix is naturally identified as
the second derivative of the free energy surface around the equilibrium. A
method to evaluate the Hessian matrix based on the 3D-RISM/RISM theory is
proposed. Proposed also is an application of the present formulation to the
molecular recognition, in which the conformational fluctuation of protein
around its native state becomes an important factor as exemplified by so called
""induced fitting"".

The
pump is driven by a high-pressure vapor bubble generated by a microheater
positioned asymmetrically in a microchannel. The bubble is approximated as a
short-term impulse delivered to the two fluidic columns inside the channel.
Fluid dynamics is described by a Newton-like equation with a variable mass, but
without the mass derivative term. Because of smaller inertia, the short column
refills the channel faster and accumulates a larger mechanical momentum. After
bubble collapse the total fluid momentum is nonzero, resulting in a net flow.
Two different versions of the model are analyzed in detail, analytically and
numerically. In the symmetrical model, the pressure at the channel-reservoir
connection plane is assumed constant, whereas in the asymmetrical model it is
reduced by a Bernoulli term. For low and intermediate vapor bubble pressures,
both models predict the existence of an optimal microheater location. The
predicted net flow in the asymmetrical model is smaller by a factor of about 2.
For unphysically large vapor pressures, the asymmetrical model predicts
saturation of the effect, while in the symmetrical model net flow increases
indefinitely. Pumping is reduced by nonzero viscosity, but to a different
degree depending on the microheater location.

Coherent condensates of the phases describe, e.g., a ""magnetic order"" of the
pseudo-spin, superfluidity of hard-core bosons, etc. This effective field
theory is a kind of extended quantum XY model, and its phase diagram can be

an active thickness of 75 um or 150 um, produced at the MPI Semiconductor
Laboratory (MPI HLL) and on 100 um thick sensors with active edges, fabricated
at VTT, Finland. Hit efficiencies are derived from beam test data for thin
devices irradiated up to a fluence of 4e15 neq/cm^2. For the active edge
devices, the charge collection properties of the edge pixels before irradiation
is discussed in detail, with respect to the inner ones, using measurements with
radioactive sources. Beyond the active edge sensors, an additional ingredient
needed to design four side buttable modules is the possibility of moving the
wire bonding area from the chip surface facing the sensor to the backside,
avoiding the implementation of the cantilever extruding beyond the sensor area.

from an anal fin and without significantly moving its body. This unique feature
makes this species' propulsion method highly efficient (Blake, 1983). It has
been suggested that there is an optimal swimming range for fish based on the
amplitude and frequency of the reverse K\'arm\'an street. Experiments have been
performed to measure the ratio between the amplitude and wavelength of vortices
in the wake of a knifefish. It is suggested that by optimizing the thrust
created by the reverse Karman street the wave efficiency can be estimated for a
given spacing ratio, and present observations have an average value of 0.89.
The relationship established between spacing ratio and wave efficiency, in
addition to the measured parameters, will be invaluable for bio-inspired
designs based on the knifefish.

addition to many next-to-leading order or even next-to-next-to leading order
$\alpha_s$ corrections made, we also study many of the previously unknown
next-to-leading order power corrections. While the former corrections are
theoretically solid, the latter corrections are phenomenologically more
important. In the QCD factorization approach based on collinear factorization,
there is difficulty to deal with the power correction diagrams due to the
endpoint singularity. Thus many of these analysis use phenomenological method.
In the perturbative QCD approach based on $k_T$ factorization, the endpoint
singularity is killed by including the quark transverse momentum. Therefore we
can calculate the annihilation type diagrams quantitatively, which give the
right sign for the direct CP asymmetry parameters. More and more $B_{(s)}$
decays channels, especially the pure annihilation type decays have been
measured by the recent experiments to confirm our theoretical predictions. More
channels are predicted for future experiments, such as the charmless and
charmed $B_s$ and $B_c$ hadronic decays and the decays involving a scalar,

selfish network creation by Fabrikant et al.[PODC'03]. GE are interesting for
two reasons: (1) they model outcomes found by agents which prefer smooth
adaptations over radical strategy-changes, (2) GE are outcomes found by agents
which do not have enough computational resources to play optimally. In the
model of Fabrikant et al. agents correspond to Internet Service Providers which
buy network links to improve their quality of network usage. It is known that
computing a best response in this model is NP-hard. Hence, poly-time agents are
likely not to play optimally. But how good are networks created by such agents?
We answer this question for very simple agents. Quite surprisingly, naive
greedy play suffices to create remarkably stable networks. Specifically, we
show that in the SUM version, where agents attempt to minimize their average
distance to all other agents, GE capture Nash equilibria (NE) on trees and that
any GE is in 3-approximate NE on general networks. For the latter we also
provide a lower bound of 3/2 on the approximation ratio. For the MAX version,
where agents attempt to minimize their maximum distance, we show that any
GE-star is in 2-approximate NE and any GE-tree having larger diameter is in
6/5-approximate NE. Both bounds are tight. We contrast these positive results
by providing a linear lower bound on the approximation ratio for the MAX
version on general networks in GE. This result implies a locality gap of
$\Omega(n)$ for the metric min-max facility location problem, where n is the

heavy virtual modes that then decay into light degrees of freedom, although our

Perturbation Theory (ChPT). The breaking of the factorization hypothesis does
not allow for a finite four-quark condensate and its use as an order parameter,
except in the chiral limit. This is rigorously obtained within ChPT and is
therefore a model-independent result. Factorization only holds formally in the
large $N_c$ limit and breaks up at finite temperature even in the chiral limit.
Nevertheless, the factorization breaking terms are precisely those needed to
yield a finite scalar susceptibility, deeply connected to chiral symmetry
restoration. Actually, we provide the full result for the SU(3) quark
condensate to NNLO in ChPT, thus extending previous results to include kaon and
eta interactions. This allows to check the effect of those corrections compared
to previous approaches and the uncertainties due to low-energy constants. We
provide a detailed analysis of scalar susceptibilities in the SU(3) meson gas,
including a comparison between the pure ChPT approach and the virial expansion,
where the unitarization of pion scattering is crucial to achieve a more
reliable prediction. Through the analysis of the interactions within this

self-avoiding trails interacting via multiply-visited sites (ISAT) are two
models of the polymer collapse transition of a polymer in dilute solution. On
the square lattice it has been established numerically that the collapse
transition of each model lies in a different universality class. It has been
shown that by adding stiffness to the ISAW model a second low temperature phase
eventuates and a more complicated phase diagram ensues with three types of
transition that meet at a multi-critical point. For large enough stiffness the
collapse transition becomes first-order. Interestingly, a phase diagram of a
similar structure has been seen to occur in an extended ISAT model on the
triangular lattice without stiffness. It is therefore of interest to see the
effect of adding stiffness to the ISAT model. We have studied by computer
simulation a generalised model of self-interacting self-avoiding trails on the
square lattice with a stiffness parameter added. Intriguingly, we find that
stiffness does not change the order of the collapse transition for ISAT on the
square lattice for a very wide range of stiffness weights. While at the lengths
considered there are clear bimodal distributions for very large stiffness, our
numerical evidence strongly suggests that these are simply finite-size effects
associated with a crossover to a first-order phase transition at infinite
stiffness.

CIRs and resonant enhancement of the transmission at zeros of the free space

of the scattering processes in ultracold atomic gases in waveguides beyond the

~500 GeV at the surface, which provides an efficient veto system for hadronic
air showers with energies above 1 PeV. One year of data from the 40-string
IceCube configuration was used to perform a search for point sources and a

limit on the ratio of gamma rays to cosmic rays of 1.2 x 10^(-3)for the flux
coming from the Galactic Plane region (-80 deg < l < -30 deg; -10 deg < b < 5
deg) in the energy range 1.2 - 6.0 PeV. In the same energy range, point source
fluxes with E^(-2) spectra have been excluded at a level of (E/TeV)^2 d\Phi/dE
~ 10^(-12)-10^(-11) cm^2/s/TeV depending on source declination. The complete
IceCube detector will have a better sensitivity, due to the larger detector
size, improved reconstruction and vetoing techniques. Preliminary data from the
nearly-final IceCube detector configuration has been used to estimate the 5
year sensitivity of the full detector. It is found to be more than an order of
magnitude better, allowing the search for PeV extensions of known TeV gamma-ray

characterization of a set of TiO2 and N-doped TiO2 samples, together with the
analysis of Ti 3d-related states carried out with X-ray photoemission (XPS) and
resonant photoemission (ResPES). The hypothesis of clustered VO as the source
of FM is then discussed in the light of the experimental and theoretical
results. Another interesting oxide system in which the stoichiometry of Ti ions
play a fundamental role is the LAO-STO interface. In fact, while LAO and STO
separately are two band insulators, the interface created by growing LAO on the
top of STO (001) has found to become metallic, hosting a 2D electron gas. The
second part of this Thesis is devoted to the study of conductive and insulating
LAO-STO interfaces, carried out by XPS, X-ray absorption (XAS) and with ResPES.
The sample stoichiometry is evaluated through a comparison with LAO and STO
single crystals. A resonance enhancement of the conductive Ti states,
associated to Ti3+ ions, is reported and compared to theoretical calculations.
On the basis of these results, the origin of metallic states in ultra-thin
LAO-STO interfaces is properly addressed. In addition, a characterization of
the structural disorder at the interface is shown, carried out with
angle-resolved XPS.

pulsars (P < 30 ms). Many of these discoveries are among the pulsars with the
largest DM/P ratios, proving that the PALFA survey is capable of probing the
Galactic plane for millisecond pulsars to a much greater depth than any
previous survey. This is due to the survey's high sensitivity, relatively high
observing frequency, and its high time and frequency resolution. Recently the
rate of discoveries has increased, due to a new more sensitive spectrometer,
two updated complementary search pipelines, the development of online

an exception, as its symmetry algebra doesn't close polynomially. The 3D
4-parameter potential for the extended Kepler-Coulomb system is not even 2nd
order superintegrable, but Verrier and Evans (2008) showed it was 4th order
superintegrable, and Tanoudis and Daskaloyannis (2011) showed that, if a 2nd
4th order symmetry is added to the generators, the symmetry algebra closes

3 and 4-parameter systems indexed by a pair of rational numbers (k_1,k_2) and
reducing to the usual systems when k_1=k_2=1. We show these systems to be
superintegrable of arbitrarily high order and determine the structure of their
symmetry algebras. We demonstrate that the symmetry algebras close
algebraically; only for systems admitting extra discrete symmetries is
polynomial closure achieved. Underlying the structure theory is the existence
of raising and lowering operators, not themselves symmetry operators or even
defined independent of basis, that can be employed to construct the symmetry
operators and their structure relations.

allowing for the Vainshtein effect. This Einstein Frame description
considerably simplifies the dynamical equations and highlights the role of the
different terms. The study of highly dense, non-relativistic environments
within this description unravels the existence of a disformal screening
mechanism, while the study of static vacuum configurations reveals the
existence of a Vainshtein radius, at which the asymptotic solution breaks down.
Disformal couplings to matter also allow the construction of Dark Energy
models, which behave differently than conformally coupled ones and introduce
new effects on the growth of Large Scale Structure over cosmological scales, on
which the scalar force is not screened. We consider a simple Disformally
Coupled Dark Matter model in detail, in which standard model particles follow
geodesics of the gravitational metric and only Dark Matter is affected by the
disformal scalar field. This particular model is not compatible with
observations in the linearly perturbed regime. Nonetheless, disformally coupled

that terminate the AGB are inhibited in NGC 4372 due to a lack of atmospheric
pulsation and the high gas-to-dust ratio in the ejecta, leading to a delay in
the associated enhanced mass loss and dust production. Previously predicted,

quantum correlations for quantum states of light. It enables us to discriminate
between the classical correlation of a two-mode coherent state and the quantum
correlation of a twin-beam state. We study the effect of loss and saturation of
the photon-number-resolving detector on the measurement of the VDPs. An
analytic function is derived for this variance, both for the coherent and the
twin-beam states. It is found that the VDPs is no longer a reliable

remains useful in some range of values of average photon numbers of the
incident light. We also quantify the linear regime of the detector with
saturation which will be useful for calibration of the detector quantum

rotating plasma by considering anisotropic transport effects. In the dilute
plasmas, the ion Larmor radius is small compared with its collisional mean free
path. In this case, the transport of heat and momentum along the magnetic field
lines become important. This paper presents a novel linear instability that may
more powerful and greater than ideal magnetothermal instability (MTI) and ideal
magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the dilute astrophysical plasmas. This
type of plasma is believed to be found in the intracluster medium of galaxy
clusters and radiatively ineffective accretion flows around black holes. We
derive the dispersion relation of this instability and obtain the instability
condition. There is at least one unstable mode that is independent of the
temperature gradient direction for a helical magnetic field geometry. This
novel instability is driven by the gyroviscosity coupled with differential
rotation. Therefore we call it as gyroviscous modified magnetorotational
instability (GvMRI). We examine how the instability depends on signs of the
temperature gradient and the gyroviscosity, and also on the magnitude of the
thermal frequency and on the values of the pitch angle. We provide a detailed
physical interpretation of obtained results. The GvMRI is applicable not only
to the accretion flows and intracluster medium but also to the transition
region between cool dense gas and the hot low-density plasma in stellar
coronae, accretion disks, and the multiphase interstellar medium because of
being independent of the temperature gradient direction.

reasonable assumptions for the higher-order behaviour of the perturbative
series, fixed-order perturbation theory (FOPT) provides the preferred framework
for the renormalization group improvement of all moments that show good

at z~0.1, and search for the footprints of AGN feedback. 3C236 shows signs of a
reactivation of its AGN triggered by a recent minor merger episode.
Observations have also previously identified an extreme HI outflow in this
source. Methods: The IRAM PdBI has been used to study the distribution and
kinematics of molecular gas in 3C236 by imaging with high spatial resolution
the emission of the 12CO(2-1) line in the nucleus of the galaxy. We have
searched for outflow signatures in the CO map. We have also derived the SFR in
3C236 using data available from the literature at UV, optical and IR
wavelengths, to determine the star-formation efficiency of molecular gas.
Results: The CO emission in 3C236 comes from a spatially resolved 2.6 kpc disk
with a regular rotating pattern. Within the limits imposed by the sensitivity
and velocity coverage of the CO data, we do not detect any outflow signatures
in the cold molecular gas. The disk has a cold gas mass M(H2)~2.1x10^9 Msun. We
determine a new value for the redshift of the source zCO=0.09927. The
similarity between the CO and HI profiles indicates that the deep HI absorption
in 3C236 can be accounted for by a rotating HI structure, restricting the
evidence of HI outflow to the most extreme velocities. In the light of the new
redshift, the analysis of the ionized gas kinematics reveals a 1000 km/s
outflow. As for the CO emitting gas, outflow signatures are nevertheless absent
in the warm molecular gas emission traced by infrared H2 lines. The
star-formation efficiency in 3C236 is consistent with the value measured in
normal galaxies, which follow the canonical KS-law. This result, confirmed to
hold in other young radio sources examined in this work, is in stark contrast
with the factor of 10-50 lower SFE that seems to characterize evolved powerful
radio galaxies.

derived from the 3D molecular structure are frequently applied for property
prediction in various fields of research. In particular, DragonX is one of the
most widely used software packages for descriptor calculation. The reliability
of 3D molecular descriptors computed by DragonX has lately been investigated,
thereby focusing on the effect of computational methods used for molecular
structure optimization on the accuracy of the resulting molecular descriptors.
The present contribution extends the analysis to a more intrinsic problem of
DragonX descriptor evaluation resulting from the sensitivity of the computed 3D
descriptors on the coordinate system used for molecule description. Evaluating
several 3D descriptors for converged molecular structures rotated around all 3
spatial axes (affine coordinate transformations) yields systematically varying
descriptor values. Since this unphysical behavior severely affects the
descriptor reliability, the present contribution is meant to summarize these
findings for later improvement of either descriptor definitions or the DragonX
implementations.
