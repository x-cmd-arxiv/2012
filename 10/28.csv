J0023+0923, J1810+1744, J2215+5135, and J2256-1024. All four are Fermi
gamma-ray sources and three are 'black-widow' pulsars, with companions of mass
< 0.1 solar masses. Data were taken using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and
covered a full binary orbit for each pulsar. Two pulsars, PSRs J2215+5135 and
J2256-1024, show significant orbital variability and X-ray flux minima at the
times of eclipses observed at radio wavelengths. This phenomenon is consistent
with intrabinary shock emission characteristic of black-widow pulsars. The
other two pulsars, PSRs J0023+0923 and J1810+1744, do not demonstrate
significant variability, but are fainter than the other two sources. Spectral
fits yield power-law indices that range from 1.4 to 2.3 and blackbody
temperatures in the hundreds of eV. The spectrum for PSR J2215+5135 shows a
significant hard X-ray component (41% of counts are above 2 keV), which is
additional evidence for the presence of intrabinary shock emission.

However, to fully exploit its potential, robust methods for estimating stellar
parameters are required and independent verification of the results is needed.
In this talk, I present a new technique developed to obtain stellar properties
by coupling asteroseismic analysis with the InfraRed Flux Method. Using two
global seismic observables and multi-band photometry, the technique determines
masses, radii, effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and thus distances
for field stars in a self-consistent manner. Applying our method to a sample of
solar-like oscillators in the {\it Kepler} field that have accurate {\it
Hipparcos} parallaxes, we find agreement in our distance determinations to
better than 5%. Comparison with measurements of spectroscopic effective
temperatures and interferometric radii also validate our results, and show that
our technique can be applied to stars evolved beyond the main-sequence phase.

pollution, diet, lifestyle) that cannot be directly measured for study
subjects. A common strategy in environmental epidemiology is to use a
first-stage (exposure) model to estimate the exposure based on covariates
and/or spatio-temporal proximity and to use predictions from the exposure model
as the covariate of interest in the second-stage (health) model. This induces a
complex form of measurement error. We propose an analytical framework and
methodology that is robust to misspecification of the first-stage model and
provides valid inference for the second-stage model parameter of interest.
  We decompose the measurement error into components analogous to classical and
Berkson error and characterize properties of the estimator in the second-stage
model if the first-stage model predictions are plugged in without correction.
Specifically, we derive conditions for compatibility between the first- and
second-stage models that guarantee consistency (and have direct and important
real-world design implications), and we derive an asymptotic estimate of
finite-sample bias when the compatibility conditions are satisfied. We propose
a methodology that (1) corrects for finite-sample bias and (2) correctly
estimates standard errors. We demonstrate the utility of our methodology in
simulations and an example from air pollution epidemiology.

taking account while dynamically a large number of axions begin away from the
hilltop region(come down from the hill) and so serve only to be the source of
the Hubble rate. Therefore the single field stays closest to the hilltop
sources the non-Gaussianity. In this case most of axions can be replaced by a
single effective field with a quadratic potential. So our potential will
contain two fields. The full cosine is responsible for the axion closest to
hilltop and quadratic term which is a source for Hubble rate [4]. We obtain
power spectrum, spectral index and non-gaussianity parameter, then we impose
conditions from WMAP for power spectrum and spectral index and see how large on
non-gaussianity parameter it is possible to achieve with such conditions.
Finally we swap quadratic term to {\lambda}{\phi}^4 and see whether this makes
it harder or easier to achieve large non-gaussianity.We find large
non-gaussianity is achievable by imposing data from WMAP conditional on axion
decay constant f has reasonable value in connection with Planck mass and by
requiring number of e-folds must be bounded between 40-60.When we swap to
{\lambda}{\phi}^4 we find that it is harder to achieve non-Gaussianity, because
we are imposed to investigate only {\lambda}{\phi}^4 domination in consistency
with WMAP data for spectral index. Although, in this case we find that large
non-gaussianity is still achievable. Finally we verify imposing the condition
for spectral index to be nearly one and find acceptable and detectable value
for non-gaussianity typically of order of 10 and 100 depending on value of
decay constant f.Swapping to {\lambda}{\phi}^4 in this case does not give us
any significant relation. In this paper we consider models which can generate
large non-gaussianity. We restrict ourselves to axion N-flation models.

indicating that He and heavier nuclei such as C-N-O experience similar

constraints provided by the B/C ratio data and within the nuclear uncertainties
arising from errors in the production cross-section data. The astrophysical
uncertainties are expected to be dramatically reduced by the data upcoming from

Consequently, this thesis revolves around two axes: applications and

less constrained and structured one gains more expressive power for the
objective function achieving more accurate models. Results show how
challenging, hard-to-optimize, energies are more adequate for certain computer

additional isometry as well as the subset of these spacetimes in which the
isometry is non-spacelike for all values v.

product of two-level unitary matrices with additional structure and prescribed
determinants. In particular, the decomposition can be done by using two-level
matrices in $d-1$ classes, where each class is isomorphic to the group of
$2\times 2$ unitary matrices. The proposed scheme is easy to apply, and useful
in treating problems with the additional structural restrictions. A Matlab
program is written to implement the scheme, and the result is used to deduce
the fact that every quantum gate acting on $n$-qubit registers can be expressed
as no more than $2^{n-1}(2^n-1)$ fully controlled single-qubit gates chosen
from $2^n-1$ classes, where the quantum gates in each class share the same
$n-1$ control qubits. Moreover, it is shown that it is easy to adjust the
proposed decomposition scheme to take advantage of additional structure
evolving in the process.

generalises the idea of [6] where an $\mathcal{A}_\infty$-algebra was
constructed from one augmentation. This category allows us to define a notion
of equivalence of augmentations when the coefficient ring is a field regardless
of its characteristic. We use simple examples to show that bilinearised
cohomology groups are efficient to distinguish those equivalences classes. We
also generalise the duality exact sequence from [12] in our contest, and
interpret geometrically the bilinearised homology in terms of the Floer

important physical applications. Here we develop a general geometrical
approach, to systematically derive Hamiltonian energy functions for these
objects. In the case of continuous curves, we demand that the energy function
must be invariant under local frame rotations, and it should also transform
covariantly under reparametrizations of the curve. This leads us to consider
energy functions that are constructed from the conserved quantities in the
hierarchy of the integrable nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE). We point
out the existence of a Weyl transformation that we utilize to introduce a dual
hierarchy to the standard NLSE hierarchy. We propose that the dual hierarchy is
also integrable, and we confirm this to the first non-trivial order. In the
discrete case the requirement of reparametrization invariance is void. But the
demand of invariance under local frame rotations prevails, and we utilize it to
introduce a discrete variant of the Zakharov-Shabat recursion relation. We use
this relation to derive frame independent quantities that we propose are the
essentially unique and as such natural candidates for constructing energy
functions for piecewise linear polygonal chains. We also investigate the
discrete version of the Weyl duality transformation. We confirm that in the
continuum limit the discrete energy functions go over to their continuum
counterparts, including the perfect derivative contributions.

emergence was that, in analyzing time series with the step multiple of solar
day, researchers ignored the nature of the solar day itself. In addition,
astrometric instruments used to measure the zenith distance relative the local
normal are, by definition, gravity independent, since the local normal is
tangential to the gravitation field line at the observation point. Therefore,
the measured zenith distances involve all the instantaneous gravitational field
distortions. The direct dependence of the zenith distance observations on the
gravitational effect of the Moon's perigee mass enables us to conclude that the
Chandler wobble is fully independent of the possible motion of the Earth's
rotation axis within the Earth.

auto-paired joint DOA and Doppler frequency shift estimates of all paths via

joint Doppler frequency shift compensation and data detection method is
developed. This method consists of three parts: (a) the received signal is
spatially filtered to get the signal corresponding to each path, and the signal
corresponding to each path is compensated for the Doppler frequency shift in
time domain, (b) the Doppler frequency shift-compensated signals of all paths
are summed together, and (c) the desired information is detected by performing
FFT on the summed signal after excluding the CP. Moreover, we prove that the
channel matrix becomes time-invariant after Doppler frequency shift
compensation and the ICI is effectively avoided. Finally, simulation results
are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare

Phase-mask coronagraphy is advantageous in terms of inner working
angle and discovery space. It is however still plagued by drawbacks such as
sensitivity to tip-tilt errors and chromatism. A nulling stellar coronagraph
based on the adaptive phase-mask concept using polarization interferometry is
presented in this paper. Aims. Our concept aims at dynamically and
achromatically optimizing the nulling efficiency of the coronagraph, making it
more immune to fast low-order aberrations (tip-tilt errors, focus, ...).
Methods. We performed numerical simulations to demonstrate the value of the
proposed method. The active control system will correct for the detrimental
effects of image instabilities on the destructive interference. The mask
adaptability both in size, phase and amplitude also compensates for
manufacturing errors of the mask itself, and potentially for chromatic effects.
Liquid-crystal properties are used to provide variable transmission of an
annulus around the phase mask, but also to achieve the achromatic {\pi} phase
shift in the core of the PSF by rotating the polarization by 180 degrees.
Results. We developed a new concept and showed its practical advantages using
numerical simulations. This new adaptive implementation of the phase-mask
coronagraph could advantageously be used on current and next-generation
adaptive optics systems, enabling small inner working angles without
compromising contrast.

the adiabatic sound speed when the entropic perturbations are zero, has to be
specified as an additional free model parameter. Due to the relations between
the adiabatic sound speed and equations of state (EoS)
$c^2_{s,ad}(a)=w(a)-d\ln(1+w(a))/3 d\ln a$, the equation of state can be
determined up to an integration constant in principle when an adiabatic sound
speed is given. Then there are two degrees of freedom to describe the linear
perturbations for a fluid. Its micro-scale properties are characterized by its
EoS or adiabatic sound speed and an effective sound speed. We take the
effective sound speed and adiabatic sound speed as free model parameters and
then use the currently available cosmic observational data sets, which include
type Ia supernova Union 2.1, baryon acoustic oscillation and WMAP 7-year data
of cosmic background radiation, to constrain the possible entropic
perturbations and the adiabatic sound speed via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method. The results show that the cosmic observations favor a small effective
sound speed $c^2_{s,eff}=0.00155_{- 0.00155}^{+ 0.000319}$ in $1\sigma$ region.

particularly important for the analysis of mathematical models of physical

operators (Perron-Frobenius operators) to identify invariant and
almost-invariant sets has been particularly successful. In the nonautonomous

The present work introduces a new analytic transfer operator construction that
enables the calculation of \emph{finite-time} coherent sets (sets are that
minimally dispersive over a finite time interval). This new construction also
elucidates the role of diffusion in the calculation and we show how properties

discrepancy for the spectra is attributed to coupling of other exciton lines to
the cavity and interference of different propagation paths towards the detector
of the fields emitted by the quantum dot. In contrast, quantitative information
about the system can readily be extracted from the dynamical measurements. In
the case of photonic crystal cavities we observe an anti crossing in the

spectral signature of strong coupling. However, time-resolved measurements
reveal that the actual coupling strength is significantly smaller than

due to cavity feeding by other quantum dots and/or multiexcition complexes

smaller damping is in fact negative. For multiplicative noise in the stiffness,
the situation is more complicated and in fact the transition is reentrant for
intermediate noise strength and damping. For multiplicative noise in the mass,
the results depend on the implementation of the noise. One can take the
velocity or the momentum to be conserved as the mass is changed. In these cases
increasing the mass destabilizes the system. Alternatively, if the change in
mass is caused by the accretion/loss of particles to the Brownian particle,
these processes are asymmetric with momentum conserved upon accretion and

regulator, $R_c$, is determined by the scale of the non-perturbative
fluctuations of QCD vacuum. From the instanton models and from the lattice
$R_c\sim 0.3$ fm. For perturbative gluons with the propagation length $R_c=
0.26$ fm the linear BFKL gives a good description of the proton structure
function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ in a wide range of $x$ and $Q^2$. The NL effects turn out
to be rather weak and amount to the 10% correction to $F_2(x,Q^2)$ for $x\lsim
10^{-5}$. Much more pronounced NL effects were found in the non-linear model,
described in the literature, with a very soft IR regularization corresponding
to the IR cutoff at $\simeq \Lambda^{-1}_{QCD}$. The latter issue is also

terms of a dichotomy between possible and impossible physical transformations -
those that can be caused to happen and those that cannot. This is a departure
from the prevailing conception of fundamental physics which is to predict what
will happen from initial conditions and laws of motion. Several converging
motivations for expecting constructor theory to be a fundamental branch of
physics are discussed. Some principles of the theory are suggested and its
potential for solving various problems and achieving various unifications is
explored. These include providing a theory of information underlying classical
and quantum information; generalising the theory of computation to include all
physical transformations; unifying formal statements of conservation laws with
the stronger operational ones (such as the ruling-out of perpetual motion
machines); expressing the principles of testability and of the computability of
nature (currently deemed methodological and metaphysical respectively) as laws
of physics; allowing exact statements of emergent laws (such as the second law
of thermodynamics); and expressing certain apparently anthropocentric
attributes such as knowledge in physical terms.

allows us to derive the effective Higgs-quark-quark couplings entering FCNC

means of the Green-Kubo method, and the conductivity of MgSiO3 post-perovskite
was found to be significantly anisotropic. The thermal conductivities of all

Assuming a Fe-free lower-mantle composition with mole fractions xMgSiO3 = 0.66
and xMgO = 0.34, the conductivity of the two-phase aggregate was calculated
along a model geotherm. It was found to vary considerably with depth, rising
from 9.5 W/(mK) at the top of the lower mantle to 20.5 W/(mK) at the top of the
thermal boundary layer above the core-mantle boundary. Extrapolation of
experimental data suggests that at deep-mantle conditions, the presence of a
realistic amount of iron impurities lowers the thermal conductivity of the
aggregate by about 50% (Manthilake et al., 2011). From this result and our

bases and the corresponding coefficient quivers may look quite differently. The
aim of this note is to introduce a class of exceptional modules which have a
distinguished tree basis, we call them radiation modules (generalizing an
inductive construction considered already by Kinser). For a Dynkin quiver,
nearly all indecomposable representations turn out to be radiation modules, the
only exception is the maximal indecomposable module in case E_8. Also, the
exceptional representation of the generalized Kronecker quivers are given by
radiation modules. Consequently, with the help of Schofield induction one can
display all the exceptional modules of an arbitrary quiver in a nice way.

T* close to the pseudogap temperature obtained from scanning tunneling

  We shall show that, given a suitable restriction on the growth of the number

finite systems, as well as continuity of topological pressure and Hausdorff
dimension for both finite and infinite systems. In particular, we strengthen
the existing continuity results for infinite autonomous systems.

meromorphic function, the Hausdorff dimension of the set of transitive points

mathematical and philosophical program of logic and semiotics initiated by
Charles Sanders Peirce and further developed by George Spencer-Brown and Louis
Kauffman. The latter school is more philosophical than is usual with the
practitioners of Bayesian inference and claims the existence of a world mind.
When these two disciplines inform each other semiotics is provided with
mathematical mechanism and Bayesian inference is seen to be closely related to
the act of distinction, the fundamental basis of logic in the work of
Spencer-Brown. This hybridization also suggests a definition for knowledge
within Bayesian inference; a definition that has been curiously lacking. Given
that Darwinian processes are physical implementations of Bayesian inference and
are utilized within numerous scientific theories across a wide range of
disciplines as mechanisms for the creation and evolution of knowledge we may
view the conjunction of these theories, within universal Darwinism, as
descriptive of a world mind. Placing the world mind in this context provides
detailed support from the scientific literature and goes some way to refute the
charges of mysticism which have been leveled at the semiotic approach.
