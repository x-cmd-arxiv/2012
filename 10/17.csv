magnetic properties of hadrons can be determined using lattice QCD in magnetic
fields. To compute the magnetic moments and polarizabilities of charged
hadrons, for example, one requires sufficiently weak magnetic fields. Such
field strengths, however, lead to closely spaced Landau levels that are not
straightforwardly resolved using standard lattice spectroscopy. Focusing on
charged spinless hadrons, we introduce a simple projection technique that can
be used to isolate the lowest Landau level. As the technique requires the
explicit coordinate-space wave-function, we investigate the extent to which the
continuum, infinite volume wave-function can be employed. We find that, in
practice, the effects of discretization can be handled using a perturbative
expansion about the continuum. Finite volume corrections are taken into account
by using the discrete magnetic translational invariance of the torus. We show
that quantized magnetic fields can lead to pernicious volume effects which
depend on the magnetic flux quantum, rather than on the lattice volume.

tie the Jacobian Conjecture in dimension two to certain Zeta functions, thereby
invoking a powerful arithmetic machinery to handle the two dimensional Jacobian
Conjecture. Let us denote by ${\rm et}(\mathbb{C}^2)$ the semigroup of two
dimensional Keller mappings. We would like to prove something like the
following: a) That there exists an infinite index set $I$, and a family of
mappings indexed by $I$, $\{F_i\,|\,i\in I\} \subset {\rm et}(\mathbb{C}^2)$
such that $$ {\rm et}(\mathbb{C}^2)={\rm Aut}(\mathbb{C}^2)\cup\bigcup_{i\in I}

parallel representation to the representation described in (a) above holds
true, this time with respect to the left composition operators $L_{G_j}$.
  These two claims will be the basis for a fractal structure on ${\rm
et}(\mathbb{C}^2)$ because the pieces $R_{F_i}({\rm et}(\mathbb{C}^2))$ are
similar to each other in the sense that they are homeomorphic, and we further
have the scaling property of self-similarity, namely $R_F({\rm

et}(\mathbb{C}^2))$ that is homeomorphic to its proper subspace $R_{H\circ
G\circ F}({\rm et}(\mathbb{C}^2))$ etc . This is the right place to remark that
the purpose of the current paper is to start and develop the parallel theory
for entire functions in one complex variable. Results in this setting will hint

twentieth century. Most models haven't considered the role that emotional
factors of the individual may play on the population's behavioral adaptation
during the spread of a pandemic disease. Considering that local interactions
among individuals generate patterns that -at a large scale- govern the action
of masses, we have studied the behavioral adaptation of a population induced by
the spread of an infectious disease. Therefore, we have developed a rule-based
model of a hypothetical zombie outbreak, written in Kappa language, and
simulated using Guillespie's stochastic approach. Our study addresses the
specificity and heterogeneity of the system at the individual level, a highly
desirable characteristic, mostly overlooked in classic epidemic models.
Together with the basic elements of a typical epidemiological model, our model
includes an individual representation of the disease progression and the
traveling of agents among cities being affected. It also introduces an
approximation to measure the effect of panic in the population as a function of
the individual situational awareness. In addition, the effect of two possible
countermeasures to overcome the zombie threat is considered: the availability
of medical treatment and the deployment of special armed forces. However, due
to the special characteristics of this hypothetical infectious disease, even
using exaggerated numbers of countermeasures, only a small percentage of the
population can be saved at the end of the simulations. As expected from a
rule-based model approach, the global dynamics of our model resulted primarily
governed by the mechanistic description of local interactions occurring at the
individual level. As a whole, people's situational awareness resulted essential
to modulate the inner dynamics of the system.

as our society increasingly relies on satellite dependent technologies. The
forecasting of flare and CME related transient geomagnetic storms has become a
primary initiative, however, minor magnetic storms caused by coronal holes
(CHs) have also proven to be of high importance due to their long lasting and
recurrent geomagnetic effects. In order to study CH properties, the author
developed an automated CH detection method (CHARM), which uses local intensity
histograms to identify CH boundaries. An additional algorithm package (CHEVOL)
was developed to study individual CHs by tracking their boundary evolution. It
is widely accepted that the short-term changes in CH boundaries are due to the
interchange reconnection between the CH open field lines and small loops. In
order to test the interchange reconnection model, the magnetic reconnection
rate and the diffusion coefficient at CH boundaries were determined using
observed CH boundary displacement velocities. The results were found to be in
agreement with those determined by the theory. The MIST algorithm was developed
by the author to build on the CHARM package, providing a fast and consistent
way to link CHs to high-speed solar wind periods detected at Earth. This
allowed us to carry out a long-term analysis (2000-2009) to study the
relationship between CHs, the corresponding HSSW properties, and geomagnetic
indices. The relationship between CH related high-speed solar wind streams and
the electron flux enhancements in the Van Allen radiation belt was confirmed.
The research presented in this thesis includes the small-scale analysis of
individual CHs on time scales of days, which is complemented with large scale
analysis of CH groups on time scales of years. This allowed us to further our
understanding of CH evolution as a whole.

wiretap secret-key (WSK) capacity for the discrete source model, we use an
alternative achievability scheme that may be useful for practical applications.
As a side result, we conveniently extend known bounds to the case of a
continuous source model. Specifically, we consider a sequential key-generation
strategy, that implements a rate-limited reconciliation step to handle
reliability, followed by a privacy amplification step performed with extractors
to handle secrecy. We prove that such a sequential strategy achieves the best
known bounds for the rate-limited WSK capacity (under the assumption of
degraded sources in the case of two-way communication). However, we show that,
unlike the case of rate-unlimited public communication, achieving the
reconciliation capacity in a sequential strategy does not necessarily lead to
achieving the best known bounds for the WSK capacity. Consequently, reliability
and secrecy can be treated successively but not independently, thereby
exhibiting a limitation of sequential strategies for rate-limited public
communication. Nevertheless, we provide scenarios for which reliability and
secrecy can be treated successively and independently, such as the two-way
rate-limited SK capacity, the one-way rate-limited WSK capacity for degraded
binary symmetric sources, and the one-way rate-limited WSK capacity for
Gaussian degraded sources.

constructing coarse grained observables and decomposing the fluctuations of

thermodynamic limit of many-body quantum states with spin-s sites, that possess
full symmetry under exchange of sites. It turns out that there is essentially a
one-to-one correspondence between such thermodynamic states and probability
measures on CP^{2s}. Let a measure be supported on a set of possibly fractal
real dimension d with respect to the Study-Fubini metric of CP^{2s}. Let m be
the number of sites in a subsystem of the bipartition. We give evidence that in
the limit where m goes to infinity, the entanglement entropy diverges like
(d/2)log(m). Further, if the measure is supported on a submanifold of CP^{2s}
and can be described by a density f with respect to the metric induced by the
Study-Fubini metric, we give evidence that the correction term is simply
related to the entropy associated to f: the geometric entropy of geometric
quantum mechanics. This extends results obtained by the authors in a recent
letter where the spin-1/2 case was considered. Here we provide more examples as
well as detailed accounts of the ideas and computations leading to these
general results. For special choices of the state in the spin-s situation, we
recover the scaling behaviour previously observed by Popkov et al., showing
that their result is but a special case of a more general scaling law.

that have been determined in a statistically meaningful manner. Furthermore,
reaction rate probability density distributions have been determined and
published in the form of lognormal parameters with the specific goal of
pursuing Monte Carlo nucleosynthesis studies.
  Aims: To test and assess different methods of randomly sampling over reaction
rate probability densities and to determine the most accurate method for
estimating elemental abundance uncertainties.
  Methods: Experimental Monte Carlo reaction rates are first computed for the
22Ne+alpha, 20Ne(p,g)21Na, 25Mg(p,g)26Al, and 18F(p,alpha)15O reactions, which
are used to calculate reference nucleosynthesis yields for 16 nuclei affected
by nucleosynthesis in massive stars and classical novae. Five different methods
of randomly sampling over these reaction rate probability distributions are
then developed, tested, and compared with the reference nucleosynthesis yields.
  Results: Given that the reaction rate probability density distributions can
be described accurately with a lognormal distribution, Monte Carlo
nucleosynthesis variations arising from the parametrised estimates for the
reaction rate variations agree remarkably well with those obtained from the
true rate samples. Most significantly, the most simple parametrisation agrees
within just a few percent, meaning that Monte Carlo nucleosynthesis studies can
be performed reliably using lognormal parametrisations of reaction rate
probability density functions.

disrupted by a BCS condensate. Our results suggest that the quark contribution
to the energy density is negative (and balanced by a positive gauge
contribution), although this result is highly sensitive to details of the
energy renormalisation. We also find evidence that the chiral condensate in
this region vanishes in the massless limit. This region gives way to a region
of deconfined quark matter at higher T and mu, with the deconfinement
temperature, determined from the renormalised Polyakov loop, decreasing only
very slowly with increasing chemical potential. The quark number susceptibility
chi_q does not exhibit any qualitative change at the deconfinement transition.
We argue that this is because chi_q is not an appropriate measure of

parabolic-elliptic Patlak-Keller-Segel system with a nonlinear sensitivity
involving a critical power. For $N = 2$, the latter reduces to the classical
linear model, well-known for its critical mass $8\pi$. We show that a critical
mass phenomenon also occurs for $N \geq 3$, but with a strongly different
qualitative behaviour. More precisely, if the total mass of cells is smaller or
equal to the critical mass M, then the cell density converges to a regular
steady state with support strictly inside the ball as time goes to infinity. In
the case of the critical mass, this result is nontrivial since there exists a
continuum of stationary solutions and is moreover in sharp contrast with the
case $N = 2$ where infinite time blow-up occurs. If the total mass of cells is
larger than M, then all solutions blow up in finite time. This actually follows

of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations (MHD) in unbounded domains.
In particular we describe an hyperbolic version of the so called artificial
compressibility method adapted to the MHD system. By exploiting the wave
equation structure of the approximating system we achieve the convergence of
the approximating sequences by means of dispersive estimate of Strichartz type.
We prove that the soleinoidal component of the approximating velocity and
magnetic fields is relatively compact and converges strongly to a weak solution

role in shaping patterns of molecular evolution in natural populations. Yet
efforts to infer these effects from DNA sequence data are limited by our
incomplete understanding of weak selection on local genomic scales. Here, we
demonstrate a natural symmetry between weak and strong selection, in which the
effects of many weakly selected mutations on patterns of molecular evolution
are equivalent to a smaller number of more strongly selected mutations. By
introducing a coarse-grained ""effective selection coefficient,"" we derive an
explicit mapping between weakly selected populations and their strongly
selected counterparts, which allows us to make accurate and efficient
predictions across the full range of selection strengths. This suggests that an
effective selection coefficient and effective mutation rate --- not an
effective population size --- is the most accurate summary of the effects of
selection over locally linked regions. Moreover, this correspondence places
fundamental limits on our ability to resolve the effects of weak selection from
contemporary sequence data alone.

Rayleigh fading, Ricean fading or Nakagami fading and driven by discrete inputs

observations of Cen X-4, where the X-ray flux (0.5 - 10 keV) varies by a factor
of 6.5 between the brightest and faintest states. We find a positive
correlation between the X-ray flux and the simultaneous near-UV flux, where as
there is no significant correlation between the X-ray and simultaneous optical
(V, B) fluxes. This suggests that while the X-ray and UV emitting regions are
somehow linked, the optical region originates elsewhere. Comparing the
luminosities, it is plausible that the UV emission originates due to
reprocessing of the X-ray flux by the accretion disk, with the hot inner region
of the disk being a possible location for the UV emitting region. The optical
emission, however, could be dominated by the donor star. The X-ray/UV
correlation does not favour the accretion stream-impact point as the source of

of a user, recommendations for an area never explored before provided by other
peers, tracking of friends, monetary rewards in the form of special deals from
the venues visited as well as a cheap way of advertisement for the latter.
However, service convenience and security have followed disjoint paths in LBSNs
and users can misuse the offered features. The major threat for the service
providers is that of fake check-ins. Users can easily manipulate the
localization module of the underlying application and declare their presence in
a counterfeit location. The incentives for these behaviors can be both earning
monetary as well as virtual rewards. Therefore, while fake check-ins driven
from the former motive can cause monetary losses, those aiming in virtual

ECDFS Near-Infrared Survey (TENIS). The median 5-sigma limiting magnitudes for
all detected objects in the ECDFS reach 24.5 and 23.9 mag (AB) for J and Ks,
respectively. In the inner 400 arcmin^2 region where the sensitivity is more
uniform, objects as faint as 25.6 and 25.0 mag are detected at 5-sigma. So this
is by far the deepest J and Ks datasets available for the ECDFS. To combine the
TENIS with the Spitzer IRAC data for obtaining better spectral energy
distributions of high-redshift objects, we developed a novel deconvolution
technique (IRACLEAN) to accurately estimate the IRAC fluxes. IRACLEAN can
minimize the effect of blending in the IRAC images caused by the large
point-spread functions and reduce the confusion noise. We applied IRACLEAN to
the images from the Spitzer IRAC/MUSYC Public Legacy in the ECDFS survey
(SIMPLE) and generated a J+Ks selected multi-wavelength catalog including the
photometry of both the TENIS near-infrared and the SIMPLE IRAC data. We
publicly release the data products derived from this work, including the J and

people do not perceive (i.e. see, hear, feel or smell) their environment
equally well in all directions. The dynamics of the individuals in our model
follow from a system of Newton-like equations in the overdamped limit. The
instantaneous velocity is modelled in such a way that it accounts for the angle
under which an individual perceives another individual. We investigate the
effects of this perception anisotropy by means of simulations, very much in the
spirit of molecular dynamics. We define a number of characteristic quantifiers
(including the polarization index and Morisita index) that serve as measures
for e.g. organization and clustering, and we use these indices to investigate
the influence of anisotropy on the global behaviour of the crowd. The goal of
the paper is to investigate the potentiality of this model; extensive
statistical analysis of simulation data, or reproducing any specific real-life

a single binary object that we call the ubit, which is not localized and which
can interact with any object in the world. Ordinary complex-vector-space
quantum theory can be recovered from this model if we simply impose a certain
restriction on the sets of allowed measurements and transformations
(Stueckelberg's rule), but in this paper we try to obtain the standard theory,
or a close approximation to it, without invoking such a restriction. We look
particularly at the effective theory that applies to a subsystem when the ubit
is interacting with a much larger environment. In a certain limit it turns out
that the ubit-environment interaction has the effect of enforcing
Stueckelberg's rule automatically, and we obtain a one-parameter family of
effective theories--modifications of standard quantum theory--that all satisfy
this rule. The one parameter is the ratio s/omega, where s quantifies the
strength of the ubit's interaction with the rest of the world and omega is the
ubit's rotation rate. We find that when this parameter is small but not zero,
the effective theory is similar to standard quantum theory but is characterized
by spontaneous decoherence of isolated systems.

the first sizeable sample of 34 low-luminosity radio galaxies at high
redshifts, selected in the COSMOS field. To model the SEDs we use two different
template-fitting techniques: i) the Hyperz code that only considers single
stellar templates and ii) our own developed technique 2SPD that also includes
the contribution from a young stellar population and dust emission. The
resulting photometric redshifts range from z ~0.7 to 3 and are in substantial
agreement with measurements from earlier work, but significantly more accurate.
The SED of most objects is consistent with a dominant contribution from an old
stellar population with an age ~1 - 3 10^{9} years. The inferred total stellar
mass range is ~10^{10} - 10^{12} M(sun). Dust emission is needed to account for
the 24micron emission in 15 objects. Estimates of the dust luminosity yield
values in the range L_{dust} ~10^{43.5} -10^{45.5} erg s^{-1}. The global dust
temperature, crudely estimated for the sources with a MIR excess, is ~ 300-850
K. A UV excess is often observed with a luminosity in the range ~
10^{42}-10^{44} erg s^{-1} at 2000 A rest frame.
  Our results show that the hosts of these high-z low-luminosity radio sources
are old massive galaxies, similarly to the local FRIs. However, the UV and MIR
excesses indicate the possible significant contribution from star formation
and/or nuclear activity in such bands, not seen in low-z FRIs. Our sources
display a wide variety of properties: from possible quasars at the highest
luminosities, to low-luminosity old galaxies.

consider both discontinuous and smooth transitions between the radiative and
convective regions and derive Green's functions to solve for the IGWs in the

smooth, the IGW flux depends on the exact form of the buoyancy frequency near
the interface. IGW excitation is most efficient for very smooth interfaces,
which gives an upper bound on the IGW flux of ~ F_conv (d/H), where F_conv is
the flux carried by the convective motions, d is the width of the transition
region, and H is the pressure scale height. This can be much larger than the
standard result in the literature for a discontinuous radiative-convective
transition, which gives a wave flux ~ F_conv M$, where M is the convective Mach
number. However, in the smooth transition case, the most efficiently excited
perturbations will break in the radiative zone. The flux of IGWs which do not
break and are able to propagate in the radiative region is at most F_conv
M^(5/8) (d/H)^(3/8), larger than the discontinuous transition result by
(MH/d)^(-3/8). The transition region in the Sun is smooth for the
energy-bearing waves; as a result, we predict that the IGW flux is a few to
five times larger than previous estimates. We discuss the implications of our

radio galaxies (HzRGs) at z~3.6 (4C03.24 & 4C19.71) and use these to
investigate the origin of extended, Inverse Compton (IC) powered X-ray halos at
high z. The halos have X-ray luminosities of Lx~3e44 erg/s and sizes of ~60kpc.
Their morphologies are broadly similar to the ~60-kpc long radio lobes around
these galaxies suggesting they are formed from IC scattering by relativistic
electrons in the radio lobes, of either CMB or FIR photons from the
dust-obscured starbursts in these galaxies. These observations double the
number of z>3 HzRGs with X-ray detected IC halos. We compare the IC X-ray to
radio luminosity ratios for these new detections to the two previously detected
z~3.8 HzRGs. Given the similar redshifts, we would expect comparable X-ray IC
luminosities if CMB mm photons are the seed field for the IC emission. Instead
the two z~3.6 HzRGs, which are ~4x fainter in the FIR, also have ~4x fainter
X-ray IC emission. Including a further six z>2 radio sources with IC X-ray
halos from the literature, we suggest that in the more compact (lobe sizes
<100-200kpc), majority of radio sources, the bulk of the IC emission may be
driven by scattering of locally produced FIR photons from luminous,
dust-obscured starbursts within these galaxies, rather than CMB photons. The
resulting X-ray emission can ionise the gas on ~100-200-kpc scales around these
systems and thus form their extended Ly-alpha emission line halos. The
starburst and AGN activity in these galaxies are thus combining to produce an
effective and wide-spread ""feedback"" process, acting on the long-term gas
reservoir for the galaxy. If episodic radio activity and co-eval starbursts are
common in massive, high-z galaxies, then this IC-feedback mechanism may affect
the star-formation histories of massive galaxies. [Abridged]

subdominant, contribution is expected to come from the process of large-scale
structure formation. The growth of structures is accompanied by accretion and
merger shocks, which would, with at least some magnetic field present, give
rise to a population of structure-formation cosmic rays (SFCRs). Though
expected, this cosmic-ray population is still hypothetical and only very weak
limits have been placed to their contribution to the EGRB. The most promising

are weak (above the observed EGRB) in some case, in others, some of our models
can provide a good fit to the observed EGRB. More importantly, we show that
these large-scale shocks could still give an important contribution to the

emission would help place tighter constraints on our models and give us a
better insight into large-scale shocks forming around them.

preceded by two 'orphan' gamma-ray flares. The near-infrared data reveal the
high-energy cut-off in the main synchrotron component, which cannot be
associated with the main gamma-ray component in a one-zone leptonic model. This
is because in such a model the luminosity ratio of the External-Compton and

of the external radiation would be implied. Therefore, we consider a
well-constrained two-zone blazar model to interpret the entire dataset. In this

component produced in the hot-dust region at the supra-pc scale, while the
gamma-ray emission is associated with the External-Compton component produced
in the broad-line region at the sub-pc scale. In addition, the optical/UV
emission is associated with the accretion disk thermal emission, with the

environment for a volume-limited sample of 12500 nearby galaxies from SDSS. We
focus on galaxies with classical bulges. Classical bulges seem to have the same
formation history as ellipticals of the same mass, and we test if environment
determines whether or not a classical bulge possesses a disc. Using the
projected fifth nearest neighbour density as a measure of local environment, we
look for correlations with environment at fixed bulge stellar mass. In groups
with fewer than 20 members, we find no evidence for changes in disc morphology
with local density. At fixed bulge mass, disc mass and disc scale length are
independent of local density. However, disc colour does increase (Delta(g - r)
~ 0.05 mag) as a function of local density in relatively poor groups.
Therefore, the colour--density relation for classical bulge+disc galaxies in
the field and in poor groups is due solely to changes in disc colour with
density. In contrast, we find no correlations between disc colour and local
density for classical bulge+disc galaxies in large, relaxed groups and
clusters. However, there is a weak correlation between disc mass and group
crossing time, suggesting morphological transformation takes places in rich
groups. Our results add to the evidence that star formation is quenched in
group environments, instead of clusters, and that star formation quenching and
morphological transformation are separate processes. Overall, we show that
environment has two effects on galactic discs: relatively low density
environments can quench star formation in discs, while processes occurring in

Numerical studies of these nonlinear effects are challenging because

easily lead to unphysical solutions. In particular, if the number of angle bins
N_a is too small, flavor conversion begins too deep and produces completely
spurious results. At the same time, N_a=1 (single-angle approximation) can be a
good proxy for the N_a -> infinity limit. Based on a linearized stability

examined in the context of the cosmic web. Halo spin, shape and the orbital
angular momentum of subhaloes is investigated relative to the LSS using the
eigenvectors of the velocity shear tensor evaluated on a grid with a scale of 1
Mpc/h, deep within the non-linear regime. Knots, filaments, sheets and voids
are associated with regions that are collapsing along 3, 2, 1 or 0 principal
directions simultaneously. Each halo is tagged with a web classification (i.e.
knot halo, filament halo, etc) according to the nature of the collapse at the
halo's position. The full distribution of shear eigenvalues is found to be
substantially different from that tagged to haloes, indicating that the
observed velocity shear is significantly biased. We find that larger mass
haloes live in regions where the shear is more isotropic, namely the expansion
or collapse is more spherical. A correlation is found between the halo's shape
and the eigenvectors of the shear tensor, with the longest (shortest) axis of
the halo's shape being aligned with the slowest (fastest) collapsing
eigenvector. This correlation is web independent, suggesting that the velocity
shear is a fundamental tracer of the halo alignment. A similar result is found
for the alignment of halo spin with the cosmic web. It has been shown that high
mass haloes exhibit a spin flip with respect to the LSS: we find the mass at
which this spin flip occurs is web dependent and not universal as suggested
previously. Although weaker than haloes, subhalo orbits too exhibit an
alignment with the LSS, providing a possible insight into the highly correlated
co-rotation of the Milky Way's satellite system. The present study suggests
that the velocity shear tensor constitutes the natural framework for studying
the directional properties of the non-linear LSS and of halos and galaxies.

detect galactic dark matter subhalos of ~ 10^8 M_{\odot} with high significance

more than 5 sigma detection significance in each lens, if the abundance of

Be star HD 100546. The emission from both molecules arises from the inner
region of the disk extending from approximately 13 AU from the central star.
The velocity profiles of the OH lines are narrower than the velocity profile of
the [O I] 6300 Angstrom line indicating that the OH in the disk is not
cospatial with the O I. This suggests that the inner optically thin region of
the disk is largely devoid of molecular gas. Unlike the ro-vibrational CO
emission lines, the OH lines are highly asymmetric. We show that the average CO
and average OH line profiles can be fit with a model of a disk comprised of an
eccentric inner wall and a circular outer disk. In this model, the vast
majority of the OH flux (75%) originates from the inner wall, while the vast
majority of the CO flux (65%) originates on the surface of the disk at radii
greater than 13 AU. Eccentric inner disks are predicted by hydrodynamic
simulations of circumstellar disks containing an embedded giant planet. We
discuss the implications of such a disk geometry in light of models of planet
disk tidal interactions and propose alternate explanations for the origin of
the asymmetry.

observed with Suzaku. Our work focuses on studying the potential contribution
from relativistic disc reflection, and examining the implications of this
interpretation for the intrinsic spectral complexities frequently displayed by
AGN in the X-ray bandpass. During the analysis, we take the unique approach of
attempting to simultaneously undertake a systematic analysis of the whole
sample, as well as a detailed treatment of each individual source, and find
that disc reflection has the required flexibility to successfully reproduce the
broadband spectrum observed for all of the sources considered. Where possible,
we use the reflected emission to place constraints on the black hole spin for
this sample of sources. Our analysis suggests a general preference for rapidly
rotating black holes, which if taken at face value is most consistent with the
scenario in which SMBH growth is dominated by prolonged, ordered accretion.
However, there may be observational biases towards AGN with high spin in the
compiled sample, limiting our ability to draw strong conclusions for the
general population at this stage. Finally, contrary to popular belief, our
analysis also implies that the dichotomy between radio loud/radio quiet AGN is

the pronounced inhibition of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as the jet

buckles in a manner similar to the Newtonian solvent but once again the

highly accurate predictor. Despite the practical importance of multi-class
boosting, it has received far less attention than its binary counterpart. In
this work, we propose a fully-corrective multi-class boosting formulation which
directly solves the multi-class problem without dividing it into multiple
binary classification problems. In contrast, most previous multi-class boosting
algorithms decompose a multi-boost problem into multiple binary boosting
problems. By explicitly deriving the Lagrange dual of the primal optimization
problem, we are able to construct a column generation-based fully-corrective
approach to boosting which directly optimizes multi-class classification
performance. The new approach not only updates all weak learners' coefficients
at every iteration, but does so in a manner flexible enough to accommodate
various loss functions and regularizations. For example, it enables us to
introduce structural sparsity through mixed-norm regularization to promote
group sparsity and feature sharing. Boosting with shared features is
particularly beneficial in complex prediction problems where features can be
expensive to compute. Our experiments on various data sets demonstrate that our
direct multi-class boosting generalizes as well as, or better than, a range of
competing multi-class boosting methods. The end result is a highly effective
and compact ensemble classifier which can be trained in a distributed fashion.

energy. A new calibration sample of 60 Galactic SNRs with independently
determined distances is created. Instead of (standard) vertical regression,
used in previous papers, different fitting procedures are applied to the
calibration sample in the log {\Sigma} - log D plane. Non-standard regressions
are used to satisfy the requirement that values of parameters obtained from the
fitting of {\Sigma} - D and D - {\Sigma} relations should be invariant within
estimated uncertainties. We impose symmetry between {\Sigma} - D and D -
{\Sigma} due to the existence of large scatter in both D and {\Sigma}. Using
four fitting methods which treat {\Sigma} and D symmetrically, different
{\Sigma} - D slopes {\beta} are obtained for the calibration sample. Monte
Carlo simulations verify that the slopes of the empirical {\Sigma} - D relation
should be determined by using orthogonal regression, because of its good
performance for data sets with severe scatter. The slope derived here ({\beta}
= 4.8) is significantly steeper than those derived in previous studies. This
new slope is closer to the updated theoretically predicted surface
brightness-diameter slope in the radio range for the Sedov phase. We also
analyze the empirical {\Sigma} - D relations for SNRs in the dense environment

Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager aboard the \emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory},
we statistically investigate the emerging dimmings (EDs) of 24 isolated active
regions (IARs) from June 2010 to May 2011. All the IARs present EDs in lower
temperature lines (e.g., 171 {\AA}) at their early emerging stages, meanwhile
in higher temperature lines (e.g., 211 {\AA}), the ED regions brighten
continuously. There are two type of EDs: fan-shaped and halo-shaped. There are
19 fan-shaped EDs and 5 halo-shaped ones. The EDs appear several to more than
ten hours delay to the first emergence of the IARs. The shortest delay is 3.6
hr and the longest 19.0 hr. The EDs last from 3.3 hr to 14.2 hr, with a mean
duration of 8.3 hr. Before the appearance of the EDs, the emergence rate of the
magnetic flux of the IARs is from 1.2 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ Mx hr$^{-1}$ to 1.4
$\times$ 10$^{20}$ Mx hr$^{-1}$. The larger the emergence rate is, the shorter
the delay time is. While the dimmings appear, the magnetic flux of the IARs
ranges from 8.8 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ Mx to 1.3 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ Mx. These
observations imply that the reconfiguration of the coronal magnetic fields due
to reconnection between the newly-emerging flux and the surrounding existing
fields results in a new thermal distribution which leads to a dimming for the
cooler channel (171 {\AA}) and brightnening in the warmer channels.

freedom of an electron, namely, its charge and spin. The exploration of novel
electronic degrees of freedom has important implications in both basic quantum
physics and advanced information technology. Valley as a new electronic degree
of freedom has received considerable attention in recent years. In this paper,
we develop the theory of spin and valley physics of an antiferromagnetic
honeycomb lattice. We show that by coupling the valley degree of freedom to
antiferromagnetic order, there is an emergent electronic degree of freedom
characterized by the product of spin and valley indices, which leads to
spin-valley dependent optical selection rule and Berry curvature-induced
topological quantum transport. These properties will enable optical
polarization in the spin-valley space, and electrical detection/manipulation
through the induced spin, valley and charge fluxes. The domain walls of an
antiferromagnetic honeycomb lattice harbors valley-protected edge states that
support spin-dependent transport. Finally, we employ first principles
calculations to show that the proposed optoelectronic properties can be
realized in antiferromagnetic manganese chalcogenophosphates (MnPX_3, X = S,
Se) in monolayer form.

conventional approaches. Simulations using realistic MHD data indicate that the
method is stable for all resolutions, including those with pixel scales well

an increase in the resolution of the data to the diffraction limit of the

However, it remains
difficult to increase the number of channels per node, thus the maximal degree
of the network may be bounded. This is typically the case in grid topology
networks, where each node has at most four neighbors. In this paper, we address
the following issue: if each node is likely to fail in an unpredictable manner,
how can we preserve some global reliability guarantees when the number of nodes
keeps increasing unboundedly ? To be more specific, we consider the problem or
reliably broadcasting information on an asynchronous grid in the presence of
Byzantine failures -- that is, some nodes may have an arbitrary and potentially
malicious behavior. Our requirement is that a constant fraction of correct
nodes remain able to achieve reliable communication. Existing solutions can
only tolerate a fixed number of Byzantine failures if they adopt a worst-case
placement scheme. Besides, if we assume a constant Byzantine ratio (each node
has the same probability to be Byzantine), the probability to have a fatal
placement approaches 1 when the number of nodes increases, and reliability
guarantees collapse. In this paper, we propose the first broadcast protocol
that overcomes these difficulties. First, the number of Byzantine failures that
can be tolerated (if they adopt the worst-case placement) now increases with
the number of nodes. Second, we are able to tolerate a constant Byzantine
ratio, however large the grid may be. In other words, the grid becomes
scalable. This result has important security applications in ultra-large

and possibly temporally varying, habitat qualities, which are commonly used in
ecology to study the fate of spatially extended natural populations. We propose
new techniques that allow to disentangle the respective contributions of
demography and dispersal to the dynamics and fate of a single species in a
source-sink metapopulation. Our approach is valid for a general class of
stochastic, individual-based, stepping-stone models, with density-independent
demography and dispersal, provided the metapopulation is finite or else enjoys
some transitivity property. We provide 1) a simple criterion of persistence, by
studying the motion of a single random disperser until it returns to its
initial position; 2) a joint characterization of the long-term growth rate and
of the asymptotic occupancy frequencies of the ancestral lineage of a random
survivor, by using large deviations theory. Both techniques yield formulae
decoupling demography and dispersal, and can be adapted to the case of periodic
or random environments, where habitat qualities are autocorrelated in space and
possibly in time. In this last case, we display examples of coupled
time-averaged sinks allowing survival, as was previously known in the absence
of demographic stochasticity for fully mixing (Jansen and Yoshimura, 1998) and
even partially mixing (Evans et al., 2012; Schreiber, 2010) metapopulations.

of the Crab pulsar to evaluate the accuracy of the pulse period determination
by comparing the values obtained by the XRT timing analysis with the values
derived from radio monitoring. We also check the absolute time reconstruction
measuring the phase position of the main peak in the Crab profile and comparing
it both with the value reported in literature and with the result that we
obtain from a simultaneous Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observation. We
find that the accuracy in period determination for the Crab pulsar is of the
order of a few picoseconds for the observation with the largest data time span.
The absolute time reconstruction, measured using the position of the Crab main
peak, shows that the main peak anticipates the phase of the position reported
in literature for RXTE by ~270 microseconds on average (~150 microseconds when
data are reduced with the attitude file corrected with the UVOT data). The
analysis of the simultaneous Swift-XRT and RXTE Proportional Counter Array
(PCA) observations confirms that the XRT Crab profile leads the PCA profile by
~200 microseconds. The analysis of XRT Photodiode mode data and BAT event data
shows a main peak position in good agreement with the RXTE, suggesting the
discrepancy observed in XRT data in Windowed Timing mode is likely due to a
systematic offset in the time assignment for this XRT read out mode.

two families of cycles are constructed as solution to a ""differential system""

an outcome is arguably the most common objective of experimental and
observational studies in the health and social sciences, in recent years,
investigators have also become increasingly interested in mediation analysis.
Specifically, upon evaluating the total effect of the exposure, investigators
routinely wish to make inferences about the direct or indirect pathways of the
effect of the exposure, through a mediator variable or not, that occurs
subsequently to the exposure and prior to the outcome. Although powerful
semiparametric methodologies have been developed to analyze observational
studies that produce double robust and highly efficient estimates of the
marginal total causal effect, similar methods for mediation analysis are
currently lacking. Thus, this paper develops a general semiparametric framework
for obtaining inferences about so-called marginal natural direct and indirect
causal effects, while appropriately accounting for a large number of
pre-exposure confounding factors for the exposure and the mediator variables.
Our analytic framework is particularly appealing, because it gives new insights
on issues of efficiency and robustness in the context of mediation analysis. In
particular, we propose new multiply robust locally efficient estimators of the
marginal natural indirect and direct causal effects, and develop a novel double
robust sensitivity analysis framework for the assumption of ignorability of the
mediator variable.

Several acceleration techniques are presented. We explain how cognitive users
can improve the convergence rate based only on few number of measurements. The
methodology provides nice properties in mean field games where the payoff
function depends only on own-action and the mean of the mean-field (first

learning framework is suitable not only for games but also for non-convex
global optimization problems. Then, we introduce mean-field learning without

which have interesting applications in financial markets. Finally, we provide a

the detection of several single pulse events, some repeating at the same
dispersion measure, which could potentially originate from neutron stars in
M31. One in particular was seen multiple times, including a burst of six pulses
in 2000 seconds, at a dispersion measure of 54.7 pc cm^-3, which potentially
places the origin of this source outside of our Galaxy. Our results are
compared to a range of hypothetical populations of pulsars and RRATs in M31 and
allow us to constrain the luminosity function of pulsars in M31. They also show
that, unless the pulsar population in M31 is much dimmer than in our Galaxy,
there is no need to invoke any violation of the inverse square law of the
distance for pulsar fluxes.

randomization and minimization methods [Pocock and Simon Biometrics 31 (1975)

stratified permuted block randomization fails to achieve good overall balance
when the number of strata is large, whereas traditional minimization methods
also suffer from the potential drawback of large within-stratum imbalances.
Moreover, the theoretical bases of minimization methods remain largely elusive.
In this paper, we propose a new covariate-adaptive design that is able to
control various types of imbalances. We show that the joint process of
within-stratum imbalances is a positive recurrent Markov chain under certain
conditions. Therefore, this new procedure yields more balanced allocation. The
advantages of the proposed procedure are also demonstrated by extensive
simulation studies. Our work provides a theoretical tool for future research in
this area.

$\sum_{v\in E_i}{\lambda(v)}>0$, for all hyperedges $E_i\in \mathcal E$, and
$\sum_{v\in E_i}{\lambda(v)}\ne \sum_{v\in E_j}{\lambda(v)}$, for every two

an edge-discriminator on $\mathcal H$ satisfying $\sum_{v\in \mathcal

the minimum is taken over all edge-discriminators on $\mathcal H$. We prove
that any hypergraph $\mathcal H=(\mathcal V, \mathcal E)$, with $|\mathcal

and equality holds if and only if the elements of $\mathcal E$ are mutually

follows from results on Sidon sequences that $\sum_{v\in \mathcal

the bound is attained up to a constant factor by the complete $r$-uniform

Finally, we show that no optimal edge-discriminator on any hypergraph $\mathcal

analyze simultaneously the trend and {\it dynamics} of the seasonality such as
time-varying frequency and amplitude, and the {\it adaptivity} of the analysis

parallel computational platform. The application is a particular task graph,
either a linear chain of tasks, or a set of independent tasks. The platform is
made of identical processors, whose speed can be dynamically modified. It is
also subject to failures: if a processor is slowed down to decrease the energy
consumption, it has a higher chance to fail. Therefore, the scheduling problem
requires to re-execute or replicate tasks (i.e., execute twice a same task,
either on the same processor, or on two distinct processors), in order to
increase the reliability. It is a tri-criteria problem: the goal is to minimize
the energy consumption, while enforcing a bound on the total execution time
(the makespan), and a constraint on the reliability of each task.
  Our main contribution is to propose approximation algorithms for these
particular classes of task graphs. For linear chains, we design a fully
polynomial time approximation scheme. However, we show that there exists no
constant factor approximation algorithm for independent tasks, unless P=NP, and
we are able in this case to propose an approximation algorithm with a

simulations of self gravitating disks around binary systems. The selected
binary and disk parameters are chosen consistent with observed systems. The
disks are evolved until they settle in a quasi-equilibrium and the resulting
systems are compared with the parameters of Kepler 16, 34 and 35. We find a
close correspondence of the peak density at the inner disk gap and the orbit of
the observed planets. We conclude, based on our simulations, that the orbits of
the observed Kepler planets are determined by the size of the inner disk gap
which for these systems results from the binary driving. This mediates planet
formation either through the density enhancement or through planetary trapping
at the density gradient inversion in the inner disk. For all three systems the
current eccentricity of the planetary orbit is less than the disk eccentricity
in the simulations. This, together with the long term stability of the orbits
argues against in situ formation (e.g. a direct collapse scenario of the
material in the ring). Conducting additional simulations of systems with a
wider range of parameters (taken from a survey of eclipsing binaries), we find
that the planet semi-major axis and binary eccentricity in such a scenario
should be tightly correlated providing an observational test of this formation
mechanism.

static parameters of hidden Markov models (HMMs). We will consider the case
where one cannot or does not want to compute the conditional likelihood density
of the observation given the hidden state because of increased computational
complexity or analytical intractability. Instead we will assume that one may
obtain samples from this conditional likelihood and hence use approximate
Bayesian computation (ABC) approximations of the original HMM. ABC
approximations are biased, but the bias can be controlled to arbitrary
precision via a parameter \epsilon>0; the bias typically goes to zero as
\epsilon \searrow 0. We first establish that the bias in the log-likelihood and
gradient of the log-likelihood of the ABC approximation, for a fixed batch of
data, is no worse than \mathcal{O}(n\epsilon), n being the number of data;
hence, for computational reasons, one might expect reasonable parameter
estimates using such an ABC approximation. Turning to the computational problem
of estimating $\theta$, we propose, using the ABC-sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
algorithm in Jasra et al. (2012), an approach based upon simultaneous
perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). Our method is investigated on two

Absence of magnetic impurity phase in these films confirmed from morphological

degradation in crystalline quality of the films with increasing doping. The
grain size reduces with increase in Mn doping proportion. The band gaps shows
red shift with doping and the width of localized states shows an increasing
tendency with doping concentration. It is due to the formation of impurity band
and trapping of Mn atoms, which leads to the generation of the defect states
within the forbidden band. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra shows gradual
decrease of intensity of exitonic and defect related peaks with increasing Mn

derivative, and the boundary map is the restriction of a function to (a subset
of) the boundary of the manifold. As one of the main theorems, we derive a
resolvent formula relating the difference of the resolvents of the Neumann and
Dirichlet operator with the Dirichlet solution and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
operator. From this, we deduce a spectral characterisation for a point being in
the spectrum of the Neumann operator in terms of the family of
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators. The relation can be generalised also to
Robin-type boundary conditions. We identify conditions expressed purely in
terms of boundary pairs, which allow us to relate our concept with existing
concepts such as boundary triples. We illustrate the theory by many examples
including Jacobi operators, Laplacians on spaces with (non-smooth) boundary and
the Zaremba (mixed boundary conditions) problem.

heavy-ion collisions as a rapid quench in view of expected rapid thermalization
to a QGP state. The transition is studied using the Polyakov loop model, with
the initial field configuration (in the confining phase) covering a small
neighborhood of the confining vacuum $l \simeq 0$, as appropriate for $T <
T_c$. Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration with the
effective potential at a temperature $T > T_c$. We study the formation of Z(3)
domain structure and its evolution during the transition as $l$ rolls down in
different directions from the top of the central hill in the effective
potential of $l$. When explicit Z(3) symmetry breaking effects (arising from
dynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains
which coarsen in time. Remarkably, the magnitude plot of $l$ shows vacuum
bubble like configurations arising during the quench. This first order
transition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum
separated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used. When
the initial field configuration everywhere rolls down roughly along the same
direction (as will happen with large explicit symmetry breaking) then we do not
find such bubble-like configurations. However, in this case we find huge
oscillations of $l$ with large length scales. We show that such large
oscillations can lead to large fluctuations in the evolution of flow
anisotropies compared to the equilibrium transition case.

properties on a broad range of spatial scales, and the correlations between
these parameters can provide insights into the processes that shape the
composition and dynamics of the rings. The Visual and Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument onboard the Cassini Spacecraft has obtained
spectra of the rings between 0.35 and 5.2 microns with sufficient spatial
resolution to discern variations on scales below 200 km. These relatively
high-resolution spectral data reveal that both the depths of the near-infrared
water-ice absorption bands and the visible spectral slopes are often correlated
with structural parameters such as the rings' optical depth. Using a simplified
model for the ring-particles' regolith properties, we have begun to disentangle
the trends due to changes in the gross composition of the ring particles from
those that may be due to shifts in the texture of the ring particles' regolith.
Consistent with previous studies, this analysis finds that the C ring and the
Cassini Division possess enhanced concentrations of a contaminant that absorbs
light over a broad range of wavelengths. On the other hand, a second
contaminant that preferentially absorbs at short visible and near-ultraviolet
wavelengths is found to be more evenly distributed throughout the rings. The
optical activity of this short-wavelength absorber increases in the inner B
ring inwards of 100,000 km from Saturn center, which may provide clues to the
origin of this contaminant. The spectral variations identified as shifts in the
regolith texture are in some places clearly correlated with the ring's optical
depth, and in other locations they appear to be associated with the
disturbances generated by strong mean-motion resonances with Saturn's various
moons.

Fukunaga, every node $v$ gets a ""bonus"" $p_v \leq d_v$ if it is selected to
$S$. Fukunaga showed that for undirected graphs one can achieve ratio $O(k \ln
k)$ for his variant, where $k=\max_{v \in V}d_v$ is the maximum demand. We
improve this by achieving ratio $\min\{p^*\lnk,k\}\cdot O(\ln (k/q^*))$ for a
more general version with node capacities, where $p^*=\max_{v \in V} p_v$ is
the maximum bonus and $q^*=\min_{v \in V} q_v$ is the minimum capacity. In

improve the ratio from $O(k \ln k)$ to $O(\ln^2k)$. We also get ratio $O(k)$
for the edge-connectivity version, for which no ratio that depends on $k$ only
was known before. To derive these results, we consider a particular case of the
Survivable Network (SN) problem when all edges of positive cost form a star. We
give ratio $O(\min\{\ln n,\ln^2 k\})$ for this variant, improving over the best
ratio known for the general case $O(k^3 \ln n)$ of Chuzhoy and Khanna.

work we investigate the evolution of these properties with increasing number of
layers (n) ranging from 1 to 10. Though, mono-layer of silicene possesses
properties similar to those of graphene, our results show that the geometric
and electronic properties of multi-layers of silicene are strikingly different
from those of multi-layers of graphene. We observe that there exist strong
inter-layer covalent bondings between the layers in multi-layers of silicene as
opposed to weak van der Waal's bonding which exists between the graphene
layers. The inter-layer bonding strongly influences the geometric and
electronic structures of these multi-layers. Like bi-layers of graphene,
silicene with two different stacking configurations AA and AB exhibits linear
and parabolic dispersions around the Fermi level, respectively. However, unlike
graphene, for bi-layers of silicene, these dispersion curves are shifted in
band diagram; this is due to the strong inter-layer bonding present in the
latter. For n > 3, we study the geometric and electronic properties of
multi-layers with four different stacking configurations namely, AAAA, AABB,
ABAB and ABC. Our results on cohesive energy show that all the multi-layers
considered are energetically stable. Furthermore, we find that the three
stacking configurations (AAAA, AABB and ABC) containing tetrahedral
coordination have much higher cohesive energy than that of Bernal (ABAB)
stacking configuration. This is in contrast to the case of multi-layers of
graphene where ABAB is reported to be the lowest energy configuration.

a variety of high energy and nuclear physics experiments. In noble-gas
detectors for double-beta decay and dark matter experiments, SiPMs are
attractive photosensors for imaging. However they are insensitive to the VUV
scintillation emitted by the noble gases (xenon and argon). This difficulty is
overcome in the NEXT experiment by coating the SiPMs with tetraphenyl butadiene
(TPB) to convert the VUV light into visible light. TPB requires stringent
storage and operational conditions to prevent its degradation by environmental
agents. The development of UV sensitive SiPMs is thus of utmost interest for
experiments using electroluminescence of noble-gas detectors. It is in
particular an important issue for a robust and background free neutrinoless
double-beta experiment with xenon gas aimed by NEXT. The photon detection
efficiency (PDE) of UV-enhanced SiPMs provided by Hamamatsu was determined for
light in the range 250-500 nm. The PDE of standard SiPMs of the same model
(S10362-33-50C), coated and non-coated with TPB, was also determined for
comparison. In the UV range 250-350 nm, the PDE of the standard SiPM is shown
to decrease strongly, down to about 3%. The UV-enhanced SiPM without window is
shown to have the maximum PDE of 44% at 325 nm and 30% at 250 nm. The PDE of
the UV-enhanced SiPM with silicon resin window has a similar trend in the UV
range, although it is about 30% lower. The TPB-coated SiPM has shown to have
about 6 times higher PDE than the non-coated SiPM in the range 250-315 nm. This
is however below the performance of the UV-enhanced prototypes in the same
wavelength range. Imaging in noble-gas detectors using UV-enhanced SiPMs is
discussed.

bubbles are produced in microgravity, which suppress the buoyant pressure
gradient that otherwise deteriorates the sphericity of the bubbles. We measure
the radius of the rebound bubble and estimate the shock energy as a function of
the initial bubble radius (2-5.6 mm) and the liquid pressure (10-80 kPa). Those
measurements uncover a systematic pressure dependence of the energy partition
between rebound and shock. We demonstrate that these observations agree with a
physical model relying on a first-order approximation of the liquid
compressibility and an adiabatic treatment of the non-condensable gas inside
the bubble. Using this model we find that the energy partition between rebound

power to bidders, and each bidder chooses the demand from each auctioneer. By
following the proposed distributed algorithm, each user determines how much

  Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/sts167",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  (Abridged) The Galactic Center (GC) hosts a population of young stars some of
which seem to form mutually inclined discs of clockwise and counter clockwise
rotating stars. We present a warped disc origin scenario for these stars
assuming that an initially flat accretion disc becomes warped due to the
Pringle instability, or due to Bardeen-Petterson effect, before it fragments to
stars. We show that this is plausible if the star formation efficiency
$\epsilon_{SF} \lesssim 1$, and the viscosity parameter $\alpha \sim 0.1$.
After fragmentation, we model the disc as a collection of concentric, circular,
mutually tilted rings, and construct warped disc models for mass ratios and
other parameters relevant to the GC environment, but also for more massive
discs. We take into account the disc's self-gravity and the torques exerted by
a surrounding star cluster. We show that a self-gravitating low-mass disc ($M_d
/ M_{bh} \sim 0.001$) precesses in integrity in the life-time of the stars, but
precesses freely when the torques from a non-spherical cluster are included. An
intermediate-mass disc ($M_d / M_{bh} \sim 0.01$) breaks into pieces which
precess independently in the self-gravity-only case, and become disrupted in
the presence of the star cluster torques. For a high-mass disc ($M_d / M_{bh}
\sim 0.1$) the evolution is dominated by self-gravity and the disc is broken
but not dissolved. The time-scale after which the disc breaks scales almost
linearly with ($M_d / M_{bh}$) for self-gravitating models. Typical values are
longer than the age of the stars for a low mass disc, and are in the range
$\sim 8 \times 10^4-10^5$ yr for high and intermediate-mass discs respectively.
None of these models explain the rotation properties of the two GC discs, but a
comparison of them with the clockwise disc shows that the lowest mass model in
a spherical star cluster matches the data best.

parameter in the understanding of the acceleration and propagation mechanisms

poorly known quantity, with observational studies producing evidence for an
isotropic distribution and theoretical models mainly considering the strongly
beamed case. We use the effect of photospheric albedo to infer the pitch angle
distribution of X-ray emitting electrons using Hard X-ray data from RHESSI. A
bi-directional approximation is applied and a regularized inversion is
performed for eight large flare events to deduce the electron spectra in both
downward (towards the photosphere) and upward (away from the photosphere)
directions. The electron spectra and the electron anisotropy ratios are
calculated for broad energy range from about 10 and up to ~ 300 keV near the
peak of the flares. The variation of electron anisotropy over short periods of
time intervals lasting 4, 8 and 16 seconds near the impulsive peak has been
examined. The results show little evidence for strong anisotropy and the mean
electron flux spectra are consistent with the isotropic electron distribution.
The 3-sigma level uncertainties, although energy and event dependent, are found
to suggest that anisotropic distribution with anisotropy larger than ~ 3 are
not consistent with the hard X-ray data. At energies above 150-200 keV, the
uncertainties are larger and thus the possible electron anisotropies could be
larger.

been proved to achieve remarkable properties such as exact support recovery of
sparse vectors when the columns are sufficently incoherent and low prediction
error under even less stringent conditions. However, many matrices do not
satisfy small coherence in practical applications and the LASSO estimator may
thus suffer from what is known as the slow rate regime.
  The goal of the present paper is to study the LASSO from a slightly different
perspective by proposing a mixture model for the design matrix which is able to
capture in a natural way the potentially clustered nature of the columns in
many practical situations. In this model, the columns of the design matrix are
drawn from a Gaussian mixture model. Instead of requiring incoherence for the
design matrix $X$, we only require incoherence of the much smaller matrix of
the mixture's centers.
  Our main result states that $X\beta$ can be estimated with the same precision
as for incoherent designs except for a correction term depending on the maximal
variance in the mixture model.

\{f(x)\,:\,x\in K\}$ where $K$ is a compact basic semi-algebraic set. We first
show that the standard Lagrangian relaxation yields a lower bound as close as
desired to the global optimum $f^*$, provided that it is applied to a problem
$\tilde{P}$ equivalent to $P$, in which sufficiently many redundant constraints
(products of the initial ones) are added to the initial description of $P$.
Next we show that the standard hierarchy of LP-relaxations of $P$ (in the
spirit of Sherali-Adams' RLT) can be interpreted as a brute force
simplification of the above Lagrangian relaxation in which a nonnegative
polynomial (with coefficients to be determined) is replaced with a constant
polynomial equal to zero. Inspired by this interpretation, we provide a
systematic improvement of the LP-hierarchy by doing a much less brutal
simplification which results into a parametrized hierarchy of semidefinite
programs (and not linear programs any more). For each semidefinite program in
the parametrized hierarchy, the semidefinite constraint has a fixed size
$O(n^k)$, independently of the rank in the hierarchy, in contrast with the
standard hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations. The parameter $k$ is to be
decided by the user. When applied to a non trivial class of convex problems,
the first relaxation of the parametrized hierarchy is exact, in contrast with
the LP-hierarchy where convergence cannot be finite. When applied to 0/1
programs it is at least as good as the first one in the hierarchy of
semidefinite relaxations. However obstructions to exactness still exist and are
briefly analyzed. Finally, the standard semidefinite hierarchy can also be
viewed as a simplification of an extended Lagrangian relaxation, but different
in spirit as sums of squares (and not scalars) multipliers are allowed.

which probably reflect stable a priori attitudes toward the law. We find that
U. S. Supreme Court justice votes are more predictable than one would expect
from an ideal court composed of perfectly independent justices. Deviations from
ideal behavior are most apparent in divided 5-4 decisions, where justice blocks
seem to be most stable. Moreover, we find evidence that justice predictability
decreased during the 50-year period spanning from the Warren Court to the

proposed to arise from the interaction with low-density (~0.3 cm^{-3}) ambient
medium. Here we present an alternative hadronic explanation with a modest
conversion efficiency (of order 1%) for this young remnant. With such an
efficiency, a normal electron-proton ratio (of order 10^{-2}) is derived from
the radio and X-ray synchrotron spectra and an average ambient density that is
at least one-order-of-magnitude higher is derived from the hadronic gamma-ray
flux. This result is consistent with the multi-band evidence of the presence of
dense medium from the north to the east of the Tycho SNR. The SNR-cloud
association, in combination with the HI absorption data, helps to constrain the
so-far controversial distance to Tycho and leads to an estimate of 2.5 kpc.

distributed fashion typically assume timely and reliable exchange of
information between neighboring components of a given multi-component system.
These assumptions are not necessarily valid in practical settings due to
varying delays that might affect transmissions at different times, as well as
possible changes in the underlying interconnection topology (e.g., due to
component mobility). In this work, we propose protocols to overcome these
limitations. We first consider a fixed interconnection topology (captured by a
- possibly directed - graph) and propose a discrete-time protocol that can
reach asymptotic average consensus in a distributed fashion, despite the
presence of arbitrary (but bounded) delays in the communication links. The
protocol requires that each component has knowledge of the number of its
outgoing links (i.e., the number of components to which it sends information).
We subsequently extend the protocol to also handle changes in the underlying
interconnection topology and describe a variety of rather loose conditions
under which the modified protocol allows the components to reach asymptotic
average consensus. The proposed algorithms are illustrated via examples.

probability distribution, but most MN structure learning methods are very slow,
due to the high cost of evaluating candidates structures. Dependency networks
(DNs) represent a probability distribution as a set of conditional probability
distributions. DNs are very fast to learn, but the conditional distributions
may be inconsistent with each other and few inference algorithms support DNs.
In this paper, we present a closed-form method for converting a DN into an MN,
allowing us to enjoy both the efficiency of DN learning and the convenience of
the MN representation. When the DN is consistent, this conversion is exact. For
inconsistent DNs, we present averaging methods that significantly improve the
approximation. In experiments on 12 standard datasets, our methods are orders
of magnitude faster than and often more accurate than combining conditional
distributions using weight learning.

in improving management practices, breeding strategies as well as engineering
viable crops for a sustainable agriculture in the coming decades.
Hyper-spectral imaging provides a particularly promising approach to gain such
understanding since it allows to discover non-destructively spectral
characteristics of plants governed primarily by scattering and absorption
characteristics of the leaf internal structure and biochemical constituents.
Several drought stress indices have been derived using hyper-spectral imaging.
However, they are typically based on few hyper-spectral images only, rely on
interpretations of experts, and consider few wavelengths only. In this study,
we present the first data-driven approach to discovering spectral drought
stress indices, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem at massive
scale. To make use of short range dependencies of spectral wavelengths, we
develop an online variational Bayes algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation
with convolved Dirichlet regularizer. This approach scales to massive datasets
and, hence, provides a more objective complement to plant physiological
practices. The spectral topics found conform to plant physiological knowledge
and can be computed in a fraction of the time compared to existing LDA
approaches.

snippets, require analysis methods beyond single-view component and topic
models. For continuous observations the current dominant approach is based on
extensions of canonical correlation analysis, factorizing the variation into
components shared by the different modalities and those private to each of
them. For count data, multiple variants of topic models attempting to tie the
modalities together have been presented. All of these, however, lack the
ability to learn components private to one modality, and consequently will try
to force dependencies even between minimally correlating modalities. In this
work we combine the two approaches by presenting a novel HDP-based topic model
that automatically learns both shared and private topics. The model is shown to
be especially useful for querying the contents of one domain given samples of
the other.

interaction in this channel, which is in agreement with the theoretical
predictions. An essential ingredient in our lattice calculation is to properly
treat the disconnected diagram. Moreover, we explain the difficulties of these

collective many body effects on the neutron production rates in a chemical
battery cathode. Ciuchi et al employ an inverse beta decay expression that
contains a two body amplitude. Only one electron and one proton may exist in
the Ciuchi et al model initial state wave function. A flaw in their reasoning
is that one cannot in reality describe collective many body correlations with
only a two particle wave function. One needs very many particles to describe
collective effects. In the model wave functions of Ciuchi et al there are no
metallic hydrides, there are no cathodes and there are no chemical batteries.
Employing a wave function with only one electron and one proton is inadequate
for describing collective metallic hydride surface quantum plasma physics in
cathodes accurately.

halogenated molecules (mainly chlorofluorocarbons-CFCs) on atmospheric O3
depletion and global climate change. Brief reviews are first given on the
cosmic-ray-driven electron-induced-reaction (CRE) theory for O3 depletion and
the warming theory of CFCs for climate change. Then natural and anthropogenic
contributions are examined in detail and separated well through in-depth
statistical analyses of comprehensive measured datasets. For O3 loss, new
statistical analyses of the CRE equation with observed data of total O3 and
stratospheric temperature give high linear correlation coefficients >=0.92.
After removal of the CR effect, a pronounced recovery by 20~25% of the
Antarctic O3 hole is found, while no recovery of O3 loss in mid-latitudes has
been observed. These results show both the dominance of the CRE mechanism and
the success of the Montreal Protocol. For global climate change, in-depth
analyses of observed data clearly show that the solar effect and human-made
halogenated gases played the dominant role in Earth climate change prior to and
after 1970, respectively. Remarkably, a statistical analysis gives a nearly
zero correlation coefficient (R=-0.05) between global surface temperature and
CO2 concentration in 1850-1970. In contrast, a nearly perfect linear
correlation with R=0.96-0.97 is found between global surface temperature and
total amount of stratospheric halogenated gases in 1970-2012. Further, a new
theoretical calculation on the greenhouse effect of halogenated gases shows
that they (mainly CFCs) could alone lead to the global surface temperature rise
of ~0.6 deg C in 1970-2002. These results provide solid evidence that recent
global warming was indeed caused by anthropogenic halogenated gases. Thus, a
slow reversal of global temperature to the 1950 value is predicted for coming
5~7 decades.
