candidate for a variable absorber. Suzaku caught NGC 4507 in a highly absorbed
state characterised by a high column density (NH \sim8 x10^23 cm^-2), a strong
reflected component (R\sim 1.9) and a high equivalent width Fe K alpha emission
line (EW\sim 500 eV). The Fe K alpha emission line is unresolved at the
resolution of the Suzaku CCDs (sigma < 30 eV or FWHM < 3000 km s^-1) and most
likely originates in a distant absorber. The Fe K beta emission line is also
clearly detected and its intensity is marginally higher than the theoretical
value for low ionisation Fe. A comparison with previous observations performed
with XMM-Newton and BeppoSAX reveals that the X-ray spectral curvature changes
on a timescale of a few months. We analysed all these historical observations,
with standard models as well as with a most recent model for a toroidal
reprocessor and found that the main driver of the observed 2-10 keV spectral
variability is a change of the line-of-sight obscuration, varying from
\sim4x10^23 cm^-2 to \sim9 x 10^23 cm^-2. The primary continuum is also
variable, although its photon index does not appear to vary, while the Fe K
alpha line and reflection component are consistent with being constant across
the observations. This suggests the presence of a rather constant reprocessor
and that the observed line of sight NH variability is either due to a certain
degree of clumpiness of the putative torus or due to the presence of a second
clumpy absorber.

two problems involving maximal scoring subsequences of a sequence. Both of

Kadane's algorithm to compute the maximum scoring subsequence of the resulting

this paper that the ISS problem can be solved in linear time and space with a
more specialized algorithm. The second problem we consider in this paper is the
{\sc Sorting a Sequence by Scores (SSS)} one, stated as follows: find a

rule for kaon decays can be understood by studying the dependence of kaon decay
amplitudes on the charm quark mass using an effective \Delta S = 1 weak
Hamiltonian in which the charm is kept as an active degree of freedom. Overlap
fermions are employed in order to avoid renormalization problems, as well as to
allow access to the deep chiral regime. Quenched results in the GIM limit have
shown that a significant part of the enhancement is purely due to low-energy
QCD effects; variance reduction techniques based on low-mode averaging were
instrumental in determining the relevant weak effective lowenergy couplings in
this case. Moving away from the GIM limit requires the computation of diagrams
containing closed quark loops. We report on our progress to employ a
combination of low-mode averaging and stochastic volume sources in order to
control these contributions. Results showing a significant improvement in the

scientific discovery, inverse engineering, decision making, software
engineering, design, human sciences, etc. If we have a set of theories that are
able to explain the same set of phenomena, we need a criterion to choose which
one is best. There are, of course, many possible criteria. Model simplicity is
one of the most common criteria in theory evaluation. The Minimum Message
Length (MML) is a solid approach to evaluate theories relative to a given
evidence or data. Theories can be expressed in specific or general
(Turing-complete) languages. First-order logic, and logic programming in
particular, is a Turing-complete language. Evaluating the simplicity of a
theory or program described in a Turing-complete language is much more
difficult than just counting the number of lines or bits. It is, in fact, the
problem of calculating its Kolmogorov complexity, which is uncomputable. Few
works in the literature have been able to present accurate and effective
approximations for a Turing-complete language. In this work, we present the
first general MML coding scheme for logic programs. With this scheme, we can
quantify the bits of information required to code (or send) a theory, a set of
data or the same data given the theory. As a realization of the above-mentioned
schemes, we present a software tool which is able to code and evaluate a set of
alternative (stochastic) theories (programs) against a set of examples. We
illustrate the application of the tool to a variety of non-probabilistic and
probabilistic scenarios.

provide a continuous transition from diffractive to inelastic processes and

Interest in the representations $U_\alpha$ stems from their appearance in the

and character $\chi_\alpha$. Hence the location of the nontrivial zeros of this
function and therefore also the spectral properties of the corresponding

related to their congruence properties. Even if as expected these properties of

noncongruence groups determined by their kernels are quite different: those
determined by $\chi_\alpha$ are character groups of type I of the group

content. Yet, it has received little attention other than as component in
specific applications such as crawlers or meta-search engines. No comprehensive
approach to form understanding exists, let alone one that produces rich models
for semantic services or integration with linked open data.
  In this paper, we present OPAL, the first comprehensive approach to form
understanding and integration. We identify form labeling and form
interpretation as the two main tasks involved in form understanding. On both
problems OPAL pushes the state of the art: For form labeling, it combines
features from the text, structure, and visual rendering of a web page. In
extensive experiments on the ICQ and TEL-8 benchmarks and a set of 200 modern
web forms OPAL outperforms previous approaches for form labeling by a
significant margin. For form interpretation, OPAL uses a schema (or ontology)
of forms in a given domain. Thanks to this domain schema, it is able to produce
nearly perfect (more than 97 percent accuracy in the evaluation domains) form
interpretations. Yet, the effort to produce a domain schema is very low, as we
provide a Datalog-based template language that eases the specification of such
schemata and a methodology for deriving a domain schema largely automatically
from an existing domain ontology. We demonstrate the value of the form
interpretations in OPAL through a light-weight form integration system that
successfully translates and distributes master queries to hundreds of forms
with no error, yet is implemented with only a handful translation rules.

induce wrappers from a set of human-annotated pages or leverage repeated
structures on the page without supervision. What the former lack in automation,
the latter lack in accuracy. Thus accurate, automatic multi-attribute object
extraction has remained an open challenge.
  AMBER overcomes both limitations through mutual supervision between the
repeated structure and automatically produced annotations. Previous approaches
based on automatic annotations have suffered from low quality due to the
inherent noise in the annotations and have attempted to compensate by exploring
multiple candidate wrappers. In contrast, AMBER compensates for this noise by
integrating repeated structure analysis with annotation-based induction: The
repeated structure limits the search space for wrapper induction, and
conversely, annotations allow the repeated structure analysis to distinguish
noise from relevant data. Both, low recall and low precision in the annotations
are mitigated to achieve almost human quality (more than 98 percent)
multi-attribute object extraction.
  To achieve this accuracy, AMBER needs to be trained once for an entire
domain. AMBER bootstraps its training from a small, possibly noisy set of
attribute instances and a few unannotated sites of the domain.

for Extraterrestrial Intelligence can be carried out by analyzing standard
astronomical spectra, including those they already have taken. Simplicity is
the outstanding advantage of a search in spectra. The spectra can be analyzed
by simple eye inspection or a few lines of code that uses Fourier transform
software. Theory, confirmed by published experiments, shows that periodic
signals in spectra can be easily generated by sending light pulses separated by
constant time intervals. While part of this article, like all articles on
searches for ETI, is highly speculative the basic physics is sound. In
particular, technology now available on Earth could be used to send signals
having the required energy to be detected at a target located 1000 light years
away. Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) could use these signals to make us
aware of their existence. For an ETI, the technique would also have the
advantage that the signals could be detected both in spectra and searches for
intensity pulses like those currently carried out on Earth.

contagion in the recent financial crisis. We develop a network approach to the
amplification of financial contagion due to the combination of overlapping
portfolios and leverage, and we show how it can be understood in terms of a
generalized branching process. By studying a stylized model we estimate the
circumstances under which systemic instabilities are likely to occur as a
function of parameters such as leverage, market crowding, diversification, and
market impact. Although diversification may be good for individual
institutions, it can create dangerous systemic effects, and as a result
financial contagion gets worse with too much diversification. Under our model
there is a critical threshold for leverage; below it financial networks are
always stable, and above it the unstable region grows as leverage increases.
The financial system exhibits ""robust yet fragile"" behavior, with regions of
the parameter space where contagion is rare but catastrophic whenever it
occurs. Our model and methods of analysis can be calibrated to real data and
provide simple yet powerful tools for macroprudential stress testing.

algorithm for sparse recovery. Recent developments have shown that OMP
guarantees exact recovery of K-sparse signals with K or more than K iterations
if the observation matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) with
some conditions. We develop RIP-based online guarantees for recovery of a
K-sparse signal with more than K OMP iterations. Though these guarantees cannot
be generalized to all sparse signals a priori, we show that they can still hold
online when the state-of-the-art K-step recovery guarantees fail. In addition,
we present bounds on the number of correct and false indices in the support
estimate for the derived condition to be less restrictive than the K-step
guarantees. Under these bounds, this condition guarantees exact recovery of a
K-sparse signal within 3K/2 iterations, which is much less than the number of
steps required for the state-of-the-art exact recovery guarantees with more
than K steps. Moreover, we present phase transitions of OMP in comparison to
basis pursuit and subspace pursuit, which are obtained after extensive recovery
simulations involving different sparse signal types. Finally, we empirically
analyse the number of false indices in the support estimate, which indicates
that these do not violate the developed upper bound in practice.

oracle property for high-dimensional sparse estimation. However, a folded
concave penalization problem usually has multiple local solutions and the
oracle property is established only for one of the unknown local solutions. A
challenging fundamental issue still remains that it is not clear whether the
local optimum computed by a given optimization algorithm possesses those nice
theoretical properties. To close this important theoretical gap in over a
decade, we provide a unified theory to show explicitly how to obtain the oracle
solution via the local linear approximation algorithm. For a folded concave
penalized estimation problem, we show that as long as the problem is
localizable and the oracle estimator is well behaved, we can obtain the oracle
estimator by using the one-step local linear approximation. In addition, once
the oracle estimator is obtained, the local linear approximation algorithm
converges, namely it produces the same estimator in the next iteration. The
general theory is demonstrated by using four classical sparse estimation
problems, that is, sparse linear regression, sparse logistic regression, sparse
precision matrix estimation and sparse quantile regression.

generated from various $J/\Psi$-nucleus potentials which are constructed by
either using a procedure based on the Pomeron-quark coupling mechanism or
folding a $J/\Psi$-N potential ($v_{J/\Psi,N}$) into the nuclear densities. We
consider $v_{J/\Psi,N}$ derived from the effective field theory approach,
Lattice QCD, and Pomeron-quark coupling mechanism. The upper bound of the
predicted total cross sections is about $0.1 - 0.3$ pico-barn. We also consider
the possibility of photo-production of a six quark-$J/\Psi$ bound state
($[q^6]_{J/\Psi})$ on the $^3He$ target. The Compound Bag Model of $NN$
scattering and the quark cluster model of nuclei are used to estimate the
$[q^6]$-N wavefunction in $^3He$ by imposing the condition that the calculated
$^3He$ charge form factor must be consistent with what is predicted by the
conventional nuclear model. The upper bound of the predicted total cross
sections of $\gamma + ^3He \rightarrow [q^6]_{J/\Psi} +N$ is about 2 - 4
pico-barn, depending on the model of $\gamma+N \rightarrow J/\Psi +N$ used in

interesting correspondences on $\mathbb{P}^1$ for which $d_{top}(F) \leq

equidistribution cannot be expected to the full extent of Brolin's theorem.

the faint electron-scattering wings are caused mainly by free electrons

tunable electronic bands. Here we use these properties to realize giant
conductance oscillations in ballistic trilayer graphene Fabry-Perot

bound states beneath an electrostatic barrier. We cloak these states by
selectively decoupling them from the leads, resulting in transport via
non-resonant states and suppression of the giant oscillations. Cloaking is
achieved both classically, by manipulating quasiparticle momenta with a

functions steepen with increasing order, giving them a higher constraining
power with respect to the extreme value statistics. Additionally, we find that
the order statistics in mass (being dominated by clusters at lower redshifts)
is sensitive to the matter density and the normalisation of the matter
fluctuations, whereas the order statistics in redshift is particularly
sensitive to the geometric evolution of the Universe. For a fixed cosmology,
both order statistics are efficient probes of the functional shape of the mass
function at the high mass end. To allow a quick assessment of both order
statistics, we provide fits as a function of the survey area that allow
percentile estimation with an accuracy better than two per cent. Furthermore,
we discuss the joint distributions in the two-dimensional case for different
combinations of order.
  Having introduced the theory, we apply the order statistical analysis to the
SPT massive cluster sample and MCXC catalogue and find that the ten most
massive clusters in the sample are consistent with LCDM and the Tinker mass

recently by Pietrzynski et al. The star's light and radial velocity curves
mimic that of classical RR Lyrae stars, except for the bump in the middle of
the ascending branch of the radial velocity curve. We show that the bump is
caused by the 2:1 resonance between the fundamental mode and the second
overtone - the same mechanism that causes the Hertzsprung bump progression in
classical Cepheids. The models allow to constrain the parameters of the star,
in particular to estimate its absolute luminosity (approx 33L_sun) and
effective temperature (approx 6970K, close to the blue edge of the instability
strip).
  We conduct a model survey for the new class of low mass pulsators similar to
OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-02792 - products of evolution in the binary systems. We compute
a grid of models with masses corresponding to half (and less) of the typical
mass of RR Lyrae variable, 0.20M_sun<=M<=0.30M_sun, and discuss the properties
of the resulting light and radial velocity curves. Resonant bump progression is
clear and may be used to distinguish such stars from classical RR Lyrae stars.
We present the Fourier decomposition parameters for the modelled light and
radial velocity curves. The expected values of the phi_31 Fourier phase for the
light curves differ significantly from that observed in RR Lyrae stars, which
is another discriminant of the new class.

contributions from the earliest galaxies during reionization and faint, dwarf
galaxies at intermediate redshifts. Previous measurements were unable to
conclusively pinpoint the dominant origin because they did not sample spatial
scales that were sufficiently large to distinguish between these two
possibilities. Here we report a measurement of the anisotropy power spectrum
from sub-arcminute to one degree angular scales and find the clustering
amplitude to be larger than the model predictions involving the two existing
explanations. As the shot-noise level of the power spectrum is consistent with
that expected from faint galaxies, a new source population on the sky is not
necessary to explain the observations. A physical mechanism that increases the
clustering amplitude, however, is needed. Motivated by recent results related
to the extended stellar light profile in dark matter halos, we consider the
possibility that the fluctuations originate from diffuse intrahalo stars of all
galaxies. We find that the measured power spectrum can be explained by an
intrahalo light fraction of 0.07 to 0.2 % relative to the total luminosity in
dark matter halos of masses log(M/M_Sun) ~ 9 to 12 at redshifts of ~ 1 to 4.

the most up-to-date Yonsei-Yale stellar evolutionary tracks and BaSel 3.1 flux

high-order Balmer lines for simple stellar populations as functions of stellar

has been taken to incorporate systematic contribution from horizontal-branch
stars which alters the temperature-sensitive Balmer lines significantly,
resulting in up to 5 Gyr difference in age estimation of old, metal-poor
stellar populations. We also find that the horizontal branches exert an
appreciable effect not only on the Balmer lines but also on the
metallicity-sensitive lines including the magnesium index. This is critical to
explain the intriguing bimodality found in index distributions of globular
clusters in massive galaxies and to derive spectroscopic metallicities
accurately from various indices. A full set of the spectroscopic and

seen over the duration of our simulations. This contrasts with the limiting
case of large planet mass (over twenty Jupiter masses) and extremely high
surface densities, where we find eccentricity growth in agreement with
previously published results. We identify the cause of this as being a
threshold surface density for a given planet mass below which eccentricity
growth cannot be excited by this method. Further, the radial profile of the
disc surface density is found to have a stronger effect on eccentricity growth

galaxies that varies with the Jeans mass in the interstellar medium, paying
particular attention to the K-band stellar mass to light ratio (M/L_K) of
present-epoch massive galaxies. We calculate the typical Jeans mass using
high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations coupled with a fully radiative model
for the ISM, which yields a parameterisation of the IMF characteristic mass as
a function of galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We then calculate the star
formation histories of galaxies utilising an equilibrium galaxy growth model
coupled with constraints on the star formation histories set by abundance
matching models. We find that at early times, energetic coupling between dust
and gas drive warm conditions in the ISM, yielding bottom-light/top- heavy IMFs
associated with large ISM Jeans masses for massive star-forming galaxies. Owing
to the remnants of massive stars that formed during the top-heavy phases at
early times, the resultant M/L_K(sigma) in massive galaxies at the present
epoch is increased relative to the non- varying IMF case. At late times, lower
cosmic ray fluxes allow for cooler ISM temperatures in massive galaxies, and
hence newly formed clusters will exhibit bottom-heavy IMFs, further increasing
M/L_K(sigma). Our central result is hence that a given massive galaxy may go
through both top-heavy and bottom-heavy IMF phases during its lifetime, though
the bulk of the stars form during a top-heavy phase. Qualitatively, the
variations in M/L_K(sigma) with galaxy mass are in agreement with observations,
however, our model may not be able to account for bottom-heavy mass functions
as indicated by stellar absorption features.

radial and tangential components V_rad = 167.9 +/- 2.8 km/s and V_tan = 101.0
+/- 34.4 km/s, respectively. We study the detailed orbital history of Leo I by
solving its equations of motion backward in time for a range of plausible mass
models for the Milky Way and its surrounding galaxies. Leo I entered the Milky
Way virial radius 2.33 +/- 0.21 Gyr ago, most likely on its first infall. It
had a pericentric approach 1.05 +/- 0.09 Gyr ago at a Galactocentric distance
of 91 +/- 36 kpc. We associate these time scales with characteristic time
scales in Leo I's star formation history, which shows an enhanced star
formation activity ~2 Gyr ago and quenching ~1 Gyr ago. There is no indication
from our calculations that other galaxies have significantly influenced Leo I's
orbit, although there is a small probability that it may have interacted with
either Ursa Minor or Leo II within the last ~1 Gyr. For most plausible Milky
Way masses, the observed velocity implies that Leo I is bound to the Milky Way.
However, it may not be appropriate to include it in models of the Milky Way
satellite population that assume dynamical equilibrium, given its recent
infall. Solution of the complete (non-radial) timing equations for the Leo I
orbit implies a Milky Way mass M_MW,vir = 3.15 (-1.36, +1.58) x 10^12 Msun,
with the large uncertainty dominated by cosmic scatter. In a companion paper,
we compare the new observations to the properties of Leo I subhalo analogs

Galactic Cepheids and compare them to population synthesis models of Cepheids
including convective core overshooting and enhanced mass loss. Rates of period
change predicted from stellar evolution models without mass loss do not agree
with observed rates whereas including enhanced mass loss yields predicted rates

mass loss as suggested previously for Polaris and delta Cephei must be a
ubiquitous property of Classical Cepheids.

particle quantum numbers (e.g.\ spin) are not constrained by a minimum total
uncertainty. We begin by defining uncertainties in terms of the outputs of a
measurement apparatus. This allows us to compare uncertainties between
multi-particle states of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles.
Entropic uncertainty relations are derived for both distinguishable and
indistinguishable particles. We then derive upper bounds on the minimum total
uncertainty for bosons and fermions. These upper bounds apply to any pair of
particle quantum numbers and depend only on the number of particles N and the
number of outcomes n for the quantum numbers. For general N, these upper bounds
necessitate a minimum total uncertainty much lower than that for
distinguishable particles. The fermion upper bound on the minimum total
uncertainty for N an integer multiple of n, is zero. Our results show that
uncertainty limits derived for single particle observables are valid only for

motivated by modeling social decision making with cooperative individuals. The
model is similar to a random field Ising model or fiber bundle model, but with
key differences on heterogeneous networks. For many types of disorder and
interactions between the nodes, we predict discontinuous phase transitions with
mean field theory which are largely independent of network structure. We show
how these phase transitions can also be understood by studying microscopic
avalanches, and describe how network structure enhances fluctuations in the
distribution of avalanches. We suggest theoretically the existence of a
""glassy"" spectrum of equilibria associated with a typical phase, even on
infinite graphs, so long as the first moment of the degree distribution is
finite. This behavior implies that the model is robust against noise below a
certain scale, and also that phase transitions can switch from discontinuous to
continuous on networks with too few edges. Numerical simulations suggest that
our theory is accurate.

Leo I dwarf spheroidal galaxy (presented in a companion paper) with the highest

I's large Galacto-centric space velocity (200 km/s) and distance (261 kpc), we
show that it is extremely unlikely to be unbound if Galactic satellites are
associated with dark matter substructure, as 99.9% of subhalos in the
simulations are bound to their host. The observed position and velocity of Leo
I strongly disfavor a low mass Milky Way: if we assume that Leo I is the least
bound of the Milky Way's classical satellites, then we find that M_MW > 10^{12}
M_sun at 95% confidence for a variety of Bayesian priors on M_MW. In lower mass
halos, it is vanishingly rare to find subhalos at 261 kpc moving as fast as Leo
I. Should an additional classical satellite be found to be less bound than Leo
I, this lower limit on M_MW would increase by 30%. Imposing a mass weighted
LCDM prior, we find a median Milky Way virial mass of M_MW=1.6 x 10^{12} M_sun,
with a 90% confidence interval of [1.0-2.4] x 10^{12} M_sun. We also confirm a
strong correlation between subhalo infall time and orbital energy in the
simulations and show that proper motions can aid significantly in interpreting
the infall times and orbital histories of satellites.

that the best description of an object's spectrum often varies between a

emphasis on infrared factors, is important to understand the consistency of the
inflationary theory, its predictivity and to establish the existence of the
slow-roll eternal inflation phenomena and its recently found volume bound. In
this paper we show that \zeta-correlators are time-independent at large
distances at all-loop level in single clock inflation. We write the n-th order
correlators of \dot\zeta\ as the time-integral of Green's functions times the
correlators of local sources that are function of the lower order fluctuations.
The Green's functions are such that only non-vanishing correlators of the
sources at late times can lead to non-vanishing correlators for \dot\zeta\ at
long distances. When the sources are connected by high wavenumber modes, the
correlator is peaked at short distances, and these diagrams cannot lead to a
time-dependence by simple diff. invariance arguments. When the sources are
connected by long wavenumber modes one can use similar arguments once the
constancy of \zeta\ at lower orders was established. Therefore the conservation
of \zeta\ at a given order follows from the conservation of \zeta\ at the lower
orders. Since at tree-level \zeta\ is constant, this implies constancy at
all-loops by induction.

is a blue straggler, formed from the merger of a close K- or G-type binary
system, which was previously in a quadruple system with the binary that
produced SN 1572. Both binaries were likely brought to tidal contact by
Kozai-Lidov oscillations acting in concert with tidal friction. Analogous
progenitor systems may include CzeV343, VW LMi, and KIC 4247791. In the second,
Tycho B is the surviving tertiary component of a triple system, which was also
likely affected by Kozai-Lidov oscillations. Rates are briefly discussed.
Problems with each evolutionary scenario are presented. Finally, a chance
alignment between Tycho B and the supernova remnant is not excluded.

graph translates into a socially-informed routing in the peer-to-peer layer. In
this work we introduce the model of a projection graph that is the result of
decentralizing a social graph onto a peer-to-peer network. We focus on three
social network metrics: degree, node betweenness and edge betweenness
centrality and analytically formulate the relation between metrics in the
social graph and in the projection graph. Through experimental evaluation on
real networks, we demonstrate that when mapping user communities of sizes up to
50-150 users on each peer, the association between the properties of the social
graph and the projection graph is high, and thus the properties of the
(dynamic) projection graph can be inferred from the properties of the (slower
changing) social graph. Furthermore, we demonstrate with two application
scenarios on large-scale social networks the usability of the projection graph
in designing social search applications and unstructured P2P overlays.

all ESF-ETGs show red centers and blue outer parts. Their outer colors require
the existence of a significant underlying population of older stars in the
UV-bright regions. Analysis of stacked SDSS spectra reveals weak LINER-like
emission in their centers. Using a cross-matched SDSS DR7/GALEX GR6 catalog, we
search for other green valley galaxies with similar properties to these
ESF-ETGs and estimate that ~13% of dust-corrected green valley galaxies of
similar stellar mass and UV-optical color are likely ESF-candidates, i.e.,
ESF-ETGs are not rare. Our results are consistent with star formation that is
gradually declining in existing disks, i.e., the ESF-ETGs are evolving onto the
red sequence for the first time, or with rejuvenated star formation due to
accreted gas in older disks provided that the gas does not disrupt the
structure of the galaxy and the resulting star formation is not too recent and
bursty. ESF-ETGs may typify an important subpopulation of galaxies that can
linger in the green valley for up to several Gyrs, based on their resemblance
to nearby gas-rich green valley galaxies with low-level ongoing star formation.

the jet and it sets a limit on the rise time. This suggest that Swift J1644+57,
that shows several flares with a rise time as short as a few hundred seconds

hydrodynamic time is a few hours. The disrupted object must have been a white

accretion rate changes form super to sub Eddington. It is possible that such a
transition was observed in the light curve of Swift J2058+05. If correct this

that the high beta equilibrium was marginally more stable than the low beta
equilibrium in the adiabatic-electron ITG mode case. However, the high beta

  press",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a brief summary of the Single Degenerate Scenario for the
progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae in which it is assumed that a low mass
carbon-oxygen white dwarf is growing in mass as a result of accretion from a
secondary star in a close binary system. Recent hydrodynamic simulations of
accretion of solar material onto white dwarfs without mixing always produce a
thermonuclear runaway and steady burning does not occur. For a broad range in
WD mass (0.4 Solar masses to 1.35 Solar Masses), the maximum ejected material
occurs for the 1.25 Solar Mass sequences and then decreases as the white dwarf
mass decreases. Therefore, the white dwarfs are growing in mass as a
consequence of the accretion of solar material and as long as there is no
mixing of accreted material with core material. In contrast, a thermonuclear
runaway in the accreted hydrogen-rich layers on the low luminosity WDs in close
binary systems where mixing of core matter with accreted material has occurred
is the outburst mechanism for Classical, Recurrent, and Symbiotic novae. The
differences in characteristics of these systems is likely the WD mass and mass
accretion rate. The high levels of enrichment of CN ejecta in elements ranging
from carbon to sulfur confirm that there is dredge-up of matter from the core
of the WD and enable them to contribute to the chemical enrichment of the
interstellar medium. Therefore, studies of CNe can lead to an improved
understanding of Galactic nucleosynthesis, some sources of pre-solar grains,
and the Extragalactic distance scale. The characteristics of the outburst
depend on the white dwarf mass, luminosity, mass accretion rate, and the
chemical composition of both the accreting material and WD material. The
properties of the outburst also depends on when, how, and if the accreted
layers are mixed with the WD core and the mixing mechanism is still unknown.

objective function is defined by signal transmission efficiency. We apply this

the usual technique of adjusting parameters only on the basis of experimental
data. The resulting model is self-organizing, i.e. perturbations in protein
concentrations or changes in extracellular signaling will automatically lead to
adaptation. We systematically perturb protein concentrations and observe the
response of the system. We find compensatory or co-regulation of protein
expression levels. In a novel experiment, we alter the distribution of
extracellular signaling, and observe adaptation based on optimizing signal
transmission. We also discuss the relationship between signaling with and
without transients. Signaling by transients may involve maximization of signal
transmission efficiency for the peak response, but a minimization in
steady-state responses. With an appropriate objective function, this can also
be achieved by concentration adjustment. Self-organizing systems may be
predictive of unwanted drug interference effects, since they aim to mimic
complex cellular adaptation in a unified way.

of the spin-down and the emitted gravitational waves of young pulsars. We find
that the frequency to which r-modes spin down a young neutron star is
surprisingly insensitive both to the microscopic details and the saturation
amplitude. Comparing our result to astrophysical data, we show that for a range
of sufficiently large saturation amplitudes r-modes provide a viable spindown
scenario and that all observed young pulsars are very likely already outside
the r-mode instability region. Therefore the most promising sources for
gravitational wave detection are unobserved neutron stars associated with
recent supernovae, and we find that advanced LIGO should be able to see several
of them. We find the remarkable result that the gravitational wave strain
amplitude is completely independent of both the r-mode saturation amplitude and
the microphysics, and depends on the saturation mechanism only within some tens
of per cent. However, the gravitational wave frequency depends on the amplitude

accretion rate decreases with decreasing radius. Two models have been proposed
to explain this result. In the adiabatic inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS), it is
thought to be due to the loss of gas in outflows. In the convection-dominated
accretion flow (CDAF) model, it is explained as because that the gas is locked
in convective eddies. In this paper we use hydrodynamical (HD) and
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to investigate which one is physical.
We calculate and compare various properties of inflow (gas with an inward
velocity) and outflow (gas with an outward velocity). Systematic and
significant differences are found. For example, for HD flows, the temperature
of outflow is higher than inflow; while for MHD flows, the specific angular
momentum of outflow is much higher than inflow. We have also analyzed the
convective stability of MHD accretion flow and found that they are stable.
These results suggest that systematic inward and outward motion must exist,
i.e., the ADIOS model is favored. The different properties of inflow and
outflow also suggest that the mechanisms of producing outflow in HD and MHD
flows are buoyancy associated with the convection and the centrifugal force
associated with the angular momentum transport mediated by the magnetic field,
respectively. The latter mechanism is similar to the Blandford & Payne
mechanism but no large-scale open magnetic field is required here. Possible
observational applications are briefly discussed.

networks. Accurately evaluating the gains of coordination, however, is
contingent upon using a network topology that models realistic cellular
deployments. In this paper, we model the base stations locations as a Poisson
point process to provide a better analytical assessment of the performance of
coordination. Since interference coordination is only feasible within clusters
of limited size, we consider a random clustering process where cluster stations
are located according to a random point process and groups of base stations
associated with the same cluster coordinate. We assume channel knowledge is
exchanged among coordinating base stations, and we analyze the performance of
interference coordination when channel knowledge at the transmitters is either
perfect or acquired through limited feedback. We apply intercell interference
nulling (ICIN) to coordinate interference inside the clusters. The feasibility
of ICIN depends on the number of antennas at the base stations. Using tools
from stochastic geometry, we derive the probability of coverage and the average
rate for a typical mobile user. We show that the average cluster size can be
optimized as a function of the number of antennas to maximize the gains of
ICIN. To minimize the mean loss in rate due to limited feedback, we propose an
adaptive feedback allocation strategy at the mobile users. We show that
adapting the bit allocation as a function of the signals' strength increases
the achievable rate with limited feedback, compared to equal bit partitioning.
Finally, we illustrate how this analysis can help solve network design problems
such as identifying regions where coordination provides gains based on average
cluster size, number of antennas, and number of feedback bits.

enhancement with resonance peaks but also dips where the cross section is
suppressed. Moreover, we have shown that the non-perturbative effects become
important even when the EWDM mass is below the TeV scale, provided that some of
the mass splitting are reduced to the order of a few MeV. This extends the
possibility of observing sizeable non-perturbative effects in the dark matter
annihilation to values of the dark matter mass significantly smaller than

Gravity is affected by the new field, but outside matter the predictions of the

satisfied. We find that massive particles do not follow a geodesic while
massless particles trajectories are null geodesics of an effective metric. We
study the Cosmological case, where we get an accelerated expansion of the

running coupling has no unphysical singularities in the low-momentum regime. We
apply the analytic model of Shirkov et al.[Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT)],
extended by Bakulev et al.[Fractional Analytic Perturbation Theory (FAPT)], and
the two-delta analytic model (2delanQCD). The latter, in contrast to (F)APT, at
higher energies basically coincides with the perturbative QCD (in the same
scheme). We use the renormalon-free mass mqbar as input. The separation of the
soft and ultrasoft parts of the binding energy E is performed by the
requirement of the cancellation of the leading infrared renormalon. The
analysis in the 2delanQCD model indicates that the low-momentum ultrasoft
regime is important for the extraction of the masses mqbar, especially mbbar.
The 2delanQCD model gives us clues on how to estimate the influence of the
ultrasoft sector on mqbar in general. These effects lead to relatively large
values mbbar(mbbar) =approx (4.35 +- 0.08) GeV in the 2delanQCD model, which,
however, are compatible with recent lattice calculations. In perturbative QCD
in MSbar scheme these effects are even stronger and give larger uncertainties
in mbbar. The (F)APT model gives small ultrasoft effects and the extracted
values of mbbar agree with those in most of the literature: mbbar(mbbar)
=approx 4.2 GeV. The extracted values of mcbar(mcbar) in all four models are
about 1.26-1.27 GeV and agree well with those in the literature.

human visual system in recovering secret image and it does not require any
complex calculation. However, the contrast of the reconstructed image could be
quite low. A number of reversing-based VCSs (or VCSs with reversing) (RVCS)
have been proposed for binary secret images, allowing participants to perform a
reversing operation on shares (or shadows). This reversing operation can be
easily implemented by current copy machines. Some existing traditional VCS
schemes without reversing (nRVCS) can be extended to RVCS with the same pixel
expansion for binary image, and the RVCS can achieve ideal contrast,
significantly higher than that of the corresponding nRVCS. In the application
of greyscale VCS, the contrast is much lower than that of the binary cases.
Therefore, it is more desirable to improve the contrast in the greyscale image
reconstruction. However, when greyscale images are involved, one cannot take
advantage of this reversing operation so easily. Many existing greyscale nRVCS
cannot be directly extended to RVCS. In this paper, we first give a new
greyscale nRVCS with minimum pixel expansion and propose an optimal-contrast
greyscale RVCS (GRVCS) by using basis matrices of perfect black nRVCS. Also, we
propose an optimal GRVCS even though the basis matrices are not perfect black.
Finally, we design an optimal-contrast GRVCS with minimum number of shares held
by each participant. The proposed schemes can satisfy different user

must be handled in the process of performing chiral extrapolations. Since the
pion cloud that surrounds hadrons becomes distorted in a finite volume,
hadronic observables must be corrected before one can compare with the
experimental values. The electric charge radius of the nucleon is of particular
interest when considering the implementation of finite-volume corrections. It
is common practice in the literature to transform electric form factors from
the lattice into charge radii prior to analysis. However, there is a
fundamental difficulty with using these charge radii in a finite-volume
extrapolation. The subtleties are a consequence of the absence of a continuous
derivative on the lattice. A procedure is outlined for handling such
finite-volume corrections, which must be applied directly to the electric form
factors themselves rather than to the charge radii.

years, increasing evidence has been found for the presence of young, massive
stars also at R > 0.5 pc. Our goal in this work is a systematic search for
young, massive star candidates throughout the entire region within R ~ 2.5 pc
of the black hole. Methods. The main criterion for the photometric
identification of young, massive early-type stars is the lack of CO-absorption
in the spectra. We used narrow-band imaging with VLT/ISAAC to search for young,
massive stars within ~2.5 pc of Sgr A*. Results. We have found 63 early-type
star candidates at R < 2.5 pc, with an estimated erroneous identification rate
of only about 20%. Considering their K-band magnitudes and interstellar
extinction, they are candidates for Wolf-Rayet stars, supergiants, or early
O-type stars. Of these, 31 stars are so far unknown young, massive star
candidates, all of which lie at R>0.5pc. The surface number density profile of
the young, massive star candidates can be well fit by a single power-law, with
Gamma = 1.6 +- 0.17 at R < 2.5 pc, which is significantly steeper than that of
the late-type giants that make up the bulk of the observable stars in the NSC.
Intriguingly, this power-law is consistent with the power-law that describes
the surface density of young, massive stars in the same brightness range at R <
0.5 pc. Conclusions. The finding of a significant number of newly identified
early-type star candidates at the Galactic center suggests that young, massive
stars can be found throughout the entire cluster which may require us to modify
existing theories for star formation at the Galactic center. Follow-up studies
are needed to improve the existing data and lay the foundations for a unified

pulsars spread across the celestial sphere are combined, allows investigation
of ""global"" phenomena such as a background of gravitational waves or
instabilities in atomic timescales that produce correlated timing residuals in
the pulsars of the array. The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) is an
implementation of the PTA concept based on observations with the Parkes 64-m
radio telescope. A sample of 20 millisecond pulsars is being observed at three
radio-frequency bands, 50cm (~700 MHz), 20cm (~1400 MHz) and 10cm (~3100 MHz),
with observations at intervals of 2 - 3 weeks. Regular observations commenced
in early 2005. This paper describes the systems used for the PPTA observations
and data processing, including calibration and timing analysis. The strategy
behind the choice of pulsars, observing parameters and analysis methods is
discussed. Results are presented for PPTA data in the three bands taken between
2005 March and 2011 March. For ten of the 20 pulsars, rms timing residuals are
less than 1 microsec for the best band after fitting for pulse frequency and
its first time derivative. Significant ""red"" timing noise is detected in about
half of the sample. We discuss the implications of these results on future
projects including the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) and a PTA based
on the Square Kilometre Array. We also present an ""extended PPTA"" data set that
combines PPTA data with earlier Parkes timing data for these pulsars.

distributed algorithm over a network. The extant literature on computing
functions in distributed networks such as wired and wireless sensor networks

distributed data when the alphabet size of the data values is small, O(1). We
describe a distributed randomized algorithm to estimate a class of non-linear
functions of the distributed data which is over a large alphabet. We consider
three types of networks: point-to-point networks with gossip based
communication, random planar networks in the connectivity regime and random
planar networks in the percolating regime both of which use the slotted Aloha
communication protocol. For each network type, we estimate the scaled $k$-th
frequency moments, for $k \geq 2$. Specifically, for every $k \geq 2,$ we give
a distributed randomized algorithm that computes, with probability
$(1-\delta),$ an $\epsilon$-approximation of the scaled $k$-th frequency
moment, $F_k/N^k$, using time $O(M^{1-\frac{1}{k-1}} T)$ and
$O(M^{1-\frac{1}{k-1}} \log N \log (\delta^{-1})/\epsilon^2)$ bits of

spatially separated by frequency filtering. Here, we alternatively propose
using noncollinearly generated SPDC. In our numerical calculation, to achieve
1.2 cycle temporal correlation for a 532 nm pump laser, only 10% -chirped
device is sufficient when noncollinear condition is applied, while a largely
chirped (50%) device is required in collinear condition. We also experimentally
demonstrate an octave-spanning (790-1610 nm) noncollinear parametric
fluorescence from a 10% chirped MgSLT crystal using both a superconducting
nanowire single-photon detector and photomultiplier tube as photon detectors.
The observed SPDC bandwidth is 194 THz, which is the largest width achieved to
date for a chirped QPM device. From this experimental result, our numerical
analysis predicts that the bi-photon can be compressed to 1.2 cycles with
appropriate phase compensation.

threat that the global trade networks could spread fatal pathogens. The global
trade network is a typical overlay network, which compounds multiple standalone
trade networks representing the transmission of a single product and connecting
the same set of countries and territories through their own set of trade
interactions. Although the epidemic dynamic implications of overlay networks
have been debated in recent studies, some general answers for the overlay of
multiple and diverse standalone networks remain elusive, especially the
relationship between the heterogeneity and diversity of a set of standalone
networks and the behavior of the overlay network. In this paper, we establish a
general analysis framework for multiple overlay networks based on diversity
theory. The framework could reveal the critical epidemic mechanisms beyond
overlay processes. Applying the framework to global trade networks, we found
that, although the distribution of connectivity of standalone trade networks
was highly heterogeneous, epidemic behavior on overlay networks is more
dependent on cooperation among standalone trade networks rather than on a few
high-connectivity networks as the general property of complex systems with
heterogeneous distribution. Moreover, the analysis of overlay trade networks
related to 7 real pathogens also suggested that epidemic behavior is not
controlled by high-connectivity goods but that the actual compound mode of
overlay trade networks plays a critical role in spreading pathogens. Finally,
we study the influence of cooperation mechanisms on the stability of overlay
networks and on the control of global epidemics. The framework provides a
general tool to study different problems on overlay networks.

for an explanation. Within the kinetic energy driven SC mechanism, it is shown
that except the quasiparticle coherence, \rho_s is dominated by the bare pair
gap, while Tc is set by the effective pair gap. By calculation of the ratio of
the effective and the bare pair gaps, it is shown that the coupling strength
decreases with increasing doping. This doping dependence of the coupling
strength induces a shift from the critical doping for the maximal value of the
bare pair gap parameter to the optimal doping for the maximal value of the

via annihilation or pair creation. For temperatures T much below the heavy
quark mass M, when kinetically equilibrated heavy quarks move very slowly, the
annihilation in the colour singlet channel is enhanced because the quark and
antiquark attract each other which increases their probability to meet, whereas
the octet contribution is suppressed. This is the so-called Sommerfeld effect.
It has not been taken into account in previous calculations of the chemical
equilibration rate, which are therefore incomplete for T < alphas^2 M. We
compute the leading-order equilibration rate in this regime; there is a large
enhancement in the singlet channel, but the rate is dominated by the octet
channel, and therefore the total effect is small. In the course of the
computation we demonstrate how operators that represent the annihilation of

distinguish rapidly and with certainty between ordered and chaotic motion in
Hamiltonian systems. This distinction is based on the different behavior of the
FNVI for the two cases: the indicator after a very short transient period of
fluctuation displays a nearly constant value for regular orbits, while it
continues to fluctuate significantly for chaotic orbits. In order to quantify
the results obtained by the FNVI method, we establish the dFNVI, which is the

Exploiting the advantages of the dFNVI method, we demonstrate how one can
rapidly identify even tiny regions of order or chaos in the phase space of
Hamiltonian systems. The new method can also be applied in order to follow the
time evolution of sticky orbits. A detailed comparison between the new FNVI
method and some other well-known dynamical methods of chaos detection reveals

of input models characterized by large 56Ni and ejecta masses, and large
kinetic energies, we recover qualitatively the Type II-Plateau, II-peculiar,
and Ib/c light-curve morphologies, although they have larger peak bolometric
luminosities (~10^9 to 10^10 Lsun) and a longer duration (~200d). We discuss
the spectral properties for each model during the photospheric and nebular
phases, including Balmer lines in II-P and II-pec at early times, the dominance
of lines from intermediate-mass-elements (IMEs) near the bolometric maximum,
and the strengthening of metal line blanketing thereafter. Having similar
He-core properties, all models exhibit similar post-peak spectra that are
strongly blanketed by FeII and FeI lines, characterized by red colors, and that
arise from photospheres/ejecta with a temperature of <4000K. Combined with the
modest line widths after bolometric peak, these properties contrast with those
of known super-luminous SNe suggesting that PISNe are yet to be discovered.
Being reddish, PISNe will be difficult to observe at high redshift except when
they stem from RSG explosions, in which case they could be used as metallicity

passage on which something flows. The second mode is dynamic: a network is a
pattern constructed by gluing functions of entities constituting the network.
In this paper, first we discuss that these two modes can be associated with the
category theoretic duality (adjunction) and derive a natural network structure
(a path notion) for each mode by appealing to the category theoretic
universality. The path notion corresponding to the static mode is just the
usual directed path. The path notion for the dynamic mode is called lateral
path which is the alternating path considered on the set of arcs. Their general
functionalities in a network are transport and coherence, respectively. Second,
we introduce a betweenness centrality of arcs for each mode and see how the two
modes are embedded in various real biological network data. We find that there
is a trade-off relationship between the two centralities: if the value of one
is large then the value of the other is small. This can be seen as a kind of
division of labor in a network into transport on the network and coherence of
the network. Finally, we propose an optimization model of networks based on a
quality function involving intensities of the two modes in order to see how
networks with the above trade-off relationship can emerge through evolution. We
show that the trade-off relationship can be observed in the evolved networks
only when the dynamic mode is dominant in the quality function by numerical
simulations. We also show that the evolved networks have features qualitatively
similar to real biological networks by standard complex network analysis.

exhibit large disagreements with stellar models. The addition of the magnetic
perturbation corrects the radius and effective temperature discrepancies
observed in EF Aquarii. Furthermore, the required magnetic field strength at
the model photosphere is within a factor of two of the magnetic field strengths
estimated from the stellar X-ray luminosities measured by ROSAT and those
predicted from Ca II K line core emission. These models provide firm evidence
that the suppression of thermal convection arising from the presence of a

cycle with a period of 11 yr and a shorter cycle with a period of ~2 yrs. The
origin of this second periodicity is still not well understood. We use almost
15 yrs of long high quality resolved data provided by the Global Oscillation
Network Group (GONG) to investigate the solar cycle changes in p-mode frequency
with spherical degree l=0-120 and in the range 1600muHz < nu < 3500 muHz. For
both periodic components of solar magnetic activity our findings locate the
origin of the frequency shift in the subsurface layers with a sudden
enhancement in the amplitude of the shift in the last few hundred kilometers.
We also show that the size of the shift increases towards equatorial latitudes
and from minimum to maximum of solar activity. On the other hand, the
signatures of the 2 yr cycle differ from the one of the 11 yr cycle in the
magnitude of the shift, as the 2 yr cycle causes a weaker shift in mode
frequencies and a slower enhancement in the last few hundreds kilometers. Based
on these findings we speculate that a possible physical mechanism behind the
quasi biennial periodicity (QBP) could be the beating between different dynamo
modes (dipole and quadrupole mode)

kriging-based sequential design which combines both the error evaluation

one selects points one at-a-time. The second one allows us to parallelize the

strategies to multi-fidelity co-kriging models which allow us to surrogate a
complex code using fast approximations of it. The main advantage of these
extensions is that it not only provides the new locations where to perform
simulations but also which versions of code have to be simulated (between the
complex one or one of its fast approximations). A real multi-fidelity
application is used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches. In
this example, the accurate code is a two-dimensional finite element model and
the less accurate one is a one-dimensional approximation of the system.

vertically-stratified, pressure-confined, polytropic gas disks using linear
stability analysis as well as analytic approximations. The disks are initially
in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and bounded by a constant external
pressure. We find that GI of a pressure-confined disk is in general a mixed
mode of the conventional Jeans and distortional instabilities, and is thus an
unstable version of acoustic-surface-gravity waves. The Jeans mode dominates in
weakly confined disks or disks with rigid boundaries. When the disk has free
boundaries and is strongly pressure-confined, on the other hand, the mixed GI
is dominated by the distortional mode that is surface-gravity waves driven
unstable under own gravity and thus incompressible. We demonstrate that the
Jeans mode is gravity-modified acoustic waves rather than inertial waves and
that inertial waves are almost unaffected by self-gravity. We derive an
analytic expression for the effective sound speed c_eff of
acoustic-surface-gravity waves. We also find expressions for the gravity
reduction factors relative to a razor-thin counterpart, appropriate for the
Jeans and distortional modes. The usual razor-thin dispersion relation after
correcting for c_eff and the reduction factors closely matches the numerical
results obtained by solving a full set of linearized equations. The effective
sound speed generalizes the Toomre stability parameter of the Jeans mode to
allow for the mixed GI of vertically-stratified, pressure-confined disks.

partition-circuit matroids, which are induced by partitions. Firstly, a
partition satisfies circuit axioms in matroid theory, then it can induce a
matroid which is called a partition-circuit matroid. A partition and an
equivalence relation on the same universe are one-to-one corresponding, then
some characteristics of partition-circuit matroids are studied through rough

and stars, we create synthetic AGN images to investigate the impact of an
optical nucleus on the morphological analysis of AGN hosts. Galaxy morphologies
are parameterized using the asymmetry index A, concentration index C, Gini
coefficient G and M20 index. A sample of ~200 synthetic AGN is matched to 21
real AGN in terms of redshift, host brightness and host-to-nucleus ratio to
ensure a reliable comparison between active and quiescent galaxies. The optical
nuclei strongly affect the morphological parameters of the underlying host
galaxy. Taking these effects into account, we find that the morphologies of the
AGN hosts are clearly distinct from galaxies undergoing violent gravitational
interactions. In fact, the host galaxies' distributions in morphological
descriptor space are more similar to undisturbed galaxies than major mergers.
Intermediate-luminosity (Lx < 10^44 erg/s) AGN hosts at z~0.7 show morphologies
similar to the general population of massive galaxies with significant bulges
at the same redshifts. If major mergers are the driver of nuclear activity at
this epoch, the signatures of gravitational interactions fade rapidly before
the optical AGN phase starts, making them undetectable on single-orbit HST
images, at least with usual morphological descriptors. This could be
investigated in future synthetic observations created from numerical

the Feynman rules for computing the connection correlation functions, as well
as the prescription for obtaining the Minkowski space graviton scattering
amplitudes from the latter. The present formalism turns out to be simpler than
the metric based one in many aspects. Simplifications result from the fact that
the conformal factor of the metric, a source of complications in the usual
approach, does not propagate in the connection formulation even off-shell. This
simplifies both the linearized theory and the interactions. For comparison, in
our approach the complete off-shell cubic GR interaction contains just 3 terms,
which should be compared to at least a dozen terms in the metric formalism. We
put the technology developed to use and compute the simplest graviton-graviton
scattering amplitudes. For GR we reproduce the well-known result. For our
other, distinct from GR, interacting theories of massless spin 2 particles we
obtain non-zero answers for some parity-violating amplitudes. Thus, in the
convention that all particles are incoming, we find that the 4 minus, as well
as the 3 minus 1 plus amplitudes are zero (as in GR), but the amplitudes with 4
gravitons of positive helicity, as well as the 3 plus 1 minus amplitudes are
different from zero. This serves as a good illustration of the type of parity
violation present in these theories. We find that the parity-violating
amplitudes are important at high energies, and that a general parity-violating
member of our class of theories ""likes"" one helicity (negative in our
conventions) more than the other in the sense that at high energies it tends to
convert all present gravitons into those of negative helicity.

hypothesis is to estimate the binary fraction of central stars of planetary
nebulae and to compare it with that of the main sequence population.
Preliminary results from photometric variability and the infrared excess
techniques indicate that the binary fraction of central stars of planetary

preferentially form via a binary channel. This article briefly reviews these

possibility of comparing the values of prediction to actual sensory inputs,
reward evaluation and supervised learning would not be possible.
  Comparators are usually not implemented explicitly, necessary comparisons are
commonly performed by directly comparing one-to-one the respective activities.
This implies that the characteristics of the two input streams (like size and

  It is however plausible that biological comparators emerge from
self-organizing, genetically encoded principles, which allow the system to
adapt to the changes in the input and in the organism.
  We propose an unsupervised neural circuitry, where the function of input
comparison emerges via self-organization only from the interaction of the

  The proposed neural comparator adapts, unsupervised, according to the
correlations present in the input streams. The system consists of a multilayer
feed-forward neural network which follows a local output minimization
(anti-Hebbian) rule for adaptation of the synaptic weights.
  The local output minimization allows the circuit to autonomously acquire the
capability of comparing the neural activities received from different neural
populations, which may differ in the size of the population and in the neural
encoding used. The comparator is able to compare objects never encountered

unitary-limit value of the linear conductance by exactly a factor 3/4 in the
Kondo-dominant regime $(\Gamma_m<T_K)$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature.
In the Majorana-fermion dominant phase ($\Gamma_m>T_K)$, on the other hand, the
spin-split Kondo resonance takes place due to the MFS-induced Zeeman splitting,
which is a genuine many-body effect of the strong Coulomb interaction and the
topological superconductivity. We find that the original Kondo resonance is
fully restored once the MFSs are strongly hybridized ($\epsilon_m > \Gamma_m$).
This unusual interaction between the Kondo effect and the MFS can thus serve to
detect the Majorana fermions unambiguously and quantify the degree of overlap

accreting binary systems. We find four categories of object (classic black
holes, GRS1915-like black holes, pulsars, and non-pulsing neutron stars) occupy

Assuming that this clustering effect is due to intrinsic properties of the
sources (such as mass accretion rate, binary separation, mass ratio, magnetic
field strength, etc.), we suggest possible physical effects that drive each
object to its specific location in the CCI phase space. We also suggest a
surface in this space which separates systems that produce jets from those
which do not, and demonstrate the use of CCI for identifying X-ray pulsars
where a period has not been established. This method can also be used to study
sub-clustering within a category and may prove useful for other classes of

know to what extent an encoder, who perfectly observes the played actions and

to be solved at the encoder is to design a source encoder which compresses the

encoder is that the multi-dimensional signal (namely, the action profiles) to
be encoded is assumed to comprise a component whose probability distribution is
not known to the encoder and the decoder has a side information (the private
signals received by the players when the encoder is off). This new framework
appears to be both of game-theoretical and information-theoretical interest. In
particular, it is useful for designing certain types of encoders that are
resilient to single deviations and provide an equilibrium utility region in the
proposed setting; it provides a new type of constraints to compress an
information source (i.e., a random variable). Regarding the first aspect, we

spread on surfaces patterned with lattices of diamond or triangular posts.
Considering post widths typically ~7 m and lattice spacings between 15-40 m, we
observe drop shapes with 3,4 and 6-fold symmetry, depending on both the
symmetry of the lattice and the shape of the posts. This is a result of the
different mechanisms of interface pinning and depinning which depend on the
direction of the contact line motion with respect to the post shape. Lattice
Boltzmann simulations are used to describe these mechanisms in detail for
triangular posts. We also follow the motion of the contact line as the drops
evaporate showing that they tend to return to their original shape. To explain
this we show that the easy direction for movement is the same for spreading and
drying drops. We compare the behaviour of small drops with that of larger drops
created by jetting several drops at the same position. We find that the contact
line motion is unexpectedly insensitive to drop volume, even when a spherical
cap of fluid forms above the posts. The findings are relevant to microfluidic
applications and to the control of drop shapes in ink-jet printing.

distance of the gas to the central black hole. We present the results of a
massive multiwavelength monitoring campaign on the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk
509 to constrain the location of the outflow components dominating the soft
X-ray band.
  Mrk 509 was monitored by XMM-Newton, Integral, Chandra, HST/COS and Swift in
2009. We have studied the response of the photoionised gas to the changes in
the ionising flux produced by the central regions. We were able to put tight
constraints on the variability of the absorbers from day to year time scales.
This allowed us to develop a model for the time-dependent photoionisation in
this source.
  We find that the more highly ionised gas producing most X-ray line opacity is
at least 5 pc away from the core; upper limits to the distance of various
absorbing components range between 20 pc up to a few kpc. The more lowly
ionised gas producing most UV line opacity is at least 100 pc away from the
nucleus.
  These results point to an origin of the dominant, slow (v<1000 km/s) outflow
components in the NLR or torus-region of Mrk 509. We find that while the
kinetic luminosity of the outflow is small, the mass carried away is likely
larger than the 0.5 Solar mass per year accreting onto the black hole.

the possibility of the infrared excess being created by a magma ocean planet or
a circumplanetary disk or torus. We show that the infrared excess is consistent
with a circumstellar debris disk or torus, located at approximately 6 AU, that
was created by a planetary scale hypervelocity impact. We find that radiation
pressure should remove submicron dust from the debris disk in less than one
year. However, the system's mid-infrared photometric flux, dominated by
submicron grains, has been stable within 4 percent over the last 27 years, from
IRAS (1983) to WISE (2010). Our new spectral modeling work and calculations of
the radiation pressure on fine dust in HD 172555 provide a self-consistent
explanation for this apparent contradiction. We also explore the unconfirmed
claim that 10^47 molecules of SiO vapor are needed to explain an emission
feature at 8 um in the Spitzer IRS spectrum of HD 172555. We find that unless
there are 10^48 atoms or 0.05 Earth masses of atomic Si and O vapor in the

emission from solid SiO, which naturally occurs in submicron silicate ""smokes""

evaluated to mitigate the effects of the phase noise in digital communication
systems.
  In Chapter 3 phase noise estimation in single-input single-output (SISO)
systems is investigated. First, a hard decision directed extended Kalman filter
(EKF) is applied to an uncoded system. Next, an iterative receiver algorithm
performing code-aided turbo synchronization is derived using the expectation
maximization (EM) framework for a coded system. Two soft-decision directed

scenario of perfect knowledge of phase noise at low-to-medium signal-to-noise
ratios.

(YSOs) disperse their circumstellar discs dramatically influences the eventual
formation and evolution of planetary systems. By means of extensive radiative
transfer (RT) modelling, we have developed a new set of diagnostic diagrams in
the infrared colour-colour plane (K-[24] vs. K-[8]), to aid with the
classification of the evolutionary stage of YSOs from photometric observations.
Our diagrams allow the differentiation of sources with unevolved (primordial)
discs from those evolving according to different clearing scenarios (e.g.
homologous depletion vs. inside-out dispersal), as well as from sources that
have already lost their disc. Classification of over 1500 sources in 15 nearby
star-forming regions reveals that approximately 39 % of the sources lie in the
primordial disc region, whereas between 31 % and 32 % disperse from the
inside-out and up to 22 % of the sources have already lost their disc. Less
than 2 % of the objects in our sample lie in the homogeneous draining regime.
Time-scales for the transition phase are estimated to be typically a few 10^5
years independent of stellar mass. Therefore, regardless of spectral type, we
conclude that currently available infrared photometric surveys point to fast
(of order 10 % of the global disc lifetime) inside-out clearing as the
preferred mode of disc dispersal.

  of Stochastic Systems with Discontinuities","The paper is submitted to SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty
  Quantification for possible publication",,,,"stat.ME math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of spectral projection based methods for simulation of a stochastic
system with discontinuous solution exhibits the Gibbs phenomenon, which is
characterized by oscillations near discontinuities. This paper investigates a
dynamic bi-orthogonality based approach with appropriate post-processing for
mitigating the effects of the Gibbs phenomenon. The proposed approach uses
spectral decomposition of the spatial and stochastic fields in appropriate
orthogonal bases, while the dynamic orthogonality condition is used to derive
the resultant closed form evolution equations. The orthogonal decomposition of
the spatial field is exploited to propose a Gegenbauer reprojection based
post-processing approach, where the orthogonal bases in spatial dimension are
reprojected on the Gegenbauer polynomials in the domain of analyticity. The
resultant spectral expansion in Gegenbauer series is shown to mitigate the
Gibbs phenomenon. Efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated for
simulation of a one-dimensional stochastic Burgers equation with uncertain
initial condition.

Josephson junction connected to a superconducting transmission line. At
frequencies below the well known emission peak at the Josephson frequency
(2eV/h), extra radiation is triggered by quantum fluctuations in the
electromagnetic environment. For weak tunneling couplings and typical ohmic
transmission lines, the corresponding photon flux spectrum is symmetric around
half the Josephson frequency, indicating that the photons are predominately
created in pairs. By establishing an input-output formalism for the microwave
field in the transmission line, we give further evidence for this nonclassical
photon pair production, demonstrating that it violates the classical
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for two-mode flux cross correlations. In connection
to recent experiments, we also consider a stepped transmission line, where
resonances increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
