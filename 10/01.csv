equation (SQG) in $ \mathbb{R}^2$. Motivated by the study of the homogeneous
statistical solutions of this equation, we show that for any large initial data
$\theta_{0}$ liying in the space $\Lambda^{s} (\dot H^{s}_{uloc}(\mathbb{R}^2))
\cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2)$ the critical (SQG) has a global weak solution in
time for all $1/2< s<1$. Our proof is based on an energy inequality verified by
the truncated $(SQG)_{R,\ep}$ equation. By classical compactness arguments, we
show that we are able to pass to the limit ($R \rightarrow \infty$, $\ep
\rightarrow 0$) in $(SQG)_{R,\ep}$ and that the limit solution has the desired
regularity.

test conditions of fullerene formation and survival under different metallicity
environments as we are analyzing five sources in our own Galaxy, four in the

detection of C60 (possibly also C70) fullerenes in the PN M 1-60 as well as of
the unusual 6.6, 9.8, and 20 um features (possible planar C24) in the PN K
3-54. Although selection effects in the original samples of PNe observed with
Spitzer may play a potentially significant role in the statistics, we find that
the detection rate of fullerenes in C-rich PNe increases with decreasing
metallicity (5% in the Galaxy, 20% in the LMC, and 44% in the SMC). CLOUDY
photoionization modeling matches the observed IR fluxes with central stars that
display a rather narrow range in effective temperature (30,000-45,000 K),
suggesting a common evolutionary status of the objects and similar fullerene
formation conditions. The observed C60 intensity ratios in the Galactic sources
confirm our previous finding in the MCs that the fullerene emission is not
excited by the UV radiation from the central star. CLOUDY models also show that
line- and wind-blanketed model atmospheres can explain many of the observed
[NeIII]/[NeII] ratios by photoionization suggesting that possibly the UV
radiation from the central star, and not shocks, are triggering the
decomposition of the circumstellar dust grains. With the data at hand, we
suggest that the most likely explanation for the formation of fullerenes and
graphene precursors in PNe is that these molecular species are built from the
photo-chemical processing of a carbonaceous compound with a mixture of aromatic
and aliphatic structures similar to that of HAC dust.

new path to understanding the physics of the innermost parts of the accretion
flows. While the processes giving rise to their X-ray continuum have been
studied extensively, the emission in the optical and infrared (OIR) energy
bands was less investigated and remains poorly understood. The standard
accretion disc, which may contribute to the flux at these wavelengths, is not
capable of explaining a number of observables: the infrared excesses, fast OIR
variability and a complicated correlation with the X-rays. It was suggested
that these energy bands are dominated by the jet emission, however, this
scenario does not work in a number of cases. We propose here an alternative,
namely that most of the OIR emission is produced by the extended hot accretion
flow. In this scenario, the OIR bands are dominated by the synchrotron
radiation from the non-thermal electrons. An additional contribution is
expected from the outer irradiated part of the accretion disc heated by the
X-rays. We discuss properties of the model and compare them to the data. We
show that the hot-flow scenario is consistent with many of the observed
spectral data, at the same time naturally explaining X-ray timing properties,
fast OIR variability and its correlation with the X-rays.

Torquato, Phys. Rev. E, 86, 021505 (2012)]. It was found that a precursor to
the glassy jammed state was evident long before the jamming density was reached
as measured by a growing nonequilibrium length scale extracted from the volume
integral of the direct correlation function $c(r)$, which becomes long-ranged
as the critical jammed state is reached. The present study extends that work by
investigating via computer simulations two different atomic models: the
single-component Z2 Dzugutov potential in three dimensions and the
binary-mixture Kob-Andersen potential in two dimensions. Consistent with the
aforementioned hard-sphere study, we demonstrate that for both models a
signature of the glass transition is apparent well before the transition
temperature is reached as measured by the length scale determined from from the
volume integral of the direct correlation function in the single-component case
and a generalized direct correlation function in the binary-mixture case. The
latter quantity is obtained from a generalized Orstein-Zernike integral
equation for a certain decoration of the atomic point configuration. We also
show that these growing length scales, which are a consequence of the
long-range nature of the direct correlation functions, are intrinsically
nonequilibrium in nature as determined by an index $X$ that is a measure of
deviation from thermal equilibrium. It is also demonstrated that this
nonequilibrium index, which increases upon supercooling, is correlated with a
characteristic relaxation time scale.

intensity-selected spectroscopy outside of outbursts. We demonstrated that

870-um band derived from arcsecond resolution observations with the Atacama
Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). We have used ALMA to map a sample of 122
870-um-selected submillimetre sources drawn from the (0.5x0.5)deg^2 LABOCA
Extended Chandra Deep Field South Submillimetre Survey (LESS). These ALMA maps
have an average depth of sigma(870um)~0.4mJy, some ~3x deeper than the original
LABOCA survey and critically the angular resolution is more than an order of
magnitude higher, FWHM of ~1.5"" compared to ~19"" for the LABOCA discovery map.
This combination of sensitivity and resolution allows us to precisely pin-point
the SMGs contributing to the submillimetre sources from the LABOCA map, free
from the effects of confusion. We show that our ALMA-derived SMG counts broadly
agree with the submillimetre source counts from previous, lower-resolution
single-dish surveys, demonstrating that the bulk of the submillimetre sources
are not caused by blending of unresolved SMGs. The difficulty which
well-constrained theoretical models have in reproducing the high-surface
densities of SMGs, thus remains. However, our observations do show that all of
the very brightest sources in the LESS sample, S(870um)>12mJy, comprise
emission from multiple, fainter SMGs, each with 870-um fluxes of <9mJy. This
implies a natural limit to the star-formation rate in SMGs of <10^3 M_Sun/yr,
which in turn suggests that the space densities of z>1 galaxies with gas masses
in excess of ~5x10^10 M_Sun is <10^-5 Mpc^-3. We also discuss the influence of
this blending on the identification and characterisation of the SMG
counterparts to these bright submillimetre sources and suggest that it may be
responsible for previous claims that they lie at higher redshifts than fainter
SMGs.

on H-topological minor free graphs. We prove the existence of polynomial time
algorithms that, for a given H-topological-minor-free graph G and a positive
integer k, output an H-topological-minor-free graph G' on O(k) vertices such
that G has a (connected) dominating set of size k iff G' has one. Our results
extend the known classes of graphs on which the Dominating Set and Connected
Dominating Set problems admit linear kernels. Prior to our work, it was known
that these problems admit linear kernels on graphs excluding a fixed apex graph
H as a minor. Moreover, for Dominating Set, a kernel of size kc(H), where c(H)
is a constant depending on the size of H, follows from a more general result on
the kernelization of Dominating Set on graphs of bounded degeneracy. Alon and
Gutner explicitly asked whether one can obtain a linear kernel for Dominating
Set on H-minor-free graphs. We answer this question in the affirmative and in
fact prove a more general result. For Connected Dominating Set no polynomial
kernel even on H-minor-free graphs was known prior to our work. On the negative
side, it is known that Connected Dominating Set on 2-degenerated graphs does
not admit a polynomial kernel unless coNP $\subseteq$ NP/poly. Our
kernelization algorithm is based on a non-trivial combination of the following
ingredients The structural theorem of Grohe and Marx [STOC 2012] for graphs
excluding a fixed graph H as a topological minor; A novel notion of
protrusions, different than the one defined in [FOCS 2009]; Our results are
based on a generic reduction rule that produces an equivalent instance (in case
the input graph is H-minor-free) of the problem, with treewidth $O(\sqrt{k})$.
The application of this rule in a divide-and-conquer fashion, together with the
new notion of protrusions, gives us the linear kernels.

classical {\sc Steiner Tree} problem on various classes of directed sparse
graphs. While the parameterized complexity of {\sc Steiner Tree} parameterized
by the number of terminals is well understood, not much is known about the
parameterization by the number of non-terminals in the solution tree. All that
is known for this parameterization is that both the directed and the undirected
versions are W[2]-hard on general graphs, and hence unlikely to be fixed
parameter tractable FPT. The undirected {\sc Steiner Tree} problem becomes FPT
when restricted to sparse classes of graphs such as planar graphs, but the
techniques used to show this result break down on directed planar graphs.
  In this article we precisely chart the tractability border for {\sc Directed
Steiner Tree} (DST) on sparse graphs parameterized by the number of
non-terminals in the solution tree. Specifically, we show that the problem is
fixed parameter tractable on graphs excluding a topological minor, but becomes
W[2]-hard on graphs of degeneracy 2. On the other hand we show that if the
subgraph induced by the terminals is required to be acyclic then the problem
becomes FPT on graphs of bounded degeneracy.
  We further show that our algorithm achieves the best possible running time
dependence on the solution size and degeneracy of the input graph, under
standard complexity theoretic assumptions. Using the ideas developed for DST,
we also obtain improved algorithms for {\sc Dominating Set} on sparse
undirected graphs. These algorithms are asymptotically optimal.

equations may be described as a redundant system of nonlinear partial
differential equations.
  We propose a framework to analyze the uniqueness and stability properties of

conditions. General theories of elliptic systems then allow us to construct a
parametrix for such systems and derive optimal stability estimates.

Calder\'on, in the context of redundant elliptic systems of equations.
  The theory is applied to the case of power density measurements, which are

AF characteristic from the NMR spectrum is incomplete between 3.5 K and TN= 5.4
K, which could be affected by quantum spin fluctuations. The AF NMR spectrum
indicates two V sites experiencing different magnetic field magnitudes, HA1=2.1

the classical and the pseudo-dipolar fields from Co2+ spins with a proposed
magnetic structure based on the neutron diffraction measurements. In the
paramagnetic state, the nuclear spin relaxation is dominated by AF spin
fluctuations through the dipolar-type coupling between V and surrounding Co2+
ions. The linear relation between the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate
1/T1T and the magnetic susceptibility chi indicates that the Q component of
magnetic susceptibility chi(Q) is roughly proportional to chi, where Q is the

critical points of appropriate scalar functions parametrized by the Lie algebra

Poisson, or variational - generating dynamical systems from such functions
highlights the common features of their construction and analysis, and supports
the construction of analogous functions in non-Hamiltonian settings. If the
symmetry group is nonabelian, the functions are invariant only with respect to
the isotropy subgroup of the given parameter value. Replacing the parametrized
family of functions with a single function on the product manifold and
extending the action using the (co)adjoint action on the algebra or its dual
yields a fully invariant function. An invariant map can be used to reverse the
usual perspective: rather than selecting a parametrized family of functions and
finding their critical points, conditions under which functions will be
critical on specific orbits, typically distinguished by isotropy class, can be
derived. This strategy is illustrated using several well-known mechanical
systems - the Lagrange top, the double spherical pendulum, the free rigid body,
and the Riemann ellipsoids - and generalizations of these systems.

random samples to obtain the central frequency, linewidth and field speckle
pattern of the modes for an ensemble of samples at three lengths. We find
strong correlation between modal field speckle patterns. This leads to
destructive interference between modes which explain strong suppression of
steady state transmission and of pulsed transmission at early times. We have
also studied the statistics of mode spacings and widths in localized samples.
The distribution of mode spacings between adjacent modes is close to the Wigner
surmise predicted for diffusive waves, which exhibit strong level repulsion.
However, a deviation from Wigner distribution can be seen in the distribution
of spacings beyond the nearest ones. A weakening in the rigidity of the modal
spectrum is also observed as the sample length increases because of reduced
level repulsion for more strongly localized waves. In contrast to residual
diffusive behavior for level spacing statistics, the distribution of level
widths are log-normal as predicted for localized waves. We also measured the
steady state and dynamic fluctuations and correlation of localized wave
transmitted through random waveguides. We find the degree of intensity
correlation first increases, and then decays with time delay, before increasing
dramatically. The variation in the spatial correlation of intensity with time
delay is due to the changing effective number of modes that contribute to
transmission. A minimum in correlation is reached when the number of modes
contributing appreciably to transmission peaks. At long times, the degree of
intensity correlation and the variance of total transmission increase
dramatically. This reflects the reduced role of short-lived states and the
growing weight of long-lived modes.

hydrogen and deuterium at pressure ranges of from 250 to 350 GPa and
temperature range of from 300 to 500 K. This proton transfer is intimately
related to the particular elongation of molecules in graphenelike layers, and
it becomes more pronounced with increasing pressure at the course of larger
elongation of molecules. As the consequence of proton transfer, hydrogen
molecules in graphenelike layers are short lived and hydrogen vibration is
strongly anharmonic. Our findings provide direct explanations on the observed
abrupt increase of Raman width at the formation of phase IV and its large
increase with pressure.

Our aim is to develop a software tool that screens TCGA data sets for
genes/miRNAs with functional involvement in specific cancers. Furthermore, our
computational pipeline is intended to produce a set of visualizations, or
profiles, that place our screened outputs in a pathway-centric context. We
accomplish our 'screening' by ranking genes/miRNAs by the correlation of their
expression misregulation with differential patient survival. In other words, if
a gene/miRNA is consistently misregulated in patients with poor survival rates
and, on the other hand, is expressed more 'normally' in patients with longer
survival rates, then it is ranked highly; if its misregulation has no such
correlation with good/bad survival in patients, then its rank is low. Our
pathway profiling pipeline produces several outputs, which allow us to examine
the functional roles played by highly ranked genes discovered by our screening.
Running the OV (ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma) data set through our
analysis pipeline, we find that several highly ranked pathways and functional
groups of genes (VEGF, Jun, Fos, etc.) have already been shown to play some
part in the development of epithelial ovarian carcinomas. We also observe that
the dysfunction of the Wnt signaling pathway, which regulates cell-fate
specification and progenitor cell differentiation, has a disproportionate
impact on the survival of ovarian cancer patients.

difficult to characterize because direct measurements of photon arrival times
are limited by the temporal resolution of photon detection. Here, we explore an
alternative possibility of characterizing the temporal coherence of two-photon
wavefunctions using single photon interference with weak coherent light.
Specifically, this method makes use of the fact that down-conversion generates
a coherent superposition of vacuum and two-photon states, so that the
coincidence count rates for photon pairs after interference with weak coherent
light are given by a superposition of the two-photon wavefunction from the
down-conversion with the product wavefunction defined by the weak coherent
references. By observing the frequency dependent interference pattern, it is
possible to reconstruct the amplitudes and the phases of the two-photon
wavefunction within the bandwidth of the reference pulses used in the single
photon interferences. The correlated single photon interferences therefore
provide a direct map of the entangled two-photon wavefunction generated in the
down-conversion process.

solid (VBS) states doped with fermionic holes. As concrete examples, we
consider the supersymmetric extension of the SU(2)- and the SO(5) VBS states,
dubbed UOSp(1|2) and UOSp(1|4) supersymmetric VBS states, respectively.
Specifically, we investigate the string-order parameters and the entanglement
spectra of these states to find that, even when the parent states (bosonic VBS
states) do not support the string order, they recover it when holes are doped
and the fermionic sector appears in the entanglement spectrum. These peculiar
properties are discussed in light of the symmetry-protected topological order.
To this end, we characterize a few typical classes of symmetry-protected
topological orders in terms of supermatrix-product states (SMPS). From this, we
see that the topological order in the bulk manifests itself in the
transformation properties of the SMPS in question and thereby affects the
structure of the entanglement spectrum. Then, we explicitly relate the
existence of the string order and the structure of the entanglement spectrum to
explain the recovery and the stabilization of the string order in the
supersymmetric systems.

investigate the underlying biological processes of CAC development from zero to

studies, a model selection procedure based on likelihood cross-validation is
adopted to identify the optimal model, which is justified by comparative Monte
Carlo studies. A shrinkaged version of cubic regression spline is used for
model estimation and variable selection simultaneously. When applying the
proposed methods to the MESA data analysis, we show that the two biological
mechanisms influencing the initiation of CAC and the magnitude of CAC when it
is positive are better characterized by an unconstrained zero-inflated normal

and may provide further insights into the biological mechanisms underlying CAC
development in humans. This highly flexible statistical framework can be
applied to zero-inflated data analyses in other areas.

high redshift of z=1.61 in the Chandra Deep Field South. The group is first
identified as an extended X-ray source. We use a wealth of deep
multi-wavelength data to identify the optical counterpart -- our red sequence
finder detects a significant over-density of galaxies at z~1.6 and the
brightest group galaxy is spectroscopically confirmed at z=1.61. We measure an
X-ray luminosity of L_{0.1-2.4 keV}= 1.8\pm0.6 \times 10^{43} erg/s, which then
translates into a group mass of 3.2\pm0.8 \times 10^{13} M_sun. This is the
lowest mass group ever confirmed at z>1.5. The deep optical-nearIR images from
CANDELS reveal that the group exhibits a surprisingly prominent red sequence. A
detailed analysis of the spectral energy distributions of the group member
candidates confirms that most of them are indeed passive galaxies. Furthermore,
their structural parameters measured from the near-IR CANDELS images show that
they are morphologically early-type. The newly identified group at z=1.61 is
dominated by quiescent early-type galaxies and the group appears similar to
those in the local Universe. One possible difference is the high fraction of
AGN (38^{+23}_{-20}%), which might indicate a role for AGN in quenching. But, a
statistical sample of high-z groups is needed to draw a general picture of
groups at this redshift. Such a sample will hopefully be available in near
future surveys.

nonlinearity, there are two types of overfitting. Therefore, a double penalized
approach is introduced for order selection. To implement this approach, a
global optimization algorithm using mixed integer programming is discussed. The

on a new variant of spectral graph theory named diffusion maps. The research is
performed on spectral domain (SD) OCT images depicting macular and optic nerve
head appearance. The presented approach does not require edge-based image
information and relies on regional image texture. Consequently, the proposed
method demonstrates robustness in situations of low image contrast or poor
layer-to-layer image gradients. Diffusion mapping is applied to 2D and 3D OCT
datasets composed of two steps, one for partitioning the data into important
and less important sections, and another one for localization of internal
layers.In the first step, the pixels/voxels are grouped in rectangular/cubic
sets to form a graph node.The weights of a graph are calculated based on
geometric distances between pixels/voxels and differences of their mean
intensity.The first diffusion map clusters the data into three parts, the
second of which is the area of interest. The other two sections are eliminated
from the remaining calculations. In the second step, the remaining area is
subjected to another diffusion map assessment and the internal layers are
localized based on their textural similarities.The proposed method was tested
on 23 datasets from two patient groups (glaucoma and normals). The mean
unsigned border positioning errors(mean - SD) was 8.52 - 3.13 and 7.56 - 2.95

family of higher order Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, OU$(p)$, in a similar
spirit as the higher order autoregressive processes AR$(p)$. We show that for

of an AR$(p)$, and that for various continuous time processes, sampled from
real data at equally spaced time instants, the OU$(p)$ model outperforms the
appropriate AR$(p)$ model.

parameters can be computed efficiently because, as we show, the iteration of OU
operators leads to a process that can be expressed as a linear combination of
basic OU processes. Using this expression we obtain a closed formula for the
covariance of the iterated OU process, and consequently estimate the parameters

prominent role in the study of qualitative dynamics and bifurcation analysis.
When interpreting the Jacobian as an adjacency matrix of an interaction graph,
its principal minors correspond to sets of disjoint cycles in this graph and
conditions for various dynamic behaviors can be inferred from its cycle
structure. For chemical reaction systems, more fine-grained analyses are
possible by studying a bipartite species-reaction graph. Several results on
injectivity, multistationarity, and bifurcations of a chemical reaction system
have been derived by using various definitions of such bipartite graph. Here,
we present a new definition of the species-reaction graph that more directly
connects the cycle structure with determinant expansion terms, principal
minors, and the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial and encompasses
previous graph constructions as special cases. This graph has a direct relation
to the interaction graph, and properties of cycles and sub-graphs can be
translated in both directions. A simple equivalence relation enables to
decompose determinant expansions more directly and allows simpler and more
direct proofs of previous results.

effects, on planets at several AU from the star, of strong tidal forces arising
from the star's large convective envelope, and of the planets' orbital
expansion due to stellar mass loss. We, for the first time, study the evolution
of planets while following each thermal pulse on the AGB. For Jovian planets,
tidal forces are strong, and can pull into the envelope planets initially at ~3
AU for a 1M_Sol star and ~5 AU for a 5M_Sol star. Lower-mass planets feel
weaker tidal forces, and Terrestrial planets initially within 1.5-3 AU enter
the stellar envelope. Thus, low-mass planets that begin inside the maximum
stellar radius can survive, as their orbits expand due to mass loss. The
inclusion of a moderate planetary eccentricity slightly strengthens the tidal
forces experienced by Jovian planets. Eccentric Terrestrial planets are more at
risk, since their eccentricity does not decay and their small pericentre takes
them inside the stellar envelope. We also find the closest radii at which
planets will be found around White Dwarfs, assuming that any planet entering
the stellar envelope is destroyed. Planets are in that case unlikely to be
found inside ~1.5 AU of a White Dwarf with a 1M_Sol progenitor and ~10 AU of a

Network description and analysis not only give a systems-level understanding of

network topology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity,
protein structure, protein-protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction

propose that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The central hit
strategy selectively targets central nodes/edges of the flexible networks of
infectious agents or cancer cells to kill them. The network influence strategy
works against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid
networks needs to be achieved by targeting the neighbors of central nodes or
edges. It is shown how network techniques can help in the identification of
single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug target candidates.
We review the recent boom in network methods helping hit identification, lead
selection optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing side-effects and drug
toxicity. Successful network-based drug development strategies are shown
through the examples of infections, cancer, metabolic diseases,
neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Summarizing more than 1200 references we
suggest an optimized protocol of network-aided drug development, and provide a
list of systems-level hallmarks of drug quality. Finally, we highlight

capsid proteins having thicknesses between 2 nm and 4 nm. To investigate
whether, in addition to the fairly conserved geometry, capsid proteins show
similarities in the way they interact with one another, we examined the shapes
of the capsids in detail. We classified them numerically according to their
similarity to sphere and icosahedron and an interpolating set of shapes in
between, all of them obtained from the theory of elasticity of shells. In order
to make a unique and straightforward connection between an idealized,
numerically calculated shape of an elastic shell and a capsid, we devised a

shape fitting the capsid best. Using such a procedure we performed statistical
analysis of a series of virus shapes and we found similarities between the

matter of debate despite the increasing number of available data provided by
spectroscopic surveys of star-forming galaxies at different redshifts. The
fundamental relations involving metallicity, such as the mass-metallicity
relation (MZR) or the fundamental-metallicity relation, give controversial
results about the reality of evolution of the chemical content of galaxies at a
given stellar mass. In this work we shed some light on this issue using the
completeness reached by the 20k bright sample of the zCOSMOS survey and using
for the first time the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio (N/O) as a tracer of the gas
phase chemical evolution of galaxies that is independent of the star formation
rate. Emission-line galaxies both in the SDSS and 20k zCOSMOS bright survey
were used to study the evolution from the local Universe of the $MZR up to a
redshift of 1.32 and the relation between stellar mass and nitrogen-to-oxygen
ratio (MNOR) up to a redshift of 0.42 using the N2S2 parameter. All the
physical properties derived from stellar continuum and gas emission-lines,
including stellar mass, star formation rates, metallicity and N/O, were
calculated in a self-consistent way over the full redshift range. We confirm
the trend to find lower metallicities in galaxies of a given stellar mass in a
younger Universe. This trend is even observed when taking possible selection
effects into account that are due to the observed larger median star formation
rates for galaxies at higher redshifts. We also find a significant evolution of
the MNOR up to z = 0.4. Taking the slope of the O/H vs. N/O relation into
account for the secondary-nitrogen production regime, the observed evolution of
the MNOR is consistent with the trends found for both the MZR and its
equivalent relation using new expressions to reduce its dependence on SFR.

millimeter waves. In this paper, we present the RF performance of metal mesh
surfaces at 43 GHz. For this purpose, we developed an apparatus to measure the
reflection coefficient, transmission coefficient, and radiative coefficient of
the mesh surface. The reflection coefficient increases as a function of metal
mesh surface tension, whereas the radiative coefficient decreases. The
anisotropic aspects of the reflection coefficient and the radiative coefficient
are also clearly seen. They depend on the front and back sides of the metal
mesh surface and the rotation angle. The transmission coefficient was measured
to be almost constant. The measured radiative coefficients and transmission
coefficients would cause significant degradation of the system noise
temperature. In addition, we carried out an astronomical observation of a
well-known SiO maser source, R Cas, by using a metal mesh mirror on the NRO
45-m radio telescope Coude system. The metal mesh mirror considerably increases
the system noise temperature and slightly decreases the peak antenna

Ising-Heisenberg model on two different but topologically related

mapping based on generalized star-triangle transformations enables one to
derive exact analytical results for the free and internal energy, spontaneous
magnetization, entropy and specific heat from the known exact results for the
corresponding spin-1/2 Ising model on a triangular lattice. It is demonstrated
that several unconventional quantum ordered and disordered phases may become
the ground state in addition to the classical ferromagnetic phase with a
perfect alignment of all constituent spins. A mutual competition between the
ferromagnetic Ising and XXZ Heisenberg interactions may lead to an appearance
of a peculiar quantum ferromagnetic phase, in which the magnetic moment of the
Heisenberg spins undergoes a quantum reduction to one third of the saturation
value in contrast with the fully saturated magnetic moment of the classical
Ising spins. In the highly frustrated regime, we have found either the
disordered quantum paramagnetic phase with the substantial residual entropy or
a similar but strikingly spontaneously long-range ordered phase, in which a
quantum reduction of the magnetic moment of the Heisenberg spins causes a small
quantum reduction of the magnetic moment of otherwise purely classical Ising
spins. It is evidenced that the specific heat exhibits diverse thermal
dependences with or without a logarithmic divergence superimposed either on one
or two round Schottky-type maxima.

improves the agreement between the theory and the room temperature experimental

that partons move independently throughout the environment created in a heavy
ion collision and with densities expected from equilibrium considerations. In
lattice calculations, charge correlations suggest that quarks exist
independently, and are not merely exchanged from hadronic object to another.
Many experimental signatures (J/Psi suppression, quark number scaling, etc.)
suggest that quarks are not confined to their original singlets, but these
signatures do not make a clear case that quarks move independently or that they
have the expected densities. I discuss a class of measurements that parallel
lattice observables and has the prospect of investigating whether partonic

represent evolutionary histories of species that undergo reticulate
evolutionary processes such as hybridization, recombination and lateral gene
transfer. Recently, there has been great interest in trying to develop methods
to construct rooted phylogenetic networks from triplets, that is rooted trees
on three species. However, although triplets determine or encode rooted
phylogenetic trees, they do not in general encode rooted phylogenetic networks,
which is a potential issue for any such method. Motivated by this fact, Huber
and Moulton recently introduced trinets as a natural extension of rooted
triplets to networks. In particular, they showed that level-1 phylogenetic
networks are encoded by their trinets, and also conjectured that all
""recoverable"" rooted phylogenetic networks are encoded by their trinets. Here
we prove that recoverable binary level-2 networks and binary tree-child
networks are also encoded by their trinets. To do this we prove two
decomposition theorems based on trinets which hold for all recoverable binary
rooted phylogenetic networks. Our results provide some additional evidence in
support of the conjecture that trinets encode all recoverable rooted
phylogenetic networks, and could also lead to new approaches to construct
phylogenetic networks from trinets.

(JKD) model which describes the viscous dissipations in the pores. Indeed, the
time-domain version of Biot-JKD model involves order 1/2 shifted fractional
derivatives which amounts to a time convolution product. To avoid storing the
past values of the solution, a diffusive representation of fractional
derivatives is used: the convolution kernel is replaced by a finite number of
memory variables that satisfy local-in-time ordinary differential equations.
The coefficients of the diffusive representation follow from an optimization
procedure of the dispersion relation. Then, various methods of scientific
computing are applied: the propagative part of the equations is discretized
using a fourth-order ADER scheme, whereas the diffusive part is solved exactly.
An immersed interface method is implemented to discretize the geometry on a
Cartesian grid, and also to enforce the jump conditions at interfaces.

where access decisions are based on policy statements issued by multiple
principals and stored in a distributed manner. In trust management, the policy
statements of a principal can refer to other principals' statements; thus, the
process of evaluating an access request (i.e., a goal) consists of finding a
""chain"" of policy statements that allows the access to the requested resource.
Most existing goal evaluation algorithms for trust management either rely on a
centralized evaluation strategy, which consists of collecting all the relevant
policy statements in a single location (and therefore they do not guarantee the
confidentiality of intensional policies), or do not detect the termination of
the computation (i.e., when all the answers of a goal are computed). In this
paper we present GEM, a distributed goal evaluation algorithm for trust
management systems that relies on function-free logic programming for the
specification of policy statements. GEM detects termination in a completely
distributed way without disclosing intensional policies, thereby preserving
their confidentiality. We demonstrate that the algorithm terminates and is
sound and complete with respect to the standard semantics for logic programs.

time-correlation functions tends to be long-lived as $T$ is lowered. As a
result, the relaxation time $\tau_\alpha$ and the viscosity $\eta$ grow more
steeply than the inverse diffusion constant $D^{-1}$ at low $T$, leading to
breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation. At low $T$, the diffusion occurs as
activation processes and may well be described by short-time analysis of rare
jump motions with broken bonds and large displacements. Some characteristic
features of the van Hove self-correlation function arise from escape jumps over

penalized regression, such as the lasso. Preselection - to start with a
manageable set of covariates - has often been implemented without clear
appreciation of its potential bias. Based on sequential implementation of the
lasso with increasing lists of predictors, we find a new property of the set of
corresponding cross-validation curves, a pattern that we call freezing. It
allows to determine a subset of covariates with which we reach the same lasso
solution as would be obtained using the full set of covariates. Freezing has
not been characterized before and is different from recently discussed safe
rules for discarding predictors. We demonstrate by simulation that ranking
predictors by their univariate correlation with the outcome, leads in a
majority of cases to early freezing, giving a safe and efficient way of
focusing the lasso analysis on a smaller and manageable number of predictors.
We illustrate the applicability of our strategy in the context of a GWAS
analysis and on microarray genomic data. Freezing offers great potential for
extending the applicability of penalized regressions to ultra highdimensional
data sets. Its applicability is not limited to the standard lasso but is a
generic property of many penalized approaches.

construction based on the direct product of the real projective plane with the
standard four-dimensional Minkowski space-time and discuss its relevance as a
model of a weakly interacting Dark Matter candidate. One important difference
with other typical UED models is the origin of the symmetry leading to the
stability of the dark matter particle. This symmetry in our case is a remnant
of the six-dimensional Minkowski space-time symmetry partially broken by the
compactification. Another important difference is the very small mass splitting
between the particles of a given Kaluza-Klein tier, which gives a very
important role to co-annihilation effects. Finally the role of higher
Kaluza-Klein tiers is also important and is discussed together with a detailed
numerical description of the influence of the resonances.

astronomy with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), with a focus on imaging
observations. Methods: We have analysed the radio-frequency interference (RFI)
situation in two 24-h surveys with Dutch LOFAR stations, covering 30-78 MHz
with low-band antennas and 115-163 MHz with high-band antennas. This is a
subset of the full frequency range of LOFAR. The surveys have been observed
with a 0.76 kHz / 1 s resolution. Results: We measured the RFI occupancy in the
low and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. These values are
found to be representative values for the LOFAR radio environment. Between day
and night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. We find
that lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of LOFAR
results in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. At LOFAR's nominal resolution of
0.76 kHz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. This rate increases
approximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.
Conclusions: Currently, by using an automated RFI detection strategy, the LOFAR
radio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. It
remains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations that
integrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. Reasons for
the low impact of RFI are the high spectral and time resolution of LOFAR;
accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and the
proximity of the antennas to the ground. We discuss some strategies that can be
used once low-level RFI starts to become apparent. It is important that the
frequency range of LOFAR remains free of broadband interference, such as DAB
stations and windmills.

metallicity and charge excitations are gapped. In dimensions greater than one,
their spins are usually ordered antiferromagnetically at low temperatures.
Geometrical frustrations can destroy this long-range order, leading to exotic
quantum spin liquid (QSL) states. However, their magnetic ground states have
been a long-standing mystery. Here we show that a QSL state in the organic Mott
insulator EtMe$_3$Sb[Pd(dmit)$_2$]$_2$ with two-dimensional triangular lattice
has Pauli-paramagnetic-like low-energy excitations, which are a hallmark of
itinerant fermions. Our torque magnetometry down to low temperatures (30 mK) up
to high fields (32 T) reveal distinct residual paramagnetic susceptibility
comparable to that in a half-filled two-dimensional metal. This demonstrates
that the system is in a magnetically gapless ground state, a critical state
with infinite magnetic correlation length. Moreover, our results are robust
against deuteration, pointing toward the emergence of an extended `quantum
critical phase', in which low-energy spin excitations behave as in paramagnetic
metals with Fermi surface, despite the frozen charge degree of freedom.

surface densities of oxide charges and interface traps at the Si-SiO2
interface, and the surface-current densities have been determined as function
of dose. Results indicate that the dose dependence of the surface density of
oxide charges and the surface-current density depend on the crystal orientation
and producer. In addition, the influence of the voltage applied to the gates of
the MOS capacitor and the gate-controlled diode during X-ray irradiation on the
surface density of oxide charges and the surface-current density has been
investigated at doses of 100 kGy and 100 MGy. It is found that both strongly
depend on the gate voltage if the electric field in the oxide points from the
surface of the SiO2 to the Si-SiO2 interface. Finally, annealing studies have
been performed at 60 and 80 degree C on MOS capacitors and gate-controlled
diodes irradiated to 5 MGy and the annealing kinetics of oxide charges and
surface current determined.

transmission of an acoustic pulse is demonstrated. This study has been done on
a stainless steel plate with regions of thickness 10:0 mm, 9:8 mm, and 9:6 mm,
using broadband pulses with energy in 200 kHz to 600 kHz band. Ultimately the
goal is to perform similar air-coupled thickness measurements in a single sided
pitch-catch measurement setup.
  The spectra of the transmitted pulses show the first and second harmonics of
the compressional waves in the plate. When compared to a plane wave model of a
fluid layer embedded in air, the second harmonic of the plate resonance fits
well with the expected value. However, the first harmonic deviates such that
the plate appears thicker at this resonance. This is believed to be caused by
the finite aperture of the transmitting transducer, causing deviations from a
plane wave. Thickness differences of 0:2 mm between the different regions of
the plate were shown to be resolved.
  A third peak was found in the spectra. The origin of this peaks has not been
verified, but is believed to come from the third harmonic of the shear wave in

dijet production at the LHC and the Tevatron, comprising tree-level effects of
O(\alpha_s\alpha,\alpha^2) and weak loop corrections of O(\alpha_s^2\alpha).
Although negligible for integrated cross sections, these corrections can reach
10-20% in the TeV range for transverse jet momenta k_T. Our detailed discussion
of numerical results comprises distributions in the dijet invariant mass and in
the transverse momenta of the leading and subleading jets. We find that the
weak loop corrections amount to about -12% and -10% for leading jets with
k_T~3TeV at the 14TeV LHC and k_T~800GeV at the Tevatron, respectively. The
electroweak tree-level contributions are of the same generic size and typically
positive at the LHC and negative at the Tevatron at high energy scales.
Generally the corrections to the dijet invariant mass distributions are smaller
by at least a factor of two as compared to the corresponding reach in the k_T
distributions, because unlike the k_T spectra the invariant-mass distributions
are not dominated by the Sudakov regime at high energy scales.

that the black hole mass is approximately 10^5 solar masses, among the lowest

measurement uses the full 2010 data sample, corresponding to an integrated

jets are identified in the dijet events, where the jet flavour is defined by
the presence of bottom, charm or solely light flavour hadrons in the jet.
Kinematic variables, based on the properties of displaced decay vertices and
optimised for jet flavour identification, are used in a multidimensional
template fit to measure the fractions of these dijet flavour states as
functions of the leading jet transverse momentum in the range 40 GeV to 500 GeV
and jet rapidity |y| < 2.1. The fit results agree with the predictions of
leading- and next-to-leading-order calculations, with the exception of the
dijet fraction composed of bottom and light flavour jets, which is
underestimated by all models at large transverse jet momenta. The ability to
identify jets containing two b-hadrons, originating from e.g. gluon splitting,
is demonstrated. The difference between bottom jet production rates in leading
and subleading jets is consistent with the next-to-leading-order predictions.

performance assessment in the medical sciences. However, different areas of
medical research may have considerably different citation practices, even
within the same medical field. Because of this, it is unclear to what extent
citation-based bibliometric indicators allow for valid comparisons between
research units active in different areas of medical research.
  Methodology: A visualization methodology is introduced that reveals
differences in citation practices between medical research areas. The
methodology extracts terms from the titles and abstracts of a large collection
of publications and uses these terms to visualize the structure of a medical
field and to indicate how research areas within this field differ from each
other in their average citation impact.
  Results: Visualizations are provided for 32 medical fields, defined based on
journal subject categories in the Web of Science database. The analysis focuses
on three fields. In each of these fields, there turn out to be large
differences in citation practices between research areas. Low-impact research
areas tend to focus on clinical intervention research, while high-impact
research areas are often more oriented on basic and diagnostic research.
  Conclusions: Popular bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index and the
impact factor, do not correct for differences in citation practices between
medical fields. These indicators therefore cannot be used to make accurate
between-field comparisons. More sophisticated bibliometric indicators do
correct for field differences but still fail to take into account within-field
heterogeneity in citation practices. As a consequence, the citation impact of
clinical intervention research may be substantially underestimated in
comparison with basic and diagnostic research.

particles. We find that for sufficiently large boosts, black hole formation
occurs. Moreover, near yet above the threshold of black hole formation, the
collision initially leads to the formation of two distinct apparent horizons
that subsequently merge. We argue that this can be understood in terms of a
focusing effect, where one boosted particle acts as a gravitational lens on the
other and vice versa, and that this is further responsible for the threshold
being lower (by a factor of a few) compared to simple hoop conjecture
estimates. Cases slightly below threshold result in complete disruption of the

star's envelope while it was on the late asymptotic giant branch (AGB). Hence,
the initial separation of the system was ~2 AU, with common envelope evolution
reducing the separation to its current value. The initial and final orbital
separations allow us to constrain the combination of the common envelope
efficiency (alpha) and binding energy parameters (lambda) for the AGB star to
alpha lambda ~3. We examine the various formation scenarios and conclude that
the substellar object was most likely to have been captured by the white dwarf
progenitor early in the life of the cluster, rather than forming in situ.

dynamics (PID) and to derive unified field equations coupling the four
fundamental interactions based on first principles. PID is a least action
principle subject to div$_A$-free constraints for the variational element with
$A$ being gauge potentials. The Lagrangian action is uniquely determined by 1)
the principle of general relativity, 2) the $U(1)$, $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ gauge
invariances, 3) the Lorentz invariance, and 4) principle of principle of
representation invariance (PRI), introduced in [11]. The unified field
equations are then derived using PID. The unified field model spontaneously
breaks the gauge symmetries, and gives rise to a new mechanism for energy and
mass generation. The unified field model introduces a natural duality between
the mediators and their dual mediators, and can be easily decoupled to study
each individual interaction when other interactions are negligible. The unified
field model, together with PRI and PID applied to individual interactions,
provides clear explanations and solutions to a number of outstanding challenges
in physics and cosmology, including e.g. the dark energy and dark matter
phenomena, the quark confinement, asymptotic freedom, short-range nature of
both strong and weak interactions, decay mechanism of sub-atomic particles,
baryon asymmetry, and the solar neutrino problem.

semiinfinite, i.e. we have two adjacent waveguides coupled laterally through
the boundary window, the system has for any a>0 a finite number of eigenvalues
below the essential spectrum threshold. Here we demonstrate that for large but
finite $\ell_\pm$ the system has resonances which converge to the said
eigenvalues as $\ell_\pm\to\infty$, and derive the leading term in the
corresponding asymptotic expansion.

still a difficult problem to tackle. Lot of progressive research has been made
on the development of suitable standards. These researches help to alleviate
and overcome some of the web services composition issues. However, the legacy
application wrappers generate nonstandard WSDL which hinder the progress.
Indeed, in addition to their lack of semantics, WSDLs have sometimes different
shapes because they are adapted to circumvent some technical implementation
aspect. In this paper, we propose a method for the semi automatic composition
of web services in the context of the NeuroLOG project. In this project the
reuse of processing tools relies on a legacy application wrapper called jGASW.
The paper describes the extensions to OWL-S in order to introduce and enable
the composition of web services generated using the jGASW wrapper and also to
implement consistency checks regarding these services.

and matter fields with minimal interaction on domain walls using $U(N)_c$ gauge
theory with $SU(N)_{L}\times SU(N)_{R}\times U(1)_{A}$ flavor symmetry.
Localization of non-Abelian fields is achieved using field-dependent gauge
coupling. We find that effective Lagrangian up to second order of derivatives
for low energy fluctuations resembles a chiral model from hadron physics with
additional minimal interactions of pions with localized gauge fields together
with nonlinear interactions of moduli fields. This result provides a step
towards a realistic model building of brane-world scenario using topological
solitons.
