  paragraph",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The first short part of this review is a general, but very detailed, critique
of the literature advocating a class of Seyfert galaxies intrinsically lacking
broad emission lines. My conclusion is that there is little or no evidence for
such objects.
  Panchromatic properties of all types of radio loud AGN are then reviewed in
detail. Radio galaxies usually show subparsec-scale radio core sources, jets,
and a pair of giant radio lobes. The optical spectra sometimes show only
relatively weak lines of low-ionization ionic species, and no clear nuclear
continuum in the optical or UV region of the spectrum. Some show strong
high-ionization narrow lines. Finally, a few radio galaxies add broad bases
onto the permitted lines. These spectral categories are the same as those for
radio-quiet AGN and quasars.
  By the 1980s, data from optical polarization and statistics of the radio
properties required that many narrow line radio galaxies do in fact produce
strong optical/UV continuum. This continuum and the broad line emission are
hidden from the line of sight by dusty, roughly toroidal gas distributions, but
they are seen in polarized flux. The radio galaxies with hidden quasars are
referred to as ""thermal.""
  Do all radio galaxies harbor hidden quasars? We now know the answer using the
radio, infrared, optical and X-ray properties. Near the top of the radio
luminosity function, for FRII, GPS, and CSS galaxies, the answer is yes. At
somewhat lower luminosities, many do not. At the lowest radio luminosities,
most do not. Instead these ""nonthermal"" weakly-accreting galaxies manifest
their energetic output only as kinetic energy in the form of synchrotron jets.
This applies to all types of radio galaxies, big FR II doubles, as well as the
small young GPS and CSS sources. Only a few FR I sources are of the thermal
type.

calculate local supernova (SN) rates for the past 510 million years (Myr).
Peaks in the SN rates match passages of the Sun through periods of locally
increased cluster formation which could be caused by spiral arms of the Galaxy.
A statistical analysis indicates that the Solar System has experienced many
large short-term increases in the flux of Galactic cosmic rays (GCR) from
nearby supernovae. The hypothesis that a high GCR flux should coincide with
cold conditions on the Earth is borne out by comparing the general geological
record of climate over the past 510 million years with the fluctuating local SN
rates. Surprisingly a simple combination of tectonics (long-term changes in sea
level) and astrophysical activity (SN rates) largely accounts for the observed
variations in marine biodiversity over the past 510 Myr. An inverse
correspondence between SN rates and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) levels is discussed
in terms of a possible drawdown of CO$_2$ by enhanced bioproductivity in oceans
that are better fertilized in cold conditions - a hypothesis that is not
contradicted by data on the relative abundance of the heavy isotope of carbon,
$^{13}$C.

pre-defined function of the measurements without the need for reconstructing
each individual sensor reading. Widely-considered examples of such functions
include the arithmetic mean and the maximum value. Standard approaches to the
computation problem separate computation from communication: quantized sensor
readings are transmitted interference-free to a fusion center that reconstructs
each sensor reading and subsequently computes the sought function value. Such
separation-based computation schemes are generally highly inefficient as a
complete reconstruction of individual sensor readings is not necessary for the
fusion center to compute a function of them. In particular, if the mathematical
structure of the wireless channel is suitably matched (in some sense) to the
function, then channel collisions induced by concurrent transmissions of
different nodes can be beneficially exploited for computation purposes.
Therefore, in this paper a practically relevant analog computation scheme is
proposed that allows for an efficient estimate of linear and nonlinear
functions over the wireless multiple-access channel. After analyzing the
asymptotic properties of the estimation error, numerical simulations are
presented to show the potential for huge performance gains when compared with
time-division multiple-access based computation schemes.

of seconds, as seen in the X-ray tail following the initial burst. Recent
studies, based on single-fluid barotropic magnetar models, have suggested that
the lower-frequency QPOs correspond to magneto-elastic oscillations of the
star. The higher frequencies, however, in particular the strong 625 Hz peak,
have proved harder to explain, except as high mode multipoles. In this work we
study the time evolutions of non-axisymmetric oscillations of two-fluid
Newtonian magnetars with no crust. We consider models with superfluid neutrons
and normal protons, and poloidal and toroidal background field configurations.
We show that multi-fluid physics (composition-gradient stratification,
entrainment) tends to increase Alfven mode frequencies significantly from their
values in a single-fluid barotropic model. The higher-frequency magnetar QPOs
may then be naturally interpreted as Alfven oscillations of the multi-fluid
stellar core. The lower-frequency QPOs are less easily explained within our
purely fluid core model, but we discuss the possibility that these are crustal
modes.

subspace iteration using reduced models (SIRM), for the dimensionality
reduction of dynamical systems. This method may be viewed as subspace iteration
combined with a model reduction procedure. Specifically, starting with a test
solution, the method solves a reduced model to obtain a more precise solution,
and it repeats this process until sufficient accuracy is achieved. The reduced
model is obtained by projecting the full model onto a subspace that is spanned
by the dominant modes of an extended data ensemble. The learning procedure is
computed in the online stage, as opposed to being computed offline, which is
used in many projection-based model reduction techniques that require prior
calculations or experiments. After providing an error bound of the classical
POD-Galerkin method in terms of the projection error and the initial condition
error, we prove that the sequence of approximate solutions converge to the
actual solution of the original system as long as the vector field of the full
model is locally Lipschitz on an open set that contains the solution
trajectory. Good accuracy of the proposed method has been demonstrated in two
numerical examples, from a linear advection-diffusion equation to a nonlinear
Burgers equation. In order to save computational cost, the SIRM method is
extended to a local model reduction approach by partitioning the entire time
domain into several subintervals and obtaining a series of local reduced models
of much lower dimensionality. The accuracy and efficiency of the local SIRM are
shown through the numerical simulation of the Navier--Stokes equation in a
lid-driven cavity flow problem.

Information (NetInf) is an information centric networking paradigm that can
support cloud computing by providing new possibilities for network transport

API, independent of their location in the network. This abstraction can hide
much of the complexity of storage and network transport systems that cloud
computing today has to deal with. In this paper we analyze how cloud computing

The derivation is subtler than that of the Sudakov resummation for an energetic

in order to derive an ultraviolet-finite and scale-invariant kernel for

and strengths their convergent behavior at small spectator momentum. The

VISTA Surveys through their lifecycle: the VISTA Public Survey consortia can
use it during their quality control assessment of survey data products before
submission to the ESO Science Archive Facility (ESO SAF); it supports their
exploitation of survey data prior to its publication through the ESO SAF; and,
subsequently, it provides the wider community with survey science exploitation
tools that complement the data product repository functionality of the ESO SAF.
  This paper has been written in conjunction with the first public release of
public survey data through the VSA and is designed to help its users understand
the data products available and how the functionality of the VSA supports their
varied science goals. We describe the design of the database and outline the
database-driven curation processes that take data from nightly
pipeline-processed and calibrated FITS files to create science-ready survey
datasets. Much of this design, and the codebase implementing it, derives from
our earlier WFCAM Science Archive (WSA), so this paper concentrates on the
VISTA-specific aspects and on improvements made to the system in the light of
experience gained in operating the WSA.

proposed on theoretical grounds that the superconducting state may have chiral
p-wave symmetry analogous to the A phase of superfluid He-3. Substantial
experimental evidence has since accumulated in favor of this pairing symmetry,
including several interesting recent results related to broken time reversal
symmetry and vortices with half of the usual superconducting flux quantum.
Great interest surrounds the possibility of chiral p-wave order in Sr2RuO4,
since this state may exhibit topological order analogous to that of a quantum
Hall state, and can support such exotic physics as Majorana fermions and
non-Abelian winding statistics, which have been proposed as one route to a
quantum computer. However, serious discrepancies remain in trying to connect
the experimental results to theoretical predictions for chiral p-wave order. In
this paper, I review a broad range of experiments on Sr2RuO4 that are sensitive
to p-wave pairing, triplet superconductivity and time-reversal symmetry
breaking and compare these experiments to each other and to theoretical
predictions. In this context, the evidence for triplet pairing is strong,
although some puzzles remain. The ""smoking gun"" experimental results for chiral
p-wave, those which directly look for evidence of broken time-reversal symmetry
in the superconducting state of Sr2RuO4, are most perplexing when the results
are compared to each other and to theoretical predictions. Consequently, the
case for chiral p-wave in Sr2RuO4 remains unresolved, suggesting the need to
consider either significant modifications to the standard chiral p-wave models
or possible alternative pairing symmetries. Recent ideas along these lines are
discussed.

developments from dynamical systems and chemical reaction network theory to
identify and characterize the key-role of the spatial organization of
eukaryotic cells in cellular information processing. In particular the
existence of distinct compartments plays a pivotal role in whether a system is
capable of multistationarity (multiple response states), and is thus directly
linked to the amount of information that the signaling molecules can represent
in the nucleus. Multistationarity provides a mechanism for switching between
different response states in cell signaling systems and enables multiple
outcomes for cellular-decision making. We find that introducing species
localization can alter the capacity for multistationarity and mathematically
demonstrate that shuttling confers flexibility for and greater control of the
emergence of an all-or-none response.

array. We here develop the variational approximation (VA) and additional
analytical methods for the description of the SDSs, and study their mobility

simulations, the solitons are not mobile in the discrete direction (non-soliton

change the energy transport even in relatively small quantities. A poloidally
varying equilibrium electrostatic potential can lead to a strong reduction or
sign change of the impurity peaking factor due to the combined effect of the
in-out impurity density asymmetry and the EXB drift of impurities. We present
an approximate expression for the impurity peaking factor and demonstrate that
impurity peaking is not significantly affected by impurity self-collisions.

LDOS(E) features and spatial excitations. Many of these phenomena can only be
observed through the use of a SI-STM and their disorder can be mapped out

study of the nanometer scale disorder of single crystal cryogenically cleaved
samples of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x whose dopings range from p = 0.19 to 0.06. The
phenomenological model used is the Tripartite model that has been successfully
applied to the average LDOS(E) previously. The resulting energy scale maps show
a structured patchwork disorder of three energy scales, which can be described
by a single underlying disordered parameter. This spatial disorder structure is
universal for all dopings and energy scales. It is independent of the oxygen
dopant negative energy resonances and the interface between the different
patches takes the form of a shortened lifetime pseudogap/superconducting gap
state. The relationship between the energy scales and the spatial modulations
of the dispersive QPI, static q1* modulation and the pseudogap shows that the
energy scales signatures in the LDOS(E) are tied to the onset and termination
of the spatial excitations. The static q1* modulations local energy range is
measured and its signature in the LDOS(E) is the kink, whose number of states
are modulated with a wave vector of q1*. This analysis of both the LDOS(r,E)
and the spatial modulations in q-space show a picture of a single underlying
disordered parameter that determines both the LDOS(E) structure as well as the
energy ranges of the QPI, q1* modulation and the pseudogap states. This
parameter for a single patch can be defined by the Fermi surface crossing of
the parent compound anti-ferromagnetic zone boundary for a model homogeneous
superconductor with the same electronic properties as the patch.

to create an efficient, understandable method aside from continued fractions.
  Let r be an unknown positive integer. Assume that with some constant
probability we obtain random positive integers of the form x=[ N k/r ] where
[.] is either the floor or ceiling of the rational number, k is selected
uniformly at random from {0,1,...,r-1}, and N is a parameter that can be
chosen. The problem of recovering r from such samples occurs precisely in the
classical post-processing part of Shor's algorithm. The quantum part (quantum
phase estimation) makes it possible to obtain such samples where r is the order
of some element a of the unit group of Z_n and n is the number to be factored.
  Shor showed that the continued fraction algorithm can be used to efficiently
recover r, since if N>2r^2 then k/r appears in lowest terms as one of the
convergents of x/N due to a standard result on continued fractions. We present
here an alternative method for recovering r based on the Gauss algorithm for
lattice basis reduction, allowing us to efficiently find the shortest nonzero
vector of a lattice generated by two vectors. Our method is about as efficient
as the method based on continued fractions, yet it is much easier to understand
all the details of why it works.

model parameter space, the little hierarchy problem -- how to reconcile the Z
and Higgs boson mass scale with the scale of SUSY breaking -- will become
increasingly exacerbated unless a sparticle signal is found. We evaluate two
different measures of fine-tuning in the mSUGRA/CMSSM model. The more stringent
of these, \Delta_{HS}, includes effects that arise from the high scale origin
of the mSUGRA parameters while the second measure, \Delta_{EW}, is determined
only by weak scale parameters: hence, it is universal to any model with the
same particle spectrum and couplings. Our results incorporate the latest
constraints from LHC7 sparticle searches, LHCb limits from B_s ->\mu^+\mu^- and

taken a central role in our current understanding of the very early universe.
The EFT perspective has been particularly useful in analyzing the
self-interactions determining the evolution of co-moving curvature
perturbations (Goldstone boson modes) and their influence on low-energy
observables. However, the standard EFT formalism, to lowest order in spacetime
differential operators, does not provide the most general parametrization of a
theory that remains weakly coupled throughout the entire low-energy regime.
Here we study the EFT formulation by including spacetime differential operators
implying a scale dependence of the Goldstone boson self-interactions and its
dispersion relation. These operators are shown to arise naturally from the
low-energy interaction of the Goldstone boson with heavy fields that have been
integrated out. We find that the EFT then stays weakly coupled all the way up
to the cutoff scale at which ultraviolet degrees of freedom become operative.
This opens up a regime of new physics where the dispersion relation is
dominated by a quadratic dependence on the momentum \omega ~ p^2. In addition,
provided that modes crossed the horizon within this energy range, the

radioactive decay, would then produce relatively narrow (1000 km s-1) emission
features observable once the supernova enters the nebular phase. Such emission
has never been detected, which already provides strong constraints on Type Ia
progenitor models. In this Letter we report the deepest limit yet on the
presence of H-alpha emission originating from the stripped hydrogen in the
nebular spectrum of a Type Ia supernova obtained using a high signal-to-noise
spectrum of the nearby normal SN Ia 2011fe 274 days after B-band maximum light

conservative upper limit on the H-alpha flux of 3.14 x 10^-17 erg s-1 cm-2,
which corresponds to a luminosity of 1.57 x 10^35 erg s-1. By scaling models
from the literature, our flux limit translates into an upper limit of 0.001
Msun of stripped material. This is an order of magnitude stronger than previous
limits. SN 2011fe was a typical Type Ia supernova, special only in its
proximity, and we argue that lack of hydrogen emission in its nebular spectrum
adds yet another strong constraint on the single degenerate class of models for

of accretion disks in both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and Galactic black hole
binaries (GBHBs). Direct evidence for highly-ionized, Compton-thin inner-disk
winds comes from observations of blueshifted (v~0.05-0.1c) iron-K X-ray
absorption lines. However, it has been suggested that the inner regions of
black hole accretion disks can also drive Compton-thick winds --- such winds
would enshroud the inner disk, preventing us from seeing direct signatures of
the accretion disk (i.e. the photospheric thermal emission, or the
Doppler/gravitationally broadened iron K-alpha line). Here, we show that,
provided the source is sub-Eddington, the well-established wind driving
mechanisms fail to launch a Compton-thick wind from the inner disk. For the
accelerated region of the wind to be Compton-thick, the momentum carried in the
wind must exceed the available photon momentum by a factor of at least
2/lambda, where lambda is the Eddington ratio of the source, ruling out
radiative acceleration unless the source is very close to the Eddington limit.
Compton-thick winds also carry large mass-fluxes, and a consideration of the
connections between the wind and the disk show this to be incompatible with
magneto-centrifugal driving. Finally, thermal driving of the wind is ruled out
on the basis of the large Compton-radii that typify black hole systems. In the
absence of some new acceleration mechanism, we conclude that the inner regions
of sub-Eddington accretion disks around black holes are indeed naked.

shell of dust and gas. The shell originates from a thermal pulse during which
the star undergoes a brief period of increased mass loss. It has hitherto been
impossible to constrain observationally the timescales and mass-loss properties
during and after a thermal pulse - parameters that determine the lifetime on
the asymptotic giant branch and the amount of elements returned by the star.
Here we report observations of CO emission from the circumstellar envelope and
shell around R Sculptoris with an angular resolution of 1.3 arcsec. What was
hitherto thought to be only a thin, spherical shell with a clumpy structure, is
revealed to contain a spiral structure. Spiral structures associated with
circumstellar envelopes have been seen previously, from which it was concluded
that the systems must be binaries. Using the data, combined with hydrodynamic
simulations, we conclude that R Sculptoris is a binary system that underwent a
thermal pulse approximately 1800 years ago, lasting approximately 200 years.
About 0.003 Msun of mass was ejected at a velocity of 14.3 km s-1 and at a rate
approximately 30 times higher than the prepulse mass-loss rate. This shows that
approximately 3 times more mass is returned to the interstellar medium during

observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe. These theories
generally include a potential V(phi) which is a function of the scalar field
phi. Although V(phi) can be represented by a very diverse set of functions,
recent work has shown the under some conditions, such as the slow roll
conditions, the equation of state parameter w is either independent of the form
of V(phi) or is part of family of solutions with only a few parameters. In
realistic models of this type the scalar field couples to other sectors of the
model leading to possibly observable changes in the fundamental constants such
as the fine structure constant alpha and the proton to electron mass ratio mu.
This paper explores the limits this puts on the validity of various cosmologies
that invoke rolling scalar fields. We find that the limit on the variation of
mu puts significant constraints on the product of a cosmological parameter w+1
times a new physics parameter zeta_mu^2, the coupling constant between mu and
the rolling scalar field. Even when the cosmologies are restricted to very slow
roll conditions either the value of zeta_mu must be at the lower end of or less
than its expected values or the value of w+1 must be restricted to values
vanishingly close to 0. This implies that either the rolling scalar field is
very weakly coupled with the electromagnetic field, small zeta_mu, very weakly
coupled with gravity, w+1 ~ 0 or both. These results stress that adherence to
the measured invariance in mu is a very significant test of the validity of any
proposed cosmology and any new physics it requires. The limits on the variation
of mu also produces a significant tension with the reported changes in the
value of alpha.

powered mostly by radioactive decay. Observationally such events are dominated
by hydrogen deficient progenitors and classified as Type I supernovae: white
dwarf thermonuclear explosions (Type Ia) and core collapses of
hydrogen-stripped massive stars (Type Ibc). Transient surveys are finding SNe I
in increasing numbers and at earlier times, allowing their early emission to be
studied in unprecedented detail. Motivated by these developments, we summarize
the physics that produces their rising lightcurves and discuss how observations
can be utilized to study these exploding stars. The early radioactive-powered
lightcurves probe the shallowest 56Ni deposits. If the amount of 56Ni mixing
can be deduced, then it places constraints on the progenitor and properties of
the explosive burning. In practice we find it is difficult to disentangle
whether the explosion occurred recently and one is seeing 56Ni heating near the
surface or whether the explosion began in the past and 56Ni heating is deeper.
In the latter case there is a ""dark phase"" between the moment of explosion and
the first light observed from the shallowest layers of 56Ni. Because of this,
simply extrapolating a lightcurve from 56Ni back in time is not a reliable
method for estimating the explosion time. The best solution is to directly
identify the moment of explosion, by either observing shock breakout or
shock-heated surface cooling, so the depth being probed by the rising
lightcurve is known. Since this is typically not available, we identify other
diagnostics that are helpful for deciphering how recently an explosion
occurred. As an example we apply these arguments to the SN Ic PTF 10vgv. We
demonstrate that just a single measurement of the photospheric velocity and
temperature during the rise places constraints on its explosion time, radius,
and 56Ni mixing.

various feedback processes. ""Second-generation"" primordial stars potentially
form from this disturbed gas after its recombination. In this Letter, we study
the late formation stage of such second-generation stars, where a large amount
of gas accretes onto the protostar and the final stellar mass is determined
when the accretion terminates. We directly compute the complex interplay
between the accretion flow and stellar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, performing
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations coupled with stellar evolution calculations.
Because of more efficient H2 and HD cooling in the pre-stellar stage, the
accretion rates onto the star are ten times lower than in the case of the
formation of the first stars. The lower accretion rates and envelope density
result in the occurrence of an expanding bipolar HII region at a lower
protostellar mass M_* \simeq 10Msun, which blows out the circumstellar
material, thereby quenching the mass supply from the envelope to the accretion
disk. At the same time the disk loses mass due to photoevaporation by the
growing star. In our fiducial case the stellar UV feedback terminates mass
accretion onto the star at M_* \simeq 17Msun. Although the derived masses of
the second-generation primordial stars are systematically lower than those of
the first generation, the difference is within a factor of only a few. Our
results suggest a new scenario, whereby the majority of the primordial stars

lensing of 21-cm fluctuations from the dark ages and the epoch of reionization
(EOR). We choose as a figure of merit the smallest cluster mass detectable
through such measurements. We construct the minimum-variance quadratic
estimator for the cluster mass based on lensing of 21-cm fluctuations at
multiple redshifts. We discuss the tradeoff between frequency bandwidth,
angular resolution, and number of redshift shells available for a fixed noise
level for the radio detectors. Observations of lensing of the 21-cm background
from the dark ages will be capable of detecting M>~10^12 Msun/h mass halos, but
will require futuristic experiments to overcome the contaminating sources.
Next-generation radio measurements of 21-cm fluctuations from the EOR will,
however, have the sensitivity to detect galaxy clusters with halo masses
M>~10^13 Msun/h, given enough observation time (for the relevant sky patch) and
collecting area to maximize their resolution capabilities.

very close (within 1\sigma) to that of the E94 SED. The mixing diagram can also

1000(L/484.73)^3.2660, while the best-fit equation for the hardhead was W(L) =

in millimeters. Results showed that, when compared to gafftopsail and hardhead

similar lengths; whereas, the Louisiana hardhead catfish tend to weigh about
the same. Results also show that the total length (TL) can be related to the

cosmological probes, the standard spherical modelling of the dark matter and
the intracluster medium is only a rough approximation. Indeed, it is well
established both theoretically and observationally that galaxy clusters are
much better approximated as triaxial objects. However, investigating the
asphericity of galaxy clusters is still in its infancy. We review here this
topic which is currently gathering a growing interest from the cluster
community. We begin by introducing the triaxial geometry. Then we discuss the
topic of deprojection and demonstrate the need for combining different probes
of the cluster's potential. We discuss the different works that have been
addressing these issues. We present a general parametric framework intended to
simultaneously fit complementary data sets (X-ray, Sunyaev Zel'dovich and
lensing data). We discuss in details the case of Abell 1689 to show how
different models/data sets lead to different haloe parameters. We present the
results obtained from fitting a 3D NFW model to X-ray, SZ, and lensing data for
4 strong lensing clusters. We argue that a triaxial model generally allows to
lower the inferred value of the concentration parameter compared to a spherical
analysis. This may alleviate tensions regarding, e.g. the over-concentration
problem. However, we stress that predictions from numerical simulations rely on
a spherical analysis of triaxial halos. Given that triaxial analysis will have
a growing importance in the observational side, we advocate the need for
simulations to be analysed in the very same way, allowing reliable and
meaningful comparisons. Besides, methods intended to derive the three
dimensional shape of galaxy clusters should be extensively tested on simulated
multi-wavelength observations.

including corrections to the Born approximation by using multiple-plane ray
tracing, and properly computes the lensed images of source galaxies in the
light cone. The key feature of this algorithm is a new, computationally
efficient Poisson solver for the sphere that combines spherical harmonic
transform and multgrid methods. As a result, large areas of sky (~10, 000
square degrees) can be ray traced efficiently at high-resolution using only a
few hundred cores on widely available machines. Using this new algorithm and
curved-sky calculations that only use a slower but more accurate spherical

large void regions in the disordered regime. As more degrees of freedom are
constrained the ground states exhibit a collapse of dimensionality

here use a partition of all users into several pools. Each pool can use its own
codes that are different for different pools. Each user has only a few codes
assigned to it within the pool. We state the problem as a combinatorial one
expressed in terms of a binary n x k matrix M where is the number n of users,
and k is the number of Walsh codes in the pool. A solution to the problem is
given as a construction of M, which has the assignment property defined in the
paper. Two constructions of such M are presented under different conditions on
n and k. The first construction is optimal in the sense that it gives the
minimal number of Walsh codes assigned to each user for given n and k. The
optimality follows from a proved necessary condition for the existence of M
with the assignment property. In addition, we propose a simple algorithm of
optimal assignment for the first construction.

characteristic ""signature"" of the Sn7Ir3 structure in all three alloys. The
Sn7Ir3 structure has two inequivalent Sn-sites with a 3:4 ratio of atoms and
point symmetries indicate that the electric-field gradients at both sites
should be axially symmetric. Measured perturbation functions for all three
alloys exhibited two axially symmetric quadrupole interaction signals having
the expected 3:4 ratio of amplitudes, as expected for the structure.
Furthermore, ratios of the two quadrupole interaction frequencies in each alloy
were characteristically large, with frequencies for probe atoms on In(3) sites
roughly five times greater than on In(4) sites. Taken together, these
observations confirm that all three phases have the Sn7Ir3 structure.

promise as qubits, a major challenge is the unavoidable hyperfine decoherence
in these materials. In group IV semiconductors, the dominant nuclear species
are spinless, allowing for qubit coherence times that have been extended up to
seconds in diamond and silicon. Carbon nanotubes are a particularly attractive
host material, because the spin-orbit interaction with the valley degree of
freedom allows for electrical manipulation of the qubit. In this work, we
realise such a qubit in a nanotube double quantum dot. The qubit is encoded in
two valley-spin states, with coherent manipulation via electrically driven spin
resonance (EDSR) mediated by a bend in the nanotube. Readout is performed by
measuring the current in Pauli blockade. Arbitrary qubit rotations are
demonstrated, and the coherence time is measured via Hahn echo. Although the
measured decoherence time is only 65 ns in our current device, this work offers
the possibility of creating a qubit for which hyperfine interaction can be
virtually eliminated.

tool to prevent brain damage resulting from physical trauma. However, all
physiological systems begin to slow down due to hypothermia that in turn can
result in increased risk of mortality. Therefore, quantification of the
transition of T_c to early hypothermia is of great clinical interest.
Conceptually, T_c may exhibit an either gradual or abrupt transition.
Bent-cable regression is an appealing statistical tool to model such data due
to the model's flexibility and greatly interpretable regression coefficients.
It handles more flexibly models that traditionally have been handled by
low-order polynomial models (for gradual transition) or piecewise linear
changepoint models (for abrupt change). We consider a rat model for humans to
quantify the temporal trend of T_c to primarily address the question: What is
the critical time point associated with a breakdown in the compensatory
mechanisms following the start of hypothermia therapy? To this end, we develop
a Bayesian modelling framework for bent-cable regression of longitudinal data
to simultaneously account for gradual and abrupt transitions. Our analysis
reveals that: (a) about 39% of rats exhibit a gradual transition in T_c; (b)
the critical time point is approximately the same regardless of transition
type; (c) both transition types show a significant increase of T_c followed by
a significant decrease.

coalescence of two neutron stars (NSs) or a NS and a black hole (BH). If this
scenario is correct, then short GRBs will be accompanied by the emission of
strong gravitational waves (GWs), detectable by GW observatories such as LIGO,
Virgo, KAGRA, and LIGO-India. As compared with blind, all-sky, all-time GW
searches, externally triggered searches for GW counterparts to short GRBs have
the advantages of both significantly reduced detection threshold due to known
time and sky location and enhanced GW amplitude because of face-on orientation.
Based on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios in candidate compact binary
coalescence events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic
estimates, and our Monte Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive
volume for GRB-triggered searches that is about 2 times greater than for an
all-sky, all-time search. For NS-NS systems, a jet angle of 20 degrees, a
gamma-ray satellite field of view of 10% of the sky, and priors with generally
precessing spin, this doubles the number of NS-NS short-GRB and NS-BH short-GRB
associations, to ~3-4% of all detections of NS-NSs and NS-BHs. We also
investigate the power of tests for statistical excesses in lists of
subthreshold events, and show that these are unlikely to reveal a subthreshold
population until finding GW associations to short GRBs is already routine.
Finally, we provide useful formulas for calculating the prior distribution of
GW amplitudes from a compact binary coalescence, for a given GW detector
network and given sky location.

derivative nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation on the background of a plane wave.
We then investigate the properties of the one-soliton solutions in detail,
showing that both the dark and bright solitons appear on the nonzero background
which reduce to algebraic solitons in specific limits.
  Last, we perform the asymptotic analysis of the two- and $N$-soliton
solutions for large time and clarify their structure and dynamics.

Aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) on the conducting faces of

deposition. The alignment of the nanotubes was found perpendicular to the
decagonal faces of the quasicrystals. A comparison between the growth and tube
quality has also been made between tubes grown on various quasicrystalline and
SiO2 substrates. While a significant MWNT growth was observed on decagonal
quasicrystalline substrate, there was no significant growth observed on
icosahedral quasicrystalline substrate. Raman spectroscopy and high resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) results show high crystalline nature
of the nanotubes. Presence of continuous iron filled core in the nanotubes
grown on these substrates was also observed, which is typically not seen in
MWNTs grown using similar process on silicon and/or silicon dioxide substrates.
The study has important implications for understanding the growth mechanism of
MWNTs on conducting substrates which have potential applications as heat sinks.

approach to extract useful information on the properties and dynamics of the
QCD matter created. We emphasize the importance of the coarse-graining scale
required for the hydrodynamic modeling which determines the space-time
resolution and the associated limitations of collective flow observables. We
show that certain kinds of observables can indicate the degree of inhomogeneity
of the initial condition under less stringent condition than the local thermal
equilibrium subjected to the coarse-graining scale compatible to the scenario.

of the main and valuable tasks of data mining. Several types of classification

trends based on unseen data. There has been no single algorithm found to be
superior over all others for all data sets. The objective of this paper is to
compare various classification algorithms that have been frequently used in
data mining for decision support systems. Three decision trees based
algorithms, one artificial neural network, one statistical, one support vector
machines with and without ada boost and one clustering algorithm are tested and
compared on four data sets from different domains in terms of predictive
accuracy, error rate, classification index, comprehensibility and training
time. Experimental results demonstrate that Genetic Algorithm (GA) and support
vector machines based algorithms are better in terms of predictive accuracy.
SVM without adaboost shall be the first choice in context of speed and

mobility support. Due to demanding real time multimedia applications, Quality
of Services (QoS) support in such infrastructure less networks have become
essential. QoS routing in mobile Ad-Hoc networks is challenging due to rapid
change in network topology. In this paper, we focused to reduce flooding
performance of the Fisheye State Routing (FSR) protocol in Grid using ns-2
network simulator under different performance metrics scenario in respect to
number of Nodes. For example, the connection establishment is costly in terms
of time and resource where the network is mostly affected by connection request
flooding. The proposed approach presents a way to reduce flooding in MANETs.
Flooding is dictated by the propagation of connection-request packets from the
source to its neighborhood nodes. The proposed architecture embarks on the
concept of sharing neighborhood information. The proposed approach focuses on
exposing its neighborhood peer to another node that is referred to as its
friend-node, which had requested/forwarded connection request. If there is a
high probability for the friend node to communicate through the exposed routes,
this could improve the efficacy of bandwidth utilization by reducing flooding,
as the routes have been acquired, without any broadcasts. Friendship between
nodes is quantized based on empirical computations and heuristic algorithms.
The nodes store the neighborhood information in their cache that is
periodically verified for consistency. Simulation results show the performance
of this proposed method.

Maxwellian with a temperature equal to that of the liquid. To characterize the

them onto just two coordinates: the distance of the evaporating molecule to the
instantaneous liquid-vapor interface, and the velocity of the water along the
average interface normal. In this projected space, we find that the TSE is
well-captured by a simple model of ballistic escape from a deep potential well,
with no additional barrier to evaporation beyond the cohesive strength of the

structures with diffraction symmetries forbidden to conventional crystals.
Since the discovery of quasicrystals by Schechtman et al. at 1984 (ref. 1),
there has been considerable progress in resolving their geometric structure.
For example, it is well known that the golden ratio of mathematics and art
occurs over and over again in their crystal structure. However, the
characteristic properties of the electronic states - whether they are extended
as in periodic crystals or localized as in amorphous materials - are still
unresolved. Here we report the first observation of quantum (T = 0) critical
phenomena of the Au-Al-Yb quasicrystal - the magnetic susceptibility and the
electronic specific heat coefficient arising from strongly correlated 4f
electrons of the Yb atoms diverge as T -> 0. Furthermore, we observe that this
quantum critical phenomenon is robust against hydrostatic pressure. By
contrast, there is no such divergence in a crystalline approximant, a phase
whose composition is close to that of the quasicrystal and whose unit cell has
atomic decorations (that is, icosahedral clusters of atoms) that look like the
quasicrystal. These results clearly indicate that the quantum criticality is
associated with the unique electronic state of the quasicrystal, that is, a
spatially confined critical state. Finally we discuss the possibility that
there is a general law underlying the conventional crystals and the
quasicrystals.

the study of relative velocities. In this context, a non local test particle is
""superluminal"" if its relative velocity exceeds the local speed of light of the
observer. The existence of superluminal relative velocities of receding test
particles, in a particular cosmological model, suggests itself as a possible
criterion for expansion of space in that model. In this point of view,
superluminal velocities of distant receding galaxy clusters result from the
expansion of space between the observer and the clusters. However, there is a
fundamental ambiguity that must be resolved before this approach can be
meaningful. The notion of relative velocity of a nonlocal object depends on the
choice of coordinates, and this ambiguity suggests the need for coordinate
independent definitions. In this work, we review four (inequivalent)
geometrically defined and universal notions of relative velocity: Fermi,
kinematic, astrometric, and spectroscopic relative velocities. We apply this
formalism to test particles undergoing radial motion relative to comoving
observers in expanding Robertson-Walker cosmologies, and include previously
unpublished results on Fermi coordinates for a class of inflationary
cosmologies. We compare relative velocities to each other, and show how pairs
of them determine geometric properties of the spacetime, including the scale
factor with sufficient data. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for
the existence of superluminal recessional Fermi speeds in general
Robertson-Walker cosmologies. We conclude with a discussion of expansion of
space.

forced to make contact with those of subsequent coordination shells. At finite

temperature. Consequently the thermal B-factor fluctuations are very small,
which is an advantage in our construction. The energy function that we utilize
resembles that of the discrete non-linear Schrodinger equation. Likewise, ours
supports solitons as local minimum energy configurations. We describe the 1ABS
backbone in terms of solitons with a precision that deviates from 1ABS by an
average root-mean-square distance, which is less than the experimentally
observed Debye-Waller B-factor fluctuation distance. We then subject the
multisoliton solution to extensive numerical heating and cooling experiments,
over a very wide range of temperatures. We concentrate in particular to
temperatures above 300K and below the theta-point unfolding temperature, which
is around 348K. We confirm that the behavior of the multisoliton is fully
consistent with Anfinsen's principle, up to very high temperatures. We observe
that the structure responds to an increase of temperature consistently in a
very similar manner. This enables us to characterize the onset of thermally
induced conformational changes in terms of three distinct backbone ligand
gates. One of the gates is made of the helix F and the helix E. This is a
pathway that is presumed to have a major role in ligand migration between the
heme and the exterior. The two other gates are chosen similarly, when open they
provide a direct access route for a ligand to reach the heme. We find that out
of the three gates we investigate, the one which is formed by helices B and G

Especially, we focus on the squashed entanglement and relative entropy of
entanglement, as well as their analogues and variants.
  Our first result is a monogamy-like inequality involving the relative entropy
of entanglement and its one-way LOCC variant. The proof is accomplished by
exploring the properties of relative entropy in the context of hypothesis
testing via one-way LOCC operations, and by making use of an argument
resembling that by Piani on the faithfulness of regularized relative entropy of
entanglement.
  Following this, we obtain a commensurate and faithful lower bound for
squashed entanglement, in the form of one-way LOCC relative entropy of
entanglement. This gives a strengthening to the strong subadditivity of von
Neumann entropy. Our result improves the trace-distance-type bound derived in
[Comm. Math. Phys., 306:805-830, 2011], where faithfulness of squashed
entanglement was first proved. Applying Pinsker's inequality, we are able to
recover the trace-distance-type bound, even with slightly better constant
factor. However, the main improvement is that our new lower bound can be much
larger than the old one and it is almost a genuine entanglement measure.
  We evaluate exactly the various relative entropy of entanglement under
restricted measurement classes, for maximally entangled states. Then, by
proving asymptotic continuity, we extend the exact evaluation to their
regularized versions for all pure states. Finally, we consider comparisons and
separations between some important entanglement measures and obtain several new
results on these, too.

on a Banach space. Applying this criterion, we solve few open questions.
Namely, we show that if $G$ is a region of $\C$ bounded by a smooth Jordan
curve $\Gamma$ such that $G$ does not meet the unit ball but $\Gamma$
intersects the unit circle in a non-trivial arc, then $M^*$ is a weakly
hypercyclic operator on $H^2(G)$, where $M$ is the multiplication by the
argument operator $Mf(z)=zf(z)$. We also prove that if $g$ is a non-constant
function from the Hardy space $H^\infty(\D)$ on the unit disk $\D$ such that
$g(\D)\cap\D=\varnothing$ and the set $\{z\in\C:|z|=1,\ |g(z)|=1\}$ is a subset
of the unit circle $\T$ of positive Lebesgue measure, then the coanalytic
Toeplitz operator $T^*_g$ on the Hardy space $H^2(\D)$ is weakly hypercyclic.
On the contrary, if $g(\D)\cap\D=\varnothing$, $|g|>1$ almost everywhere on
$\T$ and $\log(|g|-1)\in L^1(\T)$, then $T^*_g$ is not 1-weakly hypercyclic and
hence is not weakly hypercyclic (a bounded linear operator $T$ on a complex
Banach space $X$ is called $n$-weakly hypercyclic if there is $x\in X$ such
that for every surjective continuous linear operator $S:X\to \C^n$, the set
$\{S(T^mx):m\in\N\}$ is dense in $\C^n$). The last result is based upon lower
estimates of the norms of the members of orbits of a coanalytic Toeplitz
operator. Finally, we show that there is a 1-weakly hypercyclic operator on a
Hilbert space, whose square is non-cyclic and prove that a Banach space
operator is weakly hypercyclic if and only if it is $n$-weakly hypercyclic for
every $n\in\N$.

It appears after the spontaneous
breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which was proposed to solve the
strong-CP problem. Other pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons, postulated in some
extensions of the standard model of particle physics, are called axion-like
particles (ALPs) if they share certain characteristics with the axion, in
particular a coupling to two photons. Thus far, axion and ALP searches have
been unsuccessful, indicating that their couplings have to be extremely weak.
However, axions and ALPs could be responsible for some observable effects in
astrophysics and cosmology, which can also be exploited to constrain the
parameter space of these particles. We focus on limits coming from cosmology,
which is an optimal field for studying axions and ALPs. In particular, we first
investigate the possibility of a primordial population of axions and ALPs
arising during the earliest epochs of the universe. The importance of this
analysis lies on the fact that axions and ALPs are ideal dark matter candidates
because of their faint interactions and their peculiar production mechanisms.
Finally, we consider the consequences of the decay of such a population on
specific cosmological observables, namely the photon spectrum of galaxies, the
cosmic microwave background, the effective number of neutrino species, and the
abundance of primordial elements. Our bounds constitute the most stringent
probes of early decays and exclude a part of the ALP parameter space that is
otherwise very difficult to test experimentally.

a sequence of n keys from a totally ordered universe U and must assign each
arriving key a label from the label set {1,2,...,m} so that the order of labels
(strictly) respects the ordering on U. As new keys arrive it may be necessary
to change the labels of some items; such changes may be done at any time at
unit cost for each change. The goal is to minimize the total cost. An
alternative formulation of this problem is the file maintenance problem, in
which the items, instead of being labeled, are maintained in sorted order in an
array of length m, and we pay unit cost for moving an item.
  For the case m=cn for constant c>1, there are known algorithms that use at
most O(n log(n)^2) relabelings in total [Itai, Konheim, Rodeh, 1981], and it
was shown recently that this is asymptotically optimal [Bul\'anek, Kouck\'y,
Saks, 2012]. For the case of m={\Theta}(n^C) for C>1, algorithms are known that
use O(n log n) relabelings. A matching lower bound was claimed in [Dietz,
Seiferas, Zhang, 2004]. That proof involved two distinct steps: a lower bound
for a problem they call prefix bucketing and a reduction from prefix bucketing
to online labeling. The reduction seems to be incorrect, leaving a (seemingly
significant) gap in the proof. In this paper we close the gap by presenting a
correct reduction to prefix bucketing. Furthermore we give a simplified and
improved analysis of the prefix bucketing lower bound. This improvement allows
us to extend the lower bounds for online labeling to the case where the number
m of labels is superpolynomial in n. In particular, for superpolynomial m we
get an asymptotically optimal lower bound {\Omega}((n log n) / (log log m - log
log n)).

up the reflected total and linearly polarised fluxes across the illuminated and
visible part of the planetary disk, taking care to properly rotate the
polarized flux vectors towards the same reference plane. We compared flux and
polarisation signals of simple horizontally inhomogeneous model planets against
results of the weighted sum approximation, in which signals of horizontally
homogeneous planets are combined. Apart from cases in which the planet has only
a minor inhomogeneity, the signals differ significantly. In particular, the
shape of the polarisation phase function appears to be sensitive to the
horizontal inhomogeneities. The same holds true for Earth-like model planets
with patchy clouds above an ocean and a sandy continent. Our simulations
clearly show that horizontal inhomogeneities leave different traces in flux and
polarisation signals. Combining flux with polarisation measurements would help
retrieving the atmospheric and surface patterns on a planet.

model of chrosmospheric activity evolution established by combining
relationships between the R'HK index and the Rossby number with a recent model
of stellar rotation evolution on the main sequence. We measure the spot
coverage of the stellar surface as a function of time, and find evidence for a
tentative increase from 5-14% at the beginning of the observing run to 13-29%
35 days later. A high level of magnetic activity on CoRoT102899501 is
corroborated by a strong emission in the Balmer and Ca II HK lines (logR'HK ~
-4). The starspots used as tracers of the star rotation constrain the rotation
period to 1.625+/-0.002 days and do not show evidence for differential
rotation. The effective temperature (Teff=5180+/-80 K), surface gravity
(logg=4.35+/-0.1), and metallicity ([M/H]=0.05+/-0.07 dex) indicate that the
object is located near the evolutionary track of a 1.09+/-0.12 M_Sun pre-main
sequence star at an age of 23+/-10 Myrs. This value is consistent with the
""gyro-age"" of about 8-25 Myrs, inferred using a parameterization of the stellar
rotation period as a function of colour index and time established for the
I-sequence of stars in stellar clusters. We conclude that the high magnetic
activity level and fast rotation of CoRoT102899501 are manifestations of its
stellar youth consistent with its estimated evolutionary status and with the
detection of a strong Li I 6707.8 A absorption line in its spectrum. We argue
that a magnetic activity level comparable to that observed on CoRoT102899501
could have been present on the Sun at the time of planet formation.

spectra of these particles also contain the features commonly observed in
absorption and emission from dust in the diffuse interstellar medium. These
materials are produced under slow deposition conditions by minimizing the flux
of incident carbon atoms and by reducing surface mobility. The initial
chemistry leads to the formation of carbon chains, together with a limited
range of small aromatic ring molecules, and eventually results in carbon
nano-particles having an sp2/sp3 ratio = 0.4. Spectroscopic analysis of
particle composition indicates that naphthalene and naphthalene derivatives are
important constituents of this material. We suggest that carbon nano-particles
with similar composition are responsible for the appearance of the interstellar

cloud conditions by deposition of carbon on the surface of silicate grains.

Fluid Mech",,,,"physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The river bar instability is revisited, using a hydrodynamical model based on
Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The results are contrasted with the
standard analysis based on shallow water Saint-Venant equations. We first show
that the stability of both transverse modes (ripples) and of small wavelength
inclined modes (bars) predicted by the Saint-Venant approach are artefacts of
this hydrodynamical approximation. When using a more reliable hydrodynamical
model, the dispersion relation does not present any maximum of the growth rate
when the sediment transport is assumed to be locally saturated. The analysis
therefore reveals the fundamental importance of the relaxation of sediment
transport towards equilibrium as it it is responsible for the stabilisation of
small wavelength modes. This dynamical mechanism is characterised by the
saturation number, defined as the ratio of the saturation length to the water
depth Lsat/H. This dimensionless number controls the transition from ripples
(transverse patterns) at small Lsat/H to bars (inclined patterns) at large
Lsat/H. At a given value of the saturation number, the instability presents a
threshold and a convective-absolute transition, both controlled by the channel
aspect ratio {\beta}. We have investigated the characteristics of the most
unstable mode as a function of the main parameters, Lsat/H, {\beta} and of a
subdominant parameter controlling the relative influence of drag and gravity on
sediment transport. As previously found, the transition from alternate bars to
multiple bars is mostly controlled by the river aspect ratio {\beta}. By
contrast, in the alternate bar regime (large Lsat/H), the selected wavelength
does not depend much on {\beta} and approximately scales as H^(2/3)L^(1/3)/C,
where C is the Ch\'ezy number.

excitatory input from the driving Poisson stream and inhibitory impulses from
its own output through the feedback line. We obtain analytic expressions for

we consider the Kitaev model of a spinless p-wave superconductor in one
dimension, emphasizing how this model emerges from more realistic settings
based on semiconductor nanowires. We show that the flux periodicity of the
Josephson current provides signatures of the topological phase transition and
the emergence of Majorana fermions situated on both sides of the weak link even
when fermion parity is not a good quantum number. In large rings, the Majorana
fermions hybridize only across the weak link. In this case, the Josephson
current is h/e periodic in the flux threading the loop when fermion parity is a
good quantum number but reverts to the more conventional h/2e periodicity in
the presence of fermion-parity changing relaxation processes. In mesoscopic
rings, the Majorana fermions also hybridize through their overlap in the
interior of the superconducting ring. We find that in the topological
superconducting phase, this gives rise to an h/e-periodic contribution even
when fermion parity is not conserved and that this contribution exhibits a peak
near the topological phase transition. This signature of the topological phase
transition is robust to the effects of disorder. As a byproduct, we find that
close to the topological phase transition, disorder drives the system deeper
into the topological phase. This is in stark contrast to the known behavior far
from the phase transition, where disorder tends to suppress the topological

clusters and possibly even the IGM filaments. We study fluctuation dynamo
action in turbulent systems focusing on one observational signature; the
Faraday rotation measure (RM) from background radio sources seen through the
magnetic field generated by such a dynamo. We simulate the fluctuation dynamo
(FD) in periodic boxes up to resolutions of 512^3, with varying fluid and
magnetic Reynolds numbers, and measure the resulting random RMs. We show that,
even though the magnetic field generated is intermittent, it still allows for
contributions to the RM to be significant. When the dynamo saturates, it is of
order 40%-50% of the value expected in a model where fields of strength B_rms
uniformly fill cells of the largest turbulent eddy but are randomly oriented
from one cell to another. This level of RM dispersion obtains across different
values of magnetic Reynolds number and Prandtl number explored. We also use the
random RMs to probe the structure of the generated fields to distinguish the
contribution from intense and diffuse field regions. We find that the strong
field regions (say with B > 2B_rms) contribute only of order 15%-20% to the RM.
Thus rare structures do not dominate the RM; rather the general 'sea' of volume
filling fluctuating fields are the dominant contributors. We also show that the
magnetic integral scale, L_{int}, which is directly related to the RM
dispersion, increases in all the runs, as Lorentz forces become important to
saturate the dynamo. It appears that due to the ordering effect of the Lorentz
forces, L_{int} of the saturated field tends to a modest fraction, 1/2-1/3 of
the integral scale of the velocity field, for all our runs. These results are
then applied to discuss the RM signatures of FD generated fields in young
galaxies, galaxy clusters and intergalactic filaments.

system of zonal winds. Their depth remains unclear but they are thought to be
confined to the very outer envelopes where hydrogen remains molecular and the
electrical conductivity is small. The dynamo maintaining the dipole-dominated
magnetic fields of both gas giants likely operates in the deeper interior where
hydrogen assumes a metallic state. Here, we present numerical simulations that
attempt to model both the zonal winds and the interior dynamo action in an
integrated approach. Using the anelastic version of the MHD code MagIC, we
explore the effects of density stratification and radial electrical
conductivity variation. The electrical conductivity is mostly assumed to remain
constant in the thicker inner metallic region and it decays exponentially
towards the outer boundary throughout the molecular envelope. Our results show
that the combination of stronger density stratification and weaker conducting
outer layer is essential for reconciling dipole dominated dynamo action and a
fierce equatorial zonal jet. Previous simulations with homogeneous electrical
conductivity show that both are merely exclusive, with solutions either having
strong zonal winds and multipolar magnetic fields or weak zonal winds and
dipole-dominated magnetic fields. All jets tend to be geostrophic and therefore
reach right through the convective shell in our simulations. The particular
setup explored here allows a strong equatorial jet to remain confined to the
weaker conducting outer region where it does not interfere with the deeper
seated dynamo action. The flanking mid to high latitude jets, on the other
hand, have to remain faint to yield a strongly dipolar magnetic field. The
fiercer jets on Jupiter and Saturn only seem compatible with the observed
dipolar fields when they remain confined to a weaker conducting outer layer.

both with non-fading phase spaces $c_0 (\ZZ^-, \X)$ and $\ll^\infty (\ZZ^-,

For equations of the convolution type, several criteria of UE stability are
obtained in terms of the Z-transform $\wh K (\zeta)$ of the convolution kernel
$K (\cdot)$, in terms of the input-state operator and of the resolvent
(fundamental) matrix. These criteria do not impose additional positivity or
compactness assumptions on coefficients $K(j)$. Time-varying (non-convolution)
difference equations are studied via structured UE stability radii $\r_\t$ of
convolution equations. These radii correspond to a feedback scheme with delayed
output and time-varying disturbances. We also consider stability radii $\r_\c$
associated with a time-invariant disturbance operator, unstructured stability
radii, and stability radii corresponding to delayed feedback. For all these
types of stability radii two-sided estimates are obtained. The estimates from
above are given in terms of the Z-transform $\wh K (\zeta)$, the estimate from
below via the norm of the input-output operator. These estimates turn into
explicit formulae if the state space $\X$ is Hilbert or if disturbances are
time-invariant. The results on stability radii are applied to obtain various
exponential stability tests for non-convolution equations. Several examples are

classical vector field that unavoidably gets generated at large scales during
inflation. This generically results in a too anisotropic power spectrum of
zeta. Specifically, the anisotropy exceeds the 1% level (10% level) if
inflation lasted ~5 e-folds (~50 e-folds) more than the minimal amount required
to produce the CMB modes. This conclusion applies, among others, to the
application of this mechanism for magnetogenesis, for anisotropic inflation,
and for the generation of anisotropic perturbations at the end of inflation
through a waterfall field coupled to the vector (in this case, the unavoidable
contribution that we obtain is effective all throughout inflation, and it is
independent of the waterfall field). For a tuned duration of inflation, a 1%
(10%) anisotropy in the power spectrum corresponds to an anisotropic bispectrum
which is enhanced like the local one in the squeezed limit, and with an
effective local f_{NL} ~3 (~30). More in general, a significant anisotropy of
the perturbations may be a natural outcome of all models that sustain higher
than 0 spin fields during inflation.

tuning the parameters such as the quantized energy level of the dot and the
Josephson phase, which induces a supercurrent flowing between the two SC leads
through the dot. Furthermore, Andreev scattering takes place at the interface
between the dot and normal lead. The low-lying energy states of this system can
be described by a local Fermi-liquid theory for interacting Bogoliubov
particles. In a description based on an Anderson impurity model we calculate
transport coefficients, renormalized parameters and spectral function, using
Wilson's numerical renormalization group (NRG) approach, in the limit of large
SC gap. Our results demonstrate how the Andreev resonance level approaches the
Fermi level in the crossover region between Cooper-pairing singlet state and

The strong coupling situation shows a Kondo effect with a significantly
renormalized resonance width. The crossover is smeared when the coupling
between the dot and normal lead is large. Furthermore, asymmetry in the
Josephson junction suppresses the cancellations of the SC proximity for finite
Josephson phase, and it favors the SC singlet state rather than the Kondo

interpret the observed molecular line emission, we created two grids of models
of photon-dominated regions, one for solar and one for M33-type subsolar

Similarly high ratios have been observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The
HCN/CO ratio varies between 0.4% and 2.9% in the disk of M33. The 12CO/13CO
line ratio varies between 9 and 15 similar to variations found in the diffuse

(ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies. HCN abundances are lower in the subsolar
metallicity PDR models, while HCO+ abundances are enhanced. For HCN this effect
is more pronounced at low optical extinctions. The observed HCO+/HCN and HCN/CO
line ratios are naturally explained by subsolar PDR models of low optical
extinctions between 4 and 10 mag and of moderate densities of n = 3x10^3 -
3x10^4 cm^-3, while the FUV field strength only has a small effect on the
modeled line ratios. The line ratios are almost equally well reproduced by the
solar-metallicity models, indicating that variations in metallicity only play a
minor role in influencing these line ratios.

analysis. Several approaches have been proposed that either (i) partition the
whole network into clusters, even in low density region, or (ii) are aimed at
finding a single densest community (and need to be iterated to find the next
one). As social networks grow larger both approaches (i) and (ii) result in
algorithms too slow to be practical, in particular when speed in analyzing the

efficiency of computation and expressiveness and manageability of the output
community representation. We define the notion of a partial dense cover (PDC)
of a graph. Intuitively a PDC of a graph is a collection of sets of nodes that
(a) each set forms a disjoint dense induced subgraphs and (b) its removal
leaves the residual graph without dense regions. Exact computation of PDC is an
NP-complete problem, thus, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithms for
computing a PDC which we christen Core and Peel. Moreover we propose a novel
benchmarking technique that allows us to evaluate algorithms for computing PDC
using the classical IR concepts of precision and recall even without a golden
standard. Tests on 25 social and technological networks from the Stanford Large
Network Dataset Collection confirm that Core and Peel is efficient and attains
very high precison and recall.

cosmology, because any proposed model of the universe must account for the
features of this radiation. Of all CMB measurements that the scientific
community has not yet been able to perform, the CMB B-mode polarization is
probably the most challenging from the instrumental point of view. The
signature of primordial gravitational waves, which give rise to a B-type
polarization, is one of the goals in cosmology today and amongst the first
objectives in the field. For this purpose, high-performance low-temperature
bolometric cameras, made of thousands of pixels, are currently being developed
by many groups, which will improve the sensitivity to B-mode CMB polarization
by one or two orders of magnitude compared to the Planck satellite HFI
detectors. We present here a new bolometer structure that is able to increase
the pixel sensitivities and to simplify the fabrication procedure. This
innovative device replaces delicate membrane-based structures and eliminates
the mediation of phonons: the incoming energy is directly captured and measured
in the electron bath of an appropriate sensor and the thermal decoupling is
achieved via the intrinsic electron-phonon decoupling of the sensor at very low
temperature. Reported results come from a 204-pixel array of Nb$_{x}$Si$_{1-x}$
transition edge sensors with a meander structure fabricated on a 2-inch silicon
wafer using electron-beam co-evaporation and a cleanroom lithography process.
To validate the application of this device to CMB measurements, we have
performed an optical calibration of our sample in the focal plane of a dilution
cryostat test bench. We have demonstrated a light absorption close to 20% and
an NEP of about 7$\times10^{-16}$ W/$\sqrt{Hz}$, which is highly encouraging
given the scope for improvement in this type of detectors.

reproduce the binary topology of the World Trade Web. In this paper a different
approach is presented: the formalism of exponential random graphs is used and
the distances are treated as constraints, to be imposed on a previously chosen
ensemble of graphs. Then, the information encoded in the geographical distances
is used to explain the binary structure of the World Trade Web, by testing it
on the degree-degree correlations and the reciprocity structure. This leads to
the definition of a novel null model that combines spatial and non-spatial
effects. The effectiveness of spatial constraints is compared to that of
nonspatial ones by means of the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian
Information Criterion. Even if it is commonly believed that the World Trade Web
is strongly dependent on the distances, what emerges from our analysis is that
distances do not play a crucial role in shaping the World Trade Web binary
structure and that the information encoded into the reciprocity is far more
useful in explaining the observed patterns.

Northern sky of the galactic plane, using the data collected by the South Pole
neutrino telescopes IceCube and AMANDA. The galactic region considered here
includes the Local Arm towards the Cygnus region and our closest approach to
the Perseus Arm. The data have been collected between 2007 and 2009 when AMANDA
was an integrated part of IceCube, which was still under construction and
operated with 22-strings (2007-8) and 40-strings (2008-9) of optical modules
deployed in the ice. By combining the larger IceCube detector with the lower
energy threshold of the more compact AMANDA detector, we obtain an improved
sensitivity at energies below $\sim$10 TeV with respect to previous searches.
The analyses presented here are: a scan for point sources within the galactic
plane; a search optimized for multiple and extended sources in the Cygnus
region, which might be below the sensitivity of the point source scan; and
studies of seven pre-selected neutrino source candidates. For one of them,
Cygnus X-3, a time-dependent search for neutrinos in coincidence with observed
radio and X-ray flares has been performed. No evidence of a signal is found,
and upper limits are reported for each of the searches. We investigate neutrino
spectra proportional to E$^{-2}$ and E$^{-3}$ to cover the entire range of
possible spectra. The soft E$^{-3}$ spectrum results in an energy distribution
similar to a source with cut-off below $\sim$50 TeV. For the considered region
of the galactic plane, the 90% confidence level muon neutrino flux upper limits
are in the range E$^3$dN/dE$\sim 5.4 - 19.5 \times 10^{-11} \rm{TeV^{2} cm^{-2}
s^{-1}}$ for point-like neutrino sources in the energy region [180.0 GeV - 20.5
TeV]. These represent the most stringent upper limits for soft-spectra neutrino
sources within the Galaxy reported to date.

driven to a normal metal state at zero temperature. This phenomenon is known as
quantum criticality and leads to fascinating responses in thermodynamics and
transport of the compound. In the standard picture, a single quantum critical
point occurs at zero temperature, which results in a nontrivial critical
behaviour in its vicinity. Here we show that in two dimensions the scenario is
considerably more complex due to the enormous amount of quantum fluctuations.
Instead of the single point separating the antiferromagnet from the normal
metal, we have discovered a broad region between these two phases where the
magnetic order is destroyed but certain areas of the Fermi surface are closed
by a large gap. This gap reflects the formation of a novel quantum state
characterised by a superposition of d-wave superconductivity and a
quadrupole-density wave, id est a state in which an electron quadrupole density
spatially oscillates with a period drastically different from the one of the
original spin-density wave. At moderate temperatures both orders co-exist at
short distances but thermal fluctuations destroy the long-range order. Below a
critical temperature the fluctuations are less essential and superconductivity
becomes stable. This new phenomenon may shed some light on the origin of the
mysterious pseudogap state and of the high-temperature transition into the
superconducting state in cuprates. Our results demonstrate that quantum phase
transitions between antiferromagnets and normal metals in layered materials may
be the proper playground for search of new high temperature superconductors.

Yet, connectivity in these networks can be established over time and space,
based on temporal analogues of multi-hop paths (also called {\em journeys}).
Attempting to optimize the selection of the journeys in these networks
naturally leads to the study of three cases: shortest (minimum hop), fastest
(minimum duration), and foremost (earliest arrival) journeys. Efficient
centralized algorithms exists to compute all cases, when the full knowledge of
the network evolution is given.
  In this paper, we study the {\em distributed} counterparts of these problems,
i.e. shortest, fastest, and foremost broadcast with termination detection
(TDB), with minimal knowledge on the topology.
  We show that the feasibility of each of these problems requires distinct
features on the evolution, through identifying three classes of dynamic graphs
wherein the problems become gradually feasible: graphs in which the
re-appearance of edges is {\em recurrent} (class R), {\em bounded-recurrent}
(B), or {\em periodic} (P), together with specific knowledge that are
respectively $n$ (the number of nodes), $\Delta$ (a bound on the recurrence
time), and $p$ (the period). In these classes it is not required that all pairs
of nodes get in contact -- only that the overall {\em footprint} of the graph
is connected over time.
  Our results, together with the strict inclusion between $P$, $B$, and $R$,
implies a feasibility order among the three variants of the problem, i.e.
TDB[foremost] requires weaker assumptions on the topology dynamics than
TDB[shortest], which itself requires less than TDB[fastest]. Reversely, these
differences in feasibility imply that the computational powers of $R_n$,
$B_\Delta$, and $P_p$ also form a strict hierarchy.

built to obtain 2-D images at several frequencies from fusion plasmas. SAMI
uses a phased array of linearly polarised antennas. The array configuration has
been optimised to achieve maximum synthetic aperture beam efficiency. The
signals received by antennas are down-converted to the intermediate frequency
range and then recorded in a full vector form. Full vector signals allow beam
focusing and image reconstruction in both real time and a post processing mode.
SAMI can scan over 16 preprogrammed frequencies in the range of 10-35GHz with a
switching time of 300ns. The system operates in 2 different modes
simultaneously: both a passive imaging of plasma emission and also an active
imaging of the back-scattered signal of the radiation launched by one of the
antennas from the same array. This second mode is similar to so-called Doppler
backscattering (DBS) reflectometry with 2-D resolution of the propagation
velocity of turbulent structures. Both modes of operation show good performance
in a real fusion plasma experiments on Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST). We
have obtained the first ever 2-D images of BXO mode conversion windows. With
active probing, the first ever turbulence velocity maps have been obtained. In
this article we present an overview of the diagnostic and discuss recent
results.

  Next, we derive a dual formulation of the complexity of a non-adaptive

for all certificate structures. By this, we mean that there exists a function
possessing the certificate structure and such that a learning graph gives an
optimal quantum query algorithm for it.
  For a special case of certificate structures generated by certificates of
bounded size, we construct a relatively general class of functions having this
property. The construction is based on orthogonal arrays, and generalizes the
quantum query lower bound for the $k$-sum problem derived recently in
arXiv:1206.6528.

specification is realized or not by a reactive system. LTL is not expressive
enough to formalize the correctness of reactive systems with respect to some
quantitative aspects. This paper extends the qualitative LTL synthesis setting
to a quantitative setting. The alphabet of actions is extended with a weight
function ranging over the rational numbers. The value of an infinite word is
the mean-payoff of the weights of its letters. The synthesis problem then
amounts to automatically construct (if possible) a reactive system whose
executions all satisfy a given LTL formula and have mean-payoff values greater
than or equal to some given threshold. The latter problem is called LTLMP
synthesis and the LTLMP realizability problem asks to check whether such a
system exists. We first show that LTLMP realizability is not more difficult
than LTL realizability: it is 2ExpTime-Complete. This is done by reduction to
two-player mean-payoff parity games. While infinite memory strategies are
required to realize LTLMP specifications in general, we show that
epsilon-optimality can be obtained with finite memory strategies, for any
epsilon > 0. To obtain an efficient algorithm in practice, we define a
Safraless procedure to decide whether there exists a finite-memory strategy
that realizes a given specification for some given threshold. This procedure is
based on a reduction to two-player energy safety games which are in turn
reduced to safety games. Finally, we show that those safety games can be solved
efficiently by exploiting the structure of their state spaces and by using
antichains as a symbolic data-structure. All our results extend to
multi-dimensional weights. We have implemented an antichain-based procedure and
we report on some promising experimental results.

proposal, the black hole final state for closed strings is studied and the
entropy of these states is calculated.Then, to consider the closed string
states, a copy of the original Hilbert space is constructed with a set of
operators of creation/anihilation that have the same commutation properties as
the original ones. The total Hilbert space is the tensor product of the two
spaces $H_{right}\otimes H_{left}$, where in this case $H_{left/right}$ denotes
the physical quantum states space of the closed string .It is shown that closed
string states can be represented by a maximally entangled two-mode squeezed
state of the left and right spaces of closed string. Also, the entropy for
these string states is calculated.It is found that black hole entropy matches
the closed string entropy at transition point.This means that our result is
consistent with correspondence principle and thus HM mechanism in string theory
works . Consequently the unitarity of the black hole in string theory can be
reconciled.However Gottesman and Preskill point out that, in this scenario,
departures from unitarity can arise due to interactions between the collapsing
body and the infalling Hawking radiation inside the event horizon and
information can be lost. By extending the Gottesman and Preskill method to
string theory, the amount of information transformation from the matter to the
state of outgoing Hagedorn radiation for closed strings is obtained.It is
observed that information is lost for closed strings.

to the need of information security and confidentiality at various levels of
communication such as while communicating confidential personal data, medical
data of patients, defence and intelligence information of countries, data
related to examinations etc. With advancements in image processing research,
Image encryption and Steganographic techniques have gained popularity over
other forms of hidden communication techniques during the last few decades and
a number of image encryption models are suggested by various researchers from
time to time. In this paper, we are suggesting a new image encryption model
based on Fibonacci and Lucas series.

amplification when the ATA/ATAPI SSD Trim command is incorporated into
object-based storage under a variety of user workloads, including a uniform
random workload with objects of fixed size and a uniform random workload with
objects of varying sizes. We first summarize the existing models for write
amplification in SSDs for workloads with and without the Trim command, then
propose an alteration of the models that utilizes a framework of object-based
storage. The utilization of objects and pages in the SSD is derived, with the
analytic results compared to simulation. Finally, the effect of objects on
write amplification and its computation is discussed along with a potential
application to optimization of SSD usage through object storage metadata
servers that allocate object classes of distinct object size.

stress exerted by a field whose surface values are consistent with photospheric
line-of-sight measurements.
