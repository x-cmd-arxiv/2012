capillary surfaces supported by a helical wire. These open channels are
potentially useful for fluid management at low Bond numbers. The experiments
were performed in a Plateau tank, injecting 2-fluorotoluene into distilled
water, density matched at 26.5 $^{o}$C. Extension springs with a nominal
diameter of 0.24 inches and with a wire diameter of 0.018 inches were used. At
small extensions, liquid can be injected into the spring from one side. The
injected free-ended liquid columns are stable. Volume-constrained stability can
be studied after injecting from both sides until coalescence. Stable states
exist between lower and upper volume stability limits. The low volume
instability is manifested by the growth of a neck that eventually breaks. The
breakage sends a wave front; the interface ahead of the front is static while
the interface behind the front undergoes oscillations. These oscillations
eventually dampen as the free-ends retract until equilibrium states are
reached. The upper volume instability causes the interface to blow out creating
a large drop that remains connected to the liquid column supported by the
spring. After a critical pitch, injection is no longer possible from one end.
However, a liquid column established by injection can be stretched beyond the
critical pitch for injection. Beyond this pitch, after breakup and blowout the
interface undergoes a pearling instability. The resulting free ends retract and
grow into drops from which the liquid column eventually breaks. This pearling
instability propagates throughout the entire length of the structure largely
emptying it. Small tracer drops, outside and in the vicinity of the interface,
traced helical trajectories as liquid was injected into, and withdrawn from,
the spring. We also demonstrated vertical wicking into a small spring in air.

energies around the pion mass (""low energy"") and the higher energies where the

N4L0, O(e^2 delta^4), in the low-energy region, and at NLO, O(e^2 delta^0), in
the resonance region. Throughout, the Delta-pole graphs are dressed with pi-N

of proton Compton experiments is used to constrain the free parameters in our
amplitude: the M1 gamma-N-Delta transition strength b_1 (which is fixed in the
resonance region) and the polarisabilities alpha and beta (which are fixed from
data below 170 MeV). In order to obtain a reasonable fit we find it necessary
to add the spin polarisability gammaM1 as a free parameter, even though it is,

cosmological perturbations, the dynamics of the DDM was shown to be identical
to that of standard cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper, the DDM model is
investigated at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. We find that
the internal energy of the DDM fluid modifies the curvature perturbation
generated by CDM with a term quadratic in the dipole field. This correction
induces a new type of non-Gaussianity in the bispectrum of the curvature
perturbation with respect to standard CDM. Leaving unspecified the primordial
amplitude of the dipole field, which could in principle be determined by a more
fundamental description of DDM, we find that, in contrast with usual models of
primordial non-Gaussianities, the non-Gaussianity induced by DDM increases with
time after the radiation-matter equality on super-Hubble scales. This
distinctive feature of the DDM model, as compared with standard CDM, could thus
provide a specific signature in the CMB and large-scale structure probes of
non-Gaussianity.

the diagonal U(1) holonomy into account. The result suggests the system becomes
unstable and a phase transition happens at |\lambda|=1.

of second-order elliptic equations so that these solutions satisfy specific
qualitative properties such as: (i) the norm of the gradient of one solution is
bounded from below by a positive constant in the vicinity of a finite number of
prescribed points; and (ii) the determinant of gradients of $n$ solutions is
bounded from below in the vicinity of a finite number of prescribed points.
Such constructions find applications in recent hybrid medical imaging
modalities.
  The methodology is based on starting from a controlled setting in which the
constraints are satisfied and continuously modifying the coefficients in the
second-order elliptic equation. The boundary condition is evolved by solving an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) defined so that appropriate optimality
conditions are satisfied. Unique continuations and standard regularity results
for elliptic equations are used to show that the ODE admits a solution for
sufficiently long times.

transient relaxation in the Quantum Brownian Motion model for harmonic

transients corresponds to a definition of heat as the change in the system
Hamiltonian of mean force, with a recent proposal by Esposito (ELB) based on a
definition of heat as the energy change in the bath. Both expressions yield a
positive-defined entropy production and coincide for vanishing coupling
strength, but their difference is proved to be always positive (after
non-Markovian transients disappear) and to grow as the coupling strength
increases. In the classical over-damped limit the ""Poised"" entropy production
converges to the entropy production used in stochastic thermodynamics. We also
investigate the effects of the system size, and of the ensuing Poincar\'e
recurrences, and how the classical limit is approached. We close by discussing
the strong-coupling limit, in which the ideal canonical equilibrium of the bath
is violated.

component. After first correcting for contamination from the Milky Way
foreground population and misidentified background galaxies, we average the
radial density of RGB candidate stars over circular annuli centered on the
galaxy and away from the disk substructure. We find evidence of a
low-luminosity, centrally concentrated component that is everywhere in our data
fainter than mu_V ~ 33 mag arcsec^(-2). The scale length of this feature is not
well constrained by our data, but it appears to be of order r_exp ~ 20 kpc;
there is weak evidence to suggest it is not azimuthally symmetric. Inspection
of the overall CMD for this region that specifically clips out the disk
substructure reveals that this residual RGB population is consistent with an
old population with a photometric metallicity of around [Fe/H] ~ -2 dex, but
some residual contamination from the disk substructure appears to remain. We
discuss the likelihood that our findings represent a bona-fide halo in M33,
rather than extended emission from the disk substructure. We interpret our
findings in terms of an upper limit to M33's halo that is a few percent of its
total luminosity, although its actual luminosity is likely much less.

generally used to retrieve cosmological parameters from observed counts of
galaxy clusters. This neglects the observational fact that the baryonic mass
fraction in clusters is a random variable that, on average, increases with the
total mass (within an overdensity of 500). Considering a mock catalog that
includes tens of thousands of galaxy clusters, as expected from the forthcoming
generation of surveys, we show that the effect of a varying baryonic mass
fraction will be observable with high statistical significance. The net effect
is a change in the overall normalization of the cluster mass function and a
milder modification of its shape. Our results indicate the necessity of taking
into account baryonic corrections to the mass function if one wants to obtain
unbiased estimates of the cosmological parameters from data of this quality. We
introduce the formalism necessary to accomplish this goal. Our discussion is
based on the conditional probability of finding a given value of the baryonic
mass fraction for clusters of fixed total mass. Finally, we show that combining
information from the cluster counts with measurements of the baryonic mass
fraction in a small subsample of clusters (including only a few tens of
objects) will nearly optimally constrain the cosmological parameters.

the Chern-Simons (CS) case, in arbitrary (odd) dimension greater than four. The
spacetime is characterized by admitting a metric that is a warped product of a
two-dimensional spacetime M2 and an (a priori) arbitrary Euclidean base
manifold Sigma(d-2) of dimension d-2. We show that the solutions are naturally
classified in terms of the equations that restrict the base manifold. According
to the strength of such constraints we found the following branches in which
Sigma(d-2) has to fulfill: a Lovelock equation with a single vacuum (Euclidean
Lovelock Chern-Simons in dimension d-2), a single scalar equation that is the
trace of an Euclidean Lovelock CS equation in dimension d-2, or finally a
degenerate case in which the base manifold is not restricted at all. We show
that all the cases have some degeneracy in the sense that the metric functions
are not completely fixed by the field equations. This result extends the static
five-dimensional case previously discussed in Phys.Rev. D76 (2007) 064038, and
it shows that in the CS case, the inclusion of higher powers in the curvature
does not introduce new branches of solutions in Lovelock gravity. Finally we
comment on how the inclusion of a non-vanishing torsion and matter fields may
modify this analysis.

characterizing the planet forming environments around young stars. The
characteristic size of the scattering dust grains can be estimated from the
observed brightness asymmetry between the front and back side of the disk, for
example using standard Mie theory. However such models often overpredict their
brightness by one or two orders of magnitude, and have difficulty explaining
very red disk colors. We aim to develop a dust model that explains
simultaneously the observed disk surface brightness, colors and asymmetry in
scattered light, focusing on constraining grain sizes. We use the 2D radiative
transfer code MCMax with anisotropic scattering to explore the effects of grain
size on synthetic scattered light images of circumstellar disks. We compare the
results with surface brightness profiles of the protoplanetary disk HD 100546
in scattered light at wavelengths from 0.4 to 2.2 micron. We find that extreme
forward scattering by micron sized particles lowers the /effective/ dust albedo
and creates a faint and red disk that /appears/ only slightly forward
scattering. For the outer (>~100 AU) disk of HD 100546 we derive a minimum
grain size of 2.5 micron, likely present in the form of aggregates.
Intermediate sized grains are too bright, whereas smaller grains are faint and
scatter more isotropically, but also produce disk colors that are too blue.
Observed surface brightness asymmetries alone are not sufficient to constrain
the grain size in circumstellar disks. Additional information, such as the
brightness and colors of the disk are needed to provide additional constraints.

lithium abundance in stars is a long-standing problem, which indicates that the
adopted physical treatment is still lacking in some points. However, thanks to
the recent improvements in both models and observations, it is interesting to
analyse the situation to evaluate present uncertainties. We present a
consistent and quantitative analysis of the theoretical uncertainties affecting
surface lithium abundance in the current generation of models. By means of an
up-to-date and well tested evolutionary code, FRANEC, theoretical errors on
surface 7Li abundance predictions, during the pre-main sequence (pre-MS) and
main sequence (MS) phases, are discussed in detail. Then, the predicted surface
7Li abundance was tested against observational data for five open clusters,
namely Ic 2602, \alpha Per, Blanco1, Pleiades, and Ngc 2516, and for four
detached double-lined eclipsing binary systems. Stellar models for the
aforementioned clusters were computed by adopting suitable chemical
composition, age, and mixing length parameter for MS stars determined from the
analysis of the colour-magnitude diagram of each cluster. We restricted our
analysis to young clusters, to avoid additional uncertainty sources such as
diffusion and/or radiative levitation efficiency. We confirm the disagreement,
within present uncertainties, between theoretical predictions and 7Li
observations for standard models. However, we notice that a satisfactory
agreement with observations for 7Li abundance in both young open clusters and
binary systems can be achieved if a lower convection efficiency is adopted
during the pre-MS phase with respect to the MS one.

Gravitational Arc Survey (SOGRAS). The survey imaged 47 clusters in two
redshift intervals centered at $z=0.27$ and $z=0.55$, targeting the richest
clusters in each interval. Images were obtained in the $g'$, $r'$ and $i'$
bands using the SOAR Optical Imager (SOI), with a median seeing of 0.83, 0.76
and 0.71 arcsec, respectively, in these filters. Most of the survey clusters
are located within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 region and all
of them are in the SDSS footprint. Photometric calibration was therefore
performed using SDSS stars located in our SOI fields. We reached for galaxies
in all fields the detection limits of $g \sim 23.5$, $r \sim 23$ and $i \sim
22.5$ for a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 3. As a by-product of the image
processing, we generated a source catalogue with 19760 entries, the vast
majority of which are galaxies, where we list their positions, magnitudes and
shape parameters. We compared our galaxy shape measurements to those of local
galaxies and concluded that they were not strongly affected by seeing. From the
catalogue data, we are able to identify a red sequence of galaxies in most
clusters in the lower $z$ range. We found 16 gravitational arc candidates
around 8 clusters in our sample. They tend to be bluer than the central
galaxies in the lensing cluster. A preliminary analysis indicates that $\sim
10%$ of the clusters have arcs around them, with a possible indication of a
larger efficiency associated to the high-$z$ systems when compared to the
low-$z$ ones. Deeper follow-up images with Gemini strengthen the case for the
strong lensing nature of the candidates found in this survey.

that a.s. the largest connected component in the limiting set K is a point for
p<p_c(M) and with positive probability there is a connected component
intersecting opposite sides of the unit square for p\geq p_c(M).
  For all M\geq 2, the value of p_c(M) is unknown. In this paper we present
ideas to find lower and upper bounds, significantly sharper than those already

percolation. A fundamentally new result is that for all M we construct an
increasing sequence that converges to p_c(M). The terms in the sequence can in

eventually allow us to directly detect the signature of these motions from
high-resolution spectra of the ICM. In this paper, we present a study on a set
of clusters extracted from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, devoted to
explore the role of non-thermal velocity amplitude in characterising the
cluster state and the relation between observed X-ray properties. In order to
reach this goal, we apply the X-ray virtual telescope PHOX to generate
synthetic observations of the simulated clusters with both Chandra and ATHENA,
the latter used as an example for the performance of very high-resolution X-ray
telescopes. From Chandra spectra we extract global properties, e.g. luminosity
and temperature, and from ATHENA spectra we estimate the gas velocity
dispersion along the line of sight from the broadening of heavy-ion emission
lines (e.g. Fe). We further extend the analysis to the relation between
non-thermal velocity dispersion of the gas and the L_X-T scaling law for the
simulated clusters. Interestingly, we find a clear dependence of slope and
scatter on the selection criterion for the clusters, based on the level of
significance of non-thermal motions. Namely, the scatter in the relation is
significantly reduced by the exclusion of the clusters, for which we estimate
the highest turbulent velocities. Such velocity diagnostics appears therefore
as a promising independent way to identify disturbed clusters, in addition to
the commonly used morphological inspection.

that detecting AGN transits requires repeated observations of thousands of low

that 55+/-14% of the star formation budget is hosted by non-interacting
late-types, with 27+/-8% in major mergers and 18+/-6% in spheroids. Given that
a system undergoing a major merger continues to experience star formation
driven by other processes at this epoch (e.g. cold accretion, minor mergers),
~27% is an upper limit to the major-merger contribution to star formation
activity at this epoch. The ratio of the average specific star formation rate
in major mergers to that in the non-interacting late-types is ~2.2:1,
suggesting that the enhancement of star formation due to major merging is
typically modest, and that just under half the star formation in systems
experiencing major mergers is unrelated to the merger itself. Taking this into
account, we estimate that the actual major-merger contribution to the star
formation budget may be as low as ~15%. While our study does not preclude a
major-merger-dominated era in the very early Universe, if the major-merger
contribution to star formation does not evolve strongly into larger look-back
times, then this process has a relatively insignificant role in driving stellar

the entire visible and IR range. The radius ratio in each wavelength band was
rederived to ensure a consistent treatment of the bulk transit parameters and
stellar limb-darkening. Special care was taken to correct for, and derive
realistic estimates of the uncertainties due to, both occulted and unocculted
star spots. The combined spectrum is very different from the predictions of
cloud-free models: it is dominated by Rayleigh scattering over the whole
visible and near infrared range, the only detected features being narrow Na and
K lines. We interpret this as the signature of a haze of condensate grains
extending over at least 5 scale heights. We show that a dust-dominated
atmosphere could also explain several puzzling features of the emission
spectrum and phase curves, including the large amplitude of the phase curve at
3.6um, the small hot-spot longitude shift and the hot mid-infrared emission
spectrum. We discuss possible compositions and derive some first-order

by speculating that the dichotomy between the two observationally defined

whether they are clear or dusty. We also consider the possibility of a

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary

simulations include vertical stratification and assume zero net vertical
magnetic flux. We employ a super time-stepping technique to ameliorate the
Courant restriction on the diffusive time step. We find that in idealized
stratified simulations, with a spatially constant ambipolar Elsasser number Am,
turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) behaves in a
similar manner as in prior unstratified calculations. Turbulence dies away for
Am < 1, and becomes progressively more vigorous as ambipolar diffusion is
decreased. Near-ideal MHD behavior is recovered for Am > 1000. In the
intermediate regime (10 < Am < 1000) ambipolar diffusion leads to substantial
increases in both the period of the MRI dynamo cycle and the characteristic
scales of magnetic field structures. To quantify the impact of ambipolar
physics on disk accretion, we run simulations at 30 AU and 100 AU that include
a vertical Am profile based upon far ultraviolet (FUV) ionized disk models.
These models develop a vertically layered structure analogous to the Ohmic dead
zone that is present at smaller radii. We find that, although the levels of
surface turbulence can be strong (and consistent with constraints on turbulent
line widths at these radii), the inferred accretion rates are at least an order
of magnitude smaller than those observed in T Tauri stars. This discrepancy is
very likely due to the assumption of zero vertical magnetic field in our
simulations and suggests that vertical magnetic fields are essential for
MRI-driven accretion in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks.

non-zero temperatures implies that this theory has quasi-normal modes with
complex frequencies. The quasi-normal modes determine the poles and zeros of
the conductivity in the complex frequency plane, and so fully determine its
behavior on the real frequency axis, at frequencies both smaller and larger
than the absolute temperature. We describe the role of particle-vortex or
S-duality on the conductivity, specifically how it maps poles to zeros and vice
versa. These analyses motivate two sum rules obeyed by the quantum critical
conductivity: the holographic computations are the first to satisfy both sum
rules, while earlier Boltzmann-theory computations satisfy only one of them.
Finally, we compare our results with the analytic structure of the O(N) model
in the large-N limit, and other CFTs.

temperature diagnostics. At the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope the blue wing
of Ca II H is scanned with a narrowband interference filter mounted on a
rotation stage. This provides up to 0""10 spatial resolution filtergrams at high
cadence that are concurrent with other diagnostics at longer wavelengths. Aims.
The aim is to develop observational techniques that provide the photospheric
temperature stratification at the highest spatial resolution possible and use
those to compare simulations and observations at different heights. Methods. We
use filtergrams in the Ca II H blue wing obtained with a tiltable interference
filter at the SST. Synthetic observations are produced from 3D HD and 3D MHD
numerical simulations and degraded to match the observations. The temperature
structure obtained from applying the method to the synthetic data is compared
with the known structure in the simulated atmospheres and with observations of
an active region. Cross-correlation techniques using restored non-simultaneous
continuum images are used to reduce high-altitude, small-scale seeing signal
introduced from the non-simultaneity of the frames when differentiating data.
Results. Temperature extraction using high resolution filtergrams in the Ca II
H blue wing works reasonably well when tested with simulated 3D atmospheres.
The cross-correlation technique successfully compensates the problem of
small-scale seeing differences and provides a measure of the spurious signal
from this source in differentiated data. Synthesized data from the simulated
atmospheres (including pores) match well the observations morphologically at
different observed heights and in vertical temperature gradients.

theory with holographic dual description. We extend the analysis of
arxiv:1109.2920, which finds a critical electric field at which the Schwinger
pair production barrier drops to zero, to the case of magnetic fields. We first
find that, unlike ordinary weakly coupled theories, the magnetic field is not
subject to any perturbative instability originating from the presence of a
tachyonic ground state in the W-boson spectrum. This follows from the large
value of the 't Hooft coupling \lambda, which prevents the Zeeman interaction
term to overcome the particle mass at high B. Consequently, we study the next
possible B-field instability, i.e. monopole pair production, which is the
S-dual version of the Schwinger effect. Also in this case a critical magnetic
field is expected when the tunneling barrier drops to zero. These
Schwinger-type criticalities are the holographic duals, in the bulk, to the
fields E or B reaching the tension of F1 or D1 strings respectively. We then
discuss how this effect is modified when electric and magnetic fields are
present simultaneously and dyonic states in the spectrum can be pair produced
by a generic E - B background. Finally, we analyze finite temperature effects
on Schwinger criticalities, i.e. in the AdS-Schwarzshild black hole background.

ring-like distributions and either centrally peaked or off-centre emission. The
morphologies of the molecular and the ionized gas are not necessarily
coincident. The observed emission-line ratios point towards thermal processes
as the principal mechanism responsible for the H2 excitation in the nuclear and
circumnuclear regions of the galaxies, independently of the presence of an
active nucleus. We find that a rescaling of the H2 2.12 microns emission-line
luminosity by a factor beta~1200 gives a good estimate (within a factor of 2)
of the total (cold) molecular gas mass. The galaxies of the sample contain
large quantities of molecular gas in their centres, with total masses in the ~
105 - 108 Msol range. Never the less, these masses correspond to less than 3
per cent of the stellar masses derived for the galaxies in these regions,
indicating that the presence of gas should not affect black hole mass estimates
based on the dynamical modelling of the stars. The high-spatial resolution
provided by the SINFONI data allowed us to resolve a circumnuclear ring (with a
radius of ~270 pc) in the galaxy NGC 4536. The measured values of the Br_gamma

Although quenching may occur through a variety of processes, the exact
mechanism(s) that is in fact responsible for quenching is still in question.
This paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenching
processes through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as surface
stellar mass density and Sersic index (n). We analyze the rest-frame U-B color
correlations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in
the redshift range 0.5< z<0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey. We find that Sersic
index (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters and
resembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. There exists,
however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n
values that seem to contradict this behavior. We hypothesize that their Sersic
values may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits,
leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternative
to Sersic index. Not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tight
relationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is
most physically linked with quenching. Furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority of
the blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their
GIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of
similar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must
absolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. We discuss a
two-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates are
controlled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and a
second quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellar
mass build-up.

(approximately) the same for the cosmologically relevant ranges of the three

Tauri stars (CTTS, F-K type precursors) the accretion disk does not reach down
to the central star, but it is truncated near the co-rotation radius. The inner
edge of the disk is ionized by the stellar radiation, so that the accretion
stream is funneled along the magnetic field lines. On the stellar surface an
accretion shock develops, which is observed over a wide wavelength range as
X-ray emission, UV excess, optical veiling and optical and IR emission lines.
Some of the accretion tracers, e.g. H\alpha, can be calibrated to measure the
accretion rate. This accretion process is variable on time scales of hours to
years due to changing accretion rates, stellar rotation and reconfiguration of
the magnetic field. Furthermore, many accreting systems also drive strong
outflows which are ultimately powered by accretion. Several components could
contribute to the outflows: slow, wide-angle disk winds, X-winds launched close
to the inner disk rim, and thermally driven stellar winds. In any case, the
outflows contain material of very different temperatures and speeds. The disk
wind is cool and can have a molecular component with just a few tens of km/s,
while the central component of the outflow can reach a few 100 km/s. In some
cases the inner part of the outflow is collimated to a small-angle jet. These
jets have an onion-like structure, where the inner components are consecutively
hotter and faster. The jets can contain working surfaces, which show up as
Herbig-Haro knots. Accretion and outflows in the CTTS phase do not only
determine stellar parameters like the rotation rate on the main-sequence, they
also can have a profound impact on the environment of young stars. This review
concentrates on CTTS in near-by star forming regions where observations of high

816 quasars, selected to have small Fe II velocity shifts with spectral
coverage in the rest wavelength range 3500--5500 \AA. The sample is explicitly
designed to mitigate spurious effects on SPCA induced by Fe II velocity shifts.
We improve the algorithm of SPCA in the literature and introduce a new
quantity, \emph{the fractional-contribution spectrum}, that effectively
identifies the emission features encoded in each eigenspectrum. The first
eigenspectrum clearly records the power-law continuum and very broad Balmer
emission lines. Narrow emission lines dominate the second eigenspectrum. The
third eigenspectrum represents the Fe II emission and a component of the Balmer
lines with kinematically similar intermediate velocity widths. Correlations
between the weights of the eigenspectra and parametric measurements of line
strength and continuum slope confirm the above interpretation for the
eigenspectra. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the validity of our method to
recognize cross talk in SPCA and firmly rule out a single-component model for
broad Hbeta. We also present the results of SPCA for four other samples that
contain quasars in bins of larger Fe II velocity shift; similar eigenspectra
are obtained. We propose that the Hbeta-emitting region has two kinematically
distinct components: one with very large velocities whose strength correlates
with the continuum shape, and another with more modest, intermediate velocities
that is closely coupled to the gas that gives rise to Fe II emission.

galaxies in the early universe, particularly representative of those undergoing
massive events of star formation. Therefore, LBGs should produce significant
amounts of X-ray emission. We aim to trace the X-ray luminosity of Lyman Break
Galaxies across cosmic time and from that derive constraints on their star
formation history. We utilize the newly released 4 Ms mosaic obtained with the
Chandra X-ray Observatory, the deepest X-ray image to date, alongside with the
superb spectroscopic data sets available in the CDF-S survey region to
construct large but nearly uncontaminated samples of LBGs across a wide range
of redshift (0.5 < z < 4.5) which can be used as input samples for stacking
experiments. This approach allows us to trace the X-ray emission of Lyman Break
Galaxies to even lower, previously unreachable, flux density limits (~10^-18 mW
m^-2) and therefore to larger redshifts. We reliably detect soft-band X-ray
emission from all our input redshift bins except for the highest redshift (z~4)
one. From that we derive rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosities and infer star
formation rates and stellar masses. We find that star formation in LBGs peaks
at a redshift of z_peak~3.5 and then decreases quickly. We also see a
characteristic peak in the specific star formation rate (sSFR=SFR/M_*) at this
redshift. Furthermore, we calculate the contribution of LBGs to the total
cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and find that the contribution of
LBGs is negligible. Therefore, we conclude that most of the star formation in
the early universe takes place in lower luminosity galaxies as suggested by
hierarchical structure formation models.

development of public transport service is self-adjusting: Faced with a
decreasing demand, operators will tend to reduce service to cut costs,
resulting in a decrease in the level-of-service, which then triggers a further
drop in demand. The opposite may also occur: high demand will induce the
operator to increase supply, e.g. through an increase in frequency, which
results in a higher level-of-service and a subsequent increase in passenger
numbers, triggering another round of service improvements. This paper adds to
the literature by presenting an analytic model for analyzing these phenomena of
vicious or virtuous cycles. The model formalizes passengers decisions to use a
public transport service depending on waiting time and employs field data
regarding passengers variation in willingness-to-wait for a public transport
service. The paper investigates the dynamics of the line service and shows how
the emergence of a vicious or virtuous cycle depends on total number of
potential passengers and share of captive riders. It ends with a discussion of
the implications of the findings for the planning of public transport services.

current-voltage characteristics of disordered superconducting films placed in a
perpendicular magnetic field, $H$, in the whole $H$-$T$ phase diagram outside
the superconducting region. This tunnel-current is experimentally accessible by
STM measurements. In the domain of temperatures $T\geq T_{c0}$ and relatively
weak fields $H\ll H_{c2}(0)$ we reproduce existing results for the zero-voltage
tunneling conductance, but also discover an important nonlinear contribution,
which appears due to dynamic fluctuation modes and results in the formation of
a strong zero-bias anomaly (ZBA) on the scale $eV\sim
k_{\mathrm{B}}(T-T_{c0})$. At large voltages ($eV\sim k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{c0}$)
these modes, together with the contribution from static fluctuations, form a
pseudogap maximum. At low temperatures, with magnetic field values near
$H_{c2}(0)$, fluctuations acquire quantum character and the general picture of
the voltage dependent tunneling conductance resembles that one close to
$T_{c0}$, where the role of temperature and magnetic field are exchanged. In
particular, a gap-like structure appears with maximum at $eV_{\max}\sim
\Delta_{\mathrm{BCS}}$ and a sharp ZBA on the scale $eV\sim
\Delta_{\mathrm{BCS}}(H/H_{c2}(0)-1)$. The complete expression for the
tunneling current at arbitrary fields and temperatures can be evaluated only
numerically, which is presented in detail.

specifically the behaviour of solar flares and coronal mass ejections. An
investigation into the hydrodynamic evolution of a confined solar flare was
carried out using RHESSI, CDS, GOES and TRACE. Evidence for pre-flare heating,
explosive and gentle chromospheric evaporation and loop draining were observed
in the data. The observations were compared to a 0-D hydrodynamic model, EBTEL,
to aid interpretation. This led to the conclusion that the flare was not heated
purely by non-thermal beam heating as previously believed, but also required
direct heating of the plasma. An observational investigation in to the
initiation mechanism of a coronal mass ejection and eruptive flare was then
carried out, again utilising observations from a wide range of spacecraft:
MESSENGER/SAX, RHESSI, EUVI, Cor1 and Cor2. Observations provided evidence of
CME triggering by internal tether-cutting and not by breakout reconnection. A
comparison of the confined and eruptive flares suggests that while they have
different characteristics, timescales and topologies, these two phenomena are
the result of the same fundamental processes. Finally, an investigation into
the sensitivity of EUV imaging telescopes was carried out. This study
established a new technique for calculating the sensitivity of EUV imagers to
plasmas of different temperatures for four different types of plasma: coronal
hole, quiet sun, active region and solar flare. This was carried out for six
instruments: Proba-2/SWAP, TRACE, SOHO/EIT, STEREO A/EUVI, STEREO B/EUVI and
SDO/AIA. The importance of considering the multi-thermal nature of these
instruments was then put into the context of investigating explosive solar
activity.

between influence and adoption by explicitly modeling the states of being

decision-making process of adopting a product. We show that the expected profit
function under our proposed model maintains submodularity under certain

spread function. To maximize the expected profit under our extended LT model,
we employ an unbudgeted greedy framework to propose three profit maximization
algorithms. The results of our detailed experimental study on three real-world

prices dynamically based on the profit potential of each candidate seed, has
the best performance both in the expected profit achieved and in running time.

martian climate was warm enough for liquid water to flow on the surface thanks
to the greenhouse effect of a thick atmosphere. We present 3D global climate
simulations of the early martian climate performed assuming a faint young sun
and a CO2 atmosphere with pressure between 0.1 and 7 bars. The model includes a
detailed radiative transfer model using revised CO2 gas collision induced
absorption properties, and a parameterisation of the CO2 ice cloud
microphysical and radiative properties. A wide range of possible climates is
explored by using various values of obliquities, orbital parameters, cloud
microphysic parameters, atmospheric dust loading, and surface properties.
Unlike on present day Mars, for pressures higher than a fraction of a bar,
surface temperatures vary with altitude because of the adiabatic cooling and
warming of the atmosphere when it moves vertically. In most simulations, CO2
ice clouds cover a major part of the planet but greenhouse effect does not
exceed +15 K. We find that a CO2 atmosphere could not have raised the annual
mean temperature above 0{\deg}C anywhere on the planet. The collapse of the
atmosphere into permanent CO2 ice caps is predicted for pressures higher than 3
bar, or conversely at pressure lower than one bar if the obliquity is low
enough. Summertime diurnal mean surface temperatures above 0{\deg}C (a
condition which could have allowed rivers to form) are predicted for obliquity
larger than 40{\deg} at high latitudes but not in locations where most valley
networks are observed. In the absence of other warming mechanisms, our climate
model results are thus consistent with a cold early Mars scenario in which non
climatic mechanisms must occur to explain the evidence for liquid water. In a
companion paper by Wordsworth et al., we simulate the hydrological cycle on
such a planet.

point. The results at six flavors remain inconclusive: the running is slow
towards the infrared but the range and accuracy of the study are insufficient
for determining the existence of a fixed point.

consequence of the following combinatorial result: if a proper 3-coloring is
chosen uniformly from a box in Z^d, conditioned on color 0 being given to all
the vertices on the boundary of the box which are at an odd distance from a
fixed vertex v in the box, then the probability that v gets color 0 is
exponentially small in d.
  The proof proceeds through an analysis of a certain type of cutset separating
v from the boundary of the box, and builds on techniques developed by Galvin

  Building further on these techniques, we study local Markov chains for
sampling proper 3-colorings of the discrete torus Z^d_n. We show that there is
a constant \rho \approx 0.22 such that for all even n \geq 4 and d sufficiently

the spectral properties of the detected X-ray features are equally consistent
with thermal emission from hot gas, or with a power-law radiation continuum.
However, the plasma parameters implied by these different models favor a
synchrotron origin for the analyzed X-ray spots, indicating that a very
efficient acceleration of electrons is taking place within the giant structure
of Centaurus A, albeit only in isolated and compact regions. We also present a
detailed analysis of the diffuse X-ray emission, resulting in a tentative
detection of a soft excess component best fitted by a thermal model with a
temperature of 0.5 keV. The exact origin of the observed excess remains
uncertain, although energetic considerations point to thermal gas filling the
bulk of the volume of the lobe and mixed with the non-thermal plasma. The
corresponding pressure of the thermal gas in such a case appears to be in
almost exact equipartition with the pressure provided by the radio-emitting
electrons and the magnetic field. Although tentative, our findings potentially
imply that the structure of the extended lobes in active galaxies is likely to
be highly inhomogeneous, with magnetic reconnection processes continuously
converting magnetic energy to internal energy of the plasma particles, leading
to spatial and temporal variations in the plasma parameters around the
equilibrium condition.

find many distinct FSCs. We also demonstrate a procedure for creating larger

vital role in the study of complex systems. For example, many social networks
attach geo-location information to each user, allowing the study of not only
topological interactions between users, but spatial interactions as well. The
defining property of spatial networks is that edge distances are associated
with a cost, which may subtly influence the topology of the network. However,
the cost function over distance is rarely known, thus developing a model of
connections in spatial networks is a difficult task.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel model for capturing the interaction
between spatial effects and network structure. Our approach represents a unique
combination of ideas from latent variable statistical models and spatial
network modeling. In contrast to previous work, we view the ability to form
long/short-distance connections to be dependent on the individual nodes
involved. For example, a node's specific surroundings (e.g. network structure
and node density) may make it more likely to form a long distance link than
other nodes with the same degree. To capture this information, we attach a
latent variable to each node which represents a node's spatial reach. These
variables are inferred from the network structure using a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo algorithm.
  We experimentally evaluate our proposed model on 4 different types of
real-world spatial networks (e.g. transportation, biological, infrastructure,
and social). We apply our model to the task of link prediction and achieve up
to a 35% improvement over previous approaches in terms of the area under the
ROC curve. Additionally, we show that our model is particularly helpful for
predicting links between nodes with low degrees. In these cases, we see much
larger improvements over previous models.

peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) problem. Recently, many researchers have
concentrated on reducing the computational complexity of the SLM schemes. One
of the low complexity SLM schemes is the Class III SLM scheme which uses only
one inverse fast fourier transform (IFFT) operation for generating one
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal sequence. By selecting
rotations and cyclic shifts randomly, it can generate $N^3$ alternative OFDM
signal sequences, where $N$ is the FFT size. But this selection can not
guarantee the optimal PAPR reduction performances. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a simple deterministic cyclic shifts selection method which is optimal
in case of having low variance of correlation coefficient between two
alternative OFDM signal sequences. And we show that cyclic shifts are highly
dependent on the PAPR reduction performance than rotations. For small FFT size
and the number of alternative signal sequences is close to $N/8$, simulation
results show that the proposed scheme can achieve better PAPR reduction
performance than the Class III SLM scheme.

simulating molecular dynamics of Indonesian grown herbal compounds show
sufficient speed up on 32 n odes Cluster computing environment. In order to
obtain a reliable simulation, one usually needs to run the experiment on the
scale of hundred nodes. But this is expensive to develop and maintain. Since
the invention of Graphical Processing Units that is also useful for general
programming, many applications have been developed to run on this. This paper
reports our experiments that evaluate the performance of GROMACS that runs on
two different environment, Cluster computing resources and GPU based PCs. We
run the experiment on BRV-1 and REM2 compounds. Four different GPUs are
installed on the same type of PCs of quad cores; they are Gefore GTS 250, GTX
465, GTX 470 and Quadro 4000. We build a cluster of 16 nodes based on these
four quad cores PCs. The preliminary experiment shows that those run on GTX 470
is the best among the other type of GPUs and as well as the cluster computing
resource. A speed up around 11 and 12 is gained, while the cost of computer
with GPU is only about 25 percent that of Cluster we built.

ring of the planet host star. We identify 4 possible solutions resulting from
the well-known close/wide degeneracy. By measuring both the lens parallax and
the Einstein radius, we estimate the physical parameters of the planetary
system. According to the best-fit model, the two planet masses are ~0.11
M_Jupiter and 0.68 M_Jupiter and they are orbiting a G-type main sequence star
with a mass ~0.82 M_Sun. The projected separations of the individual planets
are beyond the snow line in all four solutions, being ~3.8 AU and 4.6 AU in the
best-fit solution. The deprojected separations are both individually larger and
possibly reversed in order. This is the second multi-planet system with both
planets beyond the snow line discovered by microlensing. This is the only such
a system (other than the Solar System) with measured planet masses without
sin(i) degeneracy. The planetary system is located at a distance 4.1 kpc from

correct, it will be possible to obtain detailed information about the
planet-host star from follow-up observation.

those composed of faint or dark objects. However, accurate analysis of
binary-lens light curves is often hampered by the well-known degeneracy between
close (s<1) and wide (s>1) binaries, which can be very severe due to an
intrinsic symmetry in the lens equation. Here s is the normalized projected
binary separation. In this paper, we propose a method that can resolve the
close/wide degeneracy using the effect of a lens orbital motion on lensing
light curves. The method is based on the fact that the orbital effect tends to
be important for close binaries while it is negligible for wide binaries. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the method by applying it to an actually observed
binary-lens event MOA-2011-BLG-040/OGLE-2011-BLG-0001, which suffers from
severe close/wide degeneracy. From this, we are able to uniquely specify that

provides a promising way for hydrogen storage, in which the van der Waals (vdW)
interaction plays an important role but cannot described by the density
functional theory (DFT). By using the vdW density functional (vdW-DF) method,
we investigate systematically the binding energies of hydrogen molecules in
MOF-5 crystal. We first examine the accuracy of this methodology by comparing
its results with those from the correlated quantum chemistry methods for
several fragment models cut out from the crystal. Good comparable accuracy is
found. By performing calculations for the true crystal structure adsorbing one
or multiple H$_2$ in the primitive cell, we show that these fragment models
which have been focused previously cannot represent well the property of the
crystal which cannot, however, be dealt with by the quantum chemistry methods.
It is found that the binding energy with the organic linker is much smaller
than with the metal oxide corner, which limits the H$_2$ loading. We show that
this can be improved significantly (from 5.50 to 10.39 kJ/mol) by replacing the
H atoms of the organic linker with F atoms which cause extra electrostatic
interaction.

  Betweenness","13 pages, 5 figures",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a novel, well-founded, betweenness measure, called the
Bag-of-Paths (BoP) betweenness, as well as its extension, the BoP group
betweenness, to tackle semisupervised classification problems on weighted
directed graphs. The objective of semi-supervised classification is to assign a
label to unlabeled nodes using the whole topology of the graph and the labeled
nodes at our disposal. The BoP betweenness relies on a bag-of-paths framework
assigning a Boltzmann distribution on the set of all possible paths through the
network such that long (high-cost) paths have a low probability of being picked
from the bag, while short (low-cost) paths have a high probability of being
picked. Within that context, the BoP betweenness of node j is defined as the
sum of the a posteriori probabilities that node j lies in-between two arbitrary
nodes i, k, when picking a path starting in i and ending in k. Intuitively, a
node typically receives a high betweenness if it has a large probability of
appearing on paths connecting two arbitrary nodes of the network. This quantity
can be computed in closed form by inverting a n x n matrix where n is the
number of nodes. For the group betweenness, the paths are constrained to start
and end in nodes within the same class, therefore defining a group betweenness
for each class. Unlabeled nodes are then classified according to the class
showing the highest group betweenness. Experiments on various real-world data
sets show that BoP group betweenness outperforms all the tested state
of-the-art methods. The benefit of the BoP betweenness is particularly
noticeable when only a few labeled nodes are available.

Markovian partially observed system (X,Y), whose dynamics is modeled by

sigma-algebra generated by the observation process Y provides all the available
information about the signal X. The central goal of stochastic filtering is to
characterize the filter which is the conditional distribution of X, given the
observed data. It has been proved in Ceci-Colaneri (2012) that the filter is
the unique probability measure-valued process satisfying a nonlinear stochastic
equation, the so-called Kushner-Stratonovich equation (KS-equation). In this
paper the aim is to describe the filter in terms of the unnormalized filter,
which is solution to a linear stochastic differential equation, called the
Zakai equation. We prove equivalence between strong uniqueness for the solution
to the Kushner Stratonovich equation and strong uniqueness for the solution to
the Zakai one and, as a consequence, we deduce pathwise uniqueness for the
solutions to the Zakai equation by applying the Filtered Martingale Problem

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/760/2/137",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Strong shocks propagating into a partially ionized medium are often
associated with optical Balmer lines. This emission is due to impact excitation
of neutral hydrogen by hot protons and electrons in the shocked gas. The
structure of such Balmer-dominated shocks has been computed in a previous paper
(Blasi et al. 2012), where the distribution function of neutral particles was
derived from the appropriate Boltzmann equation including coupling with ions
and electrons through charge exchange and ionization. This calculation showed
how the presence of neutrals can significantly modify the shock structure
through the formation of a ""neutral-induced"" precursor ahead of the shock. Here
we follow up on our previous work and investigate the properties of the
resulting Balmer emission, with the aim of using the observed radiation as a
diagnostic tool for shock parameters. Our main focus is on Supernova Remnant
shocks, and we find that, for typical parameters, the H{\alpha} emission
typically has a three-component spectral profile, where: 1) a narrow component
originates from upstream cold hydrogen atoms, 2) a broad component comes from
hydrogen atoms that have undergone charge exchange with shocked protons
downstream of the shock, and 3) an intermediate component is due to hydrogen
atoms that have undergone charge exchange with warm protons in the
neutral-induced precursor. The width of the intermediate line reflects the
temperature in the precursor, while the width of the narrow one is left
unaltered by the precursor. In addition, we show that the profiles of both the
intermediate and broad components generally depart from a thermal distribution.
Finally, we show that a significant amount of Balmer emission can be produced
in the precursor region if efficient electron heating takes place.

four qubits system composed of two single-mode cavities and two two-level atoms
is investigated. The transfer of single and double excitation states is
discussed for two different coupling configurations between the qubits. In the
first, the coupling is mediated by the atoms that simultaneously couple to the
cavity modes. In the second configuration, each atom resides inside one of the
cavities and the coupling between the cavities is mediated by the overlapping
field modes. A proper choice of basis states allows to identify states that
could be completely transferred between themselves. Simple expressions are
derived for the conditions for the complete transfer of quantum states and
entanglement. These conditions impose severe constraints on the evolution of
the system in the form of constants of motion. The constrains on the evolution
of the system imply that not all states can evolve in time, and we find that
the evolution of the entire system can be confined into that occurring among
two states only. Detailed analysis show that in the case where the interaction
is mediated by the atoms, only symmetric superposition states can be completely
and reversibly transferred between the atoms and the cavity modes. In the case
where the interaction is mediated by the overlapping field modes, both
symmetric and antisymmetric superposition states can be completely transferred.
We also show that the system is capable to generate purely photonic NOON
states, but only if the coupling is mediated by the atoms, and demonstrate that
the ability to generate the NOON states relies on perfect transfer of an
entanglement from the atoms to the cavity modes.

resource consuming process. Moreover, most of the methods consider that a node
will have same reputation with all the nodes in the network, which is not true.
This paper proposes a reputation aggregation algorithm that uses a variant of
gossip algorithm called differential gossip. In this paper, estimate of
reputation is considered to be having two parts, one common component which is
same with every node, and the other one is information received from immediate
neighbours based on the neighbours' direct interaction with the node. The
differential gossip is fast and requires less amount of resources. This
mechanism allows computation of independent reputation value by a node, of
every other node in the network, for each node. The differential gossip trust
has been investigated for a power law network formed using preferential
attachment \emph{(PA)} Model. The reputation computed using differential gossip
trust shows good amount of immunity to the collusion. We have verified the
performance of the algorithm on the power law networks of different sizes
ranging from 100 nodes to 50,000 nodes.

is mainly redshifted: the dynamical center of the gas differs from the black
hole position and the maximum of optical emission, and only the red-shifted
side is seen in our data. (2) Several velocity components are detected in some
lines of sight.
  Our interpretation is supported by the reanalysis of the effect of dust on a
complete planetary nebula sample. Two dust components are detected with
respective position angles of 37 deg and -66 deg. This is compatible with the
superposition of the (PA=37 deg) disk dominated by the 10-kpc ring and the
inner 0.7-kpc ring detected in infrared data, which position angle (-66 deg)
can be measured for the first time. The large scale disk, which dominates the

sight on the less inclined inner ring. The detected CO emission might come from
both components.

heavy-ion collisions is often thought of as a phenomenon affecting a hard near
on-shell parton and hence treated as partonic energy loss, a more realistic
view is to think of the medium effect as a relatively small correction to the
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) vacuum radiation pattern which reduces the initial
high virtuality of hard partons and leads to the development of a shower. The
uncertainty relation can be used to argue that a significant part of this
shower is developed even before a medium can be formed. The initial virtuality
of a shower-initiating parton is reflected in the final state in the measured
invariant mass of a jet - high mass jets are characterized by more branchings,
higher multiplicity and a wider angular structure. Since most of this structure
is determined before the medium affects the jet, selecting a particular jet
mass range strongly biases the partonic configuration that enters the medium,
and thus the medium is expected to modify high mass jets more strongly than low
mass jets. In this work, this scenario is explored using the in-medium shower
evolution code YaJEM and a possible strategy for a measurement is suggested.

gamma-ray and the radio flux density reached their historical peak.
Multiwavelength analysis shows a rotation of about 380 deg of the optical
polarization angle close in time with the rapid and strong gamma-ray flare in
2011 July. An enhancement of the optical emission and an increase of the
fractional polarization both in the optical and in radio bands is observed

in the millimeter regime followed with some time delay at centimeter down to
decimeter wavelengths. This radio flare is characterized by a rising and a
decaying stage, in agreement with the formation of a shock and its evolution,

in the vicinty of V838 Mon and are believed to be at the same distance as V838
Mon. We used the V838 Mon light echo images obtained by the Hubble Space

total brightness of the echo and its surface brightness. The results of the

to estimate the optical thickness of the matter in front of the object and the

The optical thickness of the echoing matter is not sufficient to explain the
observed difference in brightness between the B-type companion of V838 Mon and

signal-to-noise spectra have been obtained for 12 novae after the outburst in
the last 13 years with the Chandra and XMM-Newton gratings.
  They offer the only way to probe the temperature, effective gravity and
chemical composition of the hydrogen burning white dwarf before it turns off.
These spectra also allow an analysis of the ejecta, which can be photoionized
by the hot white dwarf, but more often seem to undergo collisional ionization.
  The long observations required for the gratings have revealed semi-regular
and irregular variability in X-ray flux and spectra. Large short term
variability is especially evident in the first weeks after the ejecta have
become transparent to the central supersoft X-ray source. Thanks to Chandra and
XMM-Newton, we have discovered violent phenomena in the ejecta, discrete shell
ejection, and clumpy emission regions.
  As expected, we have also unveiled the white dwarf characteristics. The peak
white dwarf effective temperature in the targets of our samples varies between
~400,000 K and over a million K, with most cases closer to the upper end,
although for two novae only upper limits around 200,000 K were obtained. A
combination of results from different X-ray satellites and instruments,
including Swift and ROSAT, shows that the shorter is the supersoft X-ray phase,
the lower is the white dwarf peak effective temperature, consistently with
theoretical predictions. The peak temperature is also inversely correlated with
t(2) the time for a decay by 2 mag in optical. I strongly advocate the use of
white dwarf atmospheric models to obtain a coherent physical picture of the
hydrogen burning process and of the surrounding ejecta.

Schauder basis (f_m) such that the generator is a Schauder multiplier

studied. A heavy singlet neutrino superfield acts as the source for (s)lepton
asymmetry and by coupling to the singlet DM superfield it produces a DM
particle density through decays. The nature of DM generated is twofold
depending on whether the Yukawa and DM couplings are either small or large.
With sufficiently small Yukawa and DM couplings DM annihilations into MSSM
particles are slow and as a consequence all DM particles form the DM component.
The solutions to Boltzmann equations are given and the dependence between the
DM masses and coupling are presented in this weak coupling regime. Also, the
behavior of the efficiency of producing asymmetric DM is determined with weak
couplings. We note that a different outcome arises if the couplings are larger
because then the ADM component is dominant due to the effectiveness of DM
decays into the MSSM sector.

topography technique. We show that the spatial distribution of the source of
groundwater can significantly impact the shape of observed patterns. An
elongated channel is observed to grow upstream when groundwater is injected at
a boundary adjacent to a reservoir held at constant height. An amphitheater
(semi-circular) shape is observed when uniform rainfall infiltrates the
granular bed to maintain a water table. Bifurcations are observed as the
channels grow in response to the ground water. We further find that the
channels grow by discrete avalanches as the height of the granular bed is
increased above the capillary rise, causing the deeper channels to have rougher
fronts. The spatio-temporal distribution of avalanches increase with bed height
when partial saturation of the bed leads to cohesion between grains. However,
the overall shape of the channels is observed to remain unaffected indicating
that seepage erosion is robust to perturbation of the erosion front.

higher efficiency than in MW-like spirals. We have investigated in detail the
turbulent-driven regime of star-formation in nearby colliding galaxies
combining high resolution VLA B array HI maps and UV GALEX observations. With
these data, we could check predictions of our state-of-the-art simulations of
mergers, such as the global sharp increase of the fraction of dense gas, as
traced by the SFR, with respect to the diffuse gas traced by HI during the
merging stage, following the increased velocity dispersion of the gas. We
present here initial results obtained studying the SFR-HI relation at 4.5 kpc
resolution. We determined SFR/HI mass ratios that are higher in the external
regions of mergers than in the outskirts of isolated spirals, though both
environments are HI dominated. SFR/HI increases towards the central regions
following the decrease of the atomic gas fraction and possibly the increased
star-formation efficiency. These results need to be checked with a larger
sample of systems and on smaller spatial scales. This is the goal of the
on-going Chaotic THINGS project that ultimately will allow us to determine why

that the mass ratio of the system is q=0.71(0.02), while the inclination of the
system (i) is 38.45(0.22) deg. Taking the primary component's temperature as
7420(192) K, we found that the temperature of the secondary is 6232(161) K. The
mass of the primary component was found to be 1.74(0.05) Msun, while it is
1.23(0.01) Msun for the secondary. The primary component's radius was found to
be 2.10(0.05) Rsun, while it was found as 1.80(0.01) Rsun for the secondary.
Revealing that the system should not exhibit any eclipses, we demonstrated that
the main variation with large amplitude should be caused due to the ellipsoidal
effect. Indeed, the Fourier analysis also supported the result. For the first
time in the literature, we revealed that the primary component is a delta Scuti
star. The period of pulsation was found to be 58.482(0.002), 58.482(0.001),
60.966(0.002), 60.964(0.003) minutes in BVRI bands, respectively. We plotted
V1464 Aql in the plane of log(Porb)-log(Ppulse). Using more than 160 binaries,
whose one or both components are pulsating, we derived a new linear fit in the
plane of log(Porb)-log(Ppulse) for each type binary. Using the linear fit of
each group, we obtained new calibrations between log(Porb) and log(Ppulse) for
different type pulsating stars. In addition, a calibration has been obtained
for the first time for the pulsating stars from the spectral types O and B.
V1464 Aql seems to be located near the other ellipsoidal and close binaries.
Thus, we listed V1464 Aql as a new candidate for the ellipsoidal variables with
a delta Scuti component.

microcanical measure can be constructed from first principles. This measure is
defined through finite-dimensional approximations and a limiting procedure.
Creutz's algorithm is a microcanonical generalization of the Metropolis-Hasting
algorithm (to sample Gibbs measures, in the canonical ensemble). We prove that
Creutz's algorithm can sample finite-dimensional approximations of the 2D Euler
microcanonical measures (incorporating fixed energy and other invariants). This
is essential as microcanonical and canonical measures are known to be
inequivalent at some values of energy and vorticity distribution. Creutz's
algorithm is used to check predictions from the mean-field statistical
mechanics theory of the 2D Euler equations (the Robert-Sommeria-Miller theory).
We found full agreement with theory. Three different ways to compute the
temperature give consistent results. Using Creutz's algorithm, a first-order
phase transition never observed previously, and a situation of statistical
ensemble inequivalence are found and studied. Strikingly, and contrasting usual
statistical mechanics interpretations, this phase transition appears from a
disordered phase to an ordered phase (with less symmetries) when energy is
increased. We explain this paradox.

a natural graph class that generalizes both interval and permutation graphs,
namely \emph{simple-triangle} graphs. Simple-triangle graphs - also known as
\emph{PI} graphs (for Point-Interval) - are the intersection graphs of
triangles that are defined by a point on a line $L_{1}$ and an interval on a
parallel line $L_{2}$. They lie naturally between permutation and trapezoid
graphs, which are the intersection graphs of line segments between $L_{1}$ and
$L_{2}$ and of trapezoids between $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, respectively. Although
various efficient recognition algorithms for permutation and trapezoid graphs
are well known to exist, the recognition of simple-triangle graphs has remained
an open problem since their introduction by Corneil and Kamula three decades
ago. In this paper we resolve this problem by proving that simple-triangle
graphs can be recognized in polynomial time. As a consequence, our algorithm
also solves a longstanding open problem in the area of partial orders, namely
the recognition of \emph{linear-interval orders}, i.e. of partial orders
$P=P_{1}\cap P_{2}$, where $P_{1}$ is a linear order and $P_{2}$ is an interval
order. This is one of the first results on recognizing partial orders $P$ that
are the intersection of orders from two different classes $\mathcal{P}_{1}$ and
$\mathcal{P}_{2}$. In complete contrast to this, partial orders $P$ which are
the intersection of orders from the same class $\mathcal{P}$ have been

considered in any computations of stellar models. In solar-type and cooler
stars, this process is dominated by gravitational settling, which is now
included in most stellar evolution codes. In hotter stars, radiative
accelerations compete with gravity and become the dominant ingredient in the
diffusion flux for most heavy elements. Introducing radiative accelerations
into the computations of stellar models modifies the internal element
distribution and may have major consequences on the stellar structure. Coupling
these processes with hydrodynamical stellar motions has important consequences
that need to be investigated in detail. We aim to include the computations of
radiative accelerations in a stellar evolution code (here the TGEC code) using
a simplified method (SVP) so that it may be coupled with sophisticated
macroscopic motions. We also compare the results with those of the Montreal
code in specific cases for validation and study the consequences of these
coupled processes on accurate models of A- and early-type stars. We implemented
radiative accelerations computations into the Toulouse-Geneva stellar evolution
code following the semi-analytical prescription proposed by Alecian and
LeBlanc. This allows more rapid computations than the full description used in
the Montreal code. We present results for A-type stellar models computed with
this updated version of TGEC and compare them with similar published models
obtained with the Montreal evolution code. We discuss the consequences for the
coupling with macroscopic motions, including thermohaline convection.

properties in the terrestrial magnetosphere. We investigate the

RE. The results are based on seven years of ion flux measurements in the energy
range ~10 keV to ~955 keV from the RAPID and CIS instruments on board the
Cluster satellites. We find that (1) hydrogen ions at ~10 keV show only a
slight correlation with the geomagnetic conditions and interplanetary magnetic
field changes. They are best correlated with the solar wind dynamic pressure
and density, which is an expected effect of the magnetospheric compression; (2)
~10 keV O+ ion intensities are more strongly affected during disturbed phase of
a geomagnetic storm or substorm than >274 keV O+ ion intensities, relative to
the corresponding hydrogen intensities; (3) In contrast to ~10 keV ions, the
>274 keV O+ ions show the strongest acceleration during growth phase and not
during the expansion phase itself. This suggests a connection between the
energy input to the magnetosphere and the effective energization of energetic
ions during growth phase; (4) The ratio between quiet and disturbed times for
the intensities of ion ionospheric outflow is similar to those observed in the
near-Earth magnetosphere at >274 keV. Therefore, the increase of the energetic
ion intensity during disturbed time is more likely due to the intensification
than to the more effective acceleration of the ionospheric source. In
conclusion, the energization process in the near-Earth magnetosphere is mass
dependent and it is more effective for the heavier ions.

rare clusters, which allows the question to be answered. We define three
statistical measures, each of which are sensitive to changes in cluster
populations arising from different modifications to the cosmological model. We
also use these properties to define the 'equivalent mass at redshift zero' for
a cluster --- the mass of an equally unusual cluster today. This quantity is
independent of the observational survey in which the cluster was found, which
makes it an ideal proxy for ranking the relative unusualness of clusters
detected by different surveys. These methods are then used on a comprehensive
sample of observed galaxy clusters and we confirm that all are less than
2-sigma deviations from the Lambda-CDM expectation. Whereas we have only
applied our method to galaxy clusters, it is applicable to any isolated,
collapsed, halo. As motivation for future surveys, we also calculate where in
the mass redshift plane the rarest halo is most likely to be found, giving
information as to which objects might be the most fruitful in the search for
new physics.

produce large, thick, or complex structural parts. They are based on the resin
flow induced, across its thickness, by a pressure applied onto a preform/resin
stacking. However, both thickness and fiber volume fraction of the final piece
are not well controlled since they result from complex mechanisms which drive
the transient mechanical equilibrium leading to the final geometrical
configuration. In order to optimize both design and manufacturing parameters,
but also to monitor the LRI process, an isothermal numerical model has been
developed which describes the mechanical interaction between the deformations
of the porous medium and the resin flow during infusion.1, 2 With this
numerical model, it is possible to investigate the LRI process of classical
industrial part shapes. To validate the numerical model, first in 2D, and to
improve the knowledge of the LRI process, this study details a comparison
between numerical simulations and an experimental study of a plate infusion
test carried out by LRI process under industrial conditions. From the numerical
prediction, the filling time, the resin mass and the thickness of the preform
can be determined. On another hand, the resin flow and the preform response can
be monitored by experimental methods during the filling stage. One key issue of
this research study is to highlight the changes in major process parameters
during the resin infusion stage, such as the temperature of the preform and
resin, and the variations of both thickness and fiber volume fraction of the
preform. Moreover, this numerical/experimental approach is the best way to
improve our knowledge on the resin infusion processes, and finally, to develop
simulation tools for the design of advanced composite parts.

investigation of the magnetic properties of buried layers. Angular

about 60 deg were recorded in parallel to the energy distribution. Depending on
purpose, energy and angular resolutions of 150 to 250 meV and 0.17 to 2 deg can
be accomplished simultaneously in such experiments. Experiments were performed
on exchange-biased magnetic layers covered by thin oxide films. More
specifically, the angular distribution of photoelectrons from the ferromagnetic
layer Co2FeAl layer grown on MnIr exchange-biasing layer was investigated where
the magnetic structure is buried beneath a MgO layer. Pronounced magnetic
dichroism is found in the Co and Fe 2p states for all angles of emission. A
slightly increased magnetic dichroism was observed for normal emission in
agreement with theoretical considerations.

obtain violations of normal FRs, which we call anomalous FRs. We derive them in

mixtures. The problem is to design the transfer matrix H so as to minimize the
mean square error (MSE) when estimating x from y. This problem has important
applications, but faces at least three hurdles. Firstly, even for a fixed H,
the minimum MSE (MMSE) has no analytical form. Secondly, the MMSE is generally
not convex in H. Thirdly, derivatives of the MMSE w.r.t. H are hard to obtain.
This paper casts the problem as a stochastic program and invokes gradient
methods. The study is motivated by two applications in signal processing. One
concerns the choice of error-reducing precoders; the other deals with selection
of pilot matrices for channel estimation. In either setting, our numerical
results indicate improved estimation accuracy - markedly better than those
obtained by optimal design based on standard linear estimators. Some
implications of the non-convexities of the MMSE are noteworthy, yet, to our
knowledge, not well known. For example, there are cases in which more pilot
power is detrimental for channel estimation. This paper explains why.

coordination and decision making in multi-agent systems. In particular, average
consensus plays a key role in a number of applications and is closely
associated with two classes of digraphs, weight-balanced (for continuous-time
systems) and bistochastic (for discrete-time systems). A weighted digraph is
called balanced if, for each node, the sum of the weights of the edges outgoing
from that node is equal to the sum of the weights of the edges incoming to that
node. In addition, a weight-balanced digraph is bistochastic if all weights are
nonnegative and, for each node, the sum of weights of edges incoming to that
node and the sum of the weights of edges out-going from that node is unity;
this implies that the corresponding weight matrix is column and row stochastic
(i.e., doubly stochastic). We propose two distributed algorithms: one solves
the weight-balance problem and the other solves the bistochastic matrix
formation problem for a distributed system whose components (nodes) can
exchange information via interconnection links (edges) that form an arbitrary,
possibly directed, strongly connected communication topology (digraph). Both
distributed algorithms achieve their goals asymptotically and operate
iteratively by having each node adapt the (nonnegative) weights on its outgoing
edges based on the weights of its incoming links (i.e., based on purely local
information). We also provide examples to illustrate the operation,
performance, and potential advantages of the proposed algorithms.

the evolution of entanglement spectra, a ""projected subspace"" block entropy,
and concurrence in the Schmidt vectors through the transition. The standard
tool of Schmidt decomposition along with the existence of the unique MG point
where the ground states are degenerate and known exactly, suggests the
projection into two orthogonal subspaces that is useful even away from this
point. Of these, one is a dominant five dimensional subspace containing the
complete state at the MG point and the other contributes marginally, albeit
with increasing weight as the number of spins is increased. We find that the
marginally contributing subspace has a minimum von Neumann entropy in the
vicinity of the dimerization transition. Entanglement content between pairs of
spins in the Schmidt vectors, studied via concurrence, shows that those
belonging to the dominant five dimensional subspace display a clear progress
towards dimerization, with the concurrence vanishing on odd/even sublattices,
again in the vicinity of the dimerization, and maximizing in the even/odd
sublattices at the MG point. In contrast, study of the Schmidt vectors in the
marginally contributing subspace, as well as in the projection of the ground
state in this space, display pair concurrence which decrease on both the

the intranight optical variability (INOV) characteristics of these \gamma-ray
loud NLSy1 galaxies, we have carried out optical flux monitoring observations
of three NLSy1 galaxies detected by {\it Fermi}/LAT: 1H 0323+342, PMN
J0948+0022 and PKS 1502+036. These optical monitoring observations showed the
presence of rapid optical flux variations in these sources. The intranight
differential light curves of these sources have revealed flux variations on
time scales of hours with amplitudes of variability > 3 percent for most of the
time. On using the {\it F}-statistics to classify the variability nature of
these sources, we obtained a duty cycle (DC) of INOV of ~85 percent.
Alternatively, the more commonly used {\it C}-statistics gave a DC of INOV of
~57 percent. Such high DC of INOV are characteristics of the BL Lac class of
AGN. The results of our monitoring observations thus indicate that there is
similarity in the INOV nature of \gamma-ray loud NLSy1 galaxies and BL Lac
objects, arguing strongly for the presence of relativistic jets aligned closely
to the observers line of sight. Moreover, our dense monitoring observations on
some of the nights have led to the clear detection of some mini-flares
superimposed on the flux variations during the night over timescales as short
as 12 minutes. The detection of short timescale flux variability in the sources
studied here is clearly due to stronger time compression leading to the jets in
these sources having large Doppler factors, similar to that of the inner jets
of TeV blazars.

Large Area Telescope, searches in gamma-rays have reached sensitivities that
allow to probe the most interesting parameter space of the weakly interacting

accompanied by a number of detection claims or indications, the most recent
being the claim of a line feature at a dark matter particle mass of $\sim$ 130
GeV at the Galactic Centre, a claim which requires confirmation from the
Fermi-LAT collaboration and other experiments, for example HESS II or the
planned Gamma-400 satellite. Predictions for the next generation air Cherenkov
telescope, Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), together with forecasts on future
Fermi-LAT constraints arrive at the exciting possibility that the cosmological
benchmark cross-section could be probed from masses of a few GeV to a few TeV.
Consequently, non-detection would pose a challenge to the WIMP paradigm, but
the reached sensitivities also imply that --optimistically-- a detection is in
the cards.

deep layers near the minimum of H- absorption. We find that a radiative
equilibrium stratification yields the best compromise between continuum and C I

photospheric flux ratio by down-scaling the monochromatic photospheric flux
with the umbral contrast for each frequency. The thus obtained monochromatic
umbral flux and the photospheric one are integratied over the whole frequency
range, yielding the ratio of total umbral and photospheric flux, which gives
3560 K < T_eff < 3780 K. We assume for our model M3 T_eff=3750 K and fit M3 to
the theoretical model by Meyer et al. (1974). Comparison of the model's 'nabla'

all, can only occur at considerably deeper layers than in the photosphere.

idempotent algebra A and a coproduct $\Delta$ on A. The coproduct is a
coassociative homomorphism from A to the multiplier algebra M(A\otimes A) with
some natural extra properties (like the existence of a counit). Further we
impose extra but natural conditions on the ranges and the kernels of the
canonical maps T_1 and T_2 defined from A\otimes A to M(A\otimes A) by
T_1(a\otimes b)=\Delta(a)(1\otimes b) and T_2(a\ot b)=(a\otimes 1)\Delta(b).
  The first condition is about the ranges of these maps. It is assumed that
there exists an idempotent element E\in M(A\otimes A) such that \Delta(A)(1\ot
A)=E(A\ot A) and (A\otimes 1)\Delta(A)=(A\otimes A)E. The second condition
determines the behavior of the coproduct on the legs of E. We require
(\Delta\otimes \iota)(E)=(\iota\otimes\Delta)(E)=(1\otimes E)(E\ot 1)=(E\otimes
1)(1\otimes E) where $\iota$ is the identity map and where $\Delta\otimes
\iota$ and $\iota\otimes\Delta$ are extensions to the multipier algebra
M(A\otimes A). Finally, the last condition determines the kernels of the
canonical maps T_1 and T_2 in terms of this idempotent E by a very specific
relation.
  From these conditions we develop the theory. In particular, we construct a
unique antipode satisfying the expected properties and various other data.
Special attention is given to the regular case (that is when the antipode is
bijective) and the case of a *-algebra (where regularity is automatic).
  Weak Hopf algebras are special cases of such weak multiplier Hopf algebras.
Conversely, if the underlying algebra of a (regular) weak multiplier Hopf
algebra has an identity, it is a weak Hopf algebra. Also any groupoid, finite
or not, yields two weak multiplier Hopf algebras in duality.

tunneling process of the black hole radiation, we interestingly find that the
most qualified candidate for a universal area gap in the tunneling mechanism is
$\gamma=8\pi$. First, we develop the Banerjee's treatment and the Kunstatter's
conjecture to revisit the black hole spectroscopy via quantum tunneling, and
find for a real tunneling process, the area spacing parameter is given by the
possible value $\gamma\geq 4$. That is, the previous model-dependent area
spacing parameters, i.e. $\gamma=8\pi, 4\ln 3, 4$, are all possible in the

characteristic of the transition is a divergence of the thermopower, according
to an inverse linear law, as a critical value of the electron density is
approached. A scaling description of this transition yields predictions about
the critical behavior of other observables, e.g., the specific heat. We also
explore the possibility that this transition realizes a recently predicted
transition from a Fermi liquid to a non-Fermi-liquid state.

Combining this idea with the cavity field technique, which aims to measure the

write a stochastic stability approach to diluted mean field spin glasses which
explicitly gives overlap constraints as the outcome. We then show that, under
minimal mathematical assumptions and for gauge invariant systems (namely those
with even Ising interactions), it is possible to ""reverse"" the idea of

unperturbed quenched Gibbs measure. This paper extends a previous study where
we showed how to derive (linear) polynomial identities from the ""energy""
contribution to the free energy, while here we focus on the consequences of
""entropic"" constraints. Interestingly, in diluted spin glasses, the entropic

formation becomes difficult at the transition from the oxygen rich chemistry of
M-stars to the carbon rich chemistry of C-stars. In the intermediate type
S-stars oxygen and carbon are consumed by CO and SiO molecule formation, and
left-over oxygen to build the SiO4-tetrahedra of silicates becomes scarce. Then
SiO molecules may directly condense into solid SiO. The IR absorption spectrum
of solid SiO differs from that of silicates by the absence of Si-O-Si bending
modes at 18 mum while the absorption by Si-O bond stretching modes at 10 mum is
present. Such characteristics are observed in a number of S-star spectra. We
suggest that this observation may be explained by formation of solid SiO as a
major dust component at C/O abundance ratios close to unity. We determine the
IR absorption properties of solid SiO by laboratory transmission measurements
of thin SiO films produced by vapour deposition on a Si(111) wafer. From the
measured spectra the dielectric function of SiO is derived. The results are
used in model calculations of radiative transfer in circumstellar dust shells
with solid SiO dust. Comparison of synthetic and observed spectra shows that
reasonable agreement is obtained between the main spectral characteristics of
emission bands due to solid SiO and an emission band centred on 10 mum, but
without accompanying 18 mum band, observed in some S-stars. We propose that
solid SiO is the carrier material of this 10 mum spectral feature.

potential contributors to the initiation and prorogation of eruptive events. A
magnetic parameter named decay index (i.e., the coronal magnetic gradient of
the overlying fields above the eruptive flux ropes) could play an important
role in controlling kinematics of eruptions. Previous studies have identified a
threshold range of the decay index that distinguishes between eruptive and
confined configurations. Here we advance the study by investigating if there is
a clear correlation between the decay index and CME speed. 38 CMEs associated
with filament eruptions and/or two-ribbon flares are selected using the Halpha
data from the Global Halpha Network. The filaments and flare ribbons observed
in Halpha associated with the CMEs help to locate the magnetic polarity
inversion line, along which the decay index is calculated based on the
potential field extrapolation using MDI magnetograms as boundary conditions.
The speeds of CMEs are obtained from the LASCO C2 CME catalog available online.
We find that the mean decay index increases with CME speed for those CMEs with
a speed below 1000 km/s, and stays flat around 2.2 for the CMEs with higher
speeds. In addition, we present a case study of a partial filament eruption, in

for these reunion probabilities for finite N using a Fermionic path integral
technique. We then analyse the asymptotic behavior of this reunion probability
for large N using two complementary techniques: (i) a saddle point analysis of
the underlying Coulomb gas and (ii) orthogonal polynomial method. These two
methods are complementary in the sense that they work in two different regimes,
respectively for L\ll O(\sqrt{N}) and L\geq O(\sqrt{N}). A striking feature of
the large N limit of the reunion probability in the three models is that it
exhibits a third-order phase transition when the system size L crosses a
critical value L=L_c(N)\sim \sqrt{N}. This transition is akin to the
Douglas-Kazakov transition in two-dimensional continuum Yang-Mills theory.
While the central part of the reunion probability, for L \sim L_c(N), is
described in terms of the Tracy-Widom distributions (associated to GOE and GUE
depending on the model), the emphasis of the present study is on the large
deviations of these reunion probabilities, both in the right [L \gg L_c(N)] and
the left [L \ll L_c(N)] tails. In particular, for model B, we find that the
matching between the different regimes corresponding to typical L \sim L_c(N)
and atypical fluctuations in the right tail L \gg L_c(N) is rather
unconventional, compared to the usual behavior found for the distribution of
the largest eigenvalue of GUE random matrices.

Interstellar Bands offer a unique probe of the diffuse, cool-warm gas in these
regions. The aim is to use DIBs as diagnostics of the local interstellar
conditions, whilst at the same time deriving properties of the yet-unknown
carriers. Spectra of over 800 early-type stars from the VLT Flames Tarantula
Survey (VFTS) were analysed. Maps were created, separately, for the Galactic
and LMC absorption in the DIBs at 4428 and 6614 Ang and - in a smaller region
near the central cluster R136 - neutral sodium (Na I D); we also measured the
DIBs at 5780 and 5797 Ang. The maps show strong 4428 and 6614 Ang DIBs in the
quiescent cloud complex to the south of 30 Dor but weak absorption in the
harsher environments to the north (bubbles) and near the OB associations. The
Na maps show at least five kinematic components in the LMC and a shell-like
structure surrounding R136, and small-scale structure in the Milky Way. The
strengths of the 4428, 5780, 5797 and 6614 Ang DIBs are correlated, also with
Na absorption and visual extinction. The strong 4428 Ang DIB is present already
at low Na column density but the 6614, 5780 and 5797 Ang DIBs start to be

the 5780 and 5797 Ang DIBs clearly confirm the Tarantula Nebula and Galactic
high-latitude gas to represent a harsh radiation environment. The resilience of
the 4428 Ang DIB suggests its carrier is large, compact and neutral. Structure
is detected in the distribution of cool-warm gas on scales between one and >100
pc in the LMC and as little as 0.01 pc in the Sun's vicinity. Stellar winds
from the central cluster R136 have created an expanding shell; some infalling

previous observations made by IRAS and Planck. The FIR luminosity density is
higher (factor of three) in Fornax compared to Virgo. The 100u (42.5-122.5u)
luminosity is two orders of magnitude larger in Fornax than in the local field
as measured by IRAS. Using stellar (L_{0.4-2.5}) and FIR (L_{100-500})
luminosities we estimate a mean optical depth of tau=0.4+/-0.1 - the same value
as Virgo. For 10 of the 11 galaxies (NGC1399 excepted) we fit a modified
blackbody curve (beta=2.0) to the SEDs to derive dust masses and temperatures

representation of the amplitude in the theory with the $\Delta$ presents a good
convergence from very low energies in the subthreshold region up to energies
well above threshold, leading also to a phenomenological description perfectly

strongly interacting quantum dot weakly coupled to two metallic contacts with
finite bias voltage. Within a kinetic equation approach, we identify
coefficients of response to the time-dependent external driving and relate
these to the concepts of charge and spin emissivities previously discussed
within the time-dependent scattering matrix approach. Expressed in terms of
auxiliary vector fields, the response coefficients allow for a straightforward
analysis of recently predicted interaction-induced pumping under periodic
modulation of the gate and bias voltage [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 226803 (2010)].
We perform a detailed study of this effect and the related adiabatic Coulomb
blockade spectroscopy, and, in particular, extend it to spin pumping. Analytic
formulas for the pumped charge and spin in the regimes of small and large
driving amplitude are provided for arbitrary bias. In the absence of a magnetic
field, we obtain a striking, simple relation between the pumped charge at zero
bias and at bias equal to the Coulomb charging energy. At finite magnetic
field, there is a possibility to have interaction-induced pure spin pumping at
this finite bias value, and generally, additional features appear in the pumped
charge. For large-amplitude adiabatic driving, the magnitude of both the pumped
charge and spin at the various resonances saturate at values which are
independent of the specific shape of the pumping cycle. Each of these values
provide an independent, quantitative measurement of the junction asymmetry.

We measure frequency shifts due to magnetic fields, side-features of

temperature-induced frequency shift is canceled to first order by the
pressure-induced shift from the crystal's helium-gas environment.

interference channel where the transmitters have perfect channel state
information and employ single-stream beamforming. The receivers are capable of
performing successive interference cancellation, so when the interfering signal
is strong enough, it can be decoded, treating the desired signal as noise, and
subtracted from the received signal, before the desired signal is decoded. We
propose efficient methods to compute the Pareto-optimal rate points and
corresponding beamforming vector pairs, by maximizing the rate of one link
given the rate of the other link. We do so by splitting the original problem
into four subproblems corresponding to the combinations of the receivers'
decoding strategies - either decode the interference or treat it as additive
noise. We utilize recently proposed parameterizations of the optimal
beamforming vectors to equivalently reformulate each subproblem as a
quasi-concave problem, which we solve very efficiently either analytically or
via scalar numerical optimization. The computational complexity of the proposed
methods is several orders-of-magnitude less than the complexity of the
state-of-the-art methods. We use the proposed methods to illustrate the effect
of the strength and spatial correlation of the channels on the shape of the
rate region.

squared norm. Additionally, we propose additional novel feature elimination
criteria that, while instead being in the soft-margin sense, too can utilize
data radius, utilizing previously published bound-related formulations for
approaching radius for the soft-margin sense, whereby e.g. a focus was on the
principle stated therein as ""finding a bound whose minima are in a region with
small leave-one-out values may be more important than its tightness"". These
additional criteria we propose combine radius utilization with a novel and
computationally low-cost soft-margin light classifier retraining approach we
devise named QP1; QP1 is the soft-margin alternative to the hard-margin LO. We
correct an error in the MFE-LO description, find MFE-LO achieves the highest
generalization accuracy among the previously published margin-based feature
elimination (MFE) methods, discuss some limitations of MFE-LO, and find our
novel methods herein outperform MFE-LO, attain lower test set classification
error rate. On several datasets that each both have a large number of features
and fall into the `large features few samples' dataset category, and on
datasets with lower (low-to-intermediate) number of features, our novel methods
give promising results. Especially, among our methods the tunable ones, that do
not employ (the non-tunable) LO approach, can be tuned more aggressively in the
future than herein, to aim to demonstrate for them even higher performance than
herein.

plasmas is proposed. It involves fast temporal modulation of a laser pulse on
the fastest instability's amplification time scale, adapting to changing and
unknown plasma conditions. These pulses are comprised of on and off sequences
having at least one or two orders of magnitude contrast between them. Such
laser illumination profiles are called STUD pulses for Spike Trains of Uneven
Duration and Delay. The STUD pulse program includes scrambling the speckle
patterns spatially in between the laser spikes. The off times allow damping of
driven waves. The scrambling of the hot spots allows tens of damping times to
elapse before hot spot locations experience recurring high intensity spikes.
Damping in the meantime will have healed the scars of past growth. Another
unique feature of STUD pulses on crossing beams is that their temporal profiles
can be interlaced or staggered, and their interactions thus controlled with an
on-off switch and a dimmer.

  Relationship between Structure and Coloring","114 pages, 120 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap
  with arXiv:0911.1587",,,,"math.GM math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Maximal planar graph refers to the planar graph with the most edges, which
means no more edges can be added so that the resulting graph is still planar.
The Four-Color Conjecture says that every planar graph without loops is
4-colorable. Indeed, in order to prove Four-Color Conjecture, it clearly
suffices to show that all maximal planar graphs are 4-colorable. Since this
conjecture was proposed in 1852, no mathematical proofs have been invented up
until now. Maybe the main reasons lie in the following three aspects in terms
of maximal planar graphs: not clearing up the structures, not figuring out the
coloring types, and not straightening out the relation between structure and
coloring. For this, we will write a series of articles to study the structure
and coloring theory of maximal planar graphs systematically. This is our first
article, which focuses mainly on the structure and coloring relations. First,
we introduce a new way to construct maximal planar graphs. The advantage of
this method is that it establishes an immediate relation with 4-colorings, and
reveals how a given maximal planar graph is generated. Second, a special class
of maximal planar graphs--recursive maximal planar graphs is researched in
depth, which lays a foundation for solving the uniquely 4-colorable planar
graphs conjecture(see subsequent articles). Third, we discover an important
mode for classifying 4-colorings: tree-coloring and cycle-coloring, which runs
through the whole series of articles. Furthermore, this mode is applied to the
research on an arbitrary 4-coloring and its corresponding structure of unions
of two and three bicolored subgraphs. Finally, we introduce the concepts of
black-white coloring and stamen phenomenon, and find out a necessary and
sufficient condition for an even cycle to be a 2-colorable cycle.

The features of the atom can be studied using the nonrelativistic reduction of
the Bethe-Salpeter equation, especially for a two body system. This work is
dedicated to discuss the bound state of spin-0 and spin-$\frac{\displaystyle

negative energy particle $(e^-$ or $hc)$ and a positive energy particle
$(u\overline{d}$ or $hc)$ has some features of a neutrino, such as spin, lepton
number and oscillation. One deduction is that if the atom is a real particle,
an atom $X$ consisting of two negative energy particles and a nucleus with
double charges exists in nature, which can be observed in Strangeonium,
Charmonium and Bottomonium decays $[s\overline{s}]$, $[c\overline{c}]$ and

circular subject with embedded circular objects is segmented into equal width
slices from different angles. For each angle, Conductance and Conductivity of

These images are compared to the target image. In the time of image
reconstruction, different filters are used and these images are compared with
