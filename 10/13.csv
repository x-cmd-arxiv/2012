large nickel clusters. This process has the characteristic features of the
first order phase transition occurring in a finite system. The focus of our
research is placed on the elucidation of correlated dynamics of a large
ensemble of particles in the course of the nanoscale liquid-solid phase
transition through the computation and analysis of the results of molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations with the corresponding theoretical model. This
problem is of significant interest and importance, because the controlled
dynamics of systems on the nanoscale is one of the central topics in the
development of modern nanotechnologies.
  MD simulations in large molecular systems are rather computer power
demanding. Therefore, in order to advance with MD simulations we have used
modern computational methods based on the graphics processing units (GPU). The
advantages of the use of GPUs for MD simulations in comparison with the CPUs
are demonstrated and benchmarked. The reported speedup reaches factors greater
than 400. This work opens a path towards exploration with the use of MD of a
larger number of scientific problems inaccessible earlier with the CPU based
computational technology.

optimal multi-item multi-bidder auction problem under two conditions. First,
bidders are independent, have additive valuations and are from the same
population. Second, every bidder's value distributions of items are independent
but not necessarily identical monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions. For
non-i.i.d. bidders, we also provide a PTAS when the number of bidders is small.
Prior to our work, even for a single bidder, only constant factor
approximations are known.
  Another appealing feature of our mechanism is the simple allocation rule.
Indeed, the mechanism we use is either the second-price auction with reserve
price on every item individually, or VCG allocation with a few outlying items
that requires additional treatments. It is surprising that such simple
allocation rules suffice to obtain nearly optimal revenue.

been raised by several authors. It seems that the natural reaction for that
criticism is to comment it from the point of view of the theory of conservation
laws. Simple example of balance equations for the intravenous administration of
drug has been given in 2011 and the corresponding equations for extravasal
administration are in the text. In principle, the equations of that kind allow
one to describe in the self consistent manner different processes of
administration, distribution, metabolism and elimination of drugs. Moreover, it
is possible to model different pharmacokinetic parameters of the
non-compartmental pharmacokinetics and therefore to comment criticism of
Rosigno. However, for practical purposes one needs approximate methods, in
particular, those based on separation of the time scales. In this text, such
method is described and its effectiveness is discussed. Basic equations are in
the next chapter. Final remarks are at the end of the text.

""vanilla"" LCDM model by Delta(chi^2) ~ 7; (ii) the uncertainty on the
determination of the standard parameters is not degraded when features are

primordial spectrum at a scale k ~ 0.005 Mpc^-1, corresponding to the scale
where the outliers in the WMAP7 data at ell=22 and ell=40 are located.; (iv) a
distinct, albeit less statistically significant peak is present in the
likelihood at smaller scales, with a Delta(chi^2) ~ 3.5, whose presence might
be related to the WMAP7 preference for a negative value of the running of the

restless Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) in NGC 7259. The object, named SN 2009ip,
was observed photometrically and spectroscopically in the optical and
near-infrared domains. We monitored a number of erupting episodes in the past
few years, and increased the density of our observations during eruptive
episodes. In this paper we present the full historical data set from 2009-2012
with multi-wavelength dense coverage of the two high luminosity events between
August - September 2012. We construct bolometric light curves and measure the
total luminosities of these eruptive or explosive events. We label them the
2012a event (lasting ~50 days) with a peak of 3x10^41 erg/s, and the 2012b
event (14 day rise time, still ongoing) with a peak of 8x10^42 erg/s. The
latter event reached an absolute R-band magnitude of about -18, comparable to
that of a core-collapse supernova (SN). Our historical monitoring has detected
high-velocity spectral features (~13000 km/s) in September 2011, one year
before the current SN-like event. This implies that the detection of such high
velocity outflows cannot, conclusively, point to a core-collapse SN origin. We
suggest that the initial peak in the 2012a event was unlikely to be due to a
faint core-collapse SN. We propose that the high intrinsic luminosity of the
latest peak, the variability history of SN 2009ip, and the detection of broad
spectral lines indicative of high-velocity ejecta are consistent with a
pulsational pair-instability event, and that the star may have survived the
last outburst. The question of the survival of the LBV progenitor star and its
future fate remain open issues, only to be answered with future monitoring of
this historically unique explosion.

a subscale description for the transfer of mass from the bubble into the

followed by solving an advection-diffusion equation on a relatively coarse
Cartesian grid. More detail about the method can be found in our paper.
  This simulation shows 13 moving bubbles in a periodic domain, 3db X 3db X
48db, where db is the bubble diameter. The grid resolution is 64 X 64 X 1024,

of galactic outflows and investigate their impact on the circumgalactic medium

simulations, including star formation, chemical enrichment, and four cases of
SNe-driven outflows: no wind (NW), an energy-driven constant velocity wind
(CW), a radially varying wind (RVWa) where the outflow velocity has a positive
correlation with galactocentric distance (r), and a RVW with additional
dependence on halo mass (RVWb). Overall, we find that the outflows expel
metal-enriched gas away from galaxies, significantly quench star formation, and
enrich the CGM. At z = 2, the radial profiles of gas properties around galaxy
centers are most sensitive to the choice of the wind model for halo masses
(10^9 - 10^11) M_sun. We infer that the RVWb model is similar to the NW case,
except that it substantially enriches the CGM: the carbon metallicity (Z_C) is
10 times higher in RVWb than in NW at r > R_200; and the warm gas of 10^4 -
10^5 K and delta < 100 is enriched to 50 times higher than in NW. We also find
that the impact of models CW and RVWa are similar, with the following
differences. RVWa causes a greater suppression of star formation rate at z < 5,
and has a higher fraction of low-density (delta < 10), warm-hot (10^4 - 10^6 K)
gas than in CW. Outflows in CW produce a higher and earlier enrichment of some
IGM phases than RVWa. By visual inspection, we note that the RVWa model shows
more pronounced bipolar outflows and galactic disks. We present fitting
formulae for [Z_C-delta] and [Z_C-r], also for the abundance of CIV as a
function of r. We predict observational diagnostics to distinguish between
different outflow scenarios: Z_C of the CGM gas at r = (30 - 300) kpc/h
comoving, and CIV fraction of the inner gas at r < (4 - 5) kpc/h comoving.

dust attenuation of Lya photons within galaxies, clustering of galaxies, and
complex propagation of Lya photons through circumgalactic and intergalactic

that there should be strong far-infrared (FIR) sources within each LAB, with

theoretical physics over the decades. Despite its importance, little is known
outside the planar limit where the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda=g_{YM}^2N$ is
fixed. In this Letter we consider more general large-N limit --- $\lambda$
grows with N, e.g., $g_{YM}^2$ is fixed. Such a limit is important particularly
in recent attempts to find the nonpertubative formulation of M-theory. Based on
various supporting evidence, we propose this limit is essentially identical to
the planar limit, in the sense the order of the large-N limit and the strong
coupling limit commute. For a wide class of large-N gauge theories, these two
limits are smoothly connected, and the analytic continuation from the planar

Observatory have previously provided evidence of anisotropy at the 99% CL using
the correlation of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with objects drawn
from the Veron-Cetty Veron catalog. In this paper we report on the use of three
catalog independent methods to search for anisotropy. The 2pt-L, 2pt+ and 3pt
methods, each giving a different measure of self-clustering in arrival
directions, were tested on mock cosmic ray data sets to study the impacts of
sample size and magnetic smearing on their results, accounting for both angular
and energy resolutions. If the sources of UHECRs follow the same large scale
structure as ordinary galaxies in the local Universe and if UHECRs are
deflected no more than a few degrees, a study of mock maps suggests that these
three methods can efficiently respond to the resulting anisotropy with a
P-value = 1.0% or smaller with data sets as few as 100 events. Using data taken
from January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2010 we examined the 20, 30,..., 110 highest
energy events with a corresponding minimum energy threshold of about 49.3 EeV.
The minimum P-values found were 13.5% using the 2pt-L method, 1.0% using the
2pt+ method and 1.1% using the 3pt method for the highest 100 energy events. In
view of the multiple (correlated) scans performed on the data set, these
catalog-independent methods do not yield strong evidence of anisotropy in the
highest energy cosmic rays.

transient, stable nuclear burning or a massive, rapidly rotating white dwarf.
Simulations of mergers have shown that the outcome strongly depends on whether
the white dwarfs are similar or dissimilar in mass. In the similar-mass case,
both white dwarfs merge fully and the remnant is hot throughout, while in the
dissimilar case, the more massive, denser white dwarf remains cold and
essentially intact, with the disrupted lower mass one wrapped around it in a
hot envelope and disk. In order to determine what constitutes ""similar in mass""
and more generally how the properties of the merger remnant depend on the input
masses, we simulated unsynchronized carbon-oxygen white dwarf mergers for a
large range of masses using smoothed-particle hydrodynamics. We find that the
structure of the merger remnant varies smoothly as a function of the ratio of
the central densities of the two white dwarfs. A density ratio of 0.6
approximately separates similar and dissimilar mass mergers. Confirming
previous work, we find that the temperatures of most merger remnants are not
high enough to immediately ignite carbon fusion. During subsequent viscous
evolution, however, the interior will likely be compressed and heated as the
disk accretes and the remnant spins down. We find from simple estimates that
this evolution can lead to ignition for many remnants. For similar-mass
mergers, this would likely occur under sufficiently degenerate conditions that
a thermonuclear runaway would ensue.

interacting with a cavity mode, coupled to a Markovian dissipative bath. In the
thermodynamic limit and at low-frequencies, we show that the distribution
function of the photonic mode is thermal, with an effective temperature set by
the atom-photon interaction strength. This behavior characterizes the static
and dynamic critical exponents of the associated superradiance transition.
Motivated by these considerations, we develop a general Keldysh path integral
approach, that allows us to study physically relevant nonlinearities beyond the
idealized Dicke model. Using standard diagrammatic techniques, we take into
account the leading-order corrections due to the finite number of atoms N. For
finite N, the photon mode behaves as a damped, classical non-linear oscillator
at finite temperature. For the atoms, we propose a Dicke action that can be
solved for any N and correctly captures the atoms' depolarization due to
dissipative dephasing.

unstable region at large Higgs field values due to RG running of couplings,
which we evaluate at 2-loop order. For currently favored values of the Higgs
mass, this renders the electroweak vacuum only meta-stable with a long
lifetime. We argue on statistical grounds that the Higgs field would be highly
unlikely to begin in the small field meta-stable region in the early universe,
and thus some new physics should enter in the energy range of order, or lower
than, the instability scale to remove the large field unstable region. We
assume that Peccei-Quinn (PQ) dynamics enters to solve the strong CP problem
and, for a PQ-scale in this energy range, may also remove the unstable region.
We allow the PQ-scale to scan and argue, again on statistical grounds, that its
value in our universe should be of order the instability scale, rather than
(significantly) lower. Since the Higgs mass determines the instability scale,
which is argued to set the PQ-scale, and since the PQ-scale determines the
axion properties, including its dark matter abundance, we are led to a
correlation between the Higgs mass and the abundance of dark matter. We find
the correlation to be in good agreement with current data.

main purpose is to understand the stability of maximally symmetric
%self-accelerating vacuum solutions. Around self-accelerating configurations,
vector degrees of freedom become strongly coupled since their kinetic terms
vanish, so their dynamics is controlled by higher order interactions. Even in
the decoupling limit, the vector Lagrangian contains an infinite number of

Lagrangian at each order in perturbations, fully manifesting the symmetries of
the system. We show that, around self-accelerating solutions, the structure of
higher order $p$-form Galileons arise, avoiding the emergence of a sixth BD
ghost mode. However, a careful analysis shows that there are directions along
which the Hamiltonian is unbounded from below. This instability can be
interpreted as one of the available fifth physical modes behaving as a ghost.

Distributions (SEDs) of the sources and showed that a 2-component grey-body

micron appear to trace a cold dust component, for which we estimated an
equilibrium temperature of the Big Grains (BGs) in the range 20 - 30 K, while
for lambda < 70 micron, the data indicated the presence of a warm dust
component at temperatures of the order of 50 - 90 K. This analysis also
revealed that dust is present in the interior of HII regions, although likely
not in a large amount. In addition, the data appear to corroborate the
hypothesis that the main mechanism responsible for the (partial) depletion of
dust in HII regions is radiation-pressure-driven drift. In this framework, we
speculated that the 24 micron emission which spatially correlates with ionized
gas might be associated with either Very Small Grain (VSG) or BG replenishment,
as recently proposed for the case of Wind-Blown Bubbles (WBB). Finally, we

relative to the receive coil. If motion correction is used to correct subject
motion occurring during an EPI time series then the receiver contrast will
effectively move relative to the subject and produce temporal modulations in
the image amplitude. This effect, which we will call the RFC-MoCo effect, may
have consequences in the analysis and interpretation of fMRI results. There are
many potential causes of motion-related noise and systematic error in EPI time
series and isolating the RFC-MoCo effect would be difficult. Therefore, we have
undertaken a simulation of this effect to better understand its severity. The
simulations examine this effect for a receive-only single-channel 16-leg
birdcage coil and a receive-only 12-channel phased array. In particular we
study: (1) The effect size; (2) Its consequences to the temporal correlations
between signals arising at different spatial locations (spatial-temporal
correlations) as is often calculated in resting state fMRI analyses; and (3)
Its impact on the temporal signal-to-noise ratio of an EPI time series. We find
that signal changes arising from the RFC-MoCo effect are likely to compete with
BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) signal changes in the presence of
significant motion, even under the assumption of perfect motion correction.
Consequently, we find that the RFC-MoCo effect may lead to spurious temporal
correlations across the image space, and that temporal SNR may be degraded with
increasing motion.

relation between the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the
thicknesses $d_F$ of the magnetic layer by solving the linearized BdG

Moreover, the system may be reentrant not only with $d_F$, as is the case when
the magnet is uniform, but with temperature $T$: the superconductivity
disappears in certain ranges of $d_F$ or $T$. The $T$ reentrance occurs when
$d_F$ is larger than the spatial period of the conical exchange field. We
compute the condensation free energies and entropies from the full BdG
equations and find the results are in agreement with $T_c$ values obtained by
linearization. The inhomogeneous nature of the magnet makes it possible for all
odd triplet pairing components to be induced. We have investigated their
properties and found that, as compared to the singlet amplitude, both the $m=0$
and $m=\pm 1$ triplet components exhibit long range penetration. For nanoscale
bilayers, the proximity lengths for both layers are also obtained. These
lengths oscillate with $d_F$ and they are found to be long range on both sides.
These results are shown to be consistent with recent experiments. We also

theory of resurgent trans-series, combined with the physical principle of

approximation reduce QFT to quantum mechanics, while preventing all intervening
rapid cross-overs or phase transitions. The reduced quantum mechanics contains
the germ of all non-perturbative data, e.g., mass gap, of the QFT, all of which
are calculable. For CP(N-1), the results obtained at arbitrary N are consistent
with lattice and large-N results. These theories are perturbatively non-Borel
summable and possess the elusive IR-renormalon singularities. The trans-series
expansion, in which perturbative and non-perturbative effects are intertwined,
encapsulates the multi-length-scale nature of the theory, and eliminates all
perturbative and non-perturbative ambiguities under consistent analytic
continuation of the coupling. We demonstrate the cancellation of the leading
non-perturbative ambiguity in perturbation theory against the ambiguity in
neutral bion amplitudes. This provides a weak-coupling interpretation of the
IR-renormalon, and a theorem by Pham et al implies that the mass gap is a
resurgent function, for which resummation of the semi-classical expansion
yields finite exact results.

neutrino mass hierarchy (MH) are discussed. Two problems are considered and are
related to each other: how to report the findings for observed experimental
data, and how to evaluate the ability of a future experiment to determine the
neutrino mass hierarchy, namely, sensitivity of the experiment. For the first
problem where experimental data have already been observed, the classical
statistical analysis involves constructing confidence intervals for the
parameter {\Delta}m^2_{32}. These intervals are deduced from the parent
distribution of the estimation of {\Delta}m^2_{32} based on experimental data.
Due to existing experimental constraints on |{\Delta}m^2_{32}|, the estimation
of {\Delta}m^2_{32} is better approximated by a Bernoulli distribution (a
Binomial distribution with 1 trial) rather than a Gaussian distribution.
Therefore, the Feldman-Cousins approach needs to be used instead of the
Gaussian approximation in constructing confidence intervals. Furthermore, as a
result of the definition of confidence intervals, even if it is correctly
constructed, its confidence level does not directly reflect how much one
hypothesis of the MH is supported by the data rather than the other hypothesis.
We thus describe a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence provided by
the observed experimental data through the (posterior) probability that either
one hypothesis of MH is true. This Bayesian presentation of observed
experimental results is then used to develop several metrics to assess the
sensitivity of future experiments. Illustrations are made using a simple
example with a confined parameter space, which approximates the MH
determination problem with experimental constraints on the |{\Delta}m^2_{32}|.

distributed storage systems (DSS). Due to their distributed nature, these
systems are intrinsically susceptible to attacks, and they may also be subject
to multiple simultaneous node failures. Cooperative regenerating codes allow
bandwidth efficient repair of multiple simultaneous node failures. This paper
analyzes storage systems that employ cooperative regenerating codes that are
robust to (passive) eavesdroppers. The analysis is divided into two parts,
studying both minimum bandwidth and minimum storage cooperative regenerating
scenarios. First, the secrecy capacity for minimum bandwidth cooperative
regenerating codes is characterized. Second, for minimum storage cooperative
regenerating codes, a secure file size upper bound and achievability results
are provided. These results establish the secrecy capacity for the minimum
storage scenario for certain special cases. In all scenarios, the achievability
results correspond to exact repair, and secure file size upper bounds are
obtained using min-cut analyses over a suitable secrecy graph representation of
DSS. The main achievability argument is based on an appropriate pre-coding of
the data to eliminate the information leakage to the eavesdropper.

  Lecture 1 provides an introduction to the subject, and uses the theory of
left-orderable groups to prove that SL(3,Z) does not act on the circle. Lecture
2 discusses bounded generation, and proves that groups of the form SL(2,Z[a])

amenable groups and bounded cohomology, respectively. They also explain how
these ideas can be used to prove that actions on the circle have finite orbits.

but lifetime prediction is mostly based on empirical trends, rather than
mathematical models. In practical lithium-ion batteries, capacity fade occurs
over thousands of cycles, limited by slow electrochemical processes, such as
the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in the negative
electrode, which compete with reversible lithium intercalation. Focusing on SEI
growth as the canonical degradation mechanism, we show that a simple
single-particle model can accurately explain experimentally observed capacity
fade in commercial cells with graphite anodes, and predict future fade based on
limited accelerated aging data for short times and elevated temperatures. The
theory is extended to porous electrodes, predicting that SEI growth is
essentially homogeneous throughout the electrode, even at high rates. The
lifetime distribution for a sample of batteries is found to be consistent with
Gaussian statistics, as predicted by the single-particle model. We also extend
the theory to rapidly degrading anodes, such as nanostructured silicon, which
exhibit large expansion on ion intercalation. In such cases, large area changes
during cycling promote SEI loss and faster SEI growth. Our simple models are
able to accurately fit a variety of published experimental data for graphite
and silicon anodes.

constant velocity motion is the only blow-up profile consistent with the
invariant scaling of the equation. This suggests the presence of downward

  At stagnation points on the axis of symmetry, the unique blow-up profile
consistent with the invariant scaling of the equation is Garabedian's pointed
bubble solution with water above air. Thus at stagnation points on the axis of
symmetry with no water above the stagnation point, the invariant scaling of the
equation cannot be the right scaling. A fine analysis of the blow-up velocity
yields that in the case that the surface is described by an injective curve,
the velocity scales almost like $\sqrt{X^2+Y^2+Z^2}$ and is asymptotically
given by the velocity field $$V(\sqrt{X^2+Y^2},Z)=c (-\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}, 2Z)$$

which is a relaxation of the Unconstrained 0-1 Quadratic Programming Problem
(QP). Applications of the BQP include mining discrete patterns from binary
data, approximating matrices by rank-one binary matrices, computing cut-norm of
a matrix, and solving optimization problems such as maximum weight biclique,
bipartite maximum weight cut, maximum weight induced subgraph of a bipartite
graph, etc. We propose several classes of heuristic approaches to solve the BQP
and discuss a number of construction algorithms, local search algorithms and
their combinations. Results of extensive computational experiments are reported
to establish the practical performance of our algorithms. For this purpose, we
propose several sets of test instances based on various applications of the
BQP. Our algorithms are compared with state-of-the-art heuristics for QP which
can also be used to solve BQP with reformulation. We also study theoretical
properties of the neighborhoods and algorithms. In particular, we establish
complexity of all neighborhood search algorithms and establish tight worst-case
performance ratio for the greedy algorithm.

graphene at any temperature down to 2 K. Neither do they found strong

graphene is strongly diamagnetic, similar to graphite. Thus the possible traces

ordinary fluids is reviewed in the first part of the paper, where special

In addition, a few mathematical features involving properties of cubic
equations are discussed, for appreciating the intrinsic beauty of the VDW
theory. A theory of astrophysical fluids is shortly reviewed in the second part
of the paper, grounding on the tensor virial theorem for two-component systems,
and an equation of state is formulated with a convenient choice of reduced
variables. Additional effort is devoted to particular choices of density
profiles, namely a simple guidance case and two cases of astrophysical
interest. The related macroisothermal curves are found to be qualitatively
similar to VDW isothermal curves below the critical threshold and, for
sufficiently steep density profiles, a critical macroisothermal curve exists,
with a single horizontal inflexion point. Under the working hypothesis of a
phase transition (assumed to be gas-stars) for astrophysical fluids, similar to
the vapour-liquid phase transition in ordinary fluids, the location of gas
clouds, stellar systems, galaxies, cluster of galaxies, on the plane scanned by
reduced variables, is tentatively assigned. A brief discussion shows how van
der Waals' two great discoveries, namely a gas equation of state where tidal
interactions between molecules are taken into account, and the law of
corresponding states, related to microcosmos, find a counterpart with regard to
macrocosmos. In conclusion, after more than a century since the awarding of the

relations for a sample of 50 clusters of galaxies. Our analysis combines
Chandra and XMM-Newton data using an energy-dependent cross-calibration. After
considering a number of scaling relations, we find that gas mass is the most
robust estimator of weak lensing mass, yielding 15 +/- 6% intrinsic scatter at
r500 (the pseudo-pressure YX has a consistent scatter of 22%+/-5%). The scatter
does not change when measured within a fixed physical radius of 1 Mpc. Clusters
with small BCG to X-ray peak offsets constitute a very regular population whose
members have the same gas mass fractions and whose even smaller <10% deviations
from regularity can be ascribed to line of sight geometrical effects alone.
Cool-core clusters, while a somewhat different population, also show the same
(<10%) scatter in the gas mass-lensing mass relation. There is a good
correlation and a hint of bimodality in the plane defined by BCG offset and
central entropy (or central cooling time). The pseudo-pressure YX does not
discriminate between the more relaxed and less relaxed populations, making it
perhaps the more even-handed mass proxy for surveys. Overall, hydrostatic
masses underestimate weak lensing masses by 10% on the average at r500; but
cool-core clusters are consistent with no bias, while non-cool-core clusters
have a large and constant 15-20% bias between r2500 and r500, in agreement with
N-body simulations incorporating unthermalized gas. For non-cool-core clusters,
the bias correlates well with BCG ellipticity. We also examine centroid shift
variance and and power ratios to quantify substructure; these quantities do not
correlate with residuals in the scaling relations. Individual clusters have for
the most part forgotten the source of their departures from self-similarity.

particular event presented a Fast Rise, Exponential Decay (FRED) structure

study was set out to estimate the most probable degree of contamination by
galactic sources that certain samples of FREDs have. In order to quantify the
degree of anisotropy the average dipolar and quadripolar moments of each sample
of GRBs with respect to the galactic plane were calculated. This was then
compared to the probability distribution of simulated samples comprised of a
combination of isotropically generated sources and galactic sources. We observe
that the dipolar and quadripolar moments of the selected subsamples of FREDs

isotropically generated samples.The most probable degree of contamination by
galactic sources for the FRED GRBs of the Swift catalog detected until February
2011 that do not have a known redshift is about 21 out of 77 sources which is
roughly equal to 27%. Furthermore we observe, that by removing from this sample
those bursts that may have any type of indirect redshift indicator and multiple
peaks gives the most probable contamination increases up to 34% (17 out of 49
sources). It is probable that a high degree of contamination by galactic
sources occurs among the single peak FREDs observed by Swift.

work is associated with a microsphere composite material, which is modelled as
a matrix-inclusion composite. The matrix phase is a homogeneous isotropic
nonlinear rubber-like material and the inclusion phase is more complex,
consisting of a distribution of sizes of stiff thin spherical shells filled
with gas. Experimentally, such materials have been shown to undergo complex
deformation under cyclic loading. Here, we consider microspheres embedded in an
unbounded host material and assume that a hydrostatic pressure is applied in
the ""far-field"". Taking into account a variety of effects including buckling of
the spherical shells, large deformation of the host phase and evolving
microstructure, we derive a model predicting the pressure-relative volume
change load curves. Nonlinear constitutive behaviour of the matrix medium is
accounted for by employing neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin incompressible models.
Moreover a nearly-incompressible solution is derived via asymptotic analysis
for a spherical cavity embedded in un unbounded isotropic homogeneous
hyperelastic medium loaded hydrostatically. The load-curve predictions reveal a
strong dependence on the microstructure of the composite, including
distribution of microspheres, the stiffness of the shells, and on the initial
volume fraction of the inclusions, whereas there is only a modest dependence on
the characteristic properties of the nonlinear elastic model used for the
rubber host.

MIMO is incorporated in the WiMAX. And all these sub carriers are considered to
be orthogonal to each other. As the number of sub carriers is increased there
is no guarantee of sustained orthogonality, i.e. at some point the carriers are
not independent to each other, and hence where the orthogonality can be loosed
which leads to interference and also owing to the synchronization between
transmitter and receiver local oscillator, it causes interference known as
Inter Carrier Interference (ICI).In this scheme at the transmitter side the
modulated data and a few predefined pilot symbols are mapped onto the non
neighboring sub carriers with weighting coefficients of +1 and -1. With the aid
of pilot symbols the frequency offset is exactly estimated by using Maximum
Likelihood Estimation MLE and hence can be minimized. At demodulation stage the
received signals are linearly combined along with their weighted oefficients
and pilot symbols, called as Pilot Aided Self Cancellation Method PASCS. The
simulations are carried out on Stanford University Interim (SUI)channels. The
simulation results shows that by incorporating this method into WiMAX systems
it performs better when the Line Of Sight (LOS) component is present in the
transmission and also it improves the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Carrier to
Interference Ratio (CIR). The CIR can be improved 20 dB. In this paper the
effectiveness of PASCS scheme is compared with the Self Cancellation Method

Tarruell et
al., Nature 483, 302 (2012)], we consider a generalization of the Landau-Zener
problem to the case of a quadratic crossing between two bands in the vicinity
of the merging transition of Dirac cones. The latter is described by the
so-called universal hamiltonian. In this framework, the inter-band tunneling
problem depends on two dimensionless parameters: one measures the proximity to
the merging transition and the other the adiabaticity of the motion. Under the
influence of a constant force, the probability for a particle to tunnel from
the lower to the upper band is computed numerically in the whole range of these
two parameters and analytically in different limits using (i) the Stueckelberg
theory for two successive linear band crossings, (ii) diabatic perturbation
theory, (iii) adiabatic perturbation theory and (iv) a modified Stueckelberg
formula. We obtain a complete phase diagram and explain the presence of
unexpected probability oscillations in terms of interferences between two poles
in the complex time plane. We also compare our results to the above mentioned
experiment.

of crosslinked membranes, giving rise to scale-dependent elastic moduli. While
thermal effects in flat membranes are well understood, many natural and
artificial microstructures are modeled as thin elastic {\it shells}. Shells are
distinguished from flat membranes by their nonzero curvature, which provides a
size-dependent coupling between the in-plane stretching modes and the
out-of-plane undulations. In addition, a shell can support a pressure
difference between its interior and exterior. Little is known about the effect
of thermal fluctuations on the elastic properties of shells. Here, we study the
statistical mechanics of shape fluctuations in a pressurized spherical shell
using perturbation theory and Monte Carlo computer simulations, explicitly
including the effects of curvature and an inward pressure. We predict novel
properties of fluctuating thin shells under point indentations and
pressure-induced deformations. The contribution due to thermal fluctuations
increases with increasing ratio of shell radius to thickness, and dominates the
response when the product of this ratio and the thermal energy becomes large
compared to the bending rigidity of the shell. Thermal effects are enhanced
when a large uniform inward pressure acts on the shell, and diverge as this
pressure approaches the classical buckling transition of the shell. Our results
are relevant for the elasticity and osmotic collapse of microcapsules.

we have studied the strain sensitivity of the high-field superconducting magnet
A15 Nb3Sn. The Nb3Sn lattice cell was deformed in the same way as observed
experimentally on multi-filamentary, technological wires subject to loads
applied along their axes. The phonon dispersion curves and electronic band
structures along different high-symmetry directions in the Brillouin zone were
calculated, at different levels of applied strain, {\epsilon}, both on the
compressive and the tensile side. Starting from the calculated averaged phonon
frequencies and electron-phonon coupling, the superconducting characteristic
critical temperature of the material, Tc, has been calculated by means of the
Allen-Dynes modification of the McMillan formula. As a result, the
characteristic bell-shaped Tc vs. {\epsilon} curve, with a maximum at zero
intrinsic strain, and with a slight asymmetry between the tensile and
compressive sides, has been obtained. These first-principle calculations thus
show that the strain sensitivity of Nb3Sn has a microscopic and intrinsic
origin, originating from shifts in the Nb3Sn critical surface. In addition, our
computations show that variations of superconducting properties of this
compound are correlated to stress-induced changes in both the phononic and
electronic properties. Finally, the strain function describing the strain
sensitivity of Nb3Sn has been extracted from the computed Tc({\epsilon}) curve,
and compared to experimental data from multi-filamentary wires. Both curves
show the expected bell-shaped behavior, but the strain sensitivity of the wire
is enhanced with respect to the theoretical predictions of the bulk, perfectly
binary and stoichiometric Nb3Sn. Understanding the origin of this difference
might open potential pathways towards the improvement of the strain tolerance

resistance to insecticides. A comprehensive survey of the bed bug microbiome
has not been performed to date, nor has an assessment of the spatial dynamics

amplifying the V4-V6 hypervariable region of the 16S rDNA gene region followed
by 454 Titanium sequencing using 31 individuals from eight natural populations
collected from residences in Cincinnati, OH. Across all samples, 97% of the
microbial community is made up of two dominant OTUs identified as the
{\alpha}-proteobacterium Wolbachia and an unnamed {\gamma}-proteobacterium from
the Enterobacteriaceae. Microbial communities varied among host populations for
measures of community diversity and exhibited significant population structure.
We also uncovered a strong negative correlation in the abundance of the two
dominant OTUs, suggesting they may fulfill similar roles as nutritional
mutualists. This broad survey represents the most comprehensive assessment, to
date, of the microbes that associate with bed bugs, and uncovers evidence for
potential antagonism between the two dominant members of the bed bug
microbiome.

widely-used nuclear norm technique may be challenged under many circumstances,
especially when certain basis coefficients are fixed, for example, the low-rank
correlation matrix completion in various fields such as the financial market
and the low-rank density matrix completion from the quantum state tomography.
To seek a solution of high recovery quality beyond the reach of the nuclear
norm, in this paper, we propose a rank-corrected procedure using a nuclear
semi-norm to generate a new estimator. For this new estimator, we establish a
non-asymptotic recovery error bound. More importantly, we quantify the
reduction of the recovery error bound for this rank-corrected procedure.
Compared with the one obtained for the nuclear norm penalized least squares
estimator, this reduction can be substantial (around 50%). We also provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for rank consistency in the sense of Bach
(2008). Very interestingly, these conditions are highly related to the concept
of constraint nondegeneracy in matrix optimization. As a byproduct, our results
provide a theoretical foundation for the majorized penalty method of Gao and
Sun (2010) and Gao (2010) for structured low-rank matrix optimization problems.
Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed rank-corrected
procedure can simultaneously achieve a high recovery accuracy and capture the
low-rank structure.

(t-SHS) packings provide a useful perturbative basis for analyzing polymer
packings with nonzero bending stiffness only for {\it small} ratios of the
stiffnesses for the bond-angle ($k_b$) and pair ($k_c$) interactions, i.e.
$k_b^{\rm crit}/k_c \lesssim 0.01$ for $N<10$ monomers, and the critical ratio
decreases with $N$. Below $k_b^{crit}$, angular interactions give rise to an
exponential (in $N$) increase in the number of distinct angular energies
arising from the diversity of covalent backbone paths through t-SHS packings.
As $k_b$ increases above $k_b^{crit}$, the low-lying energy landscape changes
dramatically as finite bending stiffness alters the structure of the polymer
packings. This study lays the groundwork for exact-enumeration studies of the
collapsed states of t-SHS-like models with larger bending stiffness.
