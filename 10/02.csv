present a combinatorial characterization of the generic minimal rigidity of a
subset of body-and-cad frameworks in which we treat 20 of the 21 body-and-cad

classical combinatorial characterizations of rigidity focus on distance
constraints between points, this is the first result simultaneously addressing
coincidence, angular, and distance constraints. Our result is stated in terms
of the partitioning of a graph into edge-disjoint spanning trees. This

seven hours at 330 MHz, resulting in a sample of about 95000 giant pulses
(GPs). This is the largest sample, to date, of GPs from the Crab pulsar taken
with the same telescope and backend and analyzed as one data set. We calculated
power-law fits to amplitude distributions for main pulse (MP) and interpulse
(IP) GPs, resulting in indices in the range of 2.1-3.1 for MP GPs at 1.2 GHz
and in the range of 2.5-3.0 and 2.4-3.1 for MP and IP GPs at 330 MHz. We also
correlated the GPs at 1.2 GHz with GPs from the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank
Telescope (GBT), which were obtained simultaneously at a higher frequency (8.9
GHz) over a span of 26 hours. In total, 7933 GPs from the 43-m telescope at 1.2
GHz and 39900 GPs from the GBT were recorded during these contemporaneous
observations. At 1.2 GHz, 236 (3%) MP GPs and 23 (5%) IP GPs were detected at
8.9 GHz, both with zero chance probability. Another 15 (4%) low-frequency IP
GPs were detected within one spin period of high-frequency IP GPs, with a
chance probability of 9%. This indicates that the emission processes at high
and low radio frequencies are related, despite significant pulse profile shape
differences. The 43-m GPs were also correlated with Fermi gamma-ray photons to
see if increased pair production in the magnetosphere is the mechanism
responsible for GP emission. A total of 92022 GPs and 393 gamma-ray photons
were used in this correlation analysis. No significant correlations were found
between GPs and gamma-ray photons. This indicates that increased pair
production in the magnetosphere is likely not the dominant cause of GPs.
Possible methods of GP production may be increased coherence of synchrotron
emission or changes in beaming direction.

knot has a reduced regular projection on the sphere such that the number of

sequence. Adams, Shinjo, and Tanaka have, in a work, shown that (2,4,5) and
(3,4,n) (where n is a positive integer greater than 4), among others, are
universal. In a forthcoming paper, Adams introduces the notion of a
multi-crossing projection of a knot. An n-crossing projection} is a projection
of a knot in which each crossing has n strands, rather than 2 strands as in a
regular projection. We then extend the notion of universality to such knots.
These results allow us to prove that (1,2,3,4) is a universal sequence for both
n-crossing knot projections, for all n>2. Adams further proves that all knots
have an n-crossing projection for all positive n. Another proof of this fact is
included in this paper. This is achieved by constructing n-crossing template
knots, which enable us to construct multi-crossing projections with crossings
of any multiplicity.

the Highly Truncated Diagonalization Approach suited to treat correlations in
an explicitly particle-number conserving microscopic approach. To do so we have
assumed axial symmetry and used a generalized Wick's theorem due to L\""owdin in
a projection-after-variation scheme. We have chosen the Skyrme SkM$^*$
energy-density functional for the particle-hole channel and a
density-independent delta force for the residual interaction. We have applied
this approach in the region of the outer fission barrier of the $^{240}$Pu

state is statically unstable against intrinsic-parity breaking modes, while the
projection does not affect the energy at the top of the intrinsic outer fission
barrier. Altogether, this leads to an increase of the height of the outer
fission barrier--with respect to the fission isomeric state--by about 350 keV,
affecting thus significantly the fission-decay lifetime of the considered
fission isomer.

SafetyMargin, a method that corrects estimators for dependence in RW samples.

with time lags caused by Compton-scattering reverberation from material a few
thousand light-seconds from the primary X-ray source. The power spectral
density and the frequency-dependent phase lags of the peak light curves are
consistent with those of the full time series. There is evidence for
non-stationarity in the Ark 564 time series in both the Fourier and peaks
analyses. A sharp `negative' lag (variations at hard photon energies lead soft
photon energies) observed in Ark 564 appears to be generated by the shape of
the hard-band transfer function and does not arise from soft-band reflection of
X-rays. These results reinforce the evidence for the existence of X-ray
reverberation in type I AGN, which requires that these AGN are significantly
affected by scattering from circumnuclear material a few tens or hundreds of
gravitational radii in extent.

equations govern the dynamical behavior of a polytropic, self-gravitating disk
under the effects of winds, around the nascent object. In order to describe
time evolution of the system, we adopt a radius dependent mass loss rate, then
highlight its importance on both the traditional $\alpha$ and innovative
$\beta$ models of viscosity prescription. In agreement with some other studies,
our solutions represent that Toomre parameter is less than one in most regions
on the $\beta$-disk which indicate that in such disks gravitational
instabilities can occur in various distances from the central accretor and so
the $\beta$-disk model might provide a good explanation of how the planetary
systems form. The purpose of the present work is twofold. First, examining the
structure of disk with wind in comparison to no-wind solution; and second, to
see if the adopted viscosity prescription affects significantly the dynamical
behavior of the disk-wind system. We also considered the temperature
distribution in our disk by a polytropic condition. The solutions imply that,
under our boundary conditions, the radial velocity is larger for $\alpha$-disks
and increases as wind becomes stronger in both viscosity models. Also, we
noticed that the disk thickness increases by amplifying the wind or adopting
larger values for polytropic exponent $\gamma$. It also may globally decrease
if one prescribe $\beta$-model for the viscosity. Moreover, in both viscosity
models, surface density and mass accretion rate reduce as wind gets stronger or
$\gamma$ increases.

Atserias, Grohe and Marx (henceforth AGM) proved a tight bound on the maximum
result size of a full conjunctive query, given constraints on the input
relation sizes. In 2012, Ngo, Porat, R{\'e} and Rudra (henceforth NPRR) devised
a join algorithm with worst-case running time proportional to the AGM bound.
Our commercial Datalog system LogicBlox employs a novel join algorithm,
\emph{leapfrog triejoin}, which compared conspicuously well to the NPRR
algorithm in preliminary benchmarks. This spurred us to analyze the complexity
of leapfrog triejoin. In this paper we establish that leapfrog triejoin is also
worst-case optimal, up to a log factor, in the sense of NPRR. We improve on the
results of NPRR by proving that leapfrog triejoin achieves worst-case
optimality for finer-grained classes of database instances, such as those
defined by constraints on projection cardinalities. We show that NPRR is
\emph{not} worst-case optimal for such classes, giving a counterexample where
leapfrog triejoin runs in $O(n \log n)$ time, compared to $\Theta(n^{1.375})$
time for NPRR. On a practical note, leapfrog triejoin can be implemented using
conventional data structures such as B-trees, and extends naturally to
$\exists_1$ queries. We believe our algorithm offers a useful addition to the
existing toolbox of join algorithms, being easy to absorb, simple to implement,

depend on a set of free parameters and which reduce smoothly to the Kerr metric
if all deviations vanish. Many of these metrics, however, are valid only for
small values of the spin or small perturbations of the Kerr metric or contain

cold, T ~ 15 K, hence the name ""Herschel cold clouds"" (HCCs). From the observed
rotational velocity profile and the assumption of spherical symmetry, the
Galactic mass density is modeled in a form close to that of an isothermal
sphere. If the HCCs constitute a certain fraction of it, their angular size
distribution has a specified shape. A fit to the data deduced from the SMC/LMC
maps supports this and yields for their radius 2.5 pc, with a small change when
allowing for a spread in HCC radii. There are so many HCCs that they will make
up all the missing Halo mass density if there is spherical symmetry and their
average mass is of order 15,000 Mo. This compares well with the Jeans mass of
circa 40,000 Mo and puts forward that the HCCs are in fact Jeans clusters,
constituting all the Galactic dark matter and much of its missing baryons, a
conclusion deduced before from a different field of the sky (Nieuwenhuizen,
Schild and Gibson 2011). A preliminary analysis of the intensities yields that
the Jeans clusters themselves may consist of some billion MACHOs of a few dozen
Earth masses. With a size of dozens of solar radii, they would mostly obscure
stars in the LMC, SMC and towards the Galactic center, and may thus have been
overlooked in microlensing.

propagation from the relay node. To counter this, we propose a novel decoder
which takes into account the possibility of an error event at $R$, without
having any knowledge about the links from $A$ to $R$ and $B$ to $R$. It is
shown that if certain parameters are chosen properly and if the map $f$
satisfies a condition called exclusive law, the proposed decoder offers the
maximum diversity order of two. Also, it is shown that for a proper choice of
the parameters, the proposed decoder admits fast decoding, with the same
decoding complexity order as that of the CFNC scheme. Simulation results
indicate that the proposed PNC scheme performs better than the CFNC scheme.

$M_H\in[ 124, 126] {\rm GeV}$. Given this range, a case may be made for new
physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) because of the resultant vacuum
stability problem, i.e., the SM Higgs quartic coupling may run to negative
values at a scale below the Planck scale. We study representative minimal
extensions of the SM that can keep the SM Higgs vacuum stable to the Planck
scale by introducing new scalar or fermion interactions at the TeV scale while
solving other phenomenological problems. In particular, we consider the type-II
seesaw model, which is introduced to explain the non-zero Majorana masses of
the active neutrinos. Similarly, we observe that if the stability of the SM
Higgs vacuum is ensured by the running of the gauge sector couplings, then one
may require a series of new electroweak multiplets, the neutral component of
which can be cold dark matter candidate. Stability may also point to a new U(1)
gauge symmetry, in which the SM Higgs carries non-zero charge.

stationary state where external forces balance dissipation on average. These
states have the invariant probability that does not respect detailed balance,
and are characterized by non-vanishing currents of conserved quantities. In
order to analyze spatially homogeneous stationary states, we develop a kinetic
approach that generalizes the one known for deterministic long-range systems;
we obtain a very good agreement between predictions from kinetic theory and
extensive numerical simulations. Our approach may also be generalized to
describe spatially inhomogeneous stationary states. We also report on numerical
simulations exhibiting a first-order nonequilibrium phase transition from
homogeneous to inhomogeneous states. Close to the phase transition, the system
shows bistable behavior between the two states, with a mean residence time that
diverges as an exponential in the inverse of the strength of the external
stochastic forces, in the limit of low values of such forces.

regardless of composite's microstructure are called exact relations. Relations
between components of the effective tensors of all laminates are called
lamination exact relations. The question of existence of sets of effective
tensors of composites that are stable under lamination, but not homogenization
was settled by Milton with an example in 3D elasticity. In this paper we
discuss an analogous question for exact relations, where in a wide variety of
physical contexts it is known (a posteriori) that all lamination exact
relations are stable under homogenization. In this paper we consider 2D
polycrystalline multi-field response materials and give an example of an exact
relation that is stable under lamination, but not homogenization. We also shed
some light on the surprising absence of such examples in most other physical
contexts (including 3D polycrystalline multi-field response materials). The

to orthogonal conjugation equivalence) of all representations of formally real
Jordan algebras as symmetric $n\times n$ matrices. For each representation we
examine the validity of the 4-chain relation|a 4th degree polynomial identity,

the abundance of cooperation at all levels of biological systems: from cells
cooperating to form a biofilm or an organism to ecosystems and human societies.
Several explanations have been proposed to resolve this paradox, including
direct reciprocity, kin, and group selection. However, our work builds upon an
observation that selection on cooperators might depend both on their relative
frequency in the population and on the population density. We find that this
feedback between the population and evolutionary dynamics can substantially
increase the frequency of cooperators at the front of an expanding population,
and can even lead to a splitting of cooperators from defectors. After
splitting, only cooperators colonize new territories, while defectors slowly
invade them from behind. Since range expansions are very common in nature, our
work provides a new explanation of the maintenance of cooperation.

complex to implement, and the search for low complexity receivers for the
detection of lattice codes is considered a challenging problem. However, the
low computational complexity advantage that sequential decoding promises, makes
it an alternative solution to the lattice decoder. In this work, we will
characterize the performance and complexity tradeoff via the error exponent and
the decoding complexity, respectively, of such a decoder as a function of the
decoding parameter --- the bias term. For the above channel, we derive the
cut-off volume-to-noise ratio that is required to achieve a good error
performance with low decoding complexity.

black hole space-time possesses a branch cut in the complex-frequency plane.
This branch cut has remained largely unexplored: only asymptotic analyses
either for small-frequency (yielding the known tail decay at late times of an
initial perturbation of the black hole) or for large-frequency (quasinormal
modes close to the branch cut in this regime have been linked to quantum
properties of black holes) have been carried out in the literature. The regime
along the cut inaccessible to these asymptotic analyses has so far remained
essentially unreachable. We present a new method for the analytic calculation
of the branch cut directly on the cut for general-spin fields in Schwarzschild
space-time. This method is valid for any values of the frequency on the cut and
so it provides analytic access to the whole branch cut for the first time. We
calculate the modes along the cut and investigate their properties and

theme of the overview is to explore the implications of the recent discovery of
a Higgs like particle regarding the prospects for the discovery of
supersymmetry assuming that it is indeed the spin 0 CP even boson that enters
in the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry. The high mass of the
Higgs like boson at $\sim 125$ GeV points to the weak scale of supersymmetry
that enters in the loop correction to the Higgs boson mass, to be relatively
high, i.e., in the TeV region. However, since more than one independent mass
scales enter in softly broken supersymmetry, the allowed parameter space of
supersymmetric models can allow a small Higgs mixing parameter $\mu$ and light
gaugino masses consistent with a $\sim 125$ GeV Higgs boson mass. Additionally
some light third generation sfermions, i.e., the stop and the stau are also
permissible. Profile likelihood analysis of a class of SUGRA models indicates
that $m_A> 300$ GeV which implies one is in the decoupling phase and the Higgs
couplings are close to the standard model in this limit. Thus a sensitive
measurement of the Higgs couplings with fermions and with the vector bosons is
needed to detect beyond the standard model effects. Other topics discussed
include dark matter, proton stability, and the Stueckelberg extended models as
probes of new physics. A brief discussion of the way forward in the post Higgs
discovery era is given.

We apply the method to real data, and we find an excellent agreement with the

successfully used in the detection of clusters in gamma-ray data. The
significance returned by our algorithm is strongly correlated with that
provided by the Maximum Likelihood analysis with standard Fermi-LAT software,

the reconstructed cluster centroid compares to that returned by standard
Maximum Likelihood analysis, allowing to look for astrophysical counterparts in
narrow regions, minimizing the chance probability in the counterpart
association. We find that gamma-ray DBSCAN is a powerful tool in the detection
of clusters in gamma-ray data, this method can be used both to look for

Vertices are chosen, one at a

optimal strategy---Dominator plays so as to end the game as quickly as possible
while Staller plays in such a way that the game lasts as many steps as
possible. The game domination number of G is the number of vertices chosen when
Dominator starts the game and the Staller-start game domination number of G
when Staller starts the game.
  In this paper these two games are studied when played on trees and spanning
subgraphs. A lower bound for the game domination number of a tree in terms of

is shown that for every k, there is a tree T with game domination number k and

turbulent cloud cores until several 104 years after protostar formation using
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) calculations. The formation and evolution
process of circumstellar disk in turbulent cloud cores differs substantially
from that in rigidly rotating cloud cores. In turbulent cloud cores, a
filamentary structure appears before the protostar formation and the protostar
forms in the filament. If the turbulence is initially sufficiently strong, the
remaining filament twists around the protostar and directly becomes a
rotation-supported disk. Upon formation, the disk orientation is generally
misaligned with the angular momentum of its host cloud core and it dynamically
varies during the main accretion phase, even though the turbulence is weak.
This is because the angular momentum of the entire cloud core is mainly
determined by the large scale velocity field whose wavelength is comparable to
the cloud scale, whereas the angular momentum of the disk is determined by the
local velocity field where the protostar forms and these two velocity fields do
not correlate with each other. In the case of disk evolution in a binary or
multiple stars, the disks are misaligned with each other at least during the
main accretion phase, because there is no correlation between the velocity
fields around the position where each protostar forms. In addition, each disk
is also misaligned with the binary orbital plane. Such misalignment can explain
the recent observations of misaligned disks and misaligned protostellar
outflows.

planets, including a hot super-Earth (55 Cnc e) extremely close to its star and
a farther out giant planet (55 Cnc b), found in milder irradiation conditions
with respect to other known hot Jupiters. This system raises important
questions on the evolution of atmospheres for close-in exoplanets, and the
dependence with planetary mass and irradiation. These questions can be
addressed by Lyman-alpha transit observations of the extended hydrogen
planetary atmospheres, complemented by contemporaneous measurements of the
stellar X-ray flux. In fact, planet `e' has been detected in transit,
suggesting the system is seen nearly edge-on. Yet, planet `b' has not been
observed in transit so far. Here, we report on Hubble Space Telescope STIS
Lyman-alpha and Chandra ACIS-S X-ray observations of 55 Cnc. These simultaneous
observations cover two transits of 55 Cnc e and two inferior conjunctions of 55
Cnc b. They reveal the star as a bright Lyman-alpha target and a variable X-ray
source. While no significant signal is detected during the transits of 55 Cnc
e, we detect a surprising Lyman-alpha absorption of 7.5 +/- 1.8% (4.2 sigma) at
inferior conjunctions of 55 Cnc b. The absorption is only detected over the
range of Doppler velocities where the stellar radiation repels hydrogen atoms
towards the observer. We calculate a false-alarm probability of 4.4%, which
takes into account the a-priori unknown transit parameters. This result
suggests the possibility that 55 Cnc b has an extended upper H I atmosphere,
which undergoes partial transits when the planet grazes the stellar disc. If
confirmed, it would show that planets cooler than hot Jupiters can also have
extended atmospheres.

variability that support a physical origin due to co-rotating interaction
regions (CIRs) that are rooted at the stellar surface. The recurrence time of
the observed spectral signatures of the CIRs is used to estimate the rotation
period of the central star and, adopting a radius between 0.3 and 0.6 \Rsun
constrains the rotational velocity to the range 54 \leq v_{rot} \leq 108 \kms.
The implications of these results for single star evolution are discussed based

interface in electromagnetism: a self-energy or potential includes the effects
of image charges. N=4 SYM with a jumping theta-angle may also be interpreted as
the low-energy effective description of a fractional topological insulator, as

spectral observations of the counter-rotating stellar discs in the strange S0
galaxy NGC 4550. We kinematically decompose the spectra into two
counter-rotating stellar components (plus a gaseous component), in order to
study both their kinematics and their populations. The derived kinematics
largely confirm what was known previously about the stellar discs, but trace
them to larger radii with smaller errors; the fitted gaseous component allows
us to trace the hydrogen emission lines for the first time, which are found to
follow the same rather strange kinematics previously seen in the [OIII] line.
Analysis of the populations of the two separate stellar components shows that
the secondary disc has a significantly younger mean age than the primary disc,
consistent with later star formation from the associated gaseous material. In
addition, the secondary disc is somewhat brighter, also consistent with such
additional star formation. However, these measurements cannot be
self-consistently modelled by a scenario in which extra stars have been added
to initially-identical counter-rotating stellar discs, which rules out Evans &
Collett's (1994) elegant ""separatrix-crossing"" model for the formation of such
massive counter-rotating discs from a single galaxy, leaving some form of
unusual gas accretion history as the most likely formation mechanism.

circumbinary accretion disk; however, previous works have revealed accretion
streams entering this cavity. Here we use 2D hydrodynamical simulations to
study the accretion streams and their periodic behavior. In particular, we
perform a suite of simulations, covering different binary mass ratios
$q=M_2/M_1$ in the range $0.01 \leq q \leq 1$. In each case, we follow the
system for several thousand binary orbits, until it relaxes to a stable
accretion pattern. We find the following results: (i) while the binary is
efficient in maintaining a low-density cavity, the time-averaged mass accretion
rate into the cavity, through narrow coherent accretion streams, is suppressed
by at most a factor of $\sim 5$, compared to a disk with a single BH with the
same mass; (ii) the largest suppression occurs for $q\approx 0.05$; binaries
whose mass ratios are either lower or higher both suppress accretion less
significantly; (iii) for $q \gtrsim 0.05$, the accretion rate is strongly
modulated by the binary, and depending on the precise value of $q$, the power
spectrum of the accretion rate shows either one, two, or three distinct
periods; and (v) for $q \lesssim 0.05$, the accretion rate becomes steady, with
no time-variations. Most binaries produced in galactic mergers are expected to
have $q\gtrsim 0.05$. If the luminosity of these binaries tracks their
accretion rate, then a periodogram of their light-curve could help in their
identification, and to constrain their mass ratio and disk properties.

The 5:3 and 7:4 resonances have statistically the same color distribution as
the low inclination ""cold"" classical belt. The inner 4:3 and distant 5:2

scattered and detached disk populations. The 2:1 resonance, which is near the
outer edge of the main Kuiper Belt, has a large range of colors with similar
numbers of moderately red and ultra-red objects at all inclinations. The inner
3:2 resonance, like the outer 2:1, has a large range of objects from neutral to
ultra-red. The Neptune Trojans (1:1 resonance) are only slightly red, similar
to the Jupiter Trojans. The inner 5:4 resonance only has four objects with
measured colors but shows equal numbers of ultra-red and moderately red
objects. The 9:5, 12:5, 7:3, 3:1 and 11:3 resonances do not have reliable color
distribution statistics, though it appears noteworthy that all three of the
measured 3:1 objects have only moderately red colors, similar to the 4:3 and

disruption of the primordial Kuiper Belt from the scattering and migration of
the giant planets. The few low inclination objects known in the outer 2:1 and
5:2 resonances are mostly only moderately red. This suggests if the 2:1 and 5:2
have a cold low inclination component, the objects likely had a significantly
different origin than the ultra-red dominated cold components of the cold

the core accretion scenario in the hot and cold start assumption and what
minimum deuterium burning mass limit is found for these objects. We also study
how the burning process influences the structure and luminosity of the objects.
Furthermore we want to test and verify our results by comparing them to already
existing hot start simulations which did not consider, however, the formation
process.
  Methods. We present a new method to calculate deuterium burning of objects in
a self-consistently coupled model of planet formation and evolution. We discuss
which theory is used to describe the process of deuterium burning and how it
was implemented.
  Results. We find that the objects forming according to a hot start scenario
behave approximately in the same way as found in previous works of evolutionary
calculations, which did not consider the formation. However, for cold start
objects one finds that the objects expand during deuterium burning instead of
being partially stabilized against contraction. In both cases, hot and cold
start, the mass of the solid core has an influence on the minimum mass limit of
deuterium burning. The general position of the mass limit, 13 MJ, stays however
approximately the same. None of the investigated parameters was able to change
this mass limit by more than 0.8 MJ. Due to deuterium burning, the luminosity
of hot and cold start objects becomes comparable after ~ 200 Myrs.

existence of the leptonic RPV operators $LLE^c$ and $LQD^c$, and a vacuum
structure where one of the left-handed sneutrinos acquires a significant

The model can be naturally consistent with bounds from electroweak precision
measurements and flavor-changing processes. It can also easily accommodate the
recently measured Higgs mass due to the existence of a scalar triplet that
couples to the Higgs with an order one coupling, with only moderate
fine-tuning. The phenomenology is rather rich and distinctive, with features
such as heavy-but-natural Dirac gauginos, relaxed bounds on squarks, resonant
slepton/sneutrino production, lepto-quark signals, as well as an interesting

collisional channels that involve binary stars. More specifically, using the
previously reported correlation between blue straggler numbers and core mass as
a benchmark, we test for correlations with the number of binary stars, as well
as with the rates of single-single, single-binary, and binary-binary
encounters. Surprisingly, we find that the simple correlation with core mass
remains by far the strongest predictor of blue straggler population size, even
in our joint models. This is despite the fact that the binary fractions
themselves strongly anti-correlate with core mass, just as expected in the
binary evolution model. At first sight, these results do not fit neatly with
either binary evolution or collisional models in their simplest forms. Arguably
the simplest and most intriguing possibility to explain this unexpected result
is that observational errors on the core binary fractions are larger than the
true intrinsic dispersion associated with their dependence on core mass. In the
context of the binary evolution model, this would explain why the combination
of binary fraction and core mass is a poorer predictor of blue straggler
numbers than core mass alone. It would also imply that core mass is a
remarkably clean predictor of core binary fractions. This would be of
considerable importance for the dynamical evolution of globular clusters, and
provides an important benchmark for models attempting to understand their

blue (presumably star-forming) galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the
range 0.2 < z < 1.4 from the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International
Survey (AEGIS). This consists in the Bayesian analysis of the observed galaxy
spectral energy distributions with a comprehensive library of synthetic spectra
assembled using realistic, hierarchical star formation and chemical enrichment
histories from cosmological simulations. We constrain the SFH of each galaxy in
our sample by comparing the observed fluxes in the B, R, I and Ks bands and
rest-frame optical emission-line luminosities with those of one million model
spectral energy distributions. We explore the dependence of the resulting SFHs
on galaxy stellar mass and redshift. We find that the average SFHs of high-mass
galaxies rise and fall in a roughly symmetric bell-shaped manner, while those
of low-mass galaxies rise progressively in time, consistent with the typically
stronger activity of star formation in low-mass compared to high-mass galaxies.
For galaxies of all masses, the star formation activity rises more rapidly at
high than at low redshift. These findings imply that the standard approximation
of exponentially declining SFHs widely used to interpret observed galaxy
spectral energy distributions may not be appropriate to constrain the physical
parameters of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts.

between disc radius and dust temperature that depends on the grain size
distribution and optical properties. By resolving the disc we can measure the
actual location of the dust. The launch of Herschel, with an angular resolution
superior to previous far-infrared telescopes, allows us to spatially resolve
more discs and locate the dust directly. Here we present the nine resolved
discs around A stars between 20 and 40 pc observed by the DEBRIS survey. We use
these data to investigate the disc radii by fitting narrow ring models to
images at 70, 100 and 160 {\mu}m and by fitting blackbodies to full spectral
energy distributions. We do this with the aim of finding an improved way of
estimating disc radii for unresolved systems. The ratio between the resolved
and blackbody radii varies between 1 and 2.5. This ratio is inversely
correlated with luminosity and any remaining discrepancies are most likely
explained by differences to the minimum size of grain in the size distribution
or differences in composition. We find that three of the systems are well fit

populations on a few hundred parsec scale in 100+ galaxies of all types. These
observations enable us to relate detailed studies of star formation in the
Milky Way to the zoo of galaxies in the distant universe. Within the disks of
spiral galaxies, recent star formation strongly scales with the local amount of
molecular gas (as traced by CO) with a molecular gas depletion time of ~2 Gyr.
This is consistent with the picture that stars form in giant molecular clouds
that have about universal properties. Galaxy centers and starbursting galaxies
deviate from this normal trend as they show enhanced star formation per unit
gas mass suggesting systematic changes in the molecular gas properties and
especially the dense gas fraction. In the outer disks of spirals and in dwarf
galaxies, the decreasing availability of atomic gas inevitably limits the
amount of star formation, though with large local variations. The critical step
for the gas-stars circle seems therefore the formation of a molecular gas phase
that shows complex dependencies on various environmental properties and are
nowadays investigated by intensive simulational work.

scattering of order one hundred photons. In our experiment, this seeded motion
is subsequently amplified and then analyzed by Doppler velocimetry. Since the
coherent oscillation is conditional upon the internal quantum state of the ion,
this motional excitation technique could be useful in atomic or molecular
single-ion spectroscopy experiments, providing a simple protocol for state
readout of non-fluorescing ions with partially closed-cycle transitions.

points to a paucity of new particles near the weak scale. This suggests that
the weak scale is tuned and that supersymmetry, if present at all, is realized
at higher energies. The measured Higgs mass constrains the scalar sparticles to
be below 10^5 TeV, while gauge coupling unification favors Higgsinos below 100
TeV. Nevertheless, in many models gaugino masses are suppressed and remain
within reach of the LHC. Tuning the weak scale and the renormalization group
evolution of the scalar masses constrain Split model building. Due to the small
gaugino masses, either the squarks or the up-higgs often run tachyonic; in the
latter case, successful electroweak breaking requires heavy higgsinos near the

to be 0.342 +/- 0.008 mas; this is the smallest interferometrically measured
stellar diameter to date, with an error of only 2%. By combining our
measurement with the star's parallax and photometry from the literature, we
greatly improve upon previous estimates of its fundamental parameters,
including stellar radius (1.44 +/- 0.06 R_Sun), effective temperature (7193 +/-
87 K, consistent with F0), luminosity (5.05 +/- 0.29 L_Sun), and the extent of
the habitable zone (1.62 AU to 3.32 AU). These improved stellar properties
permit much more precise comparisons with stellar evolutionary models, from
which a mass and age can be determined, once the metallicity of the star is
known. Considering the observational properties of other lambda Bootis stars
and the indirect evidence for youth of HR 8799, we argue that the internal
abundance, and what we refer to as the effective abundance, is most likely
near-solar. Finally, using the Yonsei-Yale evolutionary models with uniformly
scaled solar-like abundances, we estimate HR 8799's mass and age considering
two possibilities: 1.516 +0.038/-0.024 M_Sun and 33 +7/-13 Myr if the star is
contracting toward the zero age main-sequence or 1.513 +0.023/-0.024 M_Sun and
90 +381/-50 Myr if it is expanding from it. This improved estimate of HR 8799's
age with realistic uncertainties provides the best constraints to date on the
masses of its orbiting companions, and strongly suggests they are indeed
planets. They nevertheless all appear to orbit well outside the habitable zone
of this young star.

processes or Poisson cluster processes on the plane. The Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) of the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio

shown that the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) converges to a deterministic
non-zero value if the number of antennas at the representative receiver
increases linearly with the nominal interferer density. This indicates that to
the extent that the system assumptions hold, it is possible to scale such
networks by increasing the number of receiver antennas linearly with user
density. The results presented here are useful in characterizing the
performance of multiantenna wireless networks with non-homogenous spatial node
distributions and networks with clusters of users which often arise in

2HDM signals, we employ the combination of many exclusive multi-lepton search
channels to probe the collective signal from the totality of production and
decay processes. Multi-lepton signals of 2HDMs can arise from a variety of
sources, including Standard Model-like production of the CP-even scalars, $h$
and $H$, through gluon-fusion with $h,H \to ZZ^{(*)}$, or associated production
with vector bosons or top quarks, with $h,H \to WW^{(*)}, ZZ^{(*)},\tau\tau$.
Additional sources include gluon-fusion production of the heavy CP-even scalar
with decays through the light CP-even scalar, the CP-odd scalar, $A$, or the
charged scalar, $H^\pm$, such as $H \to hh$, $H \to AA$, $H \to H^+ H^-$, $H

ZZ^*,\tau\tau$. Altogether, the combined multi-lepton signal may greatly exceed
that of the Standard Model Higgs boson and provides a sensitive probe of
extended Higgs sectors. As a proof of principle, we use a factorized mapping
procedure between model parameters and signatures to determine multi-lepton
sensitivities in four different flavor conserving 2HDM parameter spaces by
simulating the acceptance times efficiency in 20 exclusive multi-lepton
channels for 222 independent production and decay topologies that arise for
four benchmark 2HDM spectra within each parameter space. A comparison of these
sensitivities with the results of a multi-lepton search conducted by the CMS

it shows an [alpha/Fe] ratio slightly under solar ([alpha/Fe] ~ -0.1 dex). This
population was probably originated by the main star formation event occurred
3-4 Gyr ago (possibly triggered by tidal capture of the Small Magellanic
Cloud). The other component (comprising ~ 16% of the sample) is peaked at
[Fe/H] ~ -1 dex and it shows an [alpha/Fe] ~ 0.2 dex. This population was
probably generated during the long quiescent epoch of star formation in between
the first episode and the most recent bursts. Indeed, in our sample we do not
find stars with chemical properties similar to the old LMC globular clusters

the ionisation state of the gas, size and luminosity of extended narrow line

ionisation from the QSO, as well as the kinematics of the ionised gas. We
detect EELRs around 19 of our 31 QSOs (61%) after deblending the unresolved QSO
emission and the extended host galaxy light in the integral field data. We
identify 13 EELRs to be entirely ionised by the QSO radiation, 3 EELRs are
composed of HII regions and 3 EELRs display signatures of both ionisation
mechanisms at different locations. The typical size of the ENLR is 10kpc at a
median nuclear [OIII] luminosity of log(L([OIII])/[erg/s])=42.7+-0.15. We show
that the ENLR sizes are least a factor of 2 larger than determined with HST,
but are consistent with those of recently reported type 2 QSOs at matching
[OIII] luminosities. The ENLR of type 1 and type 2 QSOs appear to follow the
same size-luminosity relation. Furthermore, we show for the first time that the
ENLR size is much better correlated with the QSO continuum luminosity than with
the total/nuclear [OIII] luminosity. We show that ENLR luminosity and radio
luminosity are correlated, and argue that radio jets even in radio-quiet QSOs
are important for shaping the properties of the ENLR. Strikingly, the
kinematics of the ionised gas is quiescent and likely gravitationally driven in
the majority of cases and we find only 3 objects with radial gas velocities
exceeding 400km/s in specific regions of the EELR that can be associate with
radio jets. In general, these are significantly lower outflow velocities and
detection rates compared to starburst galaxies or radio-loud QSOs.

  Rateless Codes","36 pages, 5 figures, to be submitted to IEEE Trans. on Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new coding scheme for image transmission over noisy channel is proposed.
Similar to standard image compression, the scheme includes a linear transform
followed by successive refinement scalar quantization. Unlike conventional
schemes, in the proposed system the quantized transform coefficients are
linearly mapped into channel symbols using systematic linear encoders. This
fixed-to-fixed length ""linear index coding"" approach avoids the use of an
explicit entropy coding stage (e.g., arithmetic or Huffman coding), which is
typically fragile to channel post-decoding residual errors. We use linear codes
over GF(4), which are particularly suited for this application, since they are
matched to the dead-zone quantizer symbol alphabet and to the QPSK modulation
used on the deep-space communication channel. We optimize the proposed system
where the linear codes are systematic Raptor codes over GF(4). The rateless
property of Raptor encoders allows to achieve a ""continuum"" of coding rates, in
order to accurately match the channel coding rate to the transmission channel
capacity and to the quantized source entropy rate for each transform subband
and refinement level. Comparisons are provided with respect to the
concatenation of state-of-the-art image coding and channel coding schemes used
by Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL) for the Mars Exploration Rover (MER)

order quadratures (ROQ) for multiple fast evaluations of weighted inner
products between parameterized functions. If a reduced basis (RB) or any other
projection-based model reduction technique is applied, the dimensionality of
integrands is reduced dramatically; however, the cost of approximating the
integrands by projection still scales as the size of the original problem. In
contrast, using discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) points as ROQ nodes
leads to a computational cost which depends linearly on the dimension of the
reduced space. Generation of a reduced basis via a greedy procedure requires a
training set, which for products of functions can be very large. Since this
direct approach can be impractical in many applications, we propose instead a
two-step greedy targeted towards approximation of such products. We present
numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and the efficiency of the
two-step approach. The presented ROQ are expected to display very fast
convergence whenever there is regularity with respect to parameter variation.
We find that for the particular application here considered, one driven by
gravitational wave physics, the two-step approach speeds up the offline
computations to build the ROQ by more than two orders of magnitude.
Furthermore, the resulting ROQ rule is found to converge exponentially with the
number of nodes, and a factor of ~50 savings, without loss of accuracy, is
observed in evaluations of inner products when ROQ are used as a downsampling
strategy for equidistant samples using the trapezoidal rule. While the primary
focus of this paper is on quadrature rules for inner products of parameterized
functions, our method can be easily adapted to integrations of single
parameterized functions, and some examples of this type are considered.

integrals are integrals of splines on a hyperbolic slice of the cone, yielding
polytopes in $AdS$ space. Splines thus give a geometrical counterpart to the
rational function identities at the level of the integrand. Spline technology
also allows for a clear, simple, algebraic decomposition of higher point loop
integrals in lower dimensional kinematics in terms of lower point integrals -
e.g. an hexagon integral in 2d kinematics can be written as a sum of scalar
boxes. Higher loops can also be understood directly in terms of splines - they
map onto spline convolutions, leading to an intriguing representation in terms
of hyperbolic simplices integrated over other hyperbolic simplices. We finish
with speculations on the interpretation of one-loop integrals as partition
functions, inspired by the use of splines in counting points in polytopes.

gravitational waves), a linear transformation exists that transforms the timing
residuals to a basis in which virtually all the information about the

energy per particle and the response to weak probes, are computed, studying the
effects of three nucleon interactions. Both the variational approach, based on
the formalism of correlated basis function, and the auxiliary field diffusion
Monte Carlo method have been used. A scheme suitable to construct a
density-dependent two-nucleon potential in correlated basis approach is
discussed. The density dependent potential resulting from UIX three-nucleon
force has been employed in auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo calculations
that turned out to be in very good agreement with correlated basis variational
results. Hence, the underbinding of symmetric nuclear matter has to be ascribed
to deficiencies of the UXI potential. A comparative analysis of the equations
of state of both pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter obtained
using a new generation of ""chiral inspired"" local three-body potentials has
been performed. These potentials provide an excellent description of the
properties of light nuclei, as well as of the neutron-deuteron doublet
scattering length. The weak response of symmetric nuclear matter has been
computed at three-body cluster level. Two-body effective interactions and
one-body effective operators have been derived within the formalism of
correlated basis functions. The inclusion of the three-body cluster term in the
effective interaction allowed for a direct inclusion of the UIX three-nucleon
potential. Moreover, the sizable unphysical dependence of the effective weak
operator is removed once the three-body cluster term is taken into account.

allows the formulation of RDF triples-based queries. Both these approaches are
being used in parallel by a team of cell biologists in their daily research
activities, with the objective of gradually replacing the conventional approach

effective ways of translating a question in a researcher's mind into precise

finite (small) chain structure, since the infinite chain structure is a
considerably cumbersome task. Therefore, the quantum entanglement properties
involving an infinite chain structure is quite important, not only because the
mathematical calculation is cumbersome but also because real materials are well
represented by an infinite chain. Thus, in this paper we consider an entangled
diamond chain with Ising and anisotropic Heisenberg (Ising-XXZ) coupling. Two
interstitial particles are coupled through Heisenberg coupling or simply
two-qubit Heisenberg, which could be responsible for the emergence of
entanglement. These two-qubit Heisenberg operators are interacted with two
nodal Ising spins. An infinite diamond chain is organized by
interstitial-interstitial and nodal-interstitial (dimer-monomer) site
couplings. We are able to get the thermal average of the two-qubit operator,
called the reduced two-qubit density operator. Since these density operators
are spatially separated, we could obtain the concurrence (entanglement)
directly in the thermodynamic limit. The thermal entanglement (concurrence) is
constructed for different values of the anisotropic Heisenberg parameter,
magnetic field and temperature. We also observed the threshold temperature via
the parameter of anisotropy, Heisenberg and Ising interaction, external
magnetic field, and temperature.

when dealing with both the finiteness of the effective four-dimensional (4d)
Planck mass and the localization of 4d gravity, which can be stated by the
requirement that $\int e^{-2f(\sigma)}d\sigma < \infty$, because this condition
necessarily implies that c_1 and c_2 should be positive. As a consequence of
this fact the tachyonic field $T$ turns out to be complex in contradiction with
the real nature of the starting action for the tachyonic braneworld. Conversely
if one requires to have a real tachyon field, 4d gravity will not be localized
and the effective gravitational coupling will be infinite. We present several
typical examples where this problem occurs: we have analysed this situation for
thin as well as thick tachyonic braneworlds with 4d Poincare symmetry, for the
case when a bulk cosmological constant is present, and even for a brane with an
induced spatially flat 4d cosmological background, and shown that in all cases
the tachyon field T comes out to be inconsistently complex when imposing
localization of 4d gravity. On the other hand, when dealing with a further
reduction of the hierarchy problem one should carefully consider the sign of
the constants c_1 and c_2 to avoid inconsistencies in the tachyonic braneworld
model. We also present a similar discusion involving a canonical scalar field
in the bulk where none of these problems arise and hence, the mass hierarchy
and 4d gravity localization problems can be successfully addressed at once.
Finally, the stability analysis of this scalar tensor braneworld model with a
super-exponential warp factor is performed.

still not sufficiently understood, our capacity to predict the occurrence of
solar eruptions and to forecast space weather is substantially hindered. Even
though various models have been proposed to determine the onset of solar
eruptions, the types of magnetic structures capable of triggering these
eruptions are still unclear. In this study, we solved this problem by
systematically surveying the nonlinear dynamics caused by a wide variety of
magnetic structures in terms of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
simulations. As a result, we determined that two different types of small
magnetic structures favor the onset of solar eruptions. These structures, which
should appear near the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL), include magnetic
fluxes reversed to the potential component or the nonpotential component of
major field on the PIL. In addition, we analyzed two large flares, the X-class
flare on December 13, 2006 and the M-class flare on February 13, 2011, using
imaging data provided by the Hinode satellite, and we demonstrated that they
conform to the simulation predictions. These results suggest that forecasting
of solar eruptions is possible with sophisticated observation of a solar
magnetic field, although the lead time must be limited by the time scale of
changes in the small magnetic structures.

particle density and current for TASEP with spatially inhomogeneous jump rates
given by a speed function that may admit discontinuities. The limiting density
profiles are described with a variational formula. This formula enables us to
compute explicit density profiles even though we have no information about the

cosmological information, complementary to the WL power spectrum. This has
recently been demonstrated using N-body simulations which neglect baryonic
effects. Here we employ ray-tracing N-body simulations in which we manually
steepen the density profile of each dark matter halo, mimicking the cooling and
concentration of baryons into dark matter potential wells. We find, in
agreement with previous works, that this causes a significant increase in the
amplitude of the WL power spectrum on small scales (spherical harmonic index
l>1,000). We then study the impact of the halo concentration increase on the
peak counts, and find the following. (i) Low peaks (with convergence 0.02 <
kappa_peak < 0.08), remain nearly unaffected. These peaks are created by a
constellation of several halos with low masses (10^12-10^13 M_sun) and large
angular offsets from the peak center (> 0.5 R_vir); as a result, they are
insensitive to the central halo density profiles. These peaks contain most of
the cosmological information, and thus provide an unusually sensitive and
unbiased probe. (ii) The number of high peaks (with convergence kappa_peak >
0.08) is increased. However, when the baryon effects are neglected in
cosmological parameter estimation, then the high peaks lead to a modest bias,
comparable to that from the power spectrum on relatively large-scales (l<2000),
and much smaller than the bias from the power spectrum on smaller scales
(l>2,000). (iii) In the 3D parameter space (sigma_8, Omega_m, w), the biases
from the high peaks and the power spectra are in different directions. This
suggests the possibility of ""self-calibration"": the combination of peak counts
and power spectrum can simultaneously constrain baryonic physics and
cosmological parameters.

NGC 4565 exhibits a distinctly warped and asymmetric disk with a flaring layer.
Our modeling provides no evidence for a massive, extended HI halo. We see
evidence for a bar and associated radial motions. Additionally, there are
indications of radial motions within the disk, possibly associated with a ring
of higher density. We see a substantial decrease in rotational velocity with
height above the plane of the disk (a lag) of -40 +5/-20 km/s/kpc and -30

is only seen within the inner ~4.75' (14.9 kpc) on the approaching half and
~4.25' (13.4 kpc) on the receding, making this a radially shallowing lag, which

Quantum
entanglement plays a fundamental role in many applications of quantum
information theory, such as quantum teleportation. Stochastic local quantum
operations and classical communication (SLOCC) cannot essentially change
quantum entanglement without destroying it. Therefore, entanglement can be
classified by dividing quantum states into equivalence classes, where two
states are equivalent if each can be converted into the other by SLOCC.
Properties of this classification, especially in the case of non
two-dimensional quantum systems, have not been well studied. Graphical
representation is sometimes used to clarify the nature and structural features
of entangled states. SLOCC equivalence of quantum bits (qubits) has been
described graphically via a connection between tripartite entangled qubit
states and commutative Frobenius algebras (CFAs) in monoidal categories. In
this paper, we extend this method to qutrits, i.e., systems that have three
basis states. We examine the correspondence between CFAs and tripartite
entangled qutrits. Using the symmetry property, which is required by the
definition of a CFA, we find that there are only three equivalence classes that
correspond to CFAs. We represent qutrits graphically, using the connection to
CFAs. We derive equations that characterize the three equivalence classes.
Moreover, we show that any qutrit can be represented as a composite of three
graphs that correspond to the three classes.

leading approximation) the matrix elements of the proton current J^{\pm

number of the spin-flipped quarks, which contribute to the proton transition
without spin-flip (J^{\delta,\delta}_p) and with the spin-flip

first number in parentheses is the number of the spin-flipped quarks, which
contribute to the J^{\delta,\delta}_p, and the second one is the number of the
spin-flipped quarks which contribute to the J^{-\delta,\delta}_p. For the sets
of (0,1) and (2,3), we found that the ratio G_E/G_M ~ 1, and the form factors
G_E and G_M behave for the set of (0,1) as G_E, G_M ~ 1/Q^6, and for the set of

suppose that: 1) at the lower boundary of the experimental measurements of the
ratio G_E/G_M not dipole dependence appears but the law of G_E, G_M ~ 1/Q^6; 2)
the conditions for the observation of the dipole dependence in the experiments
has not yet been achieved; 3) since for quarks J^{\delta,\delta}_q ~ 1 and

substrate are demonstrated for operation at terahertz frequencies. Based on the
relation between the patch size and the reflection phase, a progressive phase
distribution is implemented on the patch array to create a reflector able to
deflect an incident beam towards a predefined angle off the specular direction.
In order to confirm the validity of the design, a set of reflectarrays each
with periodically distributed 360*360 patch elements are fabricated and
measured. The experimental results obtained through terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy (THz-TDS) show that up to nearly 80% of the incident amplitude is
deflected into the desired direction at an operation frequency close to 1 THz.
The radiation patterns of the reflectarray in TM and TE polarizations are also
obtained at different frequencies. This work presents an attractive concept for
developing components able to efficiently manipulate terahertz radiation for
emerging terahertz communications.

the cloud. Security concerns that arise when outsourcing data and computation
to the cloud include data confidentiality and privacy. Given that a tremendous
amount of data is being generated everyday from plethora of devices equipped
with sensing capabilities, we focus on the problem of access controls over live
streams of data based on triggers or sliding windows, which is a distinct and
more challenging problem than access control over archival data. Specifically,
we investigate secure mechanisms for outsourcing access control enforcement for
stream data to the cloud. We devise a system that allows data owners to specify
fine-grained policies associated with their data streams, then to encrypt the
streams and relay them to the cloud for live processing and storage for future
use. The access control policies are enforced by the cloud, without the latter
learning about the data, while ensuring that unauthorized access is not
feasible. To realize these ends, we employ a novel cryptographic primitive,
namely proxy-based attribute-based encryption, which not only provides security
but also allows the cloud to perform expensive computations on behalf of the
users. Our approach is holistic, in that these controls are integrated with an
XML based framework (XACML) for high-level management of policies. Experiments
with our prototype demonstrate the feasibility of such mechanisms, and early
evaluations suggest graceful scalability with increasing numbers of policies,
data streams and users.

representing an experimentally feasible way of entangling two nanomechanical

$^3$He at heterogeneity of the substrate. We also measured the Larmor frequency
dependence of $T_2$ at $\rho = 5.28$ nm$^{-2}$. $1/T_2$ has a $f$-linear
dependence similarly to the earlier study on a first layer solid $^3$He. From a
comparison between our result and the earlier one, this linearity is almost
independent of the particle motion. Now, it could be caused by a microscopic
magnetic field inhomogeneity arisen from the mosaic angle spread and
diamagnetism of the graphite substrate.

relation between period derivatives and orbital periods. There are some systems
showing positive period derivatives despite the long orbital periods. We
observed the 2011 outburst of the WZ Sge-type dwarf nova BW Scl, and recorded
an O-C diagram similar to those of previously known WZ Sge-type dwarf novae.
The WZ Sge-type dwarf nova OT J184228.1+483742 showed an unusual pattern of
double outbursts composed of an outburst with early superhumps and one with
ordinary superhumps. We propose an interpretation that a very small growth rate
of the 3:1 resonance due to an extremely low mass-ratio led to a quenching of
the superoutburst before the ordinary superhumps appeared. We studied ER
UMa-type dwarf novae and found that V1159 Ori showed positive superhumps
similar to ER UMa in the 1990s. The recently recognized ER UMa-type object BK
Lyn dominantly showed negative superhumps, and its behavior was very similar to
the present-day state of ER UMa. The pattern of period variations in AM
CVn-type objects were very similar to short-period hydrogen-rich SU UMa-type
dwarf novae, making them helium analogue of hydrogen-rich SU UMa-type dwarf
novae. SBS 1108+574, a peculiar hydrogen-rich dwarf nova below the period
minimum, showed a very similar pattern of period variations to those of
short-period SU UMa-type dwarf novae. The mass-ratio derived from the detected
orbital period suggests that this secondary is a somewhat evolved star whose
hydrogen envelope was mostly stripped during the mass-exchange. CC Scl, MASTER
OT J072948.66+593824.4 and OT J173516.9+154708 showed only low-amplitude
superhumps with complex profiles. These superhumps are likely a combination of
closely separated two periods.

in a discussion with Bohr and Rosenfeld just after the news of the discovery of
the neutron reached Copenhagen in February 1932. We present arguments that the

that they in fact discussed the paper written by Landau in Zurich in February
1931 but not published until February 1932 (Phys. Z. Sowjetunion, 1, 285). In
his paper Landau mentioned the possible existence of dense stars which look
like one giant nucleus; this can be regarded as an early theoretical prediction
or anticipation of neutron stars, prior to the discovery of the neutron. The
coincidence of the dates of the neutron's discovery and the paper's publication
has led to an erroneous association of the paper with the discovery of the
neutron. In passing, we outline the contribution of Landau to the theory of
white dwarfs and to the hypothesis of stars with neutron cores.

that non propagating electric fields are generated at the locus of the Alfv\'en

significant perturbation of the plasma density. The non-linear interaction of
down and up-going Alfv\'en waves might be a cause of plasma density
fluctuations (with gradients along the magnetic field) on a scale comparable to

communities consists in modelling signals as sparse linear combinations of
atoms selected from a learned dictionary. While this paradigm has led to
numerous empirical successes in various fields ranging from image to audio
processing, there have only been a few theoretical arguments supporting these
evidences. In particular, sparse coding, or sparse dictionary learning, relies
on a non-convex procedure whose local minima have not been fully analyzed yet.
In this paper, we consider a probabilistic model of sparse signals, and show
that, with high probability, sparse coding admits a local minimum around the
reference dictionary generating the signals. Our study takes into account the
case of over-complete dictionaries and noisy signals, thus extending previous
work limited to noiseless settings and/or under-complete dictionaries. The
analysis we conduct is non-asymptotic and makes it possible to understand how
the key quantities of the problem, such as the coherence or the level of noise,

the problem of building a surrogate model of a complex computer code which can

a promising tool to build such an approximation. The idea is to improve the

present here a new approach to perform a multi-fidelity co-kriging model which
is based on a recursive formulation. The strength of this new method is that
the co-kriging model is built through a series of independent kriging models.
From them, some properties of classical kriging models can naturally be
extended to the presented co-kriging model such as a fast cross-validation
procedure. Moreover, based on a Bayes linear formulation, an extension of the
universal kriging equations are provided for the co-kriging model. Finally, the
proposed model has the advantage to reduce the computational complexity

applied to emulate a hydrodynamic simulator. This real example illustrates the
efficiency of the recursive model.

data may help us to detect, manage and control an outbreak. The identification
of robust spreading features of the system is however hampered by the temporal
dimension characterizing population interactions through movements. Traditional
centrality measures do not provide relevant information as results strongly
fluctuate in time and outbreak properties heavily depend on geotemporal initial
conditions. By focusing on the case study of cattle displacements in Italy, we
aim at characterizing livestock epidemics in terms of robust features useful
for planning and control, to deal with temporal fluctuations, sensitivity to
initial conditions and missing information during an outbreak. Through spatial
disease simulations, we detect spreading paths that are stable across different
initial conditions, allowing the clustering of the seeds and reducing the
epidemic variability. Paths also allow us to identify premises, called
sentinels, having a large probability of being infected and providing critical
information on the outbreak origin, as encoded in the clusters. This novel
procedure provides a general framework that can be applied to specific
diseases, for aiding risk assessment analysis and informing the design of

users independently access the wireless link on a slot basis with a predefined
probability, resulting in a distribution of user transmissions over slots,
based on which the estimation and contention resolution are performed.
Specifically, the contention resolution is performed using successive
interference cancellation which, coupled with the use of the optimized access
probabilities, enables throughputs that are substantially higher than the
traditional slotted ALOHA-like protocols. The key feature of the proposed
protocol is that the round durations are not a priori set and they are
terminated when the estimation/contention-resolution performance reach the
satisfactory levels.

characteristic mass of star formation. Ambipolar diffusion (AD) is considered
one of the most important heating mechanisms in weakly ionized molecular
clouds. In this work, we study the AD heating rate using 2-fluid turbulence
simulations and compare it with the overall heating rate due to turbulent
dissipation. We find that for observed molecular clouds, which typically have
Alfven Mach numbers of ~1 (Crutcher 1999) and AD Reynolds numbers of ~20 (McKee
et al. 2010), about 70% of the total turbulent dissipation is in the form of AD
heating. AD has an important effect on the length scale where energy is
dissipated: when AD heating is strong, most of the energy in the cascade is
removed by ion-neutral drift, with a comparatively small amount of energy
making it down to small scales. We derive a relation for the AD heating rate
that describes the results of our simulations to within a factor of two.
Turbulent dissipation, including AD heating, is generally less important that
cosmic-ray heating in molecular clouds, although there is substantial scatter
in both.

designed to produce a desired effect. For regression methods with squared error
loss, an $\ell_1$ penalty produces a regression which is robust to outliers and
high leverage cases; for quantile regression methods, an $\ell_2$ penalty
decreases the variance of the fit enough to overcome an increase in bias. The
paradigm thus allows us to robustify procedures which lack robustness and to
increase the efficiency of procedures which are robust. We provide a general
framework for the inclusion of case-specific parameters in regularization
problems, describing the impact on the effective loss for a variety of
regression and classification problems. We outline a computational strategy by
which existing software can be modified to solve the augmented regularization

the most popular approach to fractional calculus among physicists, since

the fractional calculus of variations is currently in fast development.
However, all current formulations for the fractional variational calculus fail

localized-delocalized DPT. In this work we show how to take advantage of DPTs

follow the so called universal plasmon ruler equation [Nano Letters 2007, 7,

means that a signal should only be observed when the control/measured

last years, in order to address several open problems in modern physics, there
is a specific one involving a tachyonic bulk scalar field. Delving into this
framework, a thick braneworld with a cosmological background induced on the
brane is here investigated. The respective field equations --- derived from the
model with a warped 5D geometry --- are highly non-linear equations, admitting
a non-trivial solution for the warp factor and the tachyon scalar field as
well, in a de Sitter 4D cosmological background. Moreover, the non-linear
tachyonic scalar field, that generates the brane in complicity with warped
gravity, has the form of a kink-like configuration. Notwithstanding, the
non-linear field equations restricting character does not allow one to easily
find thick brane solutions with a decaying warp factor which leads to the
localization of 4D gravity and other matter fields. We derive such a thick
brane configuration altogether in this tachyon-gravity setup. When analyzing
the spectrum of gravity fluctuations in the transverse traceless sector, the 4D
gravity is shown to be localized due to the presence of a {\it single} zero
mode bound state, separated by a continuum of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes
by a mass gap. It contrasts with previous results, where there is a KK massive
bound excitation providing no clear physical interpretation. The mass gap is
determined by the scale of the metric parameter $H$. Finally, the corrections
to Newton's law in this model are computed and shown to decay exponentially. It
is in full compliance to corrections reported in previous results (up to a
constant factor) within similar braneworlds with induced 4D de Sitter metric,
despite the fact that the warp factor and the massive modes have a different
form.

analyses around. For theories with f(R)=R^n we find that no known spherically

extracting relevant DDI signals from either the published literature or large

translational research, the inclusion of literature mining methodologies in DDI
workflows is still very preliminary. One area that can benefit from literature
mining is the automatic identification of a large number of potential DDIs,
whose pharmacological mechanisms and clinical significance can then be studied
via in vitro pharmacology and in populo pharmaco-epidemiology. Experiments. We
implemented a set of classifiers for identifying published articles relevant to
experimental pharmacokinetic DDI evidence. These documents are important for
identifying causal mechanisms behind putative drug-drug interactions, an
important step in the extraction of large numbers of potential DDIs. We
evaluate performance of several linear classifiers on PubMed abstracts, under
different feature transformation and dimensionality reduction methods. In
addition, we investigate the performance benefits of including various
publicly-available named entity recognition features, as well as a set of
internally-developed pharmacokinetic dictionaries. Results. We found that
several classifiers performed well in distinguishing relevant and irrelevant
abstracts. We found that the combination of unigram and bigram textual features
gave better performance than unigram features alone, and also that
normalization transforms that adjusted for feature frequency and document
length improved classification. For some classifiers, such as linear
discriminant analysis (LDA), proper dimensionality reduction had a large impact
on performance. Finally, the inclusion of NER features and dictionaries was
found not to help classification.

computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will
likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,
computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally
stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum
computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum
algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo
techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum
computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to
revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be
generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine
random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up
median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This
paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and
quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and
quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much
faster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical
framework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.

crossed numerous magnetized interstellar clouds and bubbles of different sizes
and contents on its path through the Milky Way. Having a reference model for
how the heliosphere and interstellar winds interact is critical for
understanding our current Galactic environment, and it requires untangling the
roles of two major actors: the time-variable solar wind and the local
interstellar magnetic field. Numerical simulations predict a distortion of the
heliosphere caused by both solar wind anisotropy and interstellar magnetic
field orientation. However, model comparison to deep space probes' measurements
led to contradictory reports by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 of both several
crossings of the solar wind's termination shock and of the strength of the
local interstellar field, with values ranging from 1.8 to 5.7 {\mu}G. Here, we
show that Voyager 1 & 2 plasma, fields, and Lyman-{\alpha} sky background
measurements, as well as space observations of high-energy particles of
heliospheric origin, may all be explained by a rather weak interstellar field
2.2 +/- 0.1 {\mu}G pointing from Galactic coordinates (l,b) \sim (28, 52)+/-
3{\deg}. For the 2000 epoch Ulysses-based helium parameters assumed thus far,
the interstellar bow shock must exist. By contrast, using the 2010 epoch
IBEX-based He parameters and a stronger magnetic field leads to a plasma
configuration that is not consistent with the Voyagers TS crossings. For the
newly proposed interstellar He parameters, more simulations are required before
one may determine whether the interstellar bow shock truly does disappear under
those assumptions.

widely assumed to exist in nature, it has proven difficult to implement a
minimum length scale covariantly. A key reason is that the presence of a fixed
minimum length would seem to contradict the ability of Lorentz transformations
to contract lengths. In this paper, we implement a fully covariant Planck scale
cutoff by cutting off the spectrum of the d'Alembertian. In this scenario,
consistent with Lorentz contractions, wavelengths that are arbitrarily smaller
than the Planck length continue to exist. However, the dynamics of modes of
wavelengths that are significantly smaller than the Planck length possess a
very small bandwidth. This has the effect of freezing the dynamics of such
modes. While both, wavelengths and bandwidths, are frame dependent, Lorentz
contraction and time dilation conspire to make the freezing of modes of
transplanckian wavelengths covariant. In particular, we show that this
ultraviolet cutoff can be implemented covariantly also in curved spacetimes. We
focus on Friedmann Robertson Walker (FRW) spacetimes and their much-discussed
transplanckian question: The physical wavelength of each comoving mode was
smaller than the Planck scale at sufficiently early times. What was the mode's
dynamics then? Here, we show that in the presence of the covariant UV cutoff,
the dynamical bandwidth of a comoving mode is essentially zero up until its
physical wavelength starts exceeding the Planck length. In particular, we show
that under general assumptions, the number of dynamical degrees of freedom of
each comoving mode all the way up to some arbitrary finite time is actually
finite. Our results also open the way to calculating the impact of this natural
UV cutoff on inflationary predictions for the CMB.

a similarity measure based on compression with dictionaries, the Fast
Compression Distance (FCD), which reduces the complexity of these methods,
without degradations in performance. On its basis a content-based color image

all orders is extended by considering the effective range correction in the
s-wave interaction and a (spin-independent) p-wave contact-interaction. A
two-component recursion generates the in-medium T-matrix at any order when
off-shell terms spoil the factorization of multi-loop diagrams. The resummation
to all orders is achieved in the form of a geometrical series for the
particle-particle ladders, and through an arctangent-function for the combined
particle-particle and hole-hole ladders. One finds that the effective range
correction changes the results in the limit of large scattering length
considerably, with the effect that the Bertsch parameter $\xi_n$ nearly
doubles. Applications to the equation of state of neutron matter at low density
are also discussed. For the p-wave contact-interaction the resummation to all
orders is facilitated by decomposing tensorial loop-integrals with a
transversal and a longitudinal projector. The enhanced attraction provided by
the p-wave ladder series has its origin mainly in the coherent sum of Hartree
and Fock contributions.

Imaging (ZDI) to asses whether correct reconstruction of magnetic fields is at
all possible without taking temperature into account for stars in which
magnetic and temperature inhomogeneities are spatially correlated. Methods: We
used a modern ZDI code employing a physically realistic treatment of the
polarized radiative transfer in all four Stokes parameters. We generated
artificial observations of isolated magnetic spots and of magnetic features
coinciding with cool temperature spots and then reconstructed magnetic and
temperature distributions from these data. Results: Using Stokes I and V for
simultaneous magnetic and temperature mapping for the star with a homogeneous
temperature distribution yields magnetic field strengths underestimated by
typically 10-15% relative to their true values. When temperature is kept
constant and Stokes I is not used for magnetic mapping, the underestimation is
30-60%. At the same time, the strength of magnetic field inside cool spots is
underestimated by as much as 80-95% and the spot geometry is also poorly
reconstructed when temperature variations are ignored. On the other hand, the
inversion quality is greatly improved when temperature variations are accounted
for in magnetic mapping. When using all four Stokes parameters the
reconstructed field strength inside cool spots is underestimated by 30-40% but
the spot geometry can be recovered very accurately compared to the experiments
with circular polarization alone. Conclusions: Reliable magnetic field
reconstruction for a star with high-contrast temperature spots is essentially
impossible if temperature inhomogeneities are ignored. A physically realistic
line profile modeling method, which simultaneously accounts for both types of
inhomogeneities, is required for meaningful ZDI of cool active stars.

this, a model of digital memory with each cell consisting of reflecting medium
with two reflectivities (each memory cell encoding the binary numbers 0 or 1)
is employed. The readout of binary memory essentially corresponds to
discrimination of two Bosonic attenuator channels characterized by different
reflectivities. The model requires an entire mathematical paraphernalia of
continuous variable Gaussian setting for its analysis, when arbitrary values of
reflectivities are considered. Here we restrict to a basic quantum read-out
mechanism with non-Gaussian entangled states of light, with the binary channels
to be discriminated being ideal memory characterized by reflectivity one i.e.,
an identity channel and thermal noise channel, where the signal light
illuminating the memory location gets completely lost (zero reflectivity) and
only a white thermal noise hitting the upper side of the memory reaches the
decoder. We compare the quantum reading efficiency of entangled light with any
classical source of light in this model. We show that entangled transmitters
offer better reading performance than any classical transmitters of light in
the regime of low signal intensity.

linear systems originate from the application of Newton's method on polynomial
systems. Newton's method is applied as a corrector in a path following method,
so the linear systems are solved in sequence and not simultaneously. One
solution path may require the solution of thousands of linear systems. In
previous work we reported good speedups with our implementation to evaluate and
differentiate polynomial systems on the NVIDIA Tesla C2050. Although the cost
of evaluation and differentiation often dominates the cost of linear system
solving in Newton's method, because of the limited bandwidth of the
communication between CPU and GPU, we cannot afford to send the linear system
to the CPU for solving during path tracking.
  Because of large degrees, the Jacobian matrix may contain extreme values,
requiring extended precision, leading to a significant overhead. This overhead
of multiprecision arithmetic is our main motivation to develop a massively
parallel algorithm. To allow overdetermined linear systems we solve linear
systems in the least squares sense, computing the QR decomposition of the
matrix by the modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm. We describe our implementation
of the modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method for the NVIDIA Tesla

clouds where stars and planets are forming. The low temperatures and high
extinctions of such clouds make direct observations of H3+ impossible, but lead
to large abundances of H2D+ and D2H+, which are very useful probes of the early
stages of star and planet formation. The ground-state rotational ortho-D2H+
111-000 transition at 1476.6 GHz in the prestellar core 16293E has been
searched for with the Herschel/HIFI instrument, within the CHESS (Chemical
HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions) Key Program. The line has not been
detected at the 21 mK km/s level (3 sigma integrated line intensity). We used
the ortho-H2D+ 110-111 transition and para-D2H+ 110-101 transition detected in
this source to determine an upper limit on the ortho-to-para D2H+ ratio as well
as the para-D2H+/ortho-H2D+ ratio from a non-LTE analysis. The comparison
between our chemical modeling and the observations suggests that the CO
depletion must be high (larger than 100), with a density between 5e5 and 1e6
cm-3. Also the upper limit on the ortho-D2H+ line is consistent with a low gas
temperature (~ 11 K) with a ortho-to-para ratio of 6 to 9, i.e. 2 to 3 times
higher than the value estimated from the chemical modeling, making it
impossible to detect this high frequency transition with the present state of
the art receivers.

It does not require any a priori information about the number of outliers. The
core of our algorithm is an intrinsic Conjugate Gradient method on the set of
orthogonal projection matrices, the so-called Grassmannian. Non-convex sparsity
measures are used for outlier detection, which leads to improved performance in
terms of robustly recovering and tracking the low-rank matrix. In particular,
our approach can cope with more outliers and with an underlying matrix of
higher rank than other state-of-the-art methods.

phenomenology of mixed clumps made with $\rm H_2 $ and WIMPs. Molecular clouds
built with clumps are efficient machines to transform smooth distributions of
WIMPs into concentrated networks. If WIMPs are neutralinos gravitationally
attracted in clumps of such molecular clouds, they may either enrich the baryon
sector over cosmological ages, or remain mixed with cold $\rm H_2 $ clouds
until the clumps evaporate either by collision or by stellar UV heating. A
phenomenological model based on an hypothetic dark baryonic component (DBC)
that was invoked in the past to explain one of the main drawbacks of CDM

DBC is replaced by a mix of $\rm H_2 $ and WIMPs, with a small fraction of HI

social media as communication channels. Some online social networks have become
extremely popular in the last decade. They differ among themselves in the
character of the service they provide to online users. For instance, Facebook
can be seen mainly as a platform for keeping in touch with close friends and
relatives, Twitter is used to propagate and receive news, LinkedIn facilitates
the maintenance of professional contacts, Flickr gathers amateurs and
professionals of photography, etc. Albeit different, all these online platforms
share an ingredient that pervades all their applications. There exists an
underlying social network that allows their users to keep in touch with each
other and helps to engage them in common activities or interactions leading to
a better fulfillment of the service's purposes. This is the reason why these
platforms share a good number of functionalities, e.g., personal communication
channels, broadcasted status updates, easy one-step information sharing, news
feeds exposing broadcasted content, etc. As a result, online social networks
are an interesting field to study an online social behavior that seems to be
generic among the different online services. Since at the bottom of these
services lays a network of declared relations and the basic interactions in
these platforms tend to be pairwise, a natural methodology for studying these
systems is provided by network science. In this chapter we describe some of the
results of research studies on the structure, dynamics and social activity in
online social networks. We present them in the interdisciplinary context of

emerged as a particularly important one in discerning the nature and evolution
of the Fermi surfaces of these enigmatic metals. In this article, we present a
comprehensive review of Hall effect measurements in the heavy-fermion
materials, and examine the success it has had in contributing to our current
understanding of strongly correlated matter. Particular emphasis is placed on
its utility in the investigation of quantum critical phenomena which are
thought to drive many of the exotic electronic ground states in these systems.
This is achieved by the description of measurements of the Hall effect across
the putative zero-temperature instability in the archetypal heavy-fermion metal
YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. Using the Ce$M$In$_5$ (with $M =$ Co, Ir) family of systems as
a paradigm, the influence of (antiferro-)magnetic fluctuations on the Hall
effect is also illustrated. This is compared to prior Hall effect measurements
in the cuprates and other strongly correlated systems to emphasize on the
generality of the unusual magnetotransport in materials with non-Fermi liquid
behavior.

width-first recognition is equal to or less than depth-first recognition in
general. The equivalence requires an underlying E value lattice to degenerate
into an MV algebra. We also study variants of ENTMs. ENTMs with a classical
initial state and ENTMs with a classical final state have the same power as
ENTMs with quantum initial and final states. In particular, the latter can be
simulated by ENTMs with classical transitions under a certain condition. Using
these findings, we prove that ENTMs are not equivalent to EDTMs and that ENTMs
are more powerful than EDTMs. This is a notable difference from the classical

numerical simulations: the chronology and the geometry of reionization is
investigated by means of merger histories of individual HII regions. From the
merger tree of ionized patches, one can track the individual evolution of the
regions properties such as e.g. their size, or the intensity of the percolation
process by looking at the formation rate, the frequency of mergers and the
number of individual HII regions involved in the mergers. We apply the merger
tree technique to simulations of reionization with three different kinds of
ionizing source models and two resolutions. Two of them use star particles as
ionizing sources. In this case we confront two emissivity evolutions for the
sources in order to reach the reionization at z ~ 6. As an alternative we built
a semi-analytical model where the dark matter halos extracted from the density
fields are assumed as ionizing sources. We then show how this methodology is a
good candidate to quantify the impact of the adopted star formation on the
history of the observed reionization. The semi-analytical model shows a
homogeneous reionization history with 'local' hierarchical growth steps for
individual HII regions. On the other hand auto-consistent models for star
formation tend to present fewer regions with a dominant region in size which
governs the fusion process early in the reionization at the expense of the
'local' reionizations. The differences are attenuated when the resolution of
the simulation is increased.

Galaxy and report the presence of dark features that coincide with dense
molecular clouds. Unlike infrared dark clouds, these features which we call
""radio dark clouds"" are produced by a deficiency in radio continuum emission
from molecular clouds that are embedded in a bath of UV radiation field or
synchrotron emitting cosmic ray particles. The contribution of the continuum
emission along different pathlengths results in dark features that trace
embedded molecular clouds. The new technique of identifying cold clouds can
place constraints on the depth and the magnetic field of molecular clouds when
compared to those of the surrounding hot plasma radiating at radio wavelengths.
The study of five molecular complexes in the inner Galaxy, Sgr A, Sgr B2, radio
Arc, the snake filament and G359.75-0.13 demonstrate an anti--correlation
between the distributions of radio continuum and molecular line and dust
emission. Radio dark clouds are identified in GBT maps and VLA images taken
with uniform sampling of {\it uv} coverage. The level at which the continuum
flux is suppressed in these sources suggests that the depth of the molecular
cloud is similar to the size of the continuum emission within a factor of two.
These examples suggest that high resolution, high dynamic range continuum
images can be powerful probes of interacting molecular clouds with massive
stars and supernova remnants in regions where the kinematic distance estimates
are ambiguous as well as in the nuclei of active galaxies.
