glass transition temperature T_g, is a prototypical example of non-stationary
out-of-equilibrium state. We characterize this state by evaluating its
""distance to equilibrium"", defined as the Shannon entropy difference \Delta S
(in absolute value) between the non-equilibrium state and the equilibrium state
with the same energy. We consider the time evolution of \Delta S and show that,
rather unexpectedly, \Delta S(t) continuously increases in the aging regime, if
the number of traps is infinite, meaning that the ""distance to equilibrium""
increases instead of decreasing in the relaxation process. For a finite number
N of traps, \Delta S(t) exhibits a maximum value before eventually converging
to zero when equilibrium is reached. The time t* at which the maximum is
reached however scales in a non-standard way as t* ~ N^(T_g/2T), while the
equilibration time scales as N^(T_g/T). In addition, the curves \Delta S(t) for
different N are found to rescale as ln t/ln t*, instead of the more familiar
scaling t/t*.

varieties in terms of the morphisms they induce between the respective
analytifications. The background for the principal result is as follows. Let
$V'$ and $V$ be irreducible, projective varieties over an algebraically closed,
non- archimedean valued field $k$ and $\phi$ be a finite morphism $\phi : V'
\to V$. Let $x \in V^{an}(L)$, where $L/k$ is an algebraically closed complete
non-archimedean valued field extension. We associate canonically to $x$ an
$L$-point of the space $(V \times_k L)^{an}$ which lies on the fiber over $x$
and denote this point $x_L$. The embedding of $V$ into some $n$-dimensional
projective space defines in a natural way a family of open neighbourhoods
$\mathcal{O}_{x_L}$ in $(V \times_k L)^{an}$ of $x_L$. Each element of this
family is parametrized by an $(n + 1)^2$-tuple which quantifies its size. Of
particular interest to us will be those elements $O$ of the set
$\mathcal{O}_{x_L}$ whose preimage for the morphism $(\phi \times id_L)^{an}$
decomposes into the disjoint union of homeomorphic copies of $O$ via $(\phi
\times id_L)^{an}$. Let $\mathcal{G}_{x_L} \subset \mathcal{O}_{x_L}$ denote
the sub collection of elements of this form. Theorem 1.3 shows that there
exists a deformation retraction of the space $V$ onto a finite simplicial
complex such that along the fibers of the retraction the size of the largest
element belonging to $\mathcal{G}_{x_L}$ is constant.

spectrometer can be used to perform polarization measurements in the hard
X-ray/soft gamma-ray domain (~ 130 keV - 8 MeV). However, this phenomenon is
complex to measure at high energy and requires high fluxes. Cyg X-1 appears as
the best candidate amongst the X-ray binaries since it is one of the brightest
persistent sources in this energy domain. Furthermore, a polarized component
has recently been reported above 400 keV from IBIS data. We have therefore
dedicated our efforts to develop the required tools to study the polarization
in the INTEGRAL SPI data and have first applied them to 2.6 Ms of Cyg X-1
observations, covering 6.5 years of the INTEGRAL mission.
  We have found that the high energy emission of Cyg X-1 is indeed polarized,
with a mean polarization fraction of 76 % +/- 15 % at a position angle
estimated to 42 +/- 3 degrees, for energies above 230 keV. The polarization
fraction clearly increases with energy. In the 130-230 keV band, the
polarization fraction is lower than 20 %, but exceeds 75 % between 370 and 850
keV, with the (total) emission vanishing above this energy. This result
strongly suggests that the emission originates from the jet structure known to
emit in the radio domain. The same synchrotron process could be responsible for
the emission from radio to MeV, implying the presence of high energy electrons.
This illustrates why the polarization of the high energy emission in compact
objects is an increasingly important observational objective.

observations, which were made across four nights in December 2008 and in
November and December 2009. We searched for an enhancement of the pulsed
gamma-ray emission within time windows placed around the arrival time of the
GRP events. In total, 8 different time windows with durations ranging from
0.033 ms to 72 s were positioned at three different locations relative to the
GRP to search for enhanced gamma-ray emission which lagged, led, or was
concurrent with, the GRP event. Further, we performed separate searches on main
pulse GRPs and interpulse GRPs and on the most energetic GRPs in our data
sample. No significant enhancement of pulsed VHE emission was found in any of
the preformed searches. We set upper limits of 5-10 times the average VHE flux
of the Crab pulsar on the flux simultaneous with interpulse GRPs on
single-rotation-period time scales. On $\sim$8-second time scales around
interpulse GRPs, we set an upper limit of 2-3 times the average VHE flux.

the latter case this avoids the use of local cartesian coordinates at the

formulation considers a split of the in-plane and out-of-plane membrane
contributions, which allows the construction of a stable formulation for liquid
membranes with constant surface tension. The proposed membrane formulation is
general, and accounts for dead and live loading, as well as enclosed volume,
area, and contact constraints. The new formulation is illustrated by several
challenging examples, considering linear and quadratic Lagrange elements, as

is seen that the isogeometric elements are much more accurate than standard
Lagrange elements. The gain is especially large for the liquid membrane

real number, called its fitness, according to some rules. Our main concern is
with the issue of existence of (selectively) accessible paths; that is,
monotonic paths in the hypercube along which fitness is always increasing. Our
main results resolve open questions about three such models, which in the
biophysics literature are known as house of cards (HoC), constrained house of
cards (CHoC) and rough Mount Fuji (RMF). We prove that the probability of there
being at least one accessible path from the all-zeroes node $\mathbf {v}^0$ to
the all-ones node $\mathbf {v}^1$ tends respectively to 0, 1 and 1, as $n$
tends to infinity. A crucial idea is the introduction of a generalization of
the CHoC model, in which the fitness of $\mathbf {v}^0$ is set to some
$\alpha=\alpha_n\in[0,1]$. We prove that there is a very sharp threshold at
$\alpha_n=\frac{\ln n}{n}$ for the existence of accessible paths from $\mathbf
{v}^0$ to $\mathbf {v}^1$. As a corollary we prove significant concentration,
for $\alpha$ below the threshold, of the number of accessible paths about the
expected value (the precise statement is technical; see Corollary 1.4). In the
case of RMF, we prove that the probability of accessible paths from $\mathbf
{v}^0$ to $\mathbf {v}^1$ existing tends to $1$ provided the drift parameter
$\theta=\theta_n$ satisfies $n\theta_n\rightarrow\infty$, and for any fitness
distribution which is continuous on its support and whose support is connected.

such that maximizing the information metric will indeed reliably choose the
best experiment to perform. We present the surprising result that defining the
metric purely in terms of prediction power on observable variables yields a
metric that can converge to the classical mutual information measuring how
informative the experimental observation is about an underlying hidden
variable. We show how the expectation potential information metric can compute
the ""information rate"" of an experiment as well its total possible yield, and
the information value of experimental controls. To illustrate the utility of
these concepts for guiding fundamental scientific inquiry, we present an
extensive case study (RoboMendel) applying these metrics to propose sequences
of experiments for discovering the basic principles of genetics.

how to solve this problem in near-linear O(n log^3 n) time. Previously, no
better solution was known than running a single-source single-sink max flow
algorithm n-1 times, giving a total time bound of O(n^2 log n) with the
algorithm of Borradaile and Klein.
  An important implication is that all-pairs max st-flow values in G can be
computed in near-quadratic time. This is close to optimal as the output size is
Theta(n^2). We give a quadratic lower bound on the number of distinct max flow
values and an Omega(n^3) lower bound for the total size of all min cut-sets.
This distinguishes the problem from the undirected case where the number of
distinct max flow values is O(n).

by what it is, but rather by what it does. From a computational point of view,
life hypercomputes. At the end we sketch out the possibilities, stances and

  Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking. Tata Institute of
  Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India",,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper concerns {\em randomized} leader election in synchronous
distributed networks. A distributed leader election algorithm is presented for
complete $n$-node networks that runs in O(1) rounds and (with high probability)
uses only $O(\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages to elect a unique leader (with
high probability). When considering the ""explicit"" variant of leader election
where eventually every node knows the identity of the leader, our algorithm
yields the asymptotically optimal bounds of O(1) rounds and O(n) messages. This
algorithm is then extended to one solving leader election on any connected
non-bipartite $n$-node graph $G$ in $O(\tau(G))$ time and
$O(\tau(G)\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages, where $\tau(G)$ is the mixing time
of a random walk on $G$. The above result implies highly efficient (sublinear
running time and messages) leader election algorithms for networks with small
mixing times, such as expanders and hypercubes. In contrast, previous leader
election algorithms had at least linear message complexity even in complete
graphs. Moreover, super-linear message lower bounds are known for
time-efficient {\em deterministic} leader election algorithms.
  Finally, we present an almost matching lower bound for randomized leader
election, showing that $\Omega(\sqrt n)$ messages are needed for any leader
election algorithm that succeeds with probability at least $1/e + \eps$, for
any small constant $\eps > 0$.
  We view our results as a step towards understanding the randomized complexity
ofleader election in distributed networks.

matrix-shell-core geometry, with real part equal to 1 in the matrix and the
core, and -1 in the shell; one is interested in understanding the resonant
behavior of the solution as the imaginary part of $a(x)$ decreases to zero (so
that ellipticity is lost). Most analytical work in this area has relied on
separation of variables, and has therefore been restricted to radial
geometries. We introduce a new approach based on a pair of dual variational
principles, and apply it to some non-radial examples. In our examples, as in
the radial setting, the spatial location of the source $f$ plays a crucial role
in determining whether or not resonance occurs.

slope produced enough kilometer-scale scattering objects to supply the nearby

""frozen in"" to portions of the Kuiper Belt sharing a ""hot"" orbital inclination

obtain an equation for the omni-directional particle distribution $f(v,t)$ that

characteristic acceleration time is short compared with the characteristic loss

transmission of lower-energy signals more frequently than higher-energy
signals. Previous work has shown that shaping is particularly effective when
used with coded amplitude phase-shift keying (APSK), a modulation that has been
popularized recently due to its inclusion in the DVB-S2 standard. While shaped
APSK can provide significant gains when used with standard off-the-shelf LDPC
codes, such as the codes in the DVB-S2 standard, additional non-negligible
gains can be achieved by optimizing the LDPC code with respect to the shaped
APSK modulation. In this paper, we optimize the degree distributions of the
LDPC code used in conjunction with shaped APSK. The optimization process is an
extension of the EXIT-chart technique of ten Brink, et al., which has been
adapted to account for the shaped APSK modulation. We begin by constraining the
code to have the same number of distinct variable-node degrees as the codes in
the DVB-S2 standard, and show that the optimization provides 32-APSK systems
with an additional coding gain of 0.34 dB at a system rate of R=3 bits per
symbol, compared to shaped systems that use the long LDPC code from the DVB-S2
standard. We then increase the number of allowed variable node degrees by one,
and find that an additional 0.1 dB gain is achievable.

bosonic particle discovery at the LHC. We work within a general setup that we
call the 2HDM-X, in which the quarks couple to both scalar doublets with
aligned couplings such that flavor-changing neutral currents are absent at tree
level. The 2HDM-X encompasses the traditional Type I, Type II, lepton specific,
and flipped models, but also provides for more general possibilities. The best
fit to the current data with a suppressed tau tau signal and a b bbar signal of
Standard Model strength is given by the 2HDM-X with specific parameter choices;
however, very good fits are also obtained within the lepton-specific model and
a democratic model, the 2HDM-D, in which both the up-type and down-type quarks
couple to each doublet with equal strengths. The approach provides a general
framework in which to interpret future LHC Higgs data within extensions of the
Standard Model with two Higgs doublets.

(SHAM) and undertake several new tests of the SHAM prescription for the
galaxy-dark matter connection. All SHAM models we studied exhibit significant
tension with galaxy groups observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The
SHAM prediction for the field galaxy luminosity function (LF) is systematically
too dim, and the group galaxy LF systematically too bright, regardless of the
details of the SHAM prescription. SHAM models connecting r-band luminosity, Mr,
to Vacc, the maximum circular velocity of a subhalo at the time of accretion
onto the host, faithfully reproduce galaxy group abundance as a function of
richness, g(N). However, SHAM models connecting Mr with Vpeak, the peak value
of Vmax over the entire merger history of the halo, over-predict galaxy group
abundance. Our results suggest that no SHAM model can simultaneously reproduce
the observed g(N) and two-point projected galaxy clustering. Nevertheless, we
also report a new success of SHAM: an accurate prediction for Phi(m12), the
abundance of galaxy groups as a function of magnitude gap m12, defined as the
difference between the r-band absolute magnitude of the two brightest group
members. We show that it may be possible to use joint measurements of g(N) and
Phi(m12) to tightly constrain the details of the SHAM implementation.
Additionally, we show that the hypothesis that the luminosity gap is
constructed via random draws from a universal LF provides a poor description of
the data, contradicting recent claims in the literature. Finally, we test a
common assumption of the Conditional Luminosity Function (CLF) formalism, that
the satellite LF need only be conditioned by the brightness of the central
galaxy. We find this assumption to be well-supported by the observed Phi(m12).

profiles of L*-type galaxy stellar haloes. Observations of the Milky Way and
M31 stellar haloes show contrasting results: the Milky Way has a `broken'
profile, where the density falls off more rapidly beyond ~ 25 kpc, while M31
has a smooth profile out to 100 kpc with no obvious break. Simulated stellar
haloes, built solely by the accretion of dwarf galaxies, also exhibit this
behavior: some haloes have breaks, while others don't. The presence or absence
of a break in the stellar halo profile can be related to the accretion history
of the galaxy. We find that a break radius is strongly related to the build up
of stars at apocentres. We relate these findings to observations, and find that
the `break' in the Milky Way density profile is likely associated with a
relatively early (~ 6-9 Gyr ago) and massive accretion event. In contrast, the
absence of a break in the M31 stellar halo profile suggests that its accreted
satellites have a wide range of apocentres. Hence, it is likely that M31 has
had a much more prolonged accretion history than the Milky Way.

astronomy is the broad-band absorption of the total water vapour in the
atmosphere above an observation site, often expressed as the Precipitable Water
Vapour (PWV). A long-term statistic on the PWV is thus mandatory to
characterize the quality of an existing or potential site for observational
submm-astronomy. In this study we present a three-year statistic (2008-2010) of
the PWV for ground-based telescope sites all around the world and for
stratospheric altitudes relevant for SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for
Far-infrared astronomy). The submm-transmission is calculated for typical PWVs
using an atmospheric model. We present the absolute PWV values for each site
sorted by year and time percentage. The PWV corresponding to the first decile
(10%) and the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) are calculated and transmission curves
between 150 {\mu}m and 3 mm for these values are shown. The Antarctic and
South-American sites present very good conditions for submillimetre astronomy.
The 350 {\mu}m and 450 {\mu}m atmospheric windows are open all year long
whereas the 200 {\mu}m atmospheric window opens reasonably for 25 % of the time
in Antarctica and the extremely high-altitude sites in Chile. Potential
interesting new facilities are Macon in Argentinia and Summit in Greenland that
show similar conditions as for example Mauna Kea (Hawaii). For SOFIA, we
present in more detail transmission curves for different altitudes (11 to 14
km), PWV values, and higher frequencies (up to 5 THz). Though the atmosphere at
these altitude is generally very transparent, the absorption at very high
frequencies becomes more important, partly caused by minor species. In
conclusion, the method presented in this paper could identify sites on Earth
with a great potential for submillimetre astronomy, and guide future site
testing campaigns in situ.

Individual source luminosities range from log(L_IR/Lsun)=12.5-13.6
(corresponding to star formation rates 500-9000Msun/yr, assuming a Salpeter
IMF), constituting some of the most intrinsically luminous, distant infrared
galaxies yet discovered. We present both individual and composite rest-frame
ultraviolet spectra and infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The
selection of these HSGs is reproducible and well characterized across large
areas of sky in contrast to most z>2 HyLIRGs in the literature which are
detected serendipitously or via tailored surveys searching only for high-z
HyLIRGs; therefore, we can place lower limits on the contribution of HSGs to
the cosmic star formation rate density at (7+-2)x10^(-3)Msun/yr h^3Mpc^(-3) at
z~2.5, which is >10% of the estimated total star formation rate density (SFRD)

of 3x10^(-3)Msun/yr h^3 Mpc^(-3), ~>20% of the estimated total SFRD. This

intrinsic rest-frame equivalent width of EW_0^{int}=872^{+844}_{-298}A after
the average intergalactic absorption correction. The object was
spectroscopically confirmed to be a real Ly-alpha emitter by its apparent
asymmetric Ly-alpha line profile detected at z=6.538. The continuum emission of
the object was definitely detected in our deep z'-band image; thus, its EW_0
was reliably determined. Follow-up deep near-infrared spectroscopy revealed
emission lines of neither He II lambda1640 as an apparent signature of
Population III, nor C IV lambda1549 as a proof of active nucleus. No detection
of short-lived He II lambda1640 line is not necessarily inconsistent with the
interpretation that the underlying stellar population of the object is
dominated by Population III. We found that the observed extremely large EW_0 of
the Ly-alpha emission and the upper limit on the EW_0 of the He II lambda1640
emission can be explained by population synthesis models favoring a very young
age less than 2-4Myr and massive metal-poor (Z<10^{-5}) or even metal-free
stars. The observed large EW_0 of Ly-alpha is hardly explained by Population
I/II synthesis models with Z>10^{-3}. However, we cannot conclusively rule out
the possibility that this object is composed of a normal stellar population

its significance is still unclear.

whether, unlike the case for bi-immunity, there is an absolutely undecidable
set in every non-zero Turing degree. We provide a positive answer to this
question by applying techniques from coding theory. We show how to use
Walsh-Hadamard codes to build a truth-table functional which maps any sequence
A to a sequence B, such that given any restriction of B to a set of positive
upper density, one can recover A. This implies that if A is non-computable,
then B is absolutely undecidable. Using a forcing construction, we show that
this result cannot be strengthened in any significant fashion.

the nuclear extract, the ratio of nuclear proteins compared to contaminant

this procedure, the nuclear protein expression profiles of macrophages and
dendritic cells have been compared with a proteomic approach by 2D-gel

pointing out some proteins of interest. We have chosen some of them, involved
in transcriptional regulation and/or chromatin structure for further

modeling many phenomena. Here, we focus on the regularizing effect of a large
class of memoryful high-order or time-fractional PDEs---through their
fundamental solutions---on stochastic integral equations (SIEs) driven by
space-time white noise. Surprisingly, we show that maximum spatial regularity
is achieved in the fourth-order-bi-Laplacian case; and any further increase of
the spatial-Laplacian order is entirely translated into additional temporal
regularization of the SIE. We started this program in (Allouba 2013, Allouba
2006), where we introduced two different stochastic versions of the fourth
order memoryful PDE associated with the Brownian-time Brownian motion (BTBM):
(1) the BTBM SIE and (2) the BTBM SPDE, both driven by space-time white noise.
Under wide conditions, we showed the existence of random field locally-H\""older
solutions to the BTBM SIE with striking and unprecedented time-space H\""older
exponents, in spatial dimensions $d=1,2,3$. In particular, we proved that the
spatial regularity of such solutions is nearly locally Lipschitz in $d=1,2$.
This gave, for the first time, an example of a space-time white noise driven
equation whose solutions are smoother than the corresponding Brownian sheet in
either time or space. In this paper, we introduce the $2\beta^{-1}$-order
$\beta$-inverse-stable-L\'evy-time Brownian motion ($\beta$-ISLTBM) SIEs,
driven by space-time white noise. We show that the BTBM SIE spatial regularity
and its random field third spatial dimension limit are maximal among all
$\beta$-ISLTBM SIEs. Furthermore, we show that increasing the order of the
Laplacian $\beta^{-1}$ beyond the BTBM bi-Laplacian manifests entirely as
increased temporal regularity of our random field solutions that asymptotically
approaches the temporal regularity of the Brownian sheet as $\beta\searrow0$.

violate local Lorentz invariance. This suggests that the class of holographic

this feature. The radio core shows an inverted spectrum at least up to 43GHz

stable on a level of 4Rs. The core at 43 and 22GHz tends to show slightly
(~10%) higher flux level near the date of the VHE flux peak compared with the
epochs before/after the event. The size of the 43-GHz core is estimated to be
~17Rs, which is close to the size of the emitting region suggested from the

(Oncorhynchus clarkii). However, the specific mechanisms by which rainbow trout
and their hybrids outcompete cutthroat trout have not been thoroughly explored,
and the published data is limited to lotic ecosystems. Materials and Methods:
Samples of rainbow trout and cutthroat trout were obtained from a lentic
ecosystem by angling. The total length and weight of each fish was measured and
the relative weight of each fish was computed (Anderson R.O., Neumann R.M.
1996. Length, Weight, and Associated Structural Indices, Pp. 447-481. In:
Murphy B.E. and Willis D.W. (eds.) Fisheries Techniques, second edition.

for each species. Data from an independent source (K.D. Carlander, 1969.
Handbook of Freshwater Fishery Biology, Volume One, Iowa University Press,
Ames.) was also used to generate mean weight-length curves, as well as 25th and
75th percentile curves for each species to allow further comparison. Results:
The mean relative weight of the rainbow trout was 72.5 (+/- 2.1); whereas, the
mean relative weight of the cutthroat trout was 101.0 (+/- 4.9). The rainbow
trout were thin; 80% weighed below the 25th percentile. The cutthroat trout
were plump; 86% weighed above the 75th percentile, and 29% were above the
heaviest recorded specimens at a given length in the Carlander (1969) data set.
Conclusion: This data casts doubt on the hypothesis that rainbow trout are
strong food competitors with cutthroat trout in lentic ecosystems. On the
contrary, in the lake under study, the cutthroat trout seem to be outcompeting
rainbow trout for the available food.

originates with the formation of a crack. Fatigue describes the crack formation
in the material under cyclic loading. Activation and deactivation operations of
technical units are important examples in engineering where fatigue and
especially low-cycle fatigue (LCF) play an essential role. A significant
scatter in fatigue life for many materials results in the necessity of advanced
probabilistic models for fatigue. Moreover, optimization of reliability is of
vital interest in engineering, where with respect to fatigue the cost
functionals are motivated by the predicted probability for the integrity of the
component after a certain number of load cycles. The natural mathematical
language to model failure, here understood as crack initiation, is the language
of spatio-temporal point processes and their first failure times. This
translates the problem of optimal reliability in the framework of shape
optimization. The cost functionals derived in this way for realistic optimal
reliability problems are too singular to be $H^1$-lower semi-continuous as many
damage mechanisms, like LCF, lead to crack initiation as a function of the
stress at the component's surface. Realistic crack formation models therefore
impose a new challenge to the theory of shape optimization. In this work, we
have to modify the existence proof of optimal shapes, for the case of
sufficiently smooth shapes using elliptic regularity, uniform Schauder
estimates and compactness of strong solutions via the Arzela-Ascoli theorem.
This result applies to a variety of crack initiation models and in particular
applies to a recent probabilistic model for LCF.

to 200{\mu}m. The data probe the emission from molecular PAH-type species,
transiently-heated Very Small Grains (VSGs), and large classical dust grains.
We compare the observations to earlier studies, especially those carried out
towards an isolated translucent cloud in Chamaeleon (Paper I). The spectra
towards the two LDN 1688 positions are very similar to each other, in spite of
position ON1 having a larger column density and probably being subjected to a
stronger radiation field. The ratios of the mid-IR features are similar to
those found in other diffuse and translucent clouds. Compared to paper I, the
7.7/11.3{\mu}m band ratios are lower, ~2.0, at both LDN 1688 positions. A
continuum is detected in the ~10{\mu}m region. This is stronger towards the
position ON1 but still lower than on any of the sightlines in Paper I. The
far-infrared opacities are higher than for diffuse medium. The value of the
position ON2, {\tau}200/N(H) = 3.9 x 10^{-25} cm^2/H, is twice the value found
for ON1. The radiation field of LDN 1688 is dominated by the two embedded B
type double stars, {\rho} Oph AB and HD 147889, with an additional contribution
from the Upper Sco OB association. The strong heating is reflected in the high
colour temperature, ~24 K, of the large grain emission. Radiative transfer
modelling confirms a high level of the radiation field and points to an
increased abundance of PAH grains. However, when the hardening of the radiation
field caused by the local B-stars is taken into account, the observations can
be fitted with almost no change to the standard dust models. However, all the

  feedback in galaxy formation simulations","ApJ submitted. For a high-resolution version of the paper, see
  http://kicp.uchicago.edu/~agertz/",,"10.1088/0004-637X/770/1/25",,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stellar feedback plays a key role in galaxy formation by regulating star
formation, driving interstellar turbulence and generating galactic scale
outflows. Although modern simulations of galaxy formation can resolve scales of
10-100 pc, star formation and feedback operate on smaller, ""subgrid"" scales.
Great care should therefore be taken in order to properly account for the
effect of feedback on global galaxy evolution. We investigate the momentum and
energy budget of feedback during different stages of stellar evolution, and
study its impact on the interstellar medium using simulations of local star
forming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in modern
cosmological zoom-in simulations. In particular, we present a novel subgrid
model for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar winds
from massive stars during early, pre-supernova evolutionary stages of young
star clusters. Early injection of momentum acts to clear out dense gas in star
forming regions, hence limiting star formation. The reduced gas density
mitigates radiative losses of thermal feedback energy from subsequent supernova
explosions, leading to an increased overall efficiency of stellar feedback. The
detailed impact of stellar feedback depends sensitively on the implementation
and choice of parameters. Somewhat encouragingly, we find that implementations
in which feedback is efficient lead to approximate self-regulation of global
star formation efficiency. We compare simulation results using our feedback
implementation to other phenomenological feedback methods, where thermal
feedback energy is allowed to dissipate over time scales longer than the formal
gas cooling time. We find that simulations with maximal momentum injection
suppress star formation to a similar degree as is found in simulations adopting
adiabatic thermal feedback.

of the Sunda subduction zone system, reveals a characteristic bowl-shaped
geometry in seismic tomographic images. This indicates that the oceanic
lithosphere still remains attached to the surrounding continental margins of
northern Australia and the Bird's Head microcontinent. Major controversies
exist between authors proposing an allochthonous or autochthonous origin of the
Bird's Head block. Either scenario has important implications for plate
kinematic models aiming to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the region and
the late Jurassic seaoor spreading geometry of this now subducted
Argo-Tanimbar-Seram (ATS) ocean basin. Wider implications affect the tectonic
conguration of the Tethyan-Pacic realm, the distribution of plate boundaries as
well as the shape and size of continental blocks which have been rifted off the
northeastern Gondwana margin during the Late Jurassic and are now accreted to
the SE Asia margin. We apply structural geology restoration techniques to
unfold the subducted oceanic lithosphere of the Banda Slab. Our slab unfolding
results help to discriminate between the different hypotheses concerning the
origin and kinematic history of the Bird's Head tectonic block. According to
our preferred model, the block is required to rotate 20-35 degrees clockwise
relative to its present-day position and that the initial geometry of the ATS
ocean basin was more or less rectangular shaped. We evaluate currently accepted
plate kinematic scenarios for the Jurassic and younger seaoor spreading history
north of Australia in conjunction with our restored ocean basin geometry and
conclude that the Bird's Head block is autochthonous to western Irian Jaya,
with its western margin being a continental transform margin during the rifting
and opening of the ATS ocean.

method, known as Digital Active Nulling (DAN), the current sensor (e.g. SQUID)
is nulled in a separate digital feedback loop for each bolometer frequency.
This nulling removes the dynamic range limitation on the current sensor,
increases its linearity, and reduces its effective input impedance.
Additionally, DAN removes constraints on wiring lengths and maximum
multiplexing frequency. DAN has been fully implemented and tested. Integration
for current experiments, including the South Pole Telescope, will be discussed.

function of the magnetic field) are presented for trigonal graphene nanoflakes

that is 5-7 defects, replaces the hexagons at the zigzag edge. For nanoflakes
with such reczag defective edges, emphasis is placed on topological aspects and
connections underlying the patterns dominating these spectra. The electronic
spectra of trigonal graphene nanoflakes with reczag edge terminations exhibit
certain unique features, in addition to those that are well known to appear for
graphene dots with zigzag edge termination. These unique features include
breaking of the particle-hole symmetry, and they are associated with nonlinear
dispersion of the energy as a function of momentum, which may be interpreted as
nonrelativistic behavior. The general topological features shared with the
zigzag flakes include the appearance of energy gaps at zero and low magnetic
fields due to finite size, the formation of relativistic Landau levels at high
magnetic fields, and the presence between the Landau levels of edge states (the
socalled Halperin states) associated with the integer quantum Hall effect.
Topological regimes, unique to the reczag nanoflakes, appear within a stripe of
negative energies E_b < E < 0, and along a separate feature forming a
constant-energy line outside this stripe. The lower bound (E_b) specifying the
energy stripe is independent of size. A main finding concerns the limited
applicability of the continuous Dirac-Weyl equation, since the latter does not
reproduce the special reczag features. (See also the extended abstract in the

absorption line (BAL) quasars, and combine these new data with our previous
spectropolarimetric atlases (of both radio-loud and radio-quiet objects) in
order to investigate the polarization properties of BAL quasars as a group. The
total (radio-selected) sample includes 36 (26) high-ionization and 22 (15)
low-ionization BAL quasars. On average, we confirm that broad emission lines
are polarized at a level similar to or less than the continuum and broad
absorption troughs are more highly polarized, but we note that these properties
are not true for all individual objects. Of the whole sample, 18 (31%) have
high (>2%) continuum polarization, including 45% of the LoBALs and 22% of
HiBALs. We identify a few correlations between polarization and other quasar
properties, as well as some interesting non-correlations. In particular,
continuum polarization does not correlate with radio spectral index, which
suggests that the polarization is not due to a standard geometry and preferred
viewing angle to BAL quasars. The polarization also does not correlate with the
amount of intrinsic dust reddening, indicating that the polarization is not
solely due to direct light attenuation either. Polarization does appear to
depend on the minimum BAL outflow velocity, confirming the results of previous
studies, and it may correlate with the maximum outflow velocity. We also find
that continuum polarization anti-correlates with the polarization in the C IV
broad emission and broad absorption. These results suggest that the
polarization of BAL quasars cannot be described by one simple model, and that
the scatterer location and geometry can vary significantly from object to
object.

fish motion is said to be unstable if a perturbation in the conditions
surrounding the fish results in forces and moments that tend to increase the
perturbation and it is stable if these emerging forces tend to reduce the
perturbation and return the fish to its original state. Stability may be
achieved actively or passively. Active stabilization requires neurological
control that activates musculo-skeletal components to compensate for the
external perturbations acting against stability. Passive stabilization on the
other hand requires no energy input by the fish and is dependent upon the fish
morphology, i.e. geometry and elastic properties. In this paper, we use a
deformable body consisting of an articulated body equipped with torsional
springs at its hinge joints and submerged in an unbounded perfect fluid as a
simple model to study passive stability as a function of the body geometry and
spring stiffness. We show that for given body dimensions, the spring
elasticity, when properly chosen, leads to passive stabilization of the

in the 15-17 K range. We report on the specific heat characterization of single
crystal material prepared from self-flux growth techniques with significantly
improved properties, including a much decreased residual gamma (proportional to
C/T as T->0) in the superconducting state. Thus, in contrast to previous
explanations of a finite residual gamma in LiFeAs being due to intrinsic states
in the superconducting gap, the present work shows that such a finite residual
gamma in LiFeAs is instead a function of sample quality. Further, since LiFeAs
has been characterized as nodeless with multiple superconducting gaps, we
report here on its specific heat properties in zero and applied magnetic fields
to compare to similar results on nodal iron superconductors. For comparison, we
also investigate LiFe0.98Cu0.02As, which has the reduced Tc of 9 K and Hc2 of
15 T. Interestingly, although presumably both LiFeAs and LiFe0.98Cu0.02As are
nodeless, they clearly show a non-linear dependence of the electronic density
of states (proportional to the specific heat gamma) at the Fermi energy in the
mixed state with applied field similar to the Volovik effect for nodal
superconductors. However, rather than nodal behavior, the satisfactory
comparison with a recent theory for gamma(H) for a two isotropic gap
superconductor in the presence of impurities argues for nodeless behavior.
Thus, in terms of specific heat in magnetic field, LiFeAs can serve as the
prototypical multiband, nodeless iron superconductor.

previously unpublished optical spectra of AU Mon which were obtained over
several years with dense orbital phase coverage. We utilize these data, along
with archival UV spectra, to model the temperature and structure of the
accretion disk and the gas stream. Synthetic spectral profiles for lines
including H-alpha, H-beta, and the Al III and Si IV doublets were computed with
the Shellspec program. The best match between the model spectra and the
observations is obtained for an accretion disk of inner/outer radius 5.1/23
R_sun, thickness of 5.2 R_sun, density of 1.0e-13 g/cm^3, and maximum
temperature of 14000 K, along with a gas stream at a temperature of ~8000 K
transferring ~2.4e-9 M_sun/yr. We show H-alpha Doppler tomograms of the
velocity structure of the gas, constructed from difference profiles calculated
through sequentially subtracting contributions from the stars and accretion
structures. The tomograms provide independent support for the Shellspec
modeling, while also illustrating that residual emission at sub-Keplerian
velocities persists even after subtracting the disk and stream emission.
Spectral variability in the H-alpha profile beyond that expected from either
the orbital or the long-period cycle is present on both multi-week and
multi-year timescales, and may reflect quasi-random changes in the mass
transfer rate or the disk structure. Finally, a transient UV spectral
absorption feature may be modeled as an occasional outflow launched from the
vicinity of the disk-stream interaction region.

femtocells offers a cost-effective way to mitigate this problem. Femtocells
enable larger network capacity by increasing spatial reuse of the spectrum and
shortening the distance to the users. Existing work has shown that open access
femtocells, which allow unregistered macro users to connect, are efficient in
reducing inter-cell interference and offloading traffic. However, a major
obstacle constraining the potential capability of femtocells and open access is
the lack of incentives for privately-owned femtocells to serve unregistered
users. Hence in this paper, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction
based incentive framework for accessing such selfish femtocells. We consider
two scenarios: One scenario involves a single macro user and another scenario
has multiple macro users. We design auction schemes for both scenarios and show
analytically that our schemes are truthful and have low computational
complexity. Extensive simulations validate these properties and show huge
performance improvement to the macro users.

Matching conditions that ensure the appropriate levels of continuity and
differentiability across region boundaries are developed for arbitrary tensor
fields. Standard numerical methods are then used to solve the equations with
the appropriate boundary conditions, which are determined from these
inter-region matching conditions. Numerical examples are presented which use
pseudo-spectral methods to solve simple elliptic equations on multi-cube
representations of manifolds with the topologies T^3, S^2 x S^1 and S^3.
Examples are also presented of numerical solutions of simple hyperbolic
equations on multi-cube manifolds with the topologies R x T^3, R x S^2 x S^1

connected to a bad-metal normal state and a nearby antiferromagnetic order.
Therefore, considerable attention has been focused on the role of electron
correlations and spin dynamics. In this article, we summarize some key
experiments that quite directly imply strong electron correlations in these
materials, and discuss aspects of the recent theoretical studies on these
issues. In particular, we outline a $w$-expansion, which treats the correlation
effects using the Mott transition as the reference point. For the parent
systems, it gives rise to an effective J1-J2 model that is coupled to the
itinerant electrons in the vicinity of the Fermi energy; this model yields an
isoelectronically-tuned quantum critical point, and allows a study of the
distribution of the spin spectral weight in the energy and momentum space in
the paramagnetic phase. Within the same framework, we demonstrate the Mott
insulating phase in the iron oxychalcogenides as well as the alkaline iron
selenides; for the latter system, we also consider the role of an
orbital-selective Mott phase. Finally, we discuss the singlet superconducting
pairing driven by the short-range J1-J2 interactions. Our considerations
highlight the iron pnictides and chalcogenides as exemplifying
strongly-correlated electron systems at the boundary of electronic localization
and itinerancy.

whether the coherence explains the high exciton transfer efficiency. We
distinguish several types of coherence and show that although some
photosynthetic pathways are partially coherent processes, photosynthesis in
nature proceeds through stationary states. This distinction allows us to rule
out several mechanisms of transport enhancement in sunlight. In particular,
although they are crucial for understanding exciton transport, neither wavelike
motion nor microscopic coherence, on their own, enhance the efficiency. By
contrast, two partially coherent mechanisms---ENAQT and supertransfer---can
enhance transport even in sunlight and thus constitute motifs for the
optimisation of artificial sunlight harvesting. Finally, we clarify the
importance of ultrafast spectroscopy in understanding incoherent processes.

such locking is naturally achieved and how, while locked at an antiresonance,
GR drives the evolution of the orbital separation, while dynamic tides act to

many-body systems is to recast the full problem into a form of the effective
interaction acting within a model space of tractable size. Many of the
effective-interaction theories in nuclear physics have been formulated by use
of the so called $\hatQ$ box introduced by Kuo et.al. It has been one of the
central problems how to calculate the $\hatQ$ box accurately and efficiently.
We first show that, introducing new basis states, the Hamiltonian is
transformed to a block-tridiagonal form in terms of submatrices with small
dimension. With this transformed Hamiltonian, we next prove that the $\hatQ$
box can be expressed in two ways: One is a form of continued fraction and the
other is a simple series expansion up to second order with respect to
renormalized vertices and propagators. This procedure ensures to derive an
exact $\hatQ$ box, if the calculation converges as the dimension of the Hilbert
space tends to infinity. The $\hatQ$ box given in this study corresponds to a
non-perturbative solution for the energy-dependent effective interaction which
is often referred to as the Bloch-Horowitz or the Feshbach form. By applying
the $\hatZ$-box approach based on the $\hatQ$ box proposed previously, we
introduce a graphical method for solving the eigenvalue problem of the
Hamiltonian. The present approach has a possibility of resolving many of the
difficulties encountered in the effective-interaction theory.

Dirichlet-process prior for clustering. The mixture model formulation allows
for probabilistic cluster assignments. The random-effects formulation allows
for attributing the total variability in the data to the sources that are
consistent with the experimental design, particularly when the noise level is
high and the temporal dependence is not strong. The Dirichlet-process prior
induces a prior distribution on partitions and helps to estimate the number of
clusters (or mixture components) from the data. We further tackle two
challenges associated with Dirichlet-process prior-based methods. One is
efficient sampling. We develop a novel Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) procedure to sample the partitions. The other is efficient use of
the MCMC samples in forming clusters. We propose a two-step procedure for
posterior inference, which involves resampling and relabeling, to estimate the
posterior allocation probability matrix. This matrix can be directly used in
cluster assignments, while describing the uncertainty in clustering. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and sampling procedure through
simulated data. Applying our method to a real data set collected from
Drosophila adult muscle cells after five-minute Notch activation, we identify
14 clusters of different transcriptional responses among 163 differentially

static scene is a new interesting functionality in 3D streaming systems. While
it opens exciting perspectives towards rich multimedia applications, it
requires the design of novel representations and coding techniques in order to
solve the new challenges imposed by interactive navigation. Interactivity
clearly brings new design constraints: the encoder is unaware of the exact
decoding process, while the decoder has to reconstruct information from
incomplete subsets of data since the server can generally not transmit images
for all possible viewpoints due to resource constrains. In this paper, we
propose a novel multiview data representation that permits to satisfy bandwidth
and storage constraints in an interactive multiview streaming system. In
particular, we partition the multiview navigation domain into segments, each of
which is described by a reference image and some auxiliary information. The
auxiliary information enables the client to recreate any viewpoint in the
navigation segment via view synthesis. The decoder is then able to navigate
freely in the segment without further data request to the server; it requests
additional data only when it moves to a different segment. We discuss the
benefits of this novel representation in interactive navigation systems and
further propose a method to optimize the partitioning of the navigation domain
into independent segments, under bandwidth and storage constraints.
Experimental results confirm the potential of the proposed representation;
namely, our system leads to similar compression performance as classical
inter-view coding, while it provides the high level of flexibility that is
required for interactive streaming. Hence, our new framework represents a
promising solution for 3D data representation in novel interactive multimedia
services.

flares visible in various energy bands. These flares are often, but not always,
correlated. In a number of cases the peaks of optical flares are found to be
somewhat delayed with respect to the gamma-ray peaks. One notable example of
such a delay was found in 3C 279 by Hayashida et al. and interpreted as a
result of steeper drop with distance of the energy density of external
radiation field than of the magnetic energy density. In this paper we
demonstrate that in general, depending on the respective energy density profile
along the jet, such lags can have both signs and that they can take place for
any ratio of these energy densities. We study the dependence of such lags on
the ratio of these energy densities at a distance of a maximal energy
dissipation in a jet, on their gradients, as well as on the time profile of the
relativistic electron injection within the moving source. We show how prominent
such lags can be, and what are their expected time scales. We suggest that
studies of such lags can provide a powerful tool to resolve the structure of
relativistic jets and their radiative environment. As an example we model the
lag observed in 3C 279, showing that in this object the flare is produced at a
distance of a few parsecs from the central black hole, consistent with our

stochastic processes. It is related to well-known complexity measures like
excess entropy or statistical complexity. Essentially it is a variation of the
excess entropy so that it can be interpreted as a specific measure of system
internal memory. The PMI was first introduced in 2010 by Ball, Diakonova and
MacKay as a measure for (strong) emergence. In this paper we define the PMI
mathematically and investigate the relation to excess entropy and statistical
complexity. In particular we prove that the excess entropy is an upper bound of
the PMI. Furthermore we show some properties of the PMI and calculate it
explicitly for some example processes. We also discuss to what extend it is a
measure for emergence and compare it with alternative approaches used to
formalize emergence.

spatial dimension can be simulated with a single qubit plus a continuous degree
of freedom, for example a single trapped ion. Interestingly, the dynamics of a

laboratory implementation feasible with existing set ups.

photons and their masses can give rise to the observed cold dark matter
abundance. A wide range of experiments - direct dark matter searches exploiting

neural units. These show a phase transition to chaos as a disorder parameter is
increased. The microscopic mechanisms underlying this phase transition are
unknown, and similarly to spin-glasses, shall be fundamentally related to the
behavior of the system. In this Letter we investigate the explosion of
complexity arising near that phase transition. We show that the mean number of
equilibria undergoes a sharp transition from one equilibrium to a very large
number scaling exponentially with the dimension on the system. Near
criticality, we compute the exponential rate of divergence, called topological
complexity. Strikingly, we show that it behaves exactly as the maximal Lyapunov
exponent, a classical measure of dynamical complexity. This relationship
unravels a microscopic mechanism leading to chaos which we further demonstrate
on a simpler class of disordered systems, suggesting a deep and underexplored
link between topological and dynamical complexity.

  Sn-isotopes","71 pages, 17 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.87.054321",,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pairing rotations and pairing vibrations are collective modes associated with
a field, the pair field, which changes the number of particles by two.
Consequently, they can be studied at profit with the help of two-particle
transfer reactions on superfluid and in normal nuclei, respectively. The advent
of exotic beams has opened, for the first time, the possibility to carry out
such studies in medium heavy nuclei, within the same isotopic chain. In the
case studied in the present paper that of the Sn-isotopes (essentially from
closed (Z=N=50) to closed (Z=50,N=82) shells). The static and dynamic
off-diagonal, long range order phase coherence in gauge space displayed by
pairing rotations and vibrations respectively, leads to coherent states which
behave almost classically. Consequently, these modes are amenable to an
accurate nuclear structure description in terms of simple models containing the
right physics, in particular BCS plus QRPA and HF mean field plus RPA
respectively. The associated two- nucleon transfer spectroscopic amplitudes
predicted by such model calculations can thus be viewed as essentially ""exact"".
This fact, together with the availability of optical potentials for the
different real and virtual channels involved in the reactions considered,
namely (A+2)Sn+p, (A+1)Sn+d and (A)Sn+t, allows for the calculation of the
associated absolute cross sections without, arguably, free parameters. The
numerical predictions of the absolute differential cross sections, obtained
making use of the above mentioned nuclear structure and optical potential
inputs, within the framework of second order DWBA, taking into account
simultaneous, successive and non-orthogonality contributions provide, within
experimental errors an overall account of the experimental findings for all of
the measured (A+2)Sn(p,t)(A)Sn(gs) reactions, for which absolute cross sections
have been reported to date.

Metropolis (RWM) algorithms where the target distribution has a discontinuous

continuous target densities. The main result is a weak convergence result as
the dimensionality d of the target densities converges to infinity. In
particular, when the proposal variance is scaled by $d^{-2}$, the sequence of
stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain
converges to an appropriate Langevin diffusion process. Therefore optimizing
the efficiency of the RWM algorithm is equivalent to maximizing the speed of
the limiting diffusion. This leads to an asymptotic optimal acceptance rate of
$e^{-2}$ (=0.1353) under quite general conditions. The results have major
practical implications for the implementation of RWM algorithms by highlighting
the detrimental effect of choosing RWM algorithms over Metropolis-within-Gibbs

$\Gamma$-expansion for the two-dimensional non-local Ginzburg-Landau energy

diblock copolymer systems. In this model, two phases appear, which interact via
a nonlocal Coulomb type energy. Here we focus on the sharp interface version of
this energy in the regime where one of the phases has very small volume
fraction, thus creating small ""droplets"" of the minority phase in a ""sea"" of
the majority phase. In our previous paper, we computed the $\Gamma$-limit of
the leading order energy, which yields the averaged behavior for almost
minimizers, namely that the density of droplets should be uniform. Here we go
to the next order and derive a next order $\Gamma$-limit energy, which is
exactly the Coulombian renormalized energy obtained by Sandier and Serfaty as a
limiting interaction energy for vortices in the magnetic Ginzburg-Landau model.
The derivation is based on the abstract scheme of Sandier-Serfaty that serves
to obtain lower bounds for 2-scale energies and express them through some
probabilities on patterns via the multiparameter ergodic theorem. Without thus
appealing to the Euler-Lagrange equation, we establish for all configurations
which have ""almost minimal energy"" the asymptotic roundness and radius of the
droplets, and the fact that they asymptotically shrink to points whose
arrangement minimizes the renormalized energy in some averaged sense. Via a
kind of $\Gamma$-equivalence, the obtained results also yield an expansion of
the minimal energy for the original Ohta-Kawasaki energy. This leads to
expecting to see triangular lattices of droplets as energy minimizers.

ATLAS and CMS at the LHC. Since its decay into a diphoton excludes the spin-1
case by the Landau-Yang theorem,it leaves 0 or 2 as the possible lowest spin
for the new boson. Instead of the well-established spin-0 Higgs-like boson, we
take this new boson to be a spin-2 massive Graviton-like particle denoted as
$G$, which exists copiously in extra-dimension theories, and concentrate on its
phenomenology. In particular, we calculate the three-body decays of
$G\rightarrow V f\bar{f}'$ with $V$ and $f^{(\prime)}$ the gauge boson and
fermions in the standard model (SM) and compare our results with those of the
SM Higgs boson. The couplings between $G$ and $V$s are also estimated by
fitting the data. A new observable that can distinguish $G$ from the Higgs is
proposed.

period varies with filamentary threads, ranging from 44 to 67 min. The
oscillations of different threads are out of phase, and their velocity
amplitudes vary from 30 to 60 km s$^{-1}$, with a maximum displacement of about
25 Mm. The oscillations of the SP repeat for about 4 cycles without any
significant damping and then a nearby C2.4 flare causes the transition from the
LAL oscillations of the filament to its later eruption. The filament eruption
is also associated with a coronal mass ejection and a B6.8 flare. However, the
oscillations of the NP damp with time and die out at last. Our observations

representations of real valued data streams. One approach that emerged over a
decade ago and is still considered state-of-the-art is the Symbolic Aggregate
Approximation algorithm. This discretization algorithm was the first symbolic
approach that mapped a real-valued time series to a symbolic representation
that was guaranteed to lower-bound Euclidean distance. The interest of this
paper concerns the SAX assumption of data being highly Gaussian and the use of
the standard normal curve to choose partitions to discretize the data. Though
not necessarily, but generally, and certainly in its canonical form, the SAX
approach chooses partitions on the standard normal curve that would produce an
equal probability for each symbol in a finite alphabet to occur. This procedure
is generally valid as a time series is normalized before the rest of the SAX
algorithm is applied. However there exists a caveat to this assumption of
equi-probability due to the intermediate step of Piecewise Aggregate
Approximation (PAA). What we will show in this paper is that when PAA is
applied the distribution of the data is indeed altered, resulting in a
shrinking standard deviation that is proportional to the number of points used
to create a segment of the PAA representation and the degree of
auto-correlation within the series. Data that exhibits statistically
significant auto-correlation is less affected by this shrinking distribution.
As the standard deviation of the data contracts, the mean remains the same,
however the distribution is no longer standard normal and therefore the
partitions based on the standard normal curve are no longer valid for the
assumption of equal probability.

expected at first glance. Hence we begin to discuss fundamental mathematics and
physics of RHD with special focus on differential geometric consistency and
study numerical methods for nonlinear conservation laws to gain a solid
definition of the term conservative. The efforts in tensor analysis will be
needed when applying Vinokurs theorem to gain the strong conservation form for
conservation laws in general curvilinear coordinates. Moreover, it will be
required to slightly reformulate the artificial viscosity for such nonlinear
coordinates. Astronomical objects are characterized by fast flows and high
propagation speeds on the one hand but astronomical length and time scales on
the other hand. Implicit numerical schemes are not affected by the Courant
Friedrichs Levy condition which limits explicit schemes to rather impracticably
small time steps. Implicit methods however produce algebraic problems that
require matrix inversion which is computationally expensive. In order to
achieve viable resolution, adaptive grid techniques have been developed. It is
desired to treat processes on small length scales like shocks and ionization
fronts as well as physics at the extent of the objects dimension itself like
large scale convection flows and pulsations. The combination of implicit
schemes and adaptive grids allows to resolve astrophysics appropriately at
various scales. In the last chapter of this paper we study problem oriented
adaptive grid generation in 2D and 3D. We establish three main postulations for

bar development through angular momentum exchange. Triaxial dark halos tend to
weaken bars. When the dark mass inside the bar region is negligible, the bar
develops through angular momentum exchange between inner and outer disk, and
between stars and gas. Self-regulating cycles on the bar strength may develop
in the presence of external gas accretion. Dynamical friction on dark halos
slows down bars, which puts constraints on the dark matter amount inside the
inner disk. During galaxy formation, baryons can lose most of their angular
momentum if the infall is misaligned with the dark matter axes. Stable disks
can form aligned with the minor axis of the dark halo.
  A sudden change in the infall direction, otherwise steady, can produce the
peculiar polar ring galaxies. The dark matter halo can then be aligned along
the polar disk. Misaligned infall can also maintain lopsidedness, which is only
rarely due to galaxy interactions and mergers.

A.N. Kirillov (2001) is volume preserving with respect to a natural product
measure on its domain, and that the integrand in Givental's integral formula
for GL(n,R)-Whittaker functions arises naturally in this context. Apart from
providing further evidence that Whittaker functions are the natural analogue of
Schur polynomials in this setting, our results also provide a new
`combinatorial' framework for the study of random polymers. When the input
matrix consists of random inverse gamma distributed weights, the probability
distribution of a polymer partition function constructed from these weights can
be written down explicitly in terms of Whittaker functions. Next we restrict
the geometric RSK mapping to symmetric matrices and show that the volume
preserving property continues to hold. We determine the probability law of the
polymer partition function with inverse gamma weights that are constrained to
be symmetric about the main diagonal, with an additional factor on the main
diagonal. The third combinatorial mapping studied is a variant of the geometric
RSK mapping for triangular arrays, which is again showed to be volume
preserving. This leads to a formula for the probability distribution of a
polymer model whose paths are constrained to stay below the diagonal. We also
show that the analogues of the Cauchy-Littlewood identity in the setting of
this paper are equivalent to a collection of Whittaker integral identities
conjectured by Bump (1989) and Bump and Friedberg (1990) and proved by Stade
(2001, 2002). Our approach leads to new `combinatorial' proofs and
generalizations of these identities, with some restrictions on the parameters.

X-ray morphology with measurements of the luminosity gap statistics and
ellipticity of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We check how our new X-ray

clusters with relatively undisturbed X-ray morphologies are on average more
luminous at fixed X-ray temperature than those with disturbed morphologies, and
(ii) disturbed clusters have larger X-ray masses than regular clusters for a

Model Averaging in large-scale networks. Currently, Bayesian model averaging
algorithm is applicable to networks with only tens of variables, restrained by
its super-exponential complexity. We present a novel framework, called
LSBN(Large-Scale Bayesian Network), making it possible to handle networks with
infinite size by following the principle of divide-and-conquer. The method of
LSBN comprises three steps. In general, LSBN first performs the partition by
using a second-order partition strategy, which achieves more robust results.
LSBN conducts sampling and structure learning within each overlapping community
after the community is isolated from other variables by Markov Blanket. Finally
LSBN employs an efficient algorithm, to merge structures of overlapping
communities into a whole. In comparison with other four state-of-art
large-scale network structure learning algorithms such as ARACNE, PC, Greedy
Search and MMHC, LSBN shows comparable results in five common benchmark
datasets, evaluated by precision, recall and f-score. What's more, LSBN makes
it possible to learn large-scale Bayesian structure by Model Averaging which
used to be intractable. In summary, LSBN provides an scalable and parallel
framework for the reconstruction of network structures. Besides, the complete
information of overlapping communities serves as the byproduct, which could be
used to mine meaningful clusters in biological networks, such as
protein-protein-interaction network or gene regulatory network, as well as in
social network.

permitting a variable, but bounded, interval between successive transits. We
show that this method is capable of detecting transiting planets with
significant transit timing variations (TTVs) without any loss of significance
-- ""smearing"" -- as would be incurred with traditional algorithms; however,
this is at the cost of an slightly-increased stochastic background. The
approximate times of transit are standard products of the QATS search. Despite
the increased flexibility, we show that QATS has a run-time complexity that is
comparable to traditional search codes and is comparably easy to implement.
QATS is applicable to data having a nearly uninterrupted, uniform cadence and
is therefore well-suited to the modern class of space-based transit searches
(e.g., Kepler, CoRoT). Applications of QATS include transiting planets in
dynamically active multi-planet systems and transiting planets in stellar
binary systems.

growth of pores. There have been numerous studies focusing on flow fields in
and around individual pores. We have undertaken a systematic study of the
statistical properties of such flows. Data of the Hinode Solar Optical
Telescope offer an opportunity for this type of research, because of the
uniform data quality and absence of seeing so that pores can directly be
compared in different environments and at various stages of their evolution. We
analyzed about 220 time-series of G-band images using local correlation
tracking. The thus computed flow maps make up a database, which covers various
scenes on the solar surface. We use an isolated pore to illustrate the
statistical parameters collected for further statistical analysis, which
include information about morphology, horizontal flows, evolutionary stage

proximity to sunspots or cluster of G-band bright points.

a candidate of $f(\mathcal{R})$, which is able to pass our cosmological test,

We
proposed a mathematical physics model to explore how the melting temperature of
a two dimensional mathematical dimer film depends on the odd-eveness of the
finite width of dimer film. A weak external bond between dimers is introduced
into the classical dimer model in this dimer film. We derived a general
equation of melting temperature and applied it for computing the melting
temperature of a dimer film covering a finite square lattice. The melting
temperature is proportional to the external bonding energy that we assume it
binds neighboring dimers together and proportional to the inverse of entropy
per site. Further more, it shows fusing two small rectangular dimer film with
odd number of length into one big rectangular film gains more entropy than
fusing two small rectangles with even number of length into the same big
rectangle. Fusing two small toruses with even number of length into one big
torus reduces entropy. Fusing two small toruses with odd number of length
increases the entropy. Thus two dimer films with even number of length repel
each other, two dimer films with odd length attract each other. The odd-even
effect is also reflected on the correlation function of two topologically
distinguishable loops in a torus surface. The entropy of finite system

also is devoted to the equivalent conversion between the graphs. The examining
of the transformation of the vertex graphs into the edge graphs (together with
the opposite transformation) illustrates the reasons of the appearance of
NP-completeness from the point of view of the graph theory. We suggest that it
also illustrates the synchronous possibility and impossibility of the struggle
with NP-completeness.

  has been submitted",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Freire et al. (2009, MNRAS, 396, 1764) have put forward a technique for
timing the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039A/B (hereafter A and B,
respectively). Their technique can be used to determine the sense of rotation
of A relative to its orbital plane. In this paper, we present another technique
with the same purpose. Two well-known periods, the sidereal day and solar day,
are often used to define the spin period of the earth. Their difference is
caused by a kinematic effect which correlated with earth's rotation and
revolution. We think that this kinematic effect should exist in the double
pulsar system and can be used to determine the sense of rotation of the
pulsars. Commonly, B's modulation frequency is considered to be equal to A's
rotation frequency, because B's signal is modulated by A's energy flux. When
the kinematic effect is considered, B's modulation frequency will be, similar
to the solar day and sidereal day, a little higher or lower than A's rotation
frequency. If this frequency offset can be found, A's rotation sense will be
determined and the position of the lighthouse model will be consolidated.

  compression","30 pages, 23 figures",,,,"cs.MM cs.GR math.DG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Surface parameterizations and registrations are important in computer
graphics and imaging, where 1-1 correspondences between meshes are computed. In
practice, surface maps are usually represented and stored as 3D coordinates
each vertex is mapped to, which often requires lots of storage memory. This
causes inconvenience in data transmission and data storage. To tackle this
problem, we propose an effective algorithm for compressing surface
homeomorphisms using Fourier approximation of the Beltrami representation. The
Beltrami representation is a complex-valued function defined on triangular
faces of the surface mesh with supreme norm strictly less than 1. Under
suitable normalization, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of
surface homeomorphisms and the set of Beltrami representations. Hence, every
bijective surface map is associated with a unique Beltrami representation.
Conversely, given a Beltrami representation, the corresponding bijective
surface map can be exactly reconstructed using the Linear Beltrami Solver
introduced in this paper. Using the Beltrami representation, the surface
homeomorphism can be easily compressed by Fourier approximation, without
distorting the bijectivity of the map. The storage memory can be effectively
reduced, which is useful for many practical problems in computer graphics and
imaging. In this paper, we proposed to apply the algorithm to texture map
compression and video compression. With our proposed algorithm, the storage
requirement for the texture properties of a textured surface can be
significantly reduced. Our algorithm can further be applied to compressing
motion vector fields for video compression, which effectively improve the
compression ratio.

our model $f(T)=2C_1 \sqrt{-T} +\alpha T+C_2,$ predicts the decay of dark

predicts that dark energy will overcome over all the energy content of the
Universe.
