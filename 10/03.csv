gravitational collapse. A compact star is treated as a complete degenerate
Fermi gas of neutrons, protons and electrons. In gravitational collapse, its
density reaches the thresholds for muon and pion productions, leading to
high-energy neutrinos production. By using adiabatic approximation that
macroscopic collapsing processes are much slower than microscopic processes of
particle interactions, we adopt equilibrium equations of microscopic processes
to obtain the number of neutrino productions. Assuming 10% of variation in
gravitational binding energy converted to the energy of produced neutrinos, we
obtain fluxes of 10MeV electron-neutrinos and GeV electron and muon neutrinos.
In addition, we compute the ratio (< 1) of total muon neutrino number to the
total electron neutrino number at the source and at the Earth considering
neutrino oscillations. We approximately obtain the number of GeV antineutrino
events (\gtrsim 1) in an ordinary detector such as Kamiokande and total energy
of neutrino flux (\gtrsim 10^{53} erg), as a function of collapsing star mass.

very long ago was generally considered to be impossible -- we have learned how
the Sun rotates, and we have a beautiful picture, on a coffee cup, of the

measure is derived from a deformation energy whose Hessian reproduces the
underlying Riemannian metric, and it is used to define length and energy of
discrete paths in shape space. The notion of discrete geodesics defined as
energy minimizing paths gives rise to a discrete logarithmic map, a variational
definition of a discrete exponential map, and a time discrete parallel

considered as boundary contours of physical objects consisting of viscous

field lies just beyond the half-light radius where standard models of globular
cluster dynamics (e.g. based on a lowered Maxwellian phase-space distribution)
make very robust predictions for the stellar proper motions as a function of
mass. The observed proper motions show no evidence for anisotropy in the
velocity distribution; furthermore, the observations agree in detail with a
straightforward model of the stellar distribution function. We do not find any
evidence that the young white dwarfs have received a natal kick in
contradiction with earlier results. Using the observed proper motions of the

number of stars in the cluster decreases by a factor of e, of about 3 Gyr. The

most massive main-sequence stars, providing the first direct constraint on the

often called containers. They are also useful in algebra, combinatorics,
topology, and higher category theory, and in this broader perspective the
polynomial aspect is often prominent and justifies the terminology. For
example, Tambara's theorem states that the category of finite polynomial
functors is the Lawvere theory for commutative semirings. In this talk I will
explain how an upgrade of the theory from sets to groupoids is useful to deal
with data types with symmetries, and provides a common generalisation of and a
clean unifying framework for quotient containers (cf. Abbott et al.), species
and analytic functors (Joyal 1985), as well as the stuff types of Baez-Dolan.
The multi-variate setting also includes relations and spans, multispans, and
stuff operators. An attractive feature of this theory is that with the correct
homotopical approach - homotopy slices, homotopy pullbacks, homotopy colimits,
etc. - the groupoid case looks exactly like the set case. After some standard
examples, I will illustrate the notion of data-types-with-symmetries with
examples from quantum field theory, where the symmetries of complicated tree
structures of graphs play a crucial role, and can be handled elegantly using
polynomial functors over groupoids. (These examples, although beyond species,
are purely combinatorial and can be appreciated without background in quantum
field theory.) Locally cartesian closed 2-categories provide semantics for
2-truncated intensional type theory. For a fullfledged type theory, locally
cartesian closed \infty-categories seem to be needed. The theory of these is
being developed by D.Gepner and the author as a setting for homotopical
species, and several of the results exposed in this talk are just truncations
of \infty-results obtained in joint work with Gepner. Details will appear

density and causal energy flux. Here we extend this framework by localizing the
angular momentum of the linearized gravitational field, deriving a
gravitational spin tensor which possesses similarly desirable properties. By
examining the local exchange of angular momentum (between matter and gravity)
we find that gravitational intrinsic spin is localized, separately from orbital
angular momentum, in terms of a gravitational spin tensor. This spin tensor is
then uniquely determined by requiring that it obey two simple physically
motivated algebraic conditions. Firstly, the spin of an arbitrary
(harmonic-gauge) gravitational plane wave is required to flow in the direction
of propagation of the wave. Secondly, the spin tensor of any
transverse-traceless gravitational field is required to be traceless. (The
second condition ensures that local field redefinitions suffice to cast our
gravitational energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor as sources of gravity in a
quadratic approximation to general relativity.) Additionally, the following
properties arise in the spin tensor spontaneously: all transverse-traceless
fields have purely spatial spin, and any field generated by a static
distribution of matter will carry no spin at all. Following the structure of
our previous paper, we then examine the (spatial) angular momentum exchanged
between the gravitational field and an infinitesimal detector, and develop a
microaveraging procedure that renders the process gauge-invariant. The exchange
of nonspatial angular momentum (i.e., moment of energy) is also analyzed,
leading us to conclude that a gravitational wave can displace the center of
mass of the detector; this conclusion is also confirmed by a first principles
treatment of the system. Finally, we discuss...

momentum carried by the linearized gravitational field, wherein the
gravitational energy-momentum tensor displays positive energy-density and
causal energy-flux, and the gravitational spin-tensor describes purely spatial
spin. We now investigate the role these tensors play in a broader theoretical

Noether currents associated with the symmetry of the linearized gravitational
field under translation and rotation, and (b) they are themselves a source of
gravity, analogous to the energy-momentum and spin of matter. To prove (a) we
construct a Lagrangian for linearized gravity (a covariantized Fierz-Pauli
Lagrangian for a massless spin-2 field) and show that our tensors can be
obtained from this Lagrangian using a standard variational technique for
calculating Noether currents. This approach generates formulae that uniquely
generalize our gravitational energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor beyond
harmonic gauge: we show that no other generalization can be obtained from a
covariantized Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian without introducing second derivatives in
the energy-momentum tensor. We then construct the Belinfante energy-momentum
tensor associated with our framework (combining spin and energy-momentum into a
single object) and as our first demonstration of (b) we establish that this
Belinfante tensor appears as the second-order contribution to a perturbative
expansion of the Einstein field equations. By considering a perturbative
expansion of the Einstein-Cartan field equations, we then demonstrate that (b)
can be realized without forming the Belinfante tensor: our energy-momentum

6363.776 \r{A} (the two red lines)) in order to better understand the
production of these atoms in cometary atmospheres. The analysis is based on 48
high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra collected with UVES at the ESO
VLT between 2003 and 2011 referring to 12 comets of different origins observed
at various heliocentric distances. The flux ratio of the green line to the sum
of the two red lines is evaluated to determine the parent species of the oxygen
atoms by comparison with theoretical models. This analysis confirms that, at
about 1 AU, H2O is the main parent molecule producing oxygen atoms. At
heliocentric distances > 2.5 AU, this ratio is changing rapidly, an indication
that other molecules are starting to contribute. CO and CO2, the most abundant
species after H2O in the coma, are good candidates and the ratio is used to
estimate their abundances. We found that the CO2 abundance relative to H2O in
comet C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) observed at 4 AU can be as high as ~70 %. The intrinsic
widths of the oxygen lines were also measured. The green line is on average
about 1 km/s broader than the red lines while the theory predicts the red lines
to be broader. This might be due to the nature of the excitation source and/or
a contribution of CO2 as parent molecule of the 5577.339 \r{A} line. At 4 AU,
we found that the width of the green and red lines in comet C/2001 Q4 are the

subject of growing research in the past decades. Here, we introduce a unified
framework that ties together the problems of downscaling, data fusion and data
assimilation as ill-posed inverse problems. This framework seeks solutions
beyond the classic least squares estimation paradigms by imposing proper
regularization, which are constraints consistent with the degree of smoothness
and probabilistic structure of the underlying state. We review relevant
regularization methods in derivative space and extend classic formulations of
the aforementioned problems with particular emphasis on hydrologic and
atmospheric applications. Informed by the statistical characteristics of the
state variable of interest, the central results of the paper suggest that
proper regularization can lead to a more accurate and stable recovery of the
true state and hence more skillful forecasts. In particular, using the Tikhonov

framework is demonstrated in static downscaling and fusion of synthetic
multi-sensor precipitation data, while a data assimilation numerical experiment

properties can be described in a self-consistent manner adopting a blurred
reflection model with no need to invoke partial covering. The rapid spectral
variability appears to be driven by changes in the shape of the primary emitter
that is illuminating the inner accretion disc around a rapidly spinning black
hole (a > 0.7). While light bending is certainly prominent, the rather constant
emissivity profile and break radius obtained in our spectral fitting suggest
that the blurring parameters are not changing as would be expected if the
primary source is varying its distance from the disc. Instead changes could be
intrinsic to the power law component. One possibility is that material in an
unresolved jet above the disc falls to combine with material at the base of the
jet producing the changes in the primary emitter (spectral slope and flux)
without changing its distance from the disc.

two opinions coexist in a stable relationship. We revisit and extend the
non-consensus opinion (NCO) model introduced by Shao. We generalize the NCO
model by adding a weight factor W to individual's own opinion when determining
its future opinion (NCOW model). We find that as W increases the minority
opinion holders tend to form stable clusters with a smaller initial minority
fraction compared to the NCO model. We also revisit another non-consensus
opinion, the inflexible contrarian opinion (ICO) model, which introduces
inflexible contrarians to model a competition between two opinions in the
steady state. In the ICO model, the inflexible contrarians effectively decrease
the size of the largest cluster of the rival opinion. All of the above models
have previously been explored in terms of a single network. However opinions
propagate not only within single networks but also between networks, we study
here the opinion dynamics in coupled networks. We apply the NCO rule on each
individual network and the global majority rule on interdependent pairs. We
find that the interdependent links effectively force the system from a second
order phase transition, which is characteristic of the NCO model on a single
network, to a hybrid phase transition, i.e., a mix of second-order and abrupt
jump-like transitions that ultimately becomes, as we increase the percentage of
interdependent agents, a pure abrupt transition. We conclude that for the NCO
model on coupled networks, interactions through interdependent links could push
the non-consensus opinion type model to a consensus opinion type model, which
mimics the reality that increased mass communication causes people to hold
opinions that are increasingly similar.

multiple new dualities and physical phenomena. We concentrate on one model
where we let seven-branes wrap a multi-centered Taub-NUT space instead of R4.
This configuration provides a successful F-theory embedding of a class of
recently proposed four-dimensional N = 2 superconformal (SCFT) \`a la Gaiotto.
Aspects of Argyres- Seiberg duality, of the new Gaiotto duality, as well as of
the branes network of Benini- Benvenuti and Tachikawa are captured by our
construction. The supergravity theory for the conformal case is also briefly
discussed. Extending our construction to the non-conformal case, we find
interesting cascading behavior in four-dimensional gauge theories with N = 2
supersymmetry. Since the analysis of this unexpected phenomenon is quite
difficult in the language of type IIB/F-theory, we turn to the type
IIA/M-theory description where the origin of the N = 2 cascade is clarified.
Using the T-dual type IIA brane language, we first start by studying the N = 1
supersymmetric cascading gauge theory found in type IIB string theory on p
regular and M fractional D3-branes at the tip of the conifold. We reproduce the
supersymmetric vacuum structure of this theory. We also show that the IIA
analog of the non-supersymmetric state found by Kachru, Pearson and Verlinde in
the IIB description is metastable in string theory, but the barrier for
tunneling to the supersymmetric vacuum goes to infinity in the field theory
limit. We then use the techniques we have developed to analyze the N = 2
supersymmetric gauge theory corresponding to regular and fractional D3-branes
on a near-singular K3, and clarify the origin of the cascade in this theory.

non-planarity of toroidal spin networks. Furthermore, three types of minimal

missing values. MI replaces missing values with a sample of random values drawn
from an imputation model. The most popular form of MI, which we call posterior
draw multiple imputation (PDMI), draws the parameters of the imputation model
from a Bayesian posterior distribution. An alternative, which we call maximum
likelihood multiple imputation (MLMI), estimates the parameters of the
imputation model using maximum likelihood (or equivalent). Compared to PDMI,
MLMI is less computationally intensive, faster, and yields slightly more
efficient point estimates.
  A past barrier to using MLMI was the difficulty of estimating the standard
errors of MLMI point estimates. We derive, implement, and evaluate three
consistent standard error formulas: (1) one combines variances within and
between the imputed datasets, (2) one uses the score function, and (3) one uses
the bootstrap to estimate variance components due to sampling and imputation.
Formula (1) modifies for MLMI a formula that has long been used under PDMI,
while formulas (2) and (3) can be used without modification under either PDMI
or MLMI. We have implemented MLMI and the standard error estimators in the mlmi

emission. Galaxy clusters are excellent targets to search for or to constrain
the rate of dark matter annihilation, as they are both massive and dark matter
dominated. In this study, we place limits on dark matter annihilation in a
sample of nearby clusters using upper limits on the diffuse radio emission, low
levels of observed diffuse emission, or detections of radio mini-haloes. We
find that the strongest limits on the annihilation cross section are better
than limits derived from the non-detection of clusters in the gamma-ray band by
a factor of approximately 3 or more when the same annihilation channel and
subtructure model, but different best-case clusters, are compared. The limits
on the cross section depend on the assumed amount of substructure, varying by
as much as 2 orders of magnitude for increasingly optimistic substructure
models as compared to a smooth NFW profile. In our most optimistic case, using
the results of the Phoenix Project (Gao et al. 2012b) we find that the derived

satellites of Pluto got captured in the Pluto-Charon system from the massive
heliocentric planetesimal disk in which Pluto was originally embedded into. We
find that, if the dynamical excitation of the disk is small, temporary capture
in the Pluto-Charon system can occur with non-negligible probability, due to
the dynamical perturbations exerted by the binary nature of the Pluto-Charon
pair. However, the captured objects remain on very elliptic orbits and the
typical capture time is only 100 years. In order to explain the origin of the
small satellites of Pluto, we conjecture that some of these objects got
disrupted during their Pluto-bound phase by a collision with a planetesimal of
the disk. This could have generated a debris disk, which damped under internal
collisional evolution, until turning itself into an accretional disk that could
form small satellites on circular orbits, co-planar with Charon. Unfortunately,
we find that objects large enough to carry a sufficient amount of mass to
generate the small satellites of Pluto have collisional lifetimes orders of
magnitude longer than the capture time. Thus, this scenario cannot explain the
origin of the small satellites of Pluto, which remains elusive.

cosmological models and constrain cosmological parameters. A particular feature
of interest comes from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs), which are sound
waves traveling in the hot plasma of the early Universe that stopped at the
recombination time. This feature can be observed as a localized bump in the
correlation function at the scale of the sound horizon $r_s$. As such, it
provides a standard ruler and a lot of constraining power in the correlation
function analysis of galaxy surveys. Moreover the detection of BAOs at the
expected scale gives a strong support to cosmological models. Both of these
studies (BAO detection and parameter constraints) rely on a statistical
modeling of the measured correlation function $\hat{\xi}$. Usually $\hat{\xi}$
is assumed to be gaussian, with a mean $\xi_\theta$ depending on the
cosmological model and a covariance matrix $C$ generally approximated as a
constant (i.e. independent of the model). In this article we study whether a
realistic model-dependent $C_\theta$ changes the results of cosmological
parameter constraints compared to the approximation of a constant covariance
matrix $C$. For this purpose, we use a new procedure to generate lognormal
realizations of the Luminous Red Galaxies sample of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Data Release 7 to obtain a model-dependent $C_\theta$ in a reasonable
time. The approximation of $C_\theta$ as a constant creates small changes in
the cosmological parameter constraints on our sample. We quantify this modeling
error using a lot of simulations and find that it only has a marginal influence
on cosmological parameter constraints for current and next-generation galaxy
surveys. It can be approximately taken into account by extending the $1\sigma$
intervals by a factor $\approx 1.3$.

present a distributed iterative algorithm for K-user MIMO interference networks

combines the system-wide mean squared error minimization with the waterfilling

maximize accordingly each user's transmission rate. Sum-rate computer

in the interference-limited regime, the proposed algorithm reconfigures itself

systems are always gravitationally unstable (in a probabilistic sense). The
fragmentation mass spectra, size/mass relations, correlation functions, range
of scales over which fragmentation occurs, & time-dependent rates of
fragmentation are predictable. We show how this depends on bulk turbulent
properties (Mach numbers & power spectra). We also generalize to include
rotation, complicated equations of state, collapsing/expanding backgrounds,
magnetic fields, intermittency, & non-normal statistics. We derive how
fragmentation is suppressed with 'stiffer' equations of state or different
driving mechanisms. Suppression appears at an 'effective sonic scale' where
Mach(R,rho)~1. Gas becomes stable below this scale for polytropic gamma>4/3,
but fragmentation still occurs on larger scales. The scale-free nature of
turbulence and gravity generically drives mass spectra and correlation
functions towards universal shapes, with weak dependence on many properties of
the media. Correlated fluctuation structures, non-Gaussian density
distributions, & intermittency have surprisingly small effects on the
fragmentation process. This is because fragmentation cascades on small scales
are 'frozen in' when large-scale modes push the 'parent' region above the
collapse threshold; though they collapse, their statistics are only weakly
modified by the collapse process. With thermal support, structure develops
'top-down' in time via fragmentation cascades; but strong rotational support
reverses this to 'bottom-up' growth via mergers & introduces a maximal
instability scale distinct from the Toomre scale.

This is the first H2 system analysed at a redshift < 1.5 beyond the Milky Way

based on modelling the line profiles, with a robust model-independent lower

metallicity of the absorber is 0.19 +0.21 -0.10 solar, with a dust-to-gas ratio
< 0.36 times the value in the solar neighbourhood. Absorption from associated
low-ionisation metal transitions such as OI and FeII is observed in addition to
OVI. Using Cloudy models we show that there are three phases present; a ~100 K

absorption is produced; and a hotter phase associated with OVI. Based on
similarities to high velocity clouds in the Milky Way halo showing H2 and the
presence of two nearby galaxy candidates with impact parameters of ~10 kpc, we
suggest that the absorber may be produced by a tidally-stripped structure

stellar distributions. However, the instant at which gas expulsion occurs is
found to have a strong effect on cluster response to gas removal. We find if

no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics prevents quantum information from being
copied in space, the reversibility of microscopic physics actually requires
that the information be copied in time. In spacetime as a whole, therefore,
quantum information is widely replicated but in a restricted fashion. We fully
characterize which regions of spacetime can all hold the same quantum
information. Because quantum information can be delocalized through quantum
error correction and teleportation, it need not follow well-defined
trajectories. Instead, replication of the information in any configuration of
spacetime regions not leading to violations of causality or the no-cloning
principle is allowed. To demonstrate this, we answer the operational question
of exactly when the information can be summoned to a set of spacetime points,
showing how to do so efficiently using a combination of teleportation and
codeword-stabilized quantum codes. This provides a simple and complete
description of where and when a qubit can be located in spacetime, revealing a
remarkable variety of possibilities.

an impact-generated disk, consisting of a fluid model for the disk inside the
Roche limit and an N-body code to describe accretion outside the Roche limit.
As the inner disk spreads due to a thermally regulated viscosity, material is
delivered across the Roche limit and accretes into moonlets that are added to
the N-body simulation. Contrary to an accretion timescale of a few months
obtained with prior pure N-body codes, here the final stage of the Moon's
growth is controlled by the slow spreading of the inner disk, resulting in a
total lunar accretion timescale of ~10^2 years. It has been proposed that the
inner disk may compositionally equilibrate with the Earth through diffusive
mixing, which offers a potential explanation for the identical oxygen isotope
compositions of the Earth and Moon. However, the mass fraction of the final
Moon that is derived from the inner disk is limited by resonant torques between
the disk and exterior growing moons. For initial disks containing < 2.5 lunar
masses (ML), we find that a final Moon with mass > 0.8ML contains < 60%
material derived from the inner disk, with this material preferentially
delivered to the Moon at the end of its accretion.

paper focuses on the anomalous appearence of strong infrared phonon resonances
in the optical spectroscopy of bilayer graphene and on their pronounced
Fano-like asymmetry, both tunable in gated devices. By developing a full
microscopic many-body approach for the optical phonon response we explain how
both effects can be quantitatively accounted for by the quantum interference of
electronic and phononic excitations. We show that the phonon modes borrow a
large dipole intensity from the electronic background, the so-called
charged-phonon effect, and at the same time interfer with it, leading to a
typical Fano response. Our approach allows one to disentangle the correct
selection rules that control the relative importance of the two (symmetric and
antisymmetric) relevant phonon modes for different values of the doping and/or
of the gap in bilayer graphene. Finally, we discuss the extension of the same
theoretical scheme to the Raman spectroscopy, to explain the lack of the same
features on the Raman phononic spectra. Besides its remarkable success in
explaining the existing experimental data in graphene-based systems, the
present theoretical approach offers a general scheme for the microscopic
understanding of Fano-like features in a wide variety of other systems.

obtained, and empirical expressions proposed in earlier studies are shown to be

surface. On a one-dimensional (stripe) lattice, the fundamental line soliton is
proved to be transversely unstable for both signs of transverse dispersion. If
this transverse dispersion has the opposite sign to the discrete dispersion,
the instability is caused by a resonance between isolated eigenvalues of
negative energy and the continuous spectrum of positive energy. These results
hold for both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities via a staggering

expressions for unstable eigenvalues are also derived. These analytical results

predict fatigue life from a variable amplitude strain history is presented. A
critical feature of this reversal-by-reversal model is that the damage
accumulation is inherently non-linear. The damage for a reversal in the
variable amplitude loading history is predicted by approximating that the
accumulated damage comes from a constant amplitude loading that has the strain
range of the particular variable amplitude reversal. A key feature of this
approach is that overloads at the beginning of the strain history have a more
substantial impact on the total lifetime than overloads applied toward the end
of the cycle life. This technique effectively incorporates the strain history
in the damage prediction and has the advantage over other methods in that there
are no fitting parameters that require substantial experimental data. The model
presented here is validated using experimental variable amplitude fatigue data
for three different metals.

on J, rather they are determined by the relation between \Omega_R and D. We
derive analytical expressions for the frequencies and the intensities of all

where \delta is detuning of the driving ac field from the Larmor frequency.
When \Omega_R>>D, the two lower frequencies approach s=\Omega_R, while the
upper line approaches s=2\Omega_R. Disorder of the local Larmor frequencies
leads to a Gaussian broadening of the spectral lines. We calculate
corresponding widths for different \Omega_R/D and \delta/D. Unexpectedly, we
find that one of the frequency components exhibits an unusual evolution with
\Omega_R: its frequency decreases with \Omega_R at \Omega_R<D. Upon further
increase of \Omega_R this frequency then passes through a minimum and,
eventually, approaches s=\Omega_R. Nonmonotonic behavior of the frequencies is
accompanied by nonmonotonic behavior of the respective oscillation intensity.

Such mechanism in addition to differential rotation has been suggested by
studies of flux emergence, which typically require field strength in excess of

potential energy of the superadiabatically stratified convection zone is
converted into magnetic energy. This mechanism, know as explosion of magnetic
flux tubes, has been previously studied in the thin flux tube approximation as
well as two-dimensional MHD simulations, we expand the investigation to
three-dimensional MHD simulations. Our main result is that enough
intensification can be achieved in a three-dimensional magnetic flux sheet as
long as the spatial scale of the imposed perturbation normal to the magnetic
field is sufficiently large. When this spatial scale is small, the flux sheet
tends to rise toward the surface, resulting in a significant decrease of the
magnetic field amplification.

importance of scattering and growth processes in an experimentally accessible

dominate over the growth, leading to qualitatively different system dynamics.
In particular, the scattering causes the system to rapidly reach thermal
equilibrium without greatly depleting the condensate, suggesting that it
provides a highly coherent energy transfer mechanism.

crowds, is often negatively impacted by unreliable information sources with the
low quality data. This becomes a barrier to the effective use of collective
intelligence in a variety of applications. In order to address this issue, we
propose a probabilistic model to jointly assess the reliability of sources and
find the true data. We observe that different sources are often not independent
of each other. Instead, sources are prone to be mutually influenced, which
makes them dependent when sharing information with each other. High dependency
between sources makes collective intelligence vulnerable to the overuse of
redundant (and possibly incorrect) information from the dependent sources.
Thus, we reveal the latent group structure among dependent sources, and
aggregate the information at the group level rather than from individual
sources directly. This can prevent the collective intelligence from being
inappropriately dominated by dependent sources. We will also explicitly reveal
the reliability of groups, and minimize the negative impacts of unreliable
groups. Experimental results on real-world data sets show the effectiveness of
the proposed approach with respect to existing algorithms.

digital age to a point where animate and inanimate objects can be used as a
communication channel. In addition, the ubiquity of mobile phones with
increasing capabilities and ample resources means people are now effectively
mobile sensors that can be used to sense the environment as well as data
carriers. These objects, along with their devices, form a new kind of networks
that are characterized by frequent disconnections, resource constraints and
unpredictable or stochastic mobility patterns. A key underpinning in these
networks is routing or data dissemination protocols that are designed
specifically to handle the aforementioned characteristics. Therefore, there is
a need to review state-of-the-art routing protocols, categorize them, and
compare and contrast their approaches in terms of delivery rate, resource
consumption and end-to-end delay. To this end, this paper reviews 63 unicast,
multicast and coding-based routing protocols that are designed specifically to
run in delay tolerant or challenged networks. We provide an extensive
qualitative comparison of all protocols, highlight their experimental setup and
outline their deficiencies in terms of design and research methodology. Apart
from that, we review research that aims to exploit studies on social networks
and epidemiology in order to improve routing protocol performance. Lastly, we
provide a list of future research directions.

also calculated standing wave spectrum inside the well of double barriers and
phase time of double-barrier tunneling. The wave number spectrums of standing

as resonance life time, which coincides at least in order of magnitude with

$l\rightarrow\infty$ as that of tunneling through a single barrier, and the

planetesimals --- can be explained by a mechanism of gravitational instability.
The present work focused on the origin of self-gravitating clumps in which
planetesimal formation could take place. Our computer simulations demonstrated
that such clumps of gas and boulders formed due to the development of a
two-phase instability. This instability revealed a so-called 'mutual influence
effect' in the protoplanetary disc, where the dynamics of the system were
determined by the collisionless collective motion of a low-mass subdisc
composed of primary solids. We found that a 0.1 $c_s$ velocity dispersion in
the boulder subdisc was sufficient to cause the formation of self-gravitating
clumps of gas and boulders. In such regimes, the time needed for the formation
of the collapsing objects was less than the boulders' dissipation time in the
density waves of the medium.

filaments of emitters running across this region. By examining the properties
of H-alpha emitters within the large-scale structure, we find that galaxies in
the higher-density environments at z=2.16 tend to have redder colours and
higher stellar masses compared to galaxies in more underdense regions. We also
find a population of H-alpha emitters with red colours ((J-Ks)>1), which are
much more frequent in the denser environments and which have apparently very
high stellar masses with M*>~10^11Msun, implying that these cluster galaxies
have already formed a large part of their stellar mass before z~2. Spitzer
Space Telescope 24-micron data suggests that many of these red H-alpha emitters
are bright, dusty starbursts (rather than quiescent sources). We also find that
the proto-cluster galaxies follow the same correlation between SFR and M* (the
""main sequence"") of z~2 field star-forming galaxies, but with an excess of
massive galaxies. These very massive star-forming galaxies are not seen in our
similar, previous study of z~1 clusters, suggesting that their star-formation
activity has been shut off at 1<~z<~2. We infer that the massive red (but

strong two-photon absorption and free carrier absorption, which often introduce
strong thermal effect that limit the devices' stability and cooling
performance. Further, silicon also does not provide the desired lowest order
optical nonlinearity for interfacing with other active electrical components on
a chip. On the other hand, aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wideband semiconductor
widely used in micromechanical resonators due to its low mechanical loss and
high electromechanical coupling strength. Here we report the development of
AlN-on-silicon platform for low loss, wideband optical guiding, as well as its

into the world of `big science'. Partly funded by the US Carnegie and
Rockefeller foundations, it was designed in England by Freeman Fox & Partners,
and built by the German firm MAN. This article will give an overview of the
origins of the idea for the telescope and the funding, planning and
construction of the Parkes dish over the period 1954 to 1961.

extrapolations using the flux-dispersal model as the boundary condition have
slightly lower, therefore better, force-free and divergence-free metrics, and
contain larger free magnetic energy. By comparing the extrapolated magnetic

significant fraction of massive and merging galaxy clusters.Their statistical
properties can be used to discriminate among various models for their origin.
Theoretical predictions are important as new radio telescopes are about to
begin to survey the sky at low and high frequencies with unprecedented
sensitivity. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations to model the formation and
evolution of RH in a cosmological framework by assuming that RH are either
generated in turbulent merging clusters, or are purely hadronic sources
generated in more relaxed clusters, ""off-state"" halos. The models predict that
the luminosity function of RH at high radio luminosities is dominated by the
contribution of RH generated in turbulent clusters. The generation of these RH
becomes less efficient in less massive systems causing a flattening of the
luminosity function at lower luminosities. This flattening is compensated by
the contribution of ""off-state"" RH that dominate at lower luminosities. By
restricting to clusters at z<0.6, we show that the planned EMU+WODAN surveys at
1.4 GHz have the potential to detect up to ~200 RH, increasing their number by
one order of magnitude. A fraction of these sources will be ""off-state"" RH that
should be found at flux level < 10 mJy, presently accessible only to deep
pointed observations. We also explore the synergy between the Tier 1 LOFAR
survey at 150 MHz and the EMU+WODAN surveys at 1.4 GHz. We predict a larger
number of RH in the LOFAR survey due to the high LOFAR sensitivity, but also
due to the existence of RH with very steep spectrum that glow up preferentially
at lower frequencies. These RH are only predicted in the framework of turbulent
re-acceleration models and should not have counterparts in the EMU+WODAN
surveys, thus the combination of the two surveys will test theoretical models.

expected to substantially change their properties over their lifetime. MBH
masses increase by several order of magnitude over the Hubble time, as
illustrated by Soltan's argument. MBH spins also must evolve through the series
of accretion and mergers events that grow the MBH's masses. We present a simple
model that traces the joint evolution of MBH masses and spins across cosmic
time. Our model includes MBH-MBH mergers, merger-driven gas accretion,
stochastic fueling of MBHs through molecular cloud capture, and a basic
implementation of accretion of recycled gas. This approach aims at improving
the modeling of low-redshift MBHs and AGN, whose properties can be more easily
estimated observationally. Despite the simplicity of the model, it captures
well the global evolution of the MBH population from z\sim6 to today. Under our
assumptions, we find that the typical spin and radiative efficiency of MBHs
decrease with cosmic time because of the higher incidence of stochastic
processes in gas-rich galaxies and MBH-MBH mergers in gas-poor galaxies. At z=0
the spin distribution in gas-poor galaxies peaks at spins 0.4-0.8, and it is
not strongly mass dependent. MBHs in gas-rich galaxies have a more complex
evolution, with low-mass MBHs at low redshift having low spins, and spins
increasing at larger masses and redshifts. We also find that at z>1 MBH spins

existing theoretical approaches to homogeneous random bulk Fe-Co alloys, based
on a simple virtual crystal approximation (VCA), overestimate the maximum MAE
values obtained in the CPA by a factor of four. This pronounced difference is
ascribed to the strong disorder in the minority spin channel of real alloys,
which is neglected in the VCA and which leads to a broadening of the d-like
eigenstates at the Fermi energy and to the reduction of the MAE. The ordered
Fe-Co alloys with a maximum L1_0-like atomic long-range order can exhibit high
values of the MAE, which, however, get dramatically reduced by small
perturbations of the perfect order.

empirical properties of systems situated within environments more comparable to
loose groups, including the Milky Way's Local Group. Cosmological simulations
of Milky Way-mass galaxies have been realised in two different environment
samples: in the field and in environments with similar properties to the Local
Group. Apart from the environments of the galaxies, the samples are kept as
homogeneous as possible with equivalent ranges in last major merger time, halo
mass and halo spin. Comparison of these two samples allow for systematic
differences in the simulations to be identified. Metallicity gradients, disk
scale lengths, colours, magnitudes and age-velocity dispersion relations are
studied for each galaxy in the suite and the strength of the link between these
and environment of the galaxies is studied. The bulge-to-disk ratio of the
galaxies show that these galaxies are less spheroid dominated than many other
simulated galaxies in literature with the majority of both samples being disk
dominated. We find that secular evolution and mergers dominate the spread of
morphologies and metallicity gradients with no visible differences between the
two environment samples. In contrast with this consistency in the two samples
there is tentative evidence for a systematic difference in the velocity
dispersion-age relations of galaxies in the different environments. Loose group
galaxies appear to have more discrete steps in their velocity dispersion-age
relations. We conclude that at the current resolution of cosmological galaxy
simulations field environment galaxies are sufficiently similar to those in
loose groups to be acceptable proxies for comparison with the Milky Way
provided that a similar assembly history is considered.

galaxies and for stacked ensembles at 0.5<z<2, we derive robust estimates of
dust masses (Mdust) for main sequence (MS) galaxies, which obey a tight
correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M*), and for
star-bursting galaxies that fall outside that relation. Exploiting the
correlation of gas to dust mass with metallicity (Mgas/Mdust -Z), we use our
measurements to constrain the gas content, CO-to-H2 conversion factors (a_co)
and star formation efficiencies (SFE) of these distant galaxies. Using large
statistical samples, we confirm that a_co and SFE are an order of magnitude
higher and lower, respectively, in MS galaxies at high redshifts compared to
the values of local galaxies with equivalently high infrared luminosities. For
galaxies within the MS, we show that the variations of specific star formation
rates (sSFR=SFR/M*) are driven by varying gas fractions. For relatively massive
galaxies like those in our samples, we show that the hardness of the radiation
field, <U>, which is proportional to the dust mass weighted luminosity
(LIR/Mdust), and the primary parameter defining the shape of the SED, is
equivalent to SFE/Z. For MS galaxies we measure this quantity, <U>, showing
that it does not depend significantly on either the stellar mass or the sSFR.
This is explained as a simple consequence of the existing correlations between
SFR-M*, M*-Z and Mgas-SFR. Instead, we show that <U> (or LIR/Mdust) does
evolve, with MS galaxies having harder radiation fields and thus warmer
temperatures as redshift increases from z=0 to 2, a trend which can also be
understood based on the redshift evolution of the M*-Z and SFR-M* relations.
These results motivate the construction of a universal set of SED templates for
MS galaxies which vary as a function of redshift with only one parameter, <U>.

(classical) tilting theory from the viewpoint of mutation. It is well-known in
tilting theory that an almost complete tilting module for any finite
dimensional algebra over a field k is a direct summand of exactly 1 or 2
tilting modules. An important property in cluster tilting theory is that an
almost complete cluster-tilting object in a 2-CY triangulated category is a
direct summand of exactly 2 cluster-tilting objects. Reformulated for path
algebras kQ, this says that an almost complete support tilting modules has
exactly two complements. We generalize (support) tilting modules to what we
call (support) tau-tilting modules, and show that an almost support tau-tilting
module has exactly two complements for any finite dimensional algebra. For a
finite dimensional k-algebra A, we establish bijections between functorially
finite torsion classes in mod A, support tau-tilting modules and two-term
silting complexes in Kb(proj A). Moreover these objects correspond bijectively
to cluster-tilting objects in C if A is a 2-CY tilted algebra associated with a
2-CY triangulated category C. As an application, we show that the property of
having two complements holds also for two-term silting complexes in Kb(proj A).

energy from a rotating black hole, however it was soon realized that it was not
very efficient for its astrophysical applications for powering the central
engine of quasars and AGNs. The situation however changed dramatically in the
presence of magnetic field produced by the accretion disk surrounding the hole
in the equatorial plane. In 1985, Wagh, Dhurandhar and Dadhich had for the
first time considered the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in which the magnetic
field could now provide the energy required for a fragment to ride on negative
energy orbit thereby overcoming the stringent velocity constraint of the
original PP. Thus MPP turned very efficient and so much so that efficiency
could now even exceed 100 percent. They had in principle established revival of
PP for astrophysical applications in powering the high energy sources. MPP is
however similar to the earlier discovered and well known Blandford-Znajeck (BZ)
mechanism in which the rotational energy of the hole is extracted out through a
purely electromagnetic process. Though both the processes use magnetic field as
a device to extract rotational energy from the hole, yet their kernel is quite
different in spirit. For the former magnetic field provides the threshold
energy for particle to get onto negative energy orbit so that the other
fragment goes out with enhanced energy while for the latter it generates an
electric potential difference between the equatorial plane and the polar
region, and it is the discharge of which that drives the energy flux out of the
hole. In other words, MPP is still rooted in the spacetime geometry while BZ is
essentially driven by electromagnetic interaction.

flow between the reactants, leading to a re-separation of more symmetric
fragments in the exit channel. A good understanding of the competition between
fusion and quasi-fission mechanisms is expected to be of great help to optimize
the formation and study of heavy and superheavy nuclei. Quantum microscopic
models, such as the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, allow for a treatment
of all degrees of freedom associated to the dynamics of each nucleon. This
provides a description of the complex reaction mechanisms, such as
quasi-fission, with no parameter adjusted on reaction mechanisms. In
particular, the role of the deformation and orientation of a heavy target, as
well as the entrance channel magicity and isospin are investigated with

epsilon=(epsilon_1,epsilon_2,...,epsilon_n) in {-1,1}^n and the corresponding
scalar products a.epsilon=sum_{i=1}^n a_i epsilon_i. Holtzman and Kleitman
formulated the following conjecture. It states that among the 2^n sums of the
form sum +/- a_i there are not more with |sum_{i=1}^n +/- a_i|>1 than there are
with |sum_{i=1}^n +/- a_i| <= 1. The result is of interest in itself, but has
also an appealing reformulation in probability theory and in geometry. In this
paper we will solve an extension of this problem in the uniform case where all
the a's are equal. More precisely, for S_n being a sum of n independent
Rademacher random variables, we will give, for several values of xi, precise
lower bounds for the probabilities P_n:=P{-xi sqrt{n} <= S_n <= xi sqrt{n}}.
There is an obvious relationship with the binomial distribution with parameters
n and p=1/2.
  The obtained lower bounds are sharp and much better than for instance the
bound that can be obtained from application of the Chebishev inequality. In
case xi=1 Van Zuijlen solved this problem. We remark that our bound will have
nice applications in probability theory and especially in random walk theory.

Here we analyse this unique dataset to determine absolute physical parameters

sophisticated novel approach. We measure eclipse timing variations (ETVs),
which are then combined with the single-lined radial velocity measurements to
yield masses in a manner equivalent to double-lined spectroscopic binaries. We
have also developed a new light curve synthesis code that is used to model the
triple, mutual eclipses and the effects of the changing tidal field on the
stellar surface and the relativistic Doppler-beaming. By combining the stellar
masses from the ETV study with the simultaneous light curve analysis we
determine the absolute radii of the three stars. Our results indicate that the

cosmic baryon fraction. For the largest galaxy in the triplet, this is in
contradiction to numerical simulations. The discovery of this very unique dwarf

""in-medium"") parameters of the $\pi N$ scattering amplitude: total cross
section, the ratio of real to imaginary part of the forward $\pi N$ amplitude,
and the slope parameter, were obtained by fitting them to the data on the
respective pion-nucleus cross sections calculated by means of the corresponding
relativistic wave equation with the above OP. A difference is discussed between
the best-fit ""in-medium"" parameters and the ""free"" parameters of the $\pi N$
scattering amplitudes known from the experimental data on scattering of pions
on free nucleons.

modification of the probability density function (pdf) of the random inputs,
when the quantity of interest is a failure probability (probability that a
model output exceeds a given threshold). An input is considered influential if
the input pdf modification leads to a broad change in the failure probability.
These sensitivity indices can be computed using the sole set of simulations
that has already been used to estimate the failure probability, thus limiting
the number of calls to the numerical model. In the case of a Monte Carlo
sample, asymptotical properties of the indices are derived. Based on
Kullback-Leibler divergence, several types of input perturbations are
introduced. The relevance of this new sensitivity analysis method is analysed

cover three main areas of subject: basic theory of polarization, standard
ellipsometry and Mueller ellipsometry. Section I is devoted to a short and
pedagogical introduction of the formalisms used to describe light polarization.
The following section is devoted to standard ellipsometry. The focus is on the
experimental aspects, including both pros and cons of commercially available

quantiles has relied on the Bahadur representation. This provides an error of
order $n^{-1/4}$ in normal approximations, and suggests that inference based on
regression quantiles may not be as reliable as that based on other (smoother)
approaches, whose errors are generally of order $n^{-1/2}$ (or better in
special symmetric cases). Fortunately, extensive simulations and empirical
applications show that inference for regression quantiles shares the smaller
error rates of other procedures. In fact, the ""Hungarian"" construction of
Koml\'{o}s, Major and Tusn\'{a}dy [Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 32 (1975) 111-131,
Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 34 (1976) 33-58] provides an alternative expansion
for the one-sample quantile process with nearly the root-$n$ error rate
(specifically, to within a factor of $\log n$). Such an expansion is developed
here to provide a theoretical foundation for more accurate approximations for
inference in regression quantile models. One specific application of
independent interest is a result establishing that for conditional inference,
the error rate for coverage probabilities using the Hall and Sheather [J. R.

of containing emission lines from all elements from carbon to zinc within the

studied, which contain valuable information about their origin. Most elements
were formed in type Ia and core-collapse supernovae, which have very different
chemical yields. Massive stars and AGB stars also contribute by providing most
of the carbon and nitrogen in the ICM. Because feedback processes suppress star
formation in the cluster centre, the element abundances allow us to directly
probe the star formation history of the majority of stars that are thought to
have formed between z=2-3. The spatial distribution in the core and the
evolution with redshift also provide information about how these elements are
transported from the member galaxies to the ICM. I review the current progress

pipelines have emerged to revolutionize genomics. To further their central
goal, they aim to accelerate and improve the quality of de novo whole-genome
assembly starting from short DNA reads. However, the performance of each of
these tools is contingent on the length and quality of the sequencing data, the
structure and complexity of the genome sequence, and the resolution and quality
of long-range information. Furthermore, in the absence of any metric that
captures the most fundamental ""features"" of a high-quality assembly, there is
no obvious recipe for users to select the most desirable assembler/assembly.
International competitions such as Assemblathons or GAGE tried to identify the
best assembler(s) and their features. Some what circuitously, the only
available approach to gauge de novo assemblies and assemblers relies solely on
the availability of a high-quality fully assembled reference genome sequence.
Still worse, reference-guided evaluations are often both difficult to analyze,
leading to conclusions that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we
circumvent many of these issues by relying upon a tool, dubbed FRCbam, which is
capable of evaluating de novo assemblies from the read-layouts even when no
reference exists. We extend the FRCurve approach to cases where lay-out
information may have been obscured, as is true in many deBruijn-graph-based
algorithms. As a by-product, FRCurve now expands its applicability to a much
wider class of assemblers -- thus, identifying higher-quality members of this
group, their inter-relations as well as sensitivity to carefully selected
features, with or without the support of a reference sequence or layout for the
reads. The paper concludes by reevaluating several recently conducted assembly
competitions and the datasets that have resulted from them.

young stellar object (YSO) jet with the LINC-NIRVANA (LN) interferometric
instrument, which will be mounted on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). This
simulation has been performed in order to investigate the ability of observing
the weak diffuse jet line emission against the strong IR stellar continuum
through narrow band images in the H and K atmospheric windows. In general, this
simulation provides clues on the image quality that could be achieved in
observations with a high dynamic range. In these cases, standard deconvolution
methods, such as Richardson-Lucy, do not provide satisfactory results: we
therefore propose here a new method of image reconstruction. It consists in
considering the image to be reconstructed as the sum of two terms: one
corresponding to the star (whose position is assumed to be known) and the other
to the jet. A regularization term is introduced for this second component and
the reconstruction is obtained with an iterative method alternating between the
two components. An analysis of the results shows that the image quality
obtainable with this method is significantly improved with respect to standard
deconvolution methods, reducing the number of artifacts and allowing us to
reconstruct the original jet intensity distribution with an error smaller than
10%.

hydrogen. The standard picture is challenged that the material is cirrus-like
clouds of ceramic dust responsible for Halo extinction of cosmological sources
(Finkbeiner, Davis, and Schlegel 1999). Why would such dust clouds not collapse
gravitationally to a point on a gravitational free-fall time scale of $10^8$
years? Why do the particles not collide and stick together, as is fundamental
to the theory of planet formation (Blum 2004; Blum and Wurm, 2008) in pre-solar
accretion discs? Evidence from 3.3 $\mu$m and UIB emissions as well as ERE
(extended red emission) data point to the dominance of PAH-type macromolecules
for cirrus dust, but such fractal dust will not spin in the manner of rigid
grains (Draine & Lazarian, 1998). IRAS dust clouds examined by Herschel-Planck
are easily understood as dark matter Proto-Globular-star-Cluster (PGC) clumps
of primordial gas planets, as predicted by Gibson (1996) and observed by Schild
(1996).

The learnt model is used to anticipate the optical flow up to a given time

donor under-filling its Roche lobe, and a hot accreting white dwarf, possibly

from wind accretion. We constructed NLTE synthetic spectral models for white
dwarf spectra and optically thick accretion disk spectra to model a FUSE
spectrum of AG Dra, obtained when the hot component is viewed in front of the
yellow giant. The spectrum has been de-reddened (E(B-V) = 0.05) and the model
fitting carried out, with the distance regarded as a free parameter, but
required to be larger than the Hipparcos lower limit of 1 kpc. We find that the
best-fitting model is a bare accreting white dwarf with Mwd = 0.4 Msun, Teff =
80,000K and a model-derived distance of 1543 pc. Higher temperatures are ruled
out due to excess flux at the shortest wavelengths while a lower temperature
decreases the distance below 1 kpc. Any accretion disk which might be present
is a only a minor contributor to the FUV flux. This raises the possibility that
the soft X-rays originate from a very hot boundary layer between a putative
accretion disk and the accreting star.

  In part one we propose an extension of the usual symmetry reduction procedure
to noncommutative gravity. We classify in the case of abelian Drinfel'd twists
all consistent deformations of spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
cosmologies and of the Schwarzschild black hole. The deformed symmetry
structure allows us to obtain exact solutions of the noncommutative Einstein
equations in many of our models.
  In part two we develop a new formalism for quantum field theory on
noncommutative curved spacetimes by combining methods from the algebraic
approach to quantum field theory with noncommutative differential geometry. We
also study explicit examples of deformed wave operators and find that there can
be noncommutative corrections even on the level of free field theories. The
convergent deformation of simple toy models is investigated and it is found
that these theories have an improved behaviour at short distances, i.e. in the
ultraviolet.
  In part three we study homomorphisms between and connections on
noncommutative vector bundles. We prove that all homomorphisms and connections
of the deformed theory can be obtained by applying a quantization isomorphism
to undeformed homomorphisms and connections. The extension of homomorphisms and
connections to tensor products of bimodules is clarified. As a nontrivial
application of the new mathematical formalism we extend our studies of exact
noncommutative gravity solutions to more general deformations.

information and apply it to the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, a paradigm
for cell-cycle control. Operationally, we use an inducible promoter to express
the essential transcriptional regulatory gene ctrA in a periodic, pulsed
fashion. This chemical perturbation causes the population of cells to divide
synchronously, and we use the resulting advance or delay of the division times
of single cells to construct a phase resetting curve. We find that delay is
strongly favored over advance. This finding is surprising since it does not
follow from the temporal expression profile of CtrA and, in turn, simulations
of existing network models. We propose a phenomenological model that suggests
that the cell-cycle network comprises two distinct functional modules that
oscillate autonomously and couple in a highly asymmetric fashion. These
features collectively provide a new mechanism for tight temporal control of the
cell cycle in C. crescentus. We discuss how the procedure can serve as the
basis for a general approach for probing network dynamics, which we term

effective friction and to thermal equilibrium with energy distributed over the
internal degrees of freedom. For finite temperature, the effective friction can
be described well by a viscous damping force, with a damping coefficient that
emerges naturally from the microscopic dynamics. This damping coefficient is a
non-monotonic function of the sliding velocity which peaks around resonant
velocities and increases with temperature. At low velocities, it remains finite
and nonzero, indicating the preservation of superlubricity in the zero-velocity
limit. Finally, we propose experimental systems in which our results could be

host galaxies have variously claimed an association with HII regions; no
association; or an association only with hydrogen-deficient ccSNe. Here, we
examine the immediate environments of 39 ccSNe whose positions are well known
in nearby (<15 Mpc), low inclination (<65 degrees) hosts using mostly archival,
continuum-subtracted H-alpha ground-based imaging. We find that 11 out of 29
hydrogen-rich ccSNe are spatially associated with HII regions (38 +/- 11%),
versus 7 out of 10 hydrogen-poor ccSNe (70 +/- 26%). Similar results from
Anderson et al. led to an interpretation that the progenitors of type Ib/c
ccSNe are more massive than those of type II ccSNe. Here, we quantify the
luminosities of HII region either coincident with, or nearby to the ccSNe.
Characteristic nebulae are long-lived (~20 Myr) giant HII regions rather than
short-lived (~4 Myr) isolated, compact HII regions. Therefore, the absence of a
HII region from most type II ccSNe merely reflects the longer lifetime of stars
with <12 Msun than giant HII regions. Conversely, the association of a HII
region with most type Ib/c ccSNe is due to the shorter lifetime of stars with
>12 Msun stars than the duty cycle of giant HII regions. Therefore, we conclude
that the observed association between certain ccSNe and HII provides only weak
constraints upon their progenitor masses. Nevertheless, we do favour lower mass
progenitors for two type Ib/c ccSNe that lackassociated nebular emission, a
host cluster or a nearby giant HII region. Finally, we also reconsider the
association between long Gamma Ray Bursts and the peak continuum light from
their (mostly) dwarf hosts, and conclude that this is suggestive of very high
mass progenitors, in common with previous studies.

include up-to-date grain charging calculations using a realistic UV radiation
field and full 3-D magnetohydrodynamic fluid + kinetic models for the

magnetic field (SWMF) are used, with the grain trajectory calculations done
separately for each polarity. Small grains a_gr ~ 0.01 micron are completely
excluded from the inner heliosphere. Large grains, a_gr ~ 1.0 micron pass into
the inner solar system and are concentrated near the Sun by its gravity.
Trajectories of intermediate size grains depend strongly on the SWMF polarity.
When the field has magnetic north pointing to ecliptic north, the field
de-focuses the grains resulting in low densities in the inner heliosphere,
while for the opposite polarity the dust is focused near the Sun. The ISDG
density outside the heliosphere inferred from applying the model results to in
situ dust measurements is inconsistent with local ISM depletion data for both
SWMF polarities, but is bracketed by them. This result points to the need to
include the time variation in the SWMF polarity during grain propagation. Our
results provide valuable insights for interpretation of the in situ dust

on physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. To extract crucial
information about the electroweak force, small isospin-breaking corrections to
the Fermi matrix element of superallowed transitions must be applied. Purpose:
We perform systematic calculations of isospin-breaking corrections to
superallowed beta-decays and estimate theoretical uncertainties related to the
basis truncation, time-odd polarization effects related to the intrinsic
symmetry of the underlying Slater determinants, and to the functional
parametrization. Methods: We use the self-consistent isospin- and
angular-momentum-projected nuclear density functional theory employing two
density functionals derived from the density independent Skyrme interaction.
Pairing correlations are ignored. Our framework can simultaneously describe
various effects that impact matrix elements of the Fermi decay: symmetry
breaking, configuration mixing, and long-range Coulomb polarization. Results:
The isospin-breaking corrections to the I=0+,T=1 --> I=0+,T=1 pure Fermi
transitions are computed for nuclei from A=10 to A=98 and, for the first time,
to the Fermi branch of the I,T=1/2 --> I,T=1/2 transitions in mirror nuclei
from A=11 to A=49. We carefully analyze various model assumptions impacting
theoretical uncertainties of our calculations and provide theoretical error
bars on our predictions. Conclusions: The overall agreement with empirical
isospin-breaking corrections is very satisfactory. Using computed
isospin-breaking corrections we show that the unitarity of the CKM matrix is
satisfied with a precision better than 0.1%.

they influence the phonon curves by changing the state about which
linearization is performed. In this paper, we show that in nanotubes, the axial
load has a direct first-order influence on the long-wavelength behavior of the
transverse acoustic (TA) mode. In particular, when the tube is force-free the
TA mode frequencies vary quadratically with wave number and have curvature
(second derivative) proportional to the square-root of the nanotube's bending
stiffness. When the tube has non-zero external force, the TA mode frequencies
vary linearly with wave number and have slope proportional to the square-root
of the axial force. Therefore, the TA phonon curves -- and associated transport
properties -- are not material properties but rather can be directly tuned by
external loads. In addition, we show that the out-of-plane shear deformation
does {\em not} contribute to this mode and the unusual properties of the TA
mode are exclusively due to bending. Our calculations consist of 3 parts:
first, we use a linear chain of atoms as an illustrative example that can be
solved in close-form; second, we use our recently-developed symmetry-adapted
phonon analysis method to present direct numerical evidence; and finally, we
present a simple mechanical model that captures the essential physics of the
geometric nonlinearity in slender nanotubes that couples the axial load
directly to the phonon curves. We also compute the Density of States and show
the significant effect of the external load.

and explore here a simple test which has not been previously employed: when
cosmological codes are used to simulate an isolated overdensity, they should
reproduce, in physical coordinates, those obtained in open boundary conditions
without expansion. In particular, the desired collisionless nature of the
simulations can be probed by testing for stability in physical coordinates of
virialized equilibria. We investigate and illustrate the test using a suite of
simulations in an Einstein de Sitter cosmology from initial conditions which
rapidly settle to virial equilibrium. We find that the criterion of stable
clustering allows one to determine, for given particle number N in the ""halo""
and force smoothing, a maximum red-shift range over which the collisionless
limit may be represented with desired accuracy. We also compare our results to
the so-called Layzer Irvine test, showing that it provides a weaker, but very
useful, tool to constrain the choice of numerical parameters. Finally we
outline in some detail how these methods could be employed to test the choice
of the numerical parameters used in a cosmological simulation.

we then quantize (deform) H to H^F, A to A_\star and correspondingly the

construct and study tensor products over A of modules and of morphisms, and
their twist quantization.
  This study leads to the definition of arbitrary (i.e., not necessarily

connections to tensor product modules and to quantize them to A_\star-bimodule

velocities in the environment of Galactic WR stars. We use linear
line-depolarization as an indicator of rotation, nebular morphology as an
indicator of stellar ejecta, and velocity patterns in UV absorption features as
an indicator of increased velocities in the CS environment. We find that the
~23% WR stars with ""possible ejecta nebulae"" dominate the population of WR
stars with spectropolarimetric signatures of rotation, while WR stars without
such nebulae only rarely show indications of rotation. The corresponding
objects are most likely in an early stage after a preceding RSG or LBV phase,
and have not yet lost their angular momenta due to the strong mass-loss in the
WR phase. From their photometric periods we estimate rotation parameters in the
range omega = 0.04...0.25, corresponding to moderate rotation speeds of
36...120 km/s. These values are very uncertain, but comply with the specific
surface angular momentum requirement for LGRB progenitors. Our results indicate
that, in the Galaxy, mainly ""young"" WR stars shortly after a RSG/LBV phase show
spectropolarimetric signatures of rotation. Their rotation rates are thus
likely enhanced with respect to the majority of Galactic WR stars. According to
their estimated specific surface angular momenta, a subgroup of stars exploding
in this phase may represent an evolutionary channel towards LGRBs at high
metallicities, comparable to the Galaxy.

current technology. Within the next decade, systems will contain large numbers

many computational problems exhibit little or no parallelism and many existing
formulations are sequential. It is therefore essential that highly-parallel
architectures can support sequential computation by emulating large memories
with collections of smaller ones, thus supporting efficient execution of
sequential programs or sequential components of parallel programs.
  This paper demonstrates that a realistic parallel architecture with scalable
low-latency communications can execute large-memory sequential programs with a
factor of only 2 to 3 slowdown, when compared to a conventional sequential
architecture. This overhead seems an acceptable price to pay to be able to
switch between executing highly-parallel programs and sequential programs with
large memory requirements. Efficient emulation of large memories could
therefore facilitate a transition from sequential machines by allowing existing
programs to be compiled directly to a highly-parallel architecture and then for
their performance to be improved by exploiting parallelism in memory accesses
and computation.
