the reconstruction is not good enough. This leads to difficulties for the
statistical analysis of the CMB map, especially at very large scales (to study
for e.g., the low quadrupole, ISW, axis of evil, etc). We investigate in this
paper how well some inpainting techniques can recover the low-$\ell$ spherical

three different kinds of priors: sparsity, energy and isotropy, and we compare
them. We show that two of them, sparsity and energy priors, can lead to

observed spectra in redshift space include a mixture of information:
fluctuations of density-density and velocity-velocity spectra, and distance
measures of perpendicular and parallel components to the line of sight.
Unfortunately it is hard to measure all the components simultaneously without
any specific prior assumption. Common prior assumptions include a
linear/quasi-linear model of redshift distortions or a model for the shape of
the power spectra, which eventually breaks down on small scales at later epochs
where nonlinear structure formation disturbs coherent growth. The degeneracy
breaking, between the effect of cosmic distances and redshift distortions for
example, depends on the prior we assume. An alternative approach is to utilize
the cosmological principle inscribed in the heart of the
Friedmann-Lematre-Robertson-Walker (hereafter FLRW) universe, that is, the
specific relation between the angular diameter distance and the Hubble
parameter, in this degeneracy breaking. We show that utilizing this FLRW prior
early in the step of distinguishing the distance effect from redshift

features arising from the tenuous material in the space between stars -- the
interstellar medium (ISM). Since their first detection nearly nine decades ago,
over 400 DIBs have been observed in the visible and near-infrared wavelength
range in both the Milky Way and external galaxies, both nearby and distant.
However, the identity of the species responsible for these bands remains as one
of the most enigmatic mysteries in astrophysics.
  An equally mysterious interstellar spectral signature is the 2175 Angstrom
extinction bump, the strongest absorption feature observed in the ISM. Its
carrier also remains unclear since its first detection 46 years ago.
  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have long been proposed as a
candidate for DIBs as their electronic transitions occur in the wavelength
range where DIBs are often found. In recent years, the 2175 Angstrom extinction
bump is also often attributed to the \pi--\pi* transition in PAHs. If PAHs are
indeed responsible for both the 2175 Angstrom extinction feature and DIBs,
their strengths may correlate.
  We perform an extensive literature search for lines of sight for which both
the 2175 Angstrom extinction feature and DIBs have been measured.
Unfortunately, we found no correlation between the strength of the 2175
Angstrom feature and the equivalent widths of the strongest DIBs. A possible
explanation might be that DIBs are produced by small free gas-phase PAH
molecules and ions, while the 2175 Angstrom bump is mainly from large PAHs or
PAH clusters in condensed phase so that there is no tight correlation between
DIBs and the 2175 Angstrom bump.

motion in a rod and a beam under finite deformation. For axial motion we
consider a simple rod model, and for flexural motion we employ the
Euler-Bernoulli kinematic hypothesis and consider both a conventional
transverse motion model and an inextensional planar motion model. The
underlying formulation uses the Cauchy stress and the Green-Lagrange strain.
For all models, we consider linear constitutive relations in order to isolate
the effect of finite motion. The proposed methodology, however, is applicable
to problems that also exhibit material nonlinearity. For the rod model, we
obtain the exact analytical explicit solution of the derived finite-deformation
dispersion relation, and compare it with data obtained via numerical simulation
of nonlinear wave motion in a finite rod. For the beam model, we obtain a
solution by numerical root finding. The results allow us to quantify the
deviation in the dispersion curves when exact large deformation is considered
compared to following the assumption of infinitesimal deformation. We show that
incorporation of finite deformation following the chosen definitions of stress
and strain raises the frequency branches for both axial and flexural waves
above the nominal values associated with linear motion. For the beam problem,
only the inextensional planar motion model provides an accurate description of
the finite-deformation response for both static deflection and wave dispersion.
Our findings, which represent the first derivation of finite-strain,
amplitude-dependent dispersion relations for any type of elastic media, draw
attention to 1) the tangible effect of finite deformation on wave dispersion
and consequently on the speed of sound in an elastic medium and 2) the
importance of incorporating longitudinal-transverse motion coupling in
nonlinear analysis of thin structures.

can see that there are two atomic movements involved in the ferroelectric phase
transition; the first corresponds to the vibration of crystalline lattice,
which will render phonon mode softening at the critical point, and the second
represents the slow evolution of a partially ordered nematic phase formed by
the cooperative behavior of high-temperature structure precursors. In this
hierarchical dynamic structure, the former fast dynamics could be significantly
modulated by the latter slow dynamics in the vicinity of the Curie temperature;
it then turns out that it is the behavior of the nematic phase on approaching
the critical point that makes the Landau theory deviate from experimental

hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We use a simplified dynamical model and a robust
chemical network, as opposed to previous studies which have used a three
dimensional circulation model coupled to a simple chemical kinetics scheme. The
temperature structure and distribution of the main atmospheric constituents are
calculated in the limit of an atmosphere that rotates as a solid body with an
equatorial rotation rate of 1 km/s. Such motion mimics a uniform zonal wind
which resembles the equatorial superrotation structure found by three
dimensional circulation models. The uneven heating of this tidally locked
planet causes, even in the presence of such a strong zonal wind, large
temperature contrasts between the dayside and nightside, of up to 800 K. This
would result in important longitudinal variations of some molecular abundances
if the atmosphere were at chemical equilibrium. The zonal wind, however, acts
as a powerful disequilibrium process. We identify the existence of a pressure
level of transition between two regimes, which may be located between 100 and
0.1 mbar depending on the molecule. Below this transition layer, chemical
equilibrium holds, while above it, the zonal wind tends to homogenize the
chemical composition of the atmosphere, bringing molecular abundances in the
limb and nightside regions close to chemical equilibrium values characteristic
of the dayside, i.e. producing an horizontal quenching effect in the
abundances. Reasoning based on timescales arguments indicates that horizontal
and vertical mixing are likely to compete in HD 209458b's atmosphere, producing
a complex distribution where molecular abundances are quenched horizontally to
dayside values and vertically to chemical equilibrium values characteristic of
deep layers.

lost if contributions to the common pool within a group are too small. Failure
to reach the collective target thus has dire consequences for all group
members, independently of their strategies. Wanting to move away from
unfavorable locations is therefore all but surprising. Inspired by these
observations, we here propose and study a collective-risk social dilemma where
players are allowed to move if the collective failure becomes too probable.
More precisely, this so-called risk-driven migration is launched depending on
the difference between the actual contributions and the declared target.
Mobility therefore becomes an inherent property that is utilized in an entirely
self-organizing manner. We show that under these assumptions cooperation is
promoted much more effectively than under the action of manually determined
migration rates. For the latter, we in fact identify parameter regions where
the evolution of cooperation is incredibly inhibited. Moreover, we find
unexpected spatial patterns where cooperators that do not form compact clusters
outperform those that do, and where defectors are able to utilize strikingly
different ways of invasion. The presented results support the recently revealed
importance of percolation for the successful evolution of public cooperation,
while at the same time revealing surprisingly simple ways of self-organization
towards socially desirable states.

Specifically, in the quantum setting, scrambling usually refers to the process
of mapping most initial pure product states under a unitary transformation to
states which are macroscopically entangled, in the sense of being close to
completely mixed on most subsystems containing a fraction fn of all n particles
for some constant f. While the term scrambling is used in the context of the
black hole information paradox, scrambling is related to problems involving
decoupling in general, and to the question of how large isolated many-body
systems reach local thermal equilibrium under their own unitary dynamics.
  Here, we study the speed at which various notions of scrambling/decoupling
occur in a simplified but natural model of random two-particle interactions:
random quantum circuits. For a circuit representing the dynamics generated by a
local Hamiltonian, the depth of the circuit corresponds to time. Thus, we
consider the depth of these circuits and we are typically interested in what
can be done in a depth that is sublinear or even logarithmic in the size of the
system. We resolve an outstanding conjecture raised in the context of the black
hole information paradox with respect to the depth at which a typical quantum
circuit generates an entanglement assisted encoding against the erasure
channel. In addition, we prove that typical quantum circuits of poly(log n)
depth satisfy a stronger notion of scrambling and can be used to encode alpha n
qubits into n qubits so that up to beta n errors can be corrected, for some
constants alpha, beta > 0.

correction (QEC). QEC codes and circuits are described via the stabilizer
formalism, which represents stabilizer states by keeping track of the operators
that preserve them. Such states are obtained by stabilizer circuits (consisting
of CNOT, Hadamard and Phase only) and can be represented compactly on
conventional computers using Omega(n^2) bits, where n is the number of qubits.
Although techniques for the efficient simulation of stabilizer circuits have
been studied extensively, techniques for efficient manipulation of stabilizer
states are not currently available. To this end, we design new algorithms for:
(i) obtaining canonical generators for stabilizer states, (ii) obtaining
canonical stabilizer circuits, and (iii) computing the inner product between
stabilizer states. Our inner-product algorithm takes O(n^3) time in general,
but observes quadratic behavior for many practical instances relevant to QECC
(e.g., GHZ states). We prove that each n-qubit stabilizer state has exactly
4(2^n - 1) nearest-neighbor stabilizer states, and verify this claim
experimentally using our algorithms. We design techniques for representing
arbitrary quantum states using stabilizer frames and generalize our algorithms
to compute the inner product between two such frames.

  excitation propagation on anisotropic curved surfaces","This paper has been withdrawn to rewrite it again for official
  publication",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In cardiac electrophysiology, it is important to predict the necessary
conditions for conduction failure, the failure of the cardiac excitation
propagation even in the presence of normal excitable tissue, in
high-dimensional anisotropic space because these conditions may provide
feasible mechanisms for abnormal excitation propagations such as atrial
re-entry and, subsequently, atrial fibrillation even without taking into
account the time-dependent refractory region. Some conditions of conduction
failure have been studied for anisotropy or simple curved surfaces, but the
general conditions on anisotropic curved surfaces (anisotropic and curved
surface) remain unknown. To predict and analyze conduction failure on
anisotropic curved surfaces, a new analytic approach is proposed, called the
relative acceleration approach borrowed from spacetime physics. Motivated by a
discrete model of cardiac excitation propagation, this approach is based on the
hypothesis that a large relative acceleration can translate to a dramatic
increase in the curvature of the wavefront and, subsequently, to conduction
failure. For simple anisotropic surfaces, the relative acceleration approach is
validated by computational simulations or the previously known results from the
kinematics approach. As a practical application, this approach is proposed to
provide theoretical explanations of the mechanism of cardiac excitation
propagation around the pulmonary vein with anatomically observed anisotropy.

approaches normally make use of probabilistic tools in order to distinguish
significant structures from noise and reconstruction residuals. Furthermore, we
aim to check the historical assumption that image-reconstruction algorithms
using static PSFs are not suitable for AO imaging. We convolve an image of
Saturn taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with AO PSFs from the 5-m
Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory and add both shot and readout noise.
Subsequently, we apply different approaches to the blurred and noisy data in
order to recover the original object. The approaches include multi-frame blind
deconvolution (with the algorithm IDAC), myopic deconvolution with
regularization (with MISTRAL) and wavelets- or curvelets-based static PSF
deconvolution (AWMLE and ACMLE algorithms). We used the mean squared error
(MSE) and the structural similarity index (SSIM) to compare the results. We
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the two metrics. We found that CT
produces better results than WT, as measured in terms of MSE and SSIM.
Multichannel deconvolution with a static PSF produces results which are
generally better than the results obtained with the myopic/blind approaches
(for the images we tested) thus showing that the ability of a method to
suppress the noise and to track the underlying iterative process is just as
critical as the capability of the myopic/blind approaches to update the PSF.

multipole order, the radiation rate is enhanced by powers of r_v/r_0. At low

amplified by powers of the ratio r_v/r_0 for the higher multipoles.

the fine grained phase-space information of the dark matter fluid. Using a
tetrahedral tesselation of the three-dimensional manifold that describes
perfectly cold fluids in six-dimensional phase space, the phase-space
distribution function can be followed throughout the simulation. This allows
one to project the distribution function into configuration space to obtain
highly accurate densities, velocities, and velocity dispersions. Here, we
exploit this technique to show first steps on how to devise an improved
particle-mesh technique. At its heart, the new method thus relies on a
piecewise linear approximation of the phase space distribution function rather
than the usual particle discretisation. We use pseudo-particles that
approximate the masses of the tetrahedral cells up to quadrupolar order as the
locations for cloud-in-cell (CIC) deposit instead of the particle locations
themselves as in standard CIC deposit. We demonstrate that this modification
already gives much improved stability and more accurate dynamics of the
collisionless dark matter fluid at high force and low mass resolution. We
demonstrate the validity and advantages of this method with various test
problems as well as hot/warm-dark matter simulations which have been known to
exhibit artificial fragmentation. This completely unphysical behaviour is much
reduced in the new approach. The current limitations of our approach are
discussed in detail and future improvements are outlined.

intrinsic absorption. While we cannot fit the X-ray spectral slope directly for
the rest of the sample, we estimate it from the hardness ratio and find a range
of photon indices consistent with those seen in more luminous and massive
objects. The X-ray-to-optical spectral slope (alphaox) of our IMBH sample is
systematically flatter than in active galaxies with more massive black holes,
consistent with the well-known correlation between alphaox and UV luminosity.
Thanks to the wide dynamic range of our sample, we find evidence that alphaox
increases with decreasing M_BH as expected from accretion disk models, where
the UV emission systematically decreases as M_BH decreases and the disk
temperature increases. We also find a long tail toward low alphaox values.
While some of these sources may be obscured, given the high L_bol/L_Eddington
values in the sample, we argue that some may be intrinsically X-ray-weak,
perhaps owing to a rare state that radiates very little coronal emission.

momentum increases with net vertical flux, achieving alpha=0.08 for beta_0=10^4

critical value lies at beta_0=10^3: For beta_0>10^3, the disk consists of a gas
pressure dominated midplane and a magnetically dominated corona. The turbulent
strength increases with net flux, and angular momentum transport is dominated
by turbulent fluctuations. The magnetic dynamo that leads to cyclic flips of
large-scale fields still exists, but becomes more sporadic as net flux
increases. For beta_0<10^3, the entire disk becomes magnetic dominated. The
turbulent strength saturates, and the magnetic dynamo is quenched. Stronger
large-scale fields are generated with increasing net flux, which dominates
angular momentum transport. A strong outflow is launched from the disk by the
magnetocentrifugal mechanism, and the mass flux increases linearly with net
vertical flux and shows sign of saturation at beta_0=10^2. However, the outflow
is unlikely to be directly connected to a global wind: for beta_0>10^3, the
large-scale field has no permanent bending direction due to dynamo activities,
while for beta_0<10^3, the outflows from the top and bottom sides of the disk
bend towards opposite directions, inconsistent with a physical disk wind

threaded by a weak vertical magnetic field, with a particular focus on the
interplay between MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability
(MRI) and outflows that might be launched from the disk. For that purpose, we
use a set of numerical simulations performed with the MHD code RAMSES in the
framework of the shearing box model. We concentrate on the case of a rather
weak vertical magnetic field such that the initial ratio beta0 of the thermal
and magnetic pressures in the disk midplane equals 10^4. As reported recently,
we find that MHD turbulence drives an efficient outflow out of the
computational box. We demonstrate a strong sensitivity of that result to the
box size: enlargements in the radial and vertical directions lead to a
reduction of up to an order of magnitude in the mass-loss rate. Such a
dependence prevents any realistic estimates of disk mass-loss rates being
derived using shearing-box simulations. We find however that the flow
morphology is robust and independent of the numerical details of the
simulations. Its properties display some features and approximate invariants
that are reminiscent of the Blandford & Payne launching mechanism, but
differences exist. For the magnetic field strength considered in this paper, we
also find that angular momentum transport is most likely dominated by MHD
turbulence, the saturation of which scales with the magnetic Prandtl number,
the ratio of viscosity and resistivity, in a way that is in good agreement with
expectations based on unstratified simulations. This paper thus demonstrates
for the first time that accretion disks can simultaneously exhibit MRI-driven
MHD turbulence along with magneto-centrifugally accelerated outflows.

powerful and viable method for searching for gravitational waves from generic

of black-holes [neutron-stars] are uniformly distributed between 0--0.98 [0 --

into the theoretical framework of TSM by reformulating the relevant topological

twisted boundary conditions, respectively. We finally integrate the field of
TSM into a broader context by distinguishing TSM from the concept of
topological order which has been introduced to study fractional quantum Hall
systems.

development of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and
neutrino-driven convection. To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic
simulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme
captures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number
exchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-solar-mass
progenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who
observed strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was
suppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from
numerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant
instability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory deformations of the shock
front. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for
large-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present
in our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing
neutrino heating and vigor of convection. Our results, in agreement with
simpler 3D Newtonian simulations, suggest that once neutrino-driven convection
is started, it is likely to become the dominant instability in 3D. Whether it
is the primary instability after bounce will ultimately depend on the physical
seed perturbations present in the cores of massive stars. The gravitational
wave signal, which we extract and analyze for the first time from 3D
general-relativistic models, will serve as an observational probe of the
postbounce dynamics and, in combination with neutrinos, may allow us to
determine the primary hydrodynamic instability.

infarction, we propose a method to estimate the causal effect of a treatment in
two-arm experimental studies with possible non-compliance in both treatment and
control arms. The method is based on a causal model for repeated binary
outcomes (before and after the treatment), which includes individual covariates
and latent variables for the unobserved heterogeneity between subjects.
Moreover, given the type of non-compliance, the model assumes the existence of
three subpopulations of subjects: compliers, never-takers, and always-takers.
The model is estimated by a two-step estimator: at the first step the
probability that a subject belongs to one of the three subpopulations is
estimated on the basis of the available covariates; at the second step the
causal effects are estimated through a conditional logistic method, the
implementation of which depends on the results from the first step. Standard
errors for this estimator are computed on the basis of a sandwich formula. The
application shows that prompt coronary angiography in patients with myocardial
infarction may significantly decrease the risk of other events within the next
two years, with a log-odds of about -2. Given that non-compliance is
significant for patients being given the treatment because of high risk
conditions, classical estimators fail to detect, or at least underestimate,
this effect.

beyond the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, namely it would prove that
neutrinos are Majoran fermions and that the lepton number is not conserved.
Purpose: The analysis of the results of neutrinoless double beta decay
observations requires an accurate knowledge of several nuclear matrix elements
(NME) for different mechanism that may contribute to the decay. We provide a
complete analysis of these NME for the decay of the ground state (g.s.) of
$^{48}$Ca to the g.s. $0^+_1$ and first excited $0^+_2$ state of $^{48}$Ti.
Method: For the analysis we used the nuclear shell model with effective
two-body interactions that were fine-tuned to describe the low-energy
spectroscopy of $pf$-shell nuclei. We checked our model by calculating the
two-neutrino transition probability to the g.s. of $^{48}$Ti. We also make
predictions for the transition to the first excited $0^+_2$ state of $^{48}$Ti.
Results: We present results for all NME relevant for the neutrinoless
transitions to the $0^+_1$ and $0^+_2$ states, and using the lower experimental

further used to analyze the experimental results of double beta decay

polarized p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV with data taken by the PHENIX
experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in 2006 and 2008.
Subsequently, we have found errors in the analysis procedures for the 2008
data, which resulted in an erroneous value for the extracted A_N. The errors
affected the sorting of events into the correct left/right and forward/backward
bins. This produced an incorrect value for the 2008 result, but the 2006 result
is unaffected. We have conducted two independent reanalyses with these errors
corrected, and we present here the corrected values for the 2008 data and the
combined results for 2006 and 2008. The new combined spin asymmetry in the
forward region is A_N = -0.026+/-0.026(stat)+/-0.003(sys). Since this asymmetry
is consistent with zero, we no longer claim that our results suggest a possible
non-zero trigluon correlation function in transversely polarized protons.

a sum of functions with each function only known to one node, and a
pre-specified level of node knowledge and computational capacity. We define the
optimization information each node receives from its objective function, the
neighboring information each node receives from its neighbors, and the
computational capacity each node can take advantage of in controlling its
state. It is proven that there exist a neighboring information way and a
control law that guarantee global optimal consensus if and only if the solution
sets of the local objective functions admit a nonempty intersection set for
fixed strongly connected graphs. Then we show that for any tolerated error, we
can find a control law that guarantees global optimal consensus within this
error for fixed, bidirectional, and connected graphs under mild conditions. For
time-varying graphs, we show that optimal consensus can always be achieved as
long as the graph is uniformly jointly strongly connected and the nonempty
intersection condition holds. The results illustrate that nonempty intersection
for the local optimal solution sets is a critical condition for successful
distributed optimization for a large class of algorithms.

occurred during 26 and 27 September 2009. The filament eruption was associated
with a relatively slow coronal mass ejection (CME). The filament consisted of a
large and a small part, both parts erupted nearly simultaneously. Here we focus
on the eruption associated with the larger part of the filament. The STEREO
satellites were separated by about 117 degree during this event, so we
additionally used SoHO/EIT and CORONAS/TESIS observations as a third eye (Earth
view) to aid our measurements. We measure the plane-of-sky trajectory of the
filament as seen from STEREO-A and TESIS view-points. Using a simple
trigonometric relation, we then use these measurements to estimate the true
direction of propagation of the filament which allows us to derive the true
R=R_sun v/s time profile of the filament apex. Furthermore, we develop a new
tomographic method that can potentially provide a more robust three-dimensional
reconstruction by exploiting multiple simultaneous views. We apply this method
also to investigate the 3D evolution of the top part of filament. We expect
this method to be useful when SDO and STEREO observations are combined. We then
analyze the kinematics of the eruptive filament during its rapid acceleration
phase by fitting different functional forms to the height-time data derived
from the two methods. We find that, for both methods, an exponential function
fits the rise profile of the filament slightly better than parabolic or cubic
functions. Finally, we confront these results with the predictions of
theoretical eruption models.

viewing angle. The fulldisk extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images of the Sun
obtained with high spatial and temporal resolution by the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, show flare-associated
lateral oscillations of the prominence sheet. The STEREO-A spacecraft, 81.5
degrees ahead of the Sun-Earth line, provides on-disk view of the
flare-associated coronal disturbances. We derive the temporal profile of the
lateral displacement of the prominence sheet by using the image
cross-correlation technique. The displacement curve was de-trended and the
residual oscillatory pattern was derived. We fit these oscillations with a
damped cosine function with a variable period and find that the period is
increasing. The initial oscillation period (P0) is 28.2 minutes and the damping
time (t_D) of 44 minutes. We confirm the presence of fast and slow EUV wave
components. Using STEREO-A observations we derive a propagation speed of 250
km/s for the slow EUV wave by applying time-slice technique to the running
difference images. We propose that the prominence oscillations are excited by
the fast EUV wave while the increase in oscillation period of the prominence is
an apparent effect, related to a phase change due to the slow EUV wave acting
as a secondary trigger. We discuss implications of the dual trigger effect for
coronal prominence seismology and scaling law studies of damping mechanisms.

has a fundamental 180 degree ambiguity in the determination of the azimuth
angle of the transverse field component. There are several methods that are
used in the community and each one has its merits and demerits. Here we present
a disambiguation idea that is based on the assumption that most of the magnetic
field on the sun is predominantly vertical. While the method is not applicable
to penumbra or other features harboring predominantly horizontal fields like
the sheared neutral lines, it is useful for regions where fields are
predominantly vertical like network and plage areas. The method is tested with
the full-disk solar vector magnetograms observed by the VSM/SOLIS instrument.
We find that statistically about 60-85 % of the pixels in a typical full-disk
magnetogram has field inclination in the range of 0-30 degrees with respect to
the local solar normal, and thus can be successfully disambiguated by the
proposed method. Due to its non-iterative nature, the present method is
extremely fast and therefore can be used as a good initial guess for iterative
schemes like nonpotential field computation (NPFC) method. Furthermore, the
method is insensitive to noisy pixels as it does not depend upon the
neighboring pixels or derivatives.

stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and specific SFR (sSFR). We find a
strong positive correlation between stellar mass and clustering amplitude on
1-10 h^-1 Mpc scales for blue, star-forming galaxies with 9.5 < log(M_*/M_sun)
< 11 and no dependence for red, quiescent galaxies with 10.5 < log(M_*/M_sun) <
11.5. Using recently re-calibrated DEEP2 SFRs from restframe B-band magnitude
and optical colors, we find that within the blue galaxy population at z~1, the
clustering amplitude increases strongly with increasing SFR and decreasing
sSFR. For red galaxies there is no significant correlation between clustering
amplitude and either SFR or sSFR. Blue galaxies with high SFR or low sSFR are
as clustered on large scales as red galaxies. We find that the clustering trend
observed with SFR can be explained mostly, but not entirely, by the correlation
between stellar mass and clustering amplitude for blue galaxies. We also show
that galaxies above the star-forming ""main sequence"" are less clustered than
galaxies below the main sequence, at a given stellar mass. These results are
not consistent with the high sSFR population being dominated by major mergers.
We also measure the clustering amplitude of our samples on small scales (< 0.3
h^-1 Mpc) and find an enhanced clustering signal relative to the best-fit
large-scale power law for red galaxies with high stellar mass, blue galaxies
with high SFR, and both red and blue galaxies with high sSFR. The increased
small-scale clustering for galaxies with high sSFRs is likely linked to
triggered star formation in interacting galaxies. These measurements provide
strong constraints on galaxy evolution and halo occupation distribution models
at z~1.

with fine-pitch readout strips that explores simultaneously precision tracking

chain Monte Carlo kernels used to facilitate inference in this setting can fail
to be variance bounding, and hence geometrically ergodic, which can have
consequences for the reliability of estimates in practice. This phenomenon is
typically independent of the choice of tolerance in the approximation. We then

variance bounding and geometric ergodicity from its intractable
Metropolis--Hastings counterpart, under reasonably weak and manageable
conditions. We show that the computational cost of this alternative kernel is
bounded whenever the prior is proper, and present indicative results on an
example where spectral gaps and asymptotic variances can be computed, as well
as an example involving inference for a partially and discretely observed,
time-homogeneous, pure jump Markov process. We also supply two general
theorems, one of which provides a simple sufficient condition for lack of

prediction residuals. However, in lossless coding of audio, image, and video,
specially those involving linear predictors, the predictions are from the real
domain. In this paper, we have modified and extended the Rice-Golomb code so
that it can operate at fractional precision to efficiently exploit the
real-valued predictions. Coding at arbitrarily small precision allows the
residuals to be modeled with the Laplace distribution instead of its discrete
counterpart, namely the two-sided geometric distribution (TSGD). Unlike the
Rice-Golomb code, which maps equally probable opposite-signed residuals to
different integers, the proposed coding scheme is symmetric in the sense that,
at arbitrarily small precision, it assigns codewords of equal length to equally
probable residual intervals. The symmetry of both the Laplace distribution and
the code facilitates the analysis of the proposed coding scheme to determine
the average code-length and the optimal value of the associated coding
parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme, by making
efficient use of real-valued predictions, achieves better compression as
compared to the conventional scheme.

intracluster medium (ICM) in simulated galaxy clusters. The method uses the
median of gas properties, such as density and pressure, which we show to be
very robust to the presence of gas inhomogeneities. In particular, we show that
the radial profiles of median gas properties are smooth and do not exhibit
fluctuations at locations of massive clumps in contrast to mean and mode
properties. It is shown that distribution of gas properties in a given radial
shell can be well described by a log-normal PDF and a tail. The former
corresponds to a nearly hydrostatic bulk component, accounting for ~99% of the
volume, while the tail corresponds to high density inhomogeneities. We show
that this results in a simple and robust separation of the diffuse and clumpy
components of the ICM. The FWHM of the density distribution grows with radius
and varies from ~0.15 dex in cluster centre to ~0.5 dex at 2r_500 in relaxed
clusters. The small scatter in the width between relaxed clusters suggests that
the degree of inhomogeneity is a robust characteristic of the ICM. It broadly
agrees with the amplitude of density perturbations in the Coma cluster. We
discuss the origin of ICM density variations in spherical shells and show that
less than 20% of the width can be attributed to the triaxiality of the cluster
gravitational potential. As a link to X-ray observations of real clusters we
evaluated the ICM clumping factor with and without high density
inhomogeneities. We argue that these two cases represent upper and lower limits
on the departure of the observed X-ray emissivity from the median value. We
find that the typical value of the clumping factor in the bulk component of
relaxed clusters varies from ~1.1-1.2 at r_500 up to ~1.3-1.4 at r_200, in
broad agreement with recent observations.

algorithm i) clusters a given collection of HMMs into groups of HMMs that are
similar, in terms of the distributions they represent, and ii) characterizes
each group by a ""cluster center"", i.e., a novel HMM that is representative for
the group, in a manner that is consistent with the underlying generative model

is formulated as a variational optimization problem, and efficiently solved for

benefits of the proposed algorithm, which we call variational HEM (VHEM), are
demonstrated on several tasks involving time-series data, such as hierarchical
clustering of motion capture sequences, and automatic annotation and retrieval
of music and of online hand-writing data, showing improvements over current

from the tidal disruption of a passing star by a dormant massive black hole.
The long-term, bright radio emission of Sw J1644+57 is believed to result from
the synchrotron emission of the blast wave produced by an outflow expanding
into the surrounding medium. Using the detailed multi-epoch radio spectral
data, we are able to determine the total number of radiating electrons in the
outflow at different times, and further the evolution of the cross section of
the outflow with time. We find that the outflow gradually transits from a
conical jet to a cylindrical one at later times. The transition may be due to
collimation of the outflow by the pressure of the shocked jet cocoon that forms
while the outflow is propagating in the ambient medium. Since cylindrical jets
usually exist in AGNs and extragalactic jets, this may provide independent
evidence that Sw J1644+57 signals the onset of an AGN.

proposal at length. Black hole complementarity is inevitable if we assume the
following five things: unitarity, entropy-area formula, existence of an
information observer, semi-classical quantum field theory for an asymptotic
observer, and the general relativity for an in-falling observer. However, large
N rescaling and the AMPS argument show that black hole complementarity is
inconsistent. To salvage the basic philosophy of the black hole
complementarity, AMPS introduced a firewall around the horizon. According to
large N rescaling, the firewall should be located close to the apparent
horizon. We investigate the consistency of the firewall with the two critical
conditions: the firewall should be near the time-like apparent horizon and it
should not affect the future infinity. Concerning this, we have introduced a
gravitational collapse with a false vacuum lump which can generate a spacetime
structure with disconnected apparent horizons. This reveals a situation that
there is a firewall outside of the event horizon, while the apparent horizon is
absent. Therefore, the firewall, if it exists, not only does modify the general
relativity for an in-falling observer, but also modify the semi-classical
quantum field theory for an asymptotic observer.

relevant to ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) detectors, is reported. Two
independent calibrations of the fluorescence emission induced by a 120 GeV
proton beam were employed: Cherenkov light from the beam particle and
calibrated light from a nitrogen laser. The fluorescence yield in air at a
pressure of 1013 hPa and temperature of 293 K was found to be $Y_{337} =
5.61\pm 0.06_{stat} \pm 0.21_{syst}$ photons/MeV. When compared to the
fluorescence yield currently used by UHECR experiments, this measurement
improves the uncertainty by a factor of three, and has a significant impact on
the determination of the energy scale of the cosmic ray spectrum.

is considered, where a source X wants to send information to destination Y with
the help of a relay Z. Y and Z are independent given X, and the link from Z to
Y is lossless with rate $R_0$. A new inequality is introduced to upper-bound
the capacity when the encoding rate is beyond the capacities of both individual
links XY and XZ. It is based on generalization of the blowing-up lemma, linking
conditional entropy to decoding error, and channel simulation, to the case with
side information. The achieved upper-bound is strictly better than the
well-known cut-set bound in several cases when the latter is $C_{XY}+R_0$, with
$C_{XY}$ being the channel capacity between X and Y. One particular case is
when the channel is statistically degraded, i.e., either Y is a statistically
degraded version of Z with respect to X, or Z is a statistically degraded
version of Y with respect to X. Moreover in this case, the bound is shown to be
explicitly computable. The binary erasure channel is analyzed in detail and
evaluated numerically.

topology and geometric group theory, the most important noncompact spaces are
often contractible, so distinguishing one from another requires techniques
beyond the standard tools of algebraic topology. One approach uses end
invariants, such as the number of ends or the fundamental group at infinity;
another approach seeks nice compactifications, then analyzes the boundaries. A
thread connecting the two is shape theory.
  In these notes we provide a careful development of several topics: homotopy
and homology properties and invariants for ends of spaces, proper maps and
homotopy equivalences, tameness conditions, shapes of ends, and various types
of Z-compactifications and Z-boundaries. Classical and current research from
both manifold topology and geometric group theory provide the context. Along
the way, many open problems are encountered. Our primary goal is casual but
coherent introduction that is accessible to graduate students and also of

the conditional $q$-entropies. The $q$-entropic measures fulfill many similar
properties to the standard Shannon entropy. In general, both the locality and
noncontextuality notions are usually treated with use of the so-called marginal
scenarios. These hypotheses lead to the existence of a joint probability
distribution, which marginalizes to all particular ones. Assuming the existence
of such a joint probability distribution, we derive the family of inequalities
of Bell's type in terms of conditional $q$-entropies for all $q\geq1$. Quantum
violations of the new inequalities are exemplified within the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and Klyachko-Can-Binicio\v{g}lu-Shumovsky
(KCBS) scenarios. An extension to the case of $n$-cycle scenario is briefly
mentioned. The new inequalities with conditional $q$-entropies allow to expand
a class of probability distributions, for which the nonlocality or
contextuality can be detected within entropic formulation. The $q$-entropic
inequalities can also be useful in analyzing cases with detection
inefficiencies. Using two models of such a kind, we consider some potential
advantages of the $q$-entropic formulation.

entropy thereby resulting in a loss of information carrying capacity. We check

optical/near infrared images on which the discovery and some other claims were

Fomalhaut but the detailed results from our analysis differ in some ways from
previous discussions. In particular, we do not confirm flux variability over a
two-year interval at 0.6 microns wavelength and we detect Fomalhaut b for the
first time at the short wavelength of 0.43 microns. We find that the HST image
of Fomalhaut b at $0.8\,\mu$m may be extended beyond the PSF. We cannot
determine from our astrometry if Fomalhaut b will cross or not the dust ring.
The optical through mid-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of
Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a
massive planet. We consider two models to explain the SED: (1) a large
circumplanetary disk around an unseen planet and (2) the aftermath of a
collision during the past 50-150 years of two Kuiper Belt-like objects of radii

applications have enabled a user to access a wide variety of services that

map-based applications among the users, the service provider often requires to
answer a large number of simultaneous queries. Thus, processing queries
efficiently on spatial networks (i.e., road networks) have become an important
research area in recent years. In this paper, we focus on path queries that
find the shortest path between a source and a destination of the user. In
particular, we address the problem of finding the shortest paths for a large
number of simultaneous path queries in road networks. Traditional systems that
consider one query at a time are not suitable for many applications due to high
computational and service costs. These systems cannot guarantee required
response time in high load conditions. We propose an efficient group based
approach that provides a practical solution with reduced cost. The key concept
for our approach is to group queries that share a common travel path and then
compute the shortest path for the group. Experimental results show that our
approach is on an average ten times faster than the traditional approach in
return of sacrificing the accuracy by 0.5% in the worst case, which is
acceptable for most of the users.

successful, the seemingly simplest state -- vacuum -- remains mysterious. While
the LHC experiments are expected to clarify basic questions on the structure of
QFT vacuum, much can still be done at lower energies as well. For instance,
experiments like PVLAS try to reach extremely high sensitivities, in their
attempt to observe the effects of the interaction of visible or near-visible
photons with intense magnetic fields -- a process which becomes possible in
quantum electrodynamics (QED) thanks to the vacuum fluctuations of the
electronic field, and which is akin to photon-photon scattering. PVLAS is now
close to data-taking and if it reaches the required sensitivity, it could
provide important information on QED vacuum. PVLAS and other similar
experiments face great challenges as they try to measure an extremely minute
effect. However, raising the photon energy greatly increases the photon-photon
cross-section, and gamma rays could help extract much more information from the
observed light-light scattering. Here we discuss an experimental design to
measure photon-photon scattering close to the peak of the photon-photon
cross-section, that could fit in the proposed construction of an FEL facility
at the Cabibbo Lab near Frascati (Rome, Italy).

perspective due to its close link with Poincar\'e's recurrence. Using such a
connection, a very general result of ergodic theory - Kac's lemma - can be used
to establish the intrinsic limitations to the possibility of predicting the
future from the past. In spite of a naive expectation, predictability results
to be hindered rather by the effective number of degrees of freedom of a system
than by the presence of chaos. If the effective number of degrees of freedom
becomes large enough, regardless the regular or chaotic nature of the system,
predictions turn out to be practically impossible. The discussion of these
issues is illustrated with the help of the numerical study of simple models.

entanglement renormalization tensor network states (MERA). The proposal
interprets the tensor connectivity of the MERA states associated to quantum
many body systems at criticality, in terms of a dual holographic geometry which
accounts for the qualitative aspects of the entanglement and the correlations
in these systems. In this work, some generic features of the entanglement
entropy and the two point functions in the ground state of one dimensional
gapped systems are considered through a tensor network state. The tensor
network is builded up as an hybrid composed by a finite number of MERA layers
and a matrix product state (MPS) acting as a cap layer. Using the holographic
formula for the entanglement entropy, here it is shown that an asymptotically
AdS metric can be associated to the hybrid MERA-MPS state. The metric is
defined by a function that manages the growth of the minimal surfaces near the
capped region of the geometry. Namely, it is shown how the behaviour of the
entanglement entropy and the two point correlators in the tensor network,
remains consistent with a geometric computation which only depends on this
function. From these observations, an explicit connection between the
entanglement structure of the tensor network and the function which defines the
geometry is provided.

therefore, introduced. It is thereby substantiated that the maximum of the

in the random coding regime. For a given random coding distribution and a given
class of metric decoders, we propose a generic universal decoder whose average
error probability is, within a sub-exponential multiplicative factor, no larger
than that of the best decoder within this class of decoders. Since the optimum,
maximum likelihood (ML) decoder of the underlying channel is not necessarily
assumed to belong to the given class of decoders, this setting suggests a
common generalized framework for: (i) mismatched decoding, (ii) universal
decoding for a given family of channels, and (iii) universal coding and
decoding for deterministic channels using the individual-sequence approach. The
proof of our universality result is fairly simple, and it is demonstrated how
some earlier results on universal decoding are obtained as special cases. We
also demonstrate how our method extends to more complicated scenarios, like
incorporation of noiseless feedback, and the multiple access channel.

acoustic of the reverberant chambers. Our approach exploits structured sparsity
models to perform room modeling and speech recovery. We propose a scheme for
characterizing the room acoustic from the unknown competing speech sources
relying on localization of the early images of the speakers by sparse
approximation of the spatial spectra of the virtual sources in a free-space
model. The images are then clustered exploiting the low-rank structure of the
spectro-temporal components belonging to each source. This enables us to
identify the early support of the room impulse response function and its unique
map to the room geometry. To further tackle the ambiguity of the reflection
ratios, we propose a novel formulation of the reverberation model and estimate
the absorption coefficients through a convex optimization exploiting joint
sparsity model formulated upon spatio-spectral sparsity of concurrent speech
representation. The acoustic parameters are then incorporated for separating
individual speech signals through either structured sparse recovery or inverse
filtering the acoustic channels. The experiments conducted on real data
recordings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for
multi-party speech recovery and recognition.

model with an attractive ($V> 0$) impurity potential. This is a
one-dimensional, discrete analogy of the hydrogen negative ion H$^-$ problem.
There are several different types of bound states in this system, each of which
appears in a specific region. For given $V$, there exists a (positive) critical
value $U_{c1}$ of $U$, below which the ground state is a bound state.
Interestingly, close to the critical value ($U\lesssim U_{c1}$), the ground
state can be described by the Chandrasekhar-type variational wave function,
which was initially proposed for H$^-$. For $U>U_{c1}$, the ground state is no
longer a bound state. However, there exists a second (larger) critical value
$U_{c2}$ of $U$, above which a molecule-type bound state is established and
stabilized by the repulsion. We have also tried to solve for the eigenstates of
the model using the Bethe ansatz. The model possesses a global $\Zz_2$-symmetry
(parity) which allows classification of all eigenstates into even and odd ones.
It is found that all states with odd-parity have the Bethe form, but none of
the states in the even-parity sector. This allows us to identify analytically
two odd-parity bound states, which appear in the parameter regions $-2V<U<-V$
and $-V<U<0$, respectively. Remarkably, the latter one can be \textit{embedded}
in the continuum spectrum with appropriate parameters. Moreover, in part of
these regions, there exists an even-parity bound state accompanying the
corresponding odd-parity bound state with almost the same energy.

stars is likely to play an important role in the evolution and dispersal of
circumstellar disks. Several aspects of the physics of this X-ray emission
remain mysterious, e.g., whether and how much accretion affects coronal
emission.
  We studied the X-ray variability of ~1 Myr old low-mass PMS stars as a
function of timescale, stellar rotation, and stellar characteristics, in order
to gain insights on the working of PMS coronae, their X-ray emission, and the
circumstellar environment in which they are immersed.
  We have exploited the ~850 ksec long Chandra observation of the Orion Nebula
Cluster obtained by the COUP collaboration in Jan. 2003, and statistically
analyzed the X-ray lightcurves of low-mass stars in several subsamples. In
particular, we characterized the different X-ray behavior of stars with and
without circumstellar accretion disks.
  Accreting stars (Classical T Tauri Stars, CTTSs) are found to be more
variable than non accreting ones (Weak-lined T Tauri Stars, WTTSs) at all
timescales and in all the X-ray energy bands considered. Variability is seen to
increase with time-scale up to ~10 days, i.e. the longest probed. Signatures of
rotational modulation are observed for both CTTSs and WTTSs, and most clearly
for CTTSs in the soft X-ray band. Lower mass stars are more variable than
higher mass ones.
  We propose that the difference in variability between CTTSs and WTTSs may be
explained assuming that the X-ray emission of CTTS is affected by time-variable
absorption due circumstellar structures, such as warps in the inner disk and/or
accretion streams. This suggestion is appealing because, in the hypothesis that
the coronae of CTTSs and WTTSs are similar, it may also explain why CTTSs have
lower and more scattered X-ray emission levels with respect to WTTSs.

control problems by means of optimizing a specific function on some particular
variables, the so called controls. However, this is not always enough for
solving all these problems. A high order maximum principle (Krener, 1977) must
be used in order to obtain more necessary conditions for optimality. These new
conditions determine candidates to be optimal controls for a wider range of
optimal control problems.
  Here, we focus on control-affine systems. Krener's high order perturbations
are redefined following the notions introduced in Aguilar-Lewis (2008). A
weaker version of Krener's high order maximum principle is stated in the
framework of presymplectic geometry. As a result, the presymplectic constraint
algorithm in the sense of Gotay-Nester-Hinds (1979) can be used. We establish
the connections between the presymplectic constraint algorithm and the
candidates to be optimal curves obtained from the necessary conditions in
Krener's high order maximum principle. In this paper we obtain weaker geometric
necessary conditions for optimality of abnormal solutions than the ones in
Krener (1977) and the ones in the weak high order maximum principle. These new
necessary conditions are more useful, computationally speaking, for finding
curves candidate to be optimal. The theory is supported by describing
specifically some of the above-mentioned conditions for some mechanical control
systems.

Kesten and Sidoravicius established that the front moves ballistically, and
more precisely that it satisfies a law of large numbers. Their proof is based
on a multi-scale renormalization technique, combined with approximate
sub-additivity arguments. In this paper, we build a renewal structure for the
front propagation process, and as a corollary we obtain a central limit theorem
for the front when $D_R=D_B$. Moreover, this result can be extended to the case
where $D_R>D_B$, up to modifying the dynamics so that blue particles turn red
upon contact with a site that has previously been occupied by a red particle.

Electron acceleration in the second plasma wave period reduces electron beam

a slower enhancement than the one caused by the 11 year cycle. We compare our

emanating from the Galactic Centre (GC) region. EPIC-pn and EPIC-MOS
observations, with a total exposure approaching 0.5 and 1 Ms respectively, were
used to create mosaiced images of a 100 pc x 100 pc region centred on Sgr A* in
four bands covering the 2-10 keV energy range. We have also constructed a set
of narrow-band images corresponding to the neutral iron fluorescence line at
6.4 keV and the K-shell lines at 6.7 keV and 6.9 keV from helium-like and
hydrogenic iron. We use a combination of spatial and spectral information to
decompose the GC emission into three distinct components. These comprise: the
emission from hard X-ray emitting unresolved point sources; the reflected
continuum and fluorescent line emission from dense molecular material; and the
soft diffuse emission from thermal plasma in the temperature range, kT ~
0.8-1.5 keV.
  We show that the unresolved-source component accounts for the bulk of the
6.7-keV and 6.9-keV line emission. We fit the observed X-ray surface brightness
distribution with an empirical 2-d model, which we then compare with a 3-d
mass-model prediction for the old stellar population in the GC. The X-ray
surface brightness falls-off more rapidly with angular offset from Sgr A* than
predicted. One interpretation is that the 2-10 keV X-ray emissivity increases
from 5 x 10^27 erg s^-1 Msun^-1 at 20' up to almost twice this value at 2'.
Alternatively, some refinement of the mass model may be required.
  The unresolved hard X-ray emitting source population, on the basis of
spectral comparisons, is most likely dominated by magnetic CVs. We use the
X-ray observations to set constraints on the number density of such sources.
Our analysis does not support the conjecture that a significant fraction of the
hard X-ray emission from the GC originates in very-hot diffuse thermal plasma.

stars and stellar clusters form. We have obtained high sensitivity and high
spectral resolution observations with the IRAM 30m antenna, which allowed us to
perform detailed analysis of the kinematics within one IRDC, G035.39-00.33. We
focus on the 1-0 and 3-2 transitions of N2H+, C18O (1-0), and make comparison
with SiO (2-1) observations and extinction mapping. Three interacting filaments
of gas are found. We report large-scale velocity coherence throughout the
cloud, evidenced through small velocity gradients and relatively narrow line
widths. This suggests that the merging of these filaments is somewhat ""gentle"",
possibly regulated by magnetic fields. This merging of filaments may be
responsible for the weak parsec-scale SiO emission detected by Jimenez-Serra et
al. 2010, via grain mantle vaporization. A systematic velocity shift between
the N2H+ (1-0) and C18O (1-0) gas throughout the cloud of 0.18 +/- 0.04
kms^{-1} is also found, consistent with a scenario of collisions between
filaments which is still ongoing. The N2H+ (1-0) is extended throughout the
IRDC and it does not only trace dense cores, as found in nearby low-mass
star-forming regions. The average H2 number density across the IRDC is ~ 5 x
10^4 cm^{-3}, at least one order of magnitude larger than in nearby molecular
clouds where low-mass stars are forming. A temperature gradient perpendicular
to the filament is found. From our study, we conclude that G035.39-00.33
(clearly seen in the extinction map and in N2H+) has been formed via the
collision between two relatively quiescent filaments with average densities of
~ 5 x 10^3 cm^{-3}, moving with relative velocities of ~ 5 kms^{-1}. The
accumulation of material at the merging points started > 1 Myr ago and it is

(SED) of blazars is still a bit of a mystery. While BL Lac objects can be
rather successfully modelled within the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)
scenario, the SED of low peaked Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQ) is more
difficult to reproduce. Their high-energy component needs the abundance of
strong external photon sources, giving rise to stronger cooling via the inverse
Compton channel, and thusly to a powerful component in the SED. Recently, we
were able to show that such a powerful inverse Compton component can also be
achieved within the SSC framework. This, however, is only possible if the
electrons cool by SSC, which results in a non-linear process, since the cooling
depends on an energy integral over the electrons. In this paper we aim to
compare the non-linear SSC framework with the external Compton (EC) output by
calculating analytically the external Compton component with the underlying
electron distribution being either linearly or non-linearly cooled. Due to the
additional linear cooling of the electrons with the external photons, higher
number densities of electrons are required to achieve non-linear cooling,
resulting in more powerful inverse Compton components. If the electrons
initially cool non-linearly, the resulting SED can exhibit a dominating SSC
over the EC component. However, this dominance depends strongly on the input
parameters. We conclude that with the correct time-dependent treatment the SSC
component should be taken into account to model blazar flares.

weights assumed to have a density. Assuming that the degree distribution

well the number of edges on this path or hopcount.
  The hopcount satisfies a central limit theorem where the norming constants
are expressible in terms of the parameters of an associated continuous-time

inverse of the Malthusian rate of growth of the associated branching process,
the minimal weight converges in distribution. The limiting random variable
equals the sum of the logarithms of the martingale limits of the branching
processes that measure the relative growth of neighborhoods about the two

behavior.
  The proofs rely on a refined coupling between the shortest path problems on
these graphs and continuous-time branching processes, and on a Poisson point

velocities vsini were determined by calibrating the cross-correlation function.
Effective temperatures Teff were estimated by the line-depth ratio method.
Surface gravities log g were computed by two methods: iron ionization balance
and parallax. LTE Li abundances were computed using the synthetic spectrum
method. The behaviour of the Li abundance was examined in correlation with
Teff, [Fe/H], vsini and level of activity in three stellar groups of different
temperatures. The stellar parameters and Li abundances are presented for 150
slow rotating stars of the lower part of MS. The studied stars show a decline
in the Li abundance with decreasing temperature Teff and a significant spread,
which should be due to the differences of age. A correlation between Li
abundance, vsini and level of chromospheric activity is seen for stars with
6000>Teff>5700 K, and it is tighter for stars with 5700>Teff>5200 K. Stars with
Teff<5200 K do not show any correlation between log A(Li) and vsini. The
relationship between chromospheric and coronal fluxes in active stars with
detected Li as well as in less active stars gives a hint that there exist
different conditions in the action of the dynamo mechanism in those stars. We
found that the Li-activity correlation is evident only in a restricted
temperature range and the Li abundance spread seems to be present in a group of
low chromospheric activity stars that also show a broad spread in chromospheric

the energy deposition due to annihilations of the most promising dark matter
candidate, a stable WIMP of mass 1-20 GeV. A major improvement with respect to
previous similar studies is a detailed treatment of the annihilation cascade
and its energy deposition in the cosmic gas. This is vital as this quantity is
degenerate with the annihilation cross-section <{\sigma}v>. The strongest
constraints are obtained from Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis of the combined
WMAP7 and SPT datasets up to lmax = 3100. If annihilation occurs via the e+e-
channel, a light WIMP can be excluded at the 2 {\sigma} c.l. as a viable DM
candidate in the above mass range. However, if annihilation occurs via
{\mu}+{\mu}- or {\tau}+{\tau}- channels instead we find that WIMPs with mass >
5 GeV might represent a viable cosmological DM candidate. We compare the
results obtained in the present work with those obtained adopting an analytical
simplified model for the energy deposition process widely used in literature,

[OIII] luminosities in the environmental galaxies increasing as a function of
proximity to the central emission line galaxies. There is another clear trend
toward a neighborhood effect within a radius of 1000 kpc for the AGN and
non-AGN types: Seyfert galaxies tend to have the highest probability of having
another Seyfert galaxy in the neighborhood. HII galaxies tend to have the
highest probability of having another HII galaxy in the neighborhood, etc. The
number of companions within 1000 kpc is inversely correlated with the
H{\alpha}, [OIII] {\lambda}5007, as well as with the continuum luminosities of
the central galaxies, regardless of whether they are of Seyfert, HII, or
absorption line types.

of vehicles searches for a corresponding set of non-conflicting space-time
trajectories. Many of the practical methods for centralized solving of
cooperative pathfinding problems are based on the prioritized planning
strategy. However, in some domains (e.g., multi-robot teams of unmanned aerial
vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, or unmanned ground vehicles) a
decentralized approach may be more desirable than a centralized one due to
communication limitations imposed by the domain and/or privacy concerns.
  In this paper we present an asynchronous decentralized variant of prioritized
planning ADPP and its interruptible version IADPP. The algorithm exploits the
inherent parallelism of distributed systems and allows for a speed up of the
computation process. Unlike the synchronized planning approaches, the algorithm
allows an agent to react to updates about other agents' paths immediately and
invoke its local spatio-temporal path planner to find the best trajectory, as
response to the other agents' choices. We provide a proof of correctness of the
algorithms and experimentally evaluate them on synthetic domains.

the plasma is modeled as a sphere with a radially varying permittivity, and the
internal electric fields are calculated by solving the macroscopic Maxwell
equations using an expansion in Debye potentials. It is found that the PF is
directed opposite to the plasma density gradient, similarly to large-scale
plasmas. In case of a uniform density profile, a residual spherically symmetric
compressive PF is found, suggesting possibilities for contactless ponderomotive
manipulation of homogeneous subwavelength objects. The presence of a surface PF
on discontinuous plasma boundaries is derived. This force is essential for a
microscopic description of the radiation-plasma interaction consistent with
momentum conservation. It is shown that the PF integrated over the plasma
volume is equivalent to the radiation pressure exerted on the plasma by the
incident wave. The concept of radiative acceleration of subwavelength plasmas,

interpretation of such objects is not at all clear. In this paper, we show that
quasi-probabilities naturally fall into two qualitatively different types,
according to whether their non-negative marginals can or cannot be matched to a
non-negative probability. The former type, which we call viable, are
qualitatively similar to true probabilities, but the latter type, which we call
non-viable, may not have a sensible interpretation. Determining the existence
of a probability matching given marginals is a non-trivial question in general.
In simple examples, Fine's theorem indicates that inequalities of the Bell and
CHSH type provide criteria for its existence, and these examples are considered
in detail. Our results have consequences for the linear positivity condition of
Goldstein and Page in the context of the histories approach to quantum theory.
Although it is a very weak condition for the assignment of probabilities it
fails in some important cases where our results indicate that probabilities
clearly exist. We speculate that our method, of matching probabilities to a
given set of marginals, provides a general method of assigning probabilities to
histories and we show that it passes the Di\'osi test for the statistical

we report the results from a heat treatment study of a large-grain 1.5 GHz
single-cell cavity made of ""medium purity"" Nb. The baseline surface preparation
prior to heat treatment consisted of standard buffered chemical polishing. The
heat treatment in the range 800 - 1400 C was done in a newly designed vacuum
induction furnace. Q0 values of the order of 2x1010 at 2.0 K and peak surface
magnetic field (Bp) of 90 mT were achieved reproducibly. A Q0-value of
(5+-1)1010 at 2.0 K and Bp = 90 mT was obtained after heat treatment at 1400 C.
This is the highest value ever reported at this temperature, frequency and
field. Samples heat treated with the cavity at 1400 C were analyzed by
secondary ion mass spectrometry, secondary electron microscopy, energy
dispersive X-ray, point contact tunneling and X-ray diffraction and revealed a
complex surface composition which includes titanium oxide, increased carbon and
nitrogen content but reduced hydrogen concentration compared to a non
heat-treated sample.

with spatial diffeomorphism covariance. In this work we show how an appropriate
choice of coordinate patches together with suitable modifications of these

the damping coefficient $b$ does not satisfy the Geometric Control Condition
(GCC). First, we give a link with the controllability of the associated
Schr\""odinger equation. We prove in an abstract setting that the observability
of the Schr\""odinger group implies that the semigroup associated to the damped
wave equation decays at rate $1/\sqrt{t}$ (which is a stronger rate than the
general logarithmic one predicted by the Lebeau Theorem).
  Second, we focus on the 2-dimensional torus. We prove that the best decay one
can expect is $1/t$, as soon as the damping region does not satisfy GCC.
Conversely, for smooth damping coefficients $b$, we show that the semigroup
decays at rate $1/t^{1-\eps}$, for all $\eps >0$. The proof relies on a second
microlocalization around trapped directions, and resolvent estimates.
  In the case where the damping coefficient is a characteristic function of a
strip (hence discontinuous), St\'{e}phane Nonnenmacher computes in an appendix
part of the spectrum of the associated damped wave operator, proving that the
semigroup cannot decay faster than $1/t^{2/3}$. In particular, our study shows
that the decay rate highly depends on the way $b$ vanishes.

terrestrial planet atmospheres, ranging from oxidizing through reducing, which
makes the code suitable for applications for the wide range of anticipated
terrestrial exoplanet compositions. The one-dimensional chemical transport
model treats up to 800 chemical reactions, photochemical processes, dry and wet
deposition, surface emission and thermal escape of O, H, C, N and S bearing
species, as well as formation and deposition of elemental sulfur and sulfuric
acid aerosols. We validate the model by computing the atmospheric composition
of current Earth and Mars and find agreement with observations of major trace
gases in Earth's and Mars' atmospheres. We simulate several plausible
atmospheric scenarios of terrestrial exoplanets, and choose three benchmark
cases for atmospheres from reducing to oxidizing. The most interesting finding
is that atomic hydrogen is always a more abundant reactive radical than the
hydroxyl radical in anoxic atmospheres. Whether atomic hydrogen is the most
important removal path for a molecule of interest also depends on the relevant
reaction rates. We also find that volcanic carbon compounds (i.e., CH4 and CO2)
are chemically long-lived and tend to be well mixed in both reducing and
oxidizing atmospheres, and their dry deposition velocities to the surface
control the atmospheric oxidation states. Furthermore, we revisit whether
photochemically produced oxygen can cause false positives for detecting
oxygenic photosynthesis, and find that in 1-bar CO2-rich atmospheres oxygen and
ozone may build up to levels that have been previously considered unique
signatures of life, if there is no surface emission of reducing gases...
