Asiago - Cima Ekar with the optical photon counter Aqueye (the Asiago Quantum
Eye) which has the best temporal resolution and accuracy ever achieved in the
optical domain (hundreds of picoseconds). Our goal was to perform a detailed
analysis of the optical period and phase drift of the main peak of the Crab
pulsar and compare it with the Jodrell Bank ephemerides. We determined the
position of the main peak using the steepest zero of the cross-correlation
function between the pulsar signal and an accurate optical template. The pulsar
rotational period and period derivative have been measured with great accuracy
using observations covering only a 2 day time interval. The error on the period
is 1.7 ps, limited only by the statistical uncertainty. Both the rotational
frequency and its first derivative are in agreement with those from the Jodrell
Bank radio ephemerides archive. We also found evidence of the optical peak
leading the radio one by ~230 microseconds. The distribution of phase-residuals
of the whole dataset is slightly wider than that of a synthetic signal
generated as a sequence of pulses distributed in time with the probability
proportional to the pulse shape, such as the average count rate and background
level are those of the Crab pulsar observed with Aqueye. The counting
statistics and quality of the data allowed us to determine the pulsar period
and period derivative with great accuracy in 2 days only. The time of arrival
of the optical peak of the Crab pulsar leads the radio one in agreement with
what recently reported in the literature. The distribution of the phase
residuals can be approximated with a Gaussian and is consistent with being
completely caused by photon noise (for the best data sets).

xc-energy and an accurate corresponding xc-potential even in difficult
near-degeneracy situations such as molecular bond breaking. In particular we
demand that: (1) the xc hole properly contains -1 electron, (2) the
xc-potential has the asymptotic -1/r behavior outside finite systems and (3)
the xc-potential has the correct step structure related to the derivative

screening the exchange hole in such a way that the pair-correlation function is

conduction. In the resulting tearing mode reconnection the neutral and ion
fluids become decoupled upstream from the reconnection site, creating an excess
of ions in the reconnection region and therefore an ionization imbalance. Ion
recombination in the reconnection region, combined with Alfv\'{e}nic outflows,
quickly removes ions from the reconnection site, leading to a fast reconnection
rate independent of Lundquist number. In addition to allowing fast
reconnection, we find that these non-equilibria partial ionization effects lead
to the onset of the nonlinear secondary tearing instability at lower values of
the Lundquist number than has been found in fully ionized plasmas.These
simulations provide evidence that magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere
could be responsible for jet-like transient phenomena such as spicules and

classification of all linear operators that can be defined on them. In the
1970s, there were only a few known operators, for example, the derivative
operator, the difference operator, the average operator, and the Rota-Baxter
operator. A few more appeared after Rota posed his problem. However, little
progress was made to solve this problem in general. In part, this is because
the precise meaning of the problem is not so well understood. In this paper, we
propose a formulation of the problem using the framework of operated algebras
and viewing an associative algebra with a linear operator as one that satisfies
a certain operated polynomial identity. This framework also allows us to apply
theories of rewriting systems and Gr\""{o}bner-Shirshov bases. To narrow our
focus more on the operators that Rota was interested in, we further consider
two particular classes of operators, namely, those that generalize differential
or Rota-Baxter operators. As it turns out, these two classes of operators
correspond to those that possess Gr\""obner-Shirshov bases under two different
monomial orderings. Working in this framework, and with the aid of computer
algebra, we are able to come up with a list of these two classes of operators,
and provide some evidence that these lists may be complete. Our search has
revealed quite a few new operators of these types whose properties are expected
to be similar to the differential operator and Rota-Baxter operator
respectively.
  Recently, a more unified approach has emerged in related areas, such as
difference algebra and differential algebra, and Rota-Baxter algebra and
Nijenhuis algebra. The similarities in these theories can be more efficiently

supergravity. For Yang-Mills we find that the simple form for the full
amplitude presented by Del Duca, Dixon and Maltoni naturally leads to one that
has physical residues on all compact contours. After expanding the simple form
in terms of standard scalar integrals, we introduce redundancies under certain
symmetry considerations to impose the color-kinematics duality of Bern,
Carrasco and Johansson (BCJ). For five particles we directly find the results
of Carrasco and Johansson as well as a new compact form for the supergravity
amplitude. For six particles we find that all kinematic dual Jacobi identities
are encapsulated in a single functional equation relating the expansion
coefficients. By the BCJ double-copy construction we obtain a formula for the
corresponding N=8 supergravity amplitude. Quite surprisingly, all physical
information becomes independent of the expansion coefficients modulo the
functional equation. In other words, there is no need to solve the functional
equation at all. This is quite welcome as the functional equation we find,
using our restricted set of redundancies, actually has no solutions. For this
reason we call these results virtual color-kinematics duality. We end with
speculations about the meaning of an interesting global vs. local feature of
the functional equation and the situation at higher points.

single-layer, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and short BN chains on graphene
are investigated using first-principles plane wave calculations. Our analysis
starts with the adsorption of a single carbon ad-atom and examines its
migrations. Once a C$_2$ nucleates on h-BN, the insertion of each additional
carbon at its close proximity causes a short segment of carbon atomic chain to
grow by one atom at at a time in a quaint way: The existing chain leaves its
initial position and subsequently is attached from its bottom end to the top of
the carbon ad-atom. The electronic, magnetic and structural properties of these
chains vertically adsorbed to h-BN depend on the number of carbon atoms in the
chain, such that they exhibit an even-odd disparity. An individual carbon chain
can also modify the electronic structure with localized states in the wide band
gap of h-BN. As a reverse situation we examined the growth of short BN atomic
chains on graphene, which attribute diverse properties depending on whether B
or N is the atom bound to the substrate. These results together with ab-initio
molecular dynamics simulations of the growth process reveal the interesting
self-assembly behavior of the grown chains. Furthermore, we find that these
atomic chains enhance the chemical activity of h-BN and graphene sheets by
creating active sites for the bonding of various ad-atoms and can act as
pillars between two and multiple sheets of these honeycomb structures leaving
wider spacing between them to achieve high capacity storage of specific
molecules.

striking benefit of these methods is the ability to obtain swift and consistent
results without the necessity for air, pH, or temperature sensitive techniques;
therefore, reaction times and complex manufacturing processes are greatly
reduced as compared to conventional synthetic methods. This is a great benefit

scientific disciplines including seismology, economy, and epidemiology. Here,
we focus on the predictability of invasion of a broad class of epidemics caused
by diseases that lead to permanent immunity of infected hosts after recovery or
death. We approach the problem from the perspective of the science of
complexity by proposing and testing several strategies for the estimation of
important characteristics of epidemics, such as the probability of invasion.
Our results suggest that parsimonious approximate methodologies may lead to the
most reliable and robust predictions. The proposed methodologies are first
applied to analysis of experimentally observed epidemics: invasion of the
fungal plant pathogen \emph{Rhizoctonia solani} in replicated host microcosms.
We then consider numerical experiments of the SIR
(susceptible-infected-removed) model to investigate the performance of the
proposed methods in further detail. The suggested framework can be used as a
valuable tool for quick assessment of epidemic threat at the stage when
epidemics only start developing. Moreover, our work amplifies the significance
of the small-scale and finite-time microcosm realizations of epidemics
revealing their predictive power.

other exotic superconducting phases, is proposed with bosonization analysis. In

In the refined conjecture, Z_{BH} is the partition function of BPS black holes
counted with spin, or more precisely the protected spin character. Z_{top}
becomes the partition function of the refined topological string, which is
itself an index. Both the original and the refined conjecture are examples of
large N duality in the 't Hooft sense. The refined conjecture applies to
non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds only, so the black holes are really BPS
particles with large entropy, of order N^2. The refined OSV conjecture states
that the refined BPS partition function has a large N dual which is captured by
the refined topological string. We provide evidence that the conjecture holds
by studying local Calabi-Yau threefolds consisting of line bundles over a genus
g Riemann surface. We show that the refined topological string partition
function on these geometries is computed by a two-dimensional TQFT. We also
study the refined black hole partition function arising from N D4 branes on the

two-dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills. Finally, we show that in the large N limit
this theory factorizes to the square of the refined topological string in

a homeotropic cell, however, particles rotate to orient their long axis
parallel to the director. When so aligned, parallel dipoles repel and form 2D
ordered assemblies with hexagonal symmetry that ripen over time owing to
attraction between antiparallel neighbors. Further, we show that the anchoring
conditions inside the cell can be altered by application of an electrical
field, allowing us to flip microbullets to orient parallel to the director, an

control the formation of 1D chains and hexagonal lattices with respect to the

increasing oxygen coverage. While a single oxygen atom migrates over the C-C

21-cm absorption arising within the hosts of z > 1 radio galaxies and quasars
have been remarkably unsuccessful. Curran et al.(2008) suggest that this is due
to the high redshift selection biasing towards the most optically bright
objects (those most luminous in the ultra-violetin the rest-frame), where the
gas is ionised by the active galactic nucleus. They therefore argue that there
must be a population of fainter objects in which the hydrogen is not ionised
and which exhibit a similar detection rate as at lower redshifts. In order to
find this ""missing"" gas at high redshift, we have therefore undertaken a survey
of z > 2 radio sources, selected by optical faintness. Despite having optical
magnitudes which indicate that the targets have ultra-violet luminosities below
the threshold where all of the gas is ionised, there were no detections in any
of the eight sources for which useable data were obtained. Upon an analysis of
the spectral energy distributions, ionising photon rates can only be determined
for three of these, all of which suggest that the objects are above the highest
luminosity of a current 21-cm detection. The possibility that the other five
could be located at lower photon rates cannot be ruled out, although zero
detections out of five is not statistically significant. Another possible cause
of the non-detections is that our selection biases the sample towards sources
which are very steep in the radio band, with a mean spectral index of = -1.0,
cf. -0.3 for both the 21-cm detections and UV luminous non-detections. This
adds the further possibility that the sources have very extended emission,
which would have the effect of reducing the coverage by the putative absorbing
gas, thus decreasing the sensitivity of the observation.

of gravitational waves. The most effective method to look for a signal with a
well understood waveform, such as the binary black hole signal, is matched
filtering against a library of model waveforms. Current model waveforms are
comprised solely of the dominant radiation mode, the quadrupole mode, although
it is known that there can be significant power in the higher-order modes. The
binary black hole waveforms produced by numerical relativity are accurate
through late inspiral, merger, and ringdown and include the higher-order modes.
The available numerical-relativity waveforms span an increasing portion of the
physical parameter space of unequal mass, spin and precession. In this paper,
we investigate the degree to which gravitational-wave searches could be
improved by the inclusion of higher modes in the model waveforms, for signals
with a variety of initial mass ratios and generic spins. Our investigation
studies how well the quadrupole-only waveform model matches the signal as a
function of the inclination and orientation of the source and how the modes
contribute to the distance reach into the Universe of Advanced LIGO for a fixed
set of internal source parameters. The mismatch between signals and
quadrupole-only waveform can be large, dropping below 0.97 for up to 65% of the
source-sky for the non-precessing cases we studied, and over a larger area in
one precessing case. There is a corresponding 30% increase in detection volume
that could be achieved by adding higher modes to the search; however, this is
mitigated by the fact that the mismatch is largest for signals which radiate
the least energy and to which the search is therefore least sensitive.
Likewise, the mismatch is largest in directions from the source along which the
least energy is radiated.

(0.8 dex, on average) between the position of our objects and the local
relation for AGN, in the sense that the majority of red QSO hosts have lower
velocity dispersions and/or more massive BHs than local galaxies. These results
are in agreement with recent studies of AGN at similar and higher redshifts.
This could indicate an unusually rapid growth in the host galaxies since z~0.2,
if these objects were to land in the local relation at present time. However,
the z>0.1 AGN (including our sample and those of previous studies) have
significantly higher BH mass than those of local AGN, so a direct comparison is
not straightforward. Further, using several samples of local and higher-z AGN,
we find a striking trend of an increasing offset with respect to the local
M-sigma relation as a function of AGN luminosity, with virtually all objects
with log(L_5100/erg s^-1) > 43.6 falling above the relation. Given the
relatively small number of AGN at z>0.1 for which there are direct measurements
of stellar velocity dispersions, it is impossible at present to determine
whether there truly is evolution in M-sigma with redshift. Larger, carefully
selected samples of AGN are necessary to disentangle the dependence of M-sigma

still an enigma, whose nature is debated. One of the possible mechanism to
produce this emission is the bremsstrahlung model. However, previous analytical
and numerical calculations showed that in this case the intracluster plasma had
to be overheated very fast because suprathermal electrons emitting the HXR
excess lose their energy mainly by Coulomb losses, i.e., they heat the
background plasma. It was concluded also from these investigations that it is
problematic to produce emitting electrons from a background plasma by
stochastic (Fermi) acceleration because the energy supplied by external sources
in the form of Fermi acceleration is quickly absorbed by the background plasma.
In other words the Fermi acceleration is ineffective for particle acceleration.
We revisited this problem and found that at some parameter of acceleration the
rate of plasma heating is rather low and the acceleration tails of non-thermal
particles can be generated and exist for a long time while the plasma
temperature is almost constant. We showed also that for some regime of
acceleration the plasma cools down instead of being heated up, even though
external sources (in the form of external acceleration) supply energy to the
system. The reason is that the acceleration withdraws effectively high energy
particles from the thermal pool (analogue of Maxwell demon).

~300-1500 AU and a pericenter distance ~10-200 AU, with a significant
probability of being closer to the MBH than S2. Future detection of such a
closer star would offer an important test to general relativity. The majority
of the surviving ejected companions of the S-stars are expected to be located

effect of attractions on the correlation length scales. We find that
attractions can strongly affect relaxation dynamics, dynamic heterogeneity and
the associated dynamic correlation length of the liquid, but their influence on
bond orientational order and the associated static correlation length shows a
manner reminiscent of the effect of attractions on the thermodynamics of
liquids. This implies that the growth of bond orientational order and static
correlation length scale might be merely a manifestation of favoring the
configurational entropy in weakly frustrated glass-forming liquids. Thus, our
results lead strong evidence that bond orientational order cannot provide a

to global healthcare. However, in spite of its great potential and research
history over many decades, these systems are not commonly used. One of the main
problems is that existing methods use diffusive jets, which result in scattered
penetration and severe deceleration of the jets, causing frequent pain and
insufficient penetration. Another longstanding challenge is the development of
accurate small volume injections. In this paper we employ a novel method of
needle-free drug injection, using highly-focused high speed microjets, which
aims to solve these challenges. We experimentally demonstrate that these unique
jets are able to penetrate human skin: the focused nature of these microjets
creates an injection spot smaller than a mosquito's proboscis and guarantees a
high percentage of the liquid being injected. The liquid substances can be
delivered to a much larger depth than conventional methods, and create a
well-controlled dispersion pattern. Thanks to the excellent controllability of
the microjet, small volume injections become feasible. Furthermore, the
penetration dynamics is studied through experiments performed on gelatin
mixtures (human soft tissue equivalent) and human skin, agreeing well with a
viscous stress model which we develop. This model predicts the depth of the
penetration into both human skin and soft tissue. The results presented here
take needle-free injections a step closer to widespread use.

In contrast to neutron stars, the structure of quark stars is determined by two

base of the crust. If bare, quark stars possess ultra-high electric fields on
the order of 10^{18} to 10^{19} V/cm. These features render the properties of
quark stars more multifaceted than those of neutron stars and may allow one to

phenomena in galaxies, which point to the existence of starburst rings and
dense circumnuclear molecular disks. The effect of self-gravity of the gas in
the 2D disk can be important in confronting observations and numerical
simulations in detail. For use in such applications, a new method for the
calculation of the gravitational force of a 2D disk is presented. Instead of
solving the complete potential function problem, we calculate the force in
infinite planes in Cartesian and polar coordinates by a reproducing kernel
method. Under the limitation of a 2D disk, we specifically represent the force
as a double summation of a convolution of the surface density and a fundamental
kernel and employ a fast Fourier transform technique. In this method, the
entire computational complexity can be reduced from $O(N^2\times N^2)$ to
$O((N\times \log_2(N)^2)$, where $N$ is the number of zones in one dimension.
This approach does not require softening. The proposed method is similar to a
spectral method, but without the necessity of imposing a periodic boundary
condition. We further show this approach is of near second order accuracy for a
smooth surface density in a Cartesian coordinate system.

pairs in the O:H-O hydrogen-bond is shown to originate the anomalies of ice
under compression. Consistency between experimental observations, density
functional theory and molecular dynamics calculations confirmed that the
resultant force of the compression, the repulsion, and the recovery of
electron-pair dislocations differentiates ice from other materials in response
to pressure. The compression shortens and strengthens the longer-and-softer
intermolecular O:H lone-pair virtual-bond; the repulsion pushes the bonding
electron pair away from the H+/p and hence lengthens and weakens the
intramolecular H-O real-bond. The virtual-bond compression and the real-bond
elongation symmetrize the O:H-O as observed at ~60 GPa and result in the
abnormally low compressibility of ice. The virtual-bond stretching phonons (<
400 cm-1) are thus stiffened and the real-bond stretching phonons (> 3000 cm-1)
softened upon compression. The cohesive energy of the real-bond dominates and
its loss lowers the critical temperature for the VIII-VII phase transition. The
polarization of the lone electron pairs and the entrapment of the bonding
electron pairs by compression expand the band gap consequently. Findings should
form striking impact to understanding the physical anomalies of H2O.

VLTI/PIONIER interferometer. Thorough analysis of interferometric data was
performed to measure the stellar angular diameter and to search for
circumstellar material. We detected near-infrared circumstellar emission around
beta Pic that accounts for 1.37% +/- 0.16% of the near-infrared stellar flux
and that is located within the field-of-view of PIONIER (i.e., ~200 mas in
radius). The flux ratio between this excess and the photosphere emission is
shown to be stable over a period of 1 year and to vary only weakly across the H
band, suggesting that the source is either very hot (> 1500 K) or dominated by
the scattering of the stellar flux. In addition, we derived the limb-darkened
angular diameter of beta Pic with an unprecedented accuracy (theta_LD= 0.736

likely due to the scattering of stellar light by circumstellar dust and/or the

elements. Since the invention, Hill cipher algorithm was used for symmetric
encryption, where the multiplication matrix is the key. The Hill cipher
requires the inverse of the matrix to recover the plaintext from cipher text.
We propose a class of matrices in GF(2) which are non invertible and easy to
generate.

In this paper, we present D-FLAT, a novel tool that relieves the user of having
to handle all the technical details concerned with parsing, tree decomposition,
the handling of data structures, etc. Instead, it is only the dynamic
programming algorithm itself which has to be specified in the ASP language.
D-FLAT employs an ASP solver in order to compute the local solutions in the
dynamic programming algorithm. In the paper, we give a few examples
illustrating the use of D-FLAT and describe the main features of the system.

oxygen accretes sufficient mass to trigger a thermonuclear explosion$^{1}$. The
accretion could occur slowly from an unevolved (main-sequence) or evolved
(subgiant or giant) star$^{2,3}$, that being dubbed the single-degenerate

degenerate channel)$^{3,4}$. Obviously, a companion will survive the explosion
only in the single-degenerate channel$^{5}$. Both channels might contribute to
the production of type Ia supernovae$^{6,7}$ but their relative proportions
still remain a fundamental puzzle in astronomy. Previous searches for remnant
companions have revealed one possible case for SN 1572$^{8,9}$, though that has
been criticized$^{10}$. More recently, observations have restricted surviving
companions to be small, main-sequence stars$^{11,12,13}$, ruling out giant
companions, though still allowing the single-degenerate channel. Here we report
the result of a search for surviving companions to the progenitor of SN

  elliptical, single and vertically stacked InAs quantum dots","Accepted for publication in Physical Review B journal",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The demonstration of isotropic polarization response from semiconductor
quantum dots (QDs) is a crucial step towards the design of several
optoelectronic technologies. Among many parameters that impact the degree of
polarization (DOP) of a QD system, the shape asymmetry is a critical factor. We
perform multi-million-atom simulations to study the impact of the elliptical
shapes on the electronic and polarization properties of single and vertically
stacked InAs QDs. The comparison between a low aspect ratio (AR) and a high AR
QD reveals that the electronic and the polarization properties strongly depend
on the AR of the QD; the elongation of a tall QD allows tuning of the DOP over
a much wider range. We then extend our analysis to an experimentally reported
vertical stack of nine QDs (9-VSQDs) that has shown significant potential to
achieve isotropic polarization properties. We analyse the contribution from the
shape asymmetry in the large, experimentally measured, in-plane polarization
anisotropy. Our analysis shows that the orientation of the base elongation
controls the sign of the DOP; however the magnitude of the base elongation has
only a very little impact on the magnitude of the DOP. We further predict that
the elliptical shape of the 9-VSQDs can only tune either DOP[110] or DOP[-110]
for an isotropic response. Our model results, in agreement with the TEM
findings, suggest that the experimentally grown 9-VSQDs has either a
circular-base or a slightly [-110] elongated base. Overall the detailed
investigation of the DOP as a function of the QD shape asymmetry provides a
theoretical guidance for the continuing experimental efforts to achieve
tailored polarization properties from the QD nano-structures for the design of
optical devices.

  It turns out that the method applies to both a class of ordinary Lie algebras

  Besides some examples, due to the level of complexity we will only describe a
few precise results. One of these is a complete classification of which ideals
can occur in the enveloping algebra of the translation subgroup of the

construction of an infinite-dimensional family of inequivalent representations
already in dimension 12. This is much lower than the 24-dimensional

increases considerably, though yet in a manageable fashion, in the

to fit this SED and determine the surface gravity and temperature of both
components. The gravitational redshift provided an independent confirmation of
the surface gravity of the sdB component. An orbital period of 753 +- 3 d and a
mass ratio of q = 0.637 +- 0.015 were found from the RV-curves. The sdB
component has an effective temperature of Teff = 33500 +- 1200 K and a surface
gravity of logg = 5.84 +- 0.08 dex, while the cool companion is found to be a
G-type star with Teff = 5930 +- 160 K and logg = 4.29 +- 0.05 dex. Assuming a
canonical mass of Msdb = 0.47 Msun, the MS component has a mass of 0.74 +- 0.07

inequality (ELGI) by Usha Devi et al. (arXiv: 1208.4491v2 (2012)). This
inequality places a bound on the statistical measurement outcomes of dynamical
observables describing a macrorealistic system. Such a bound is not necessarily
obeyed by quantum systems, and therefore provides an important way to
distinguish quantumness from classical behavior. Here we study ELGI using a
two-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system. To perform the noninvasive
measurements required for the ELGI study, we prepare the system qubit in a
maximally mixed state as well as use the `ideal negative result measurement'
procedure with the help of an ancilla qubit. The experimental results show a
clear violation of ELGI by over four standard deviations. These results agree
with the predictions of quantum theory. The violation of ELGI is attributed to
the fact that certain joint probabilities are not legitimate in the quantum
scenario, in the sense they do not reproduce all the marginal probabilities.
Using a three-qubit system, we experimentally demonstrate that three-time joint
probabilities do not reproduce certain two-time marginal probabilities.

single-level quantum dot weakly coupled to a local Einstein phonon which causes
fluctuations in the dot energy. An analytic expression for the cumulant
generating function, accurate up to second order in the electron-phonon
coupling and valid for finite voltages and temperatures, is obtained in the
extended wide-band limit. The result accounts for nonequilibrium phonon
distributions induced by the source-drain bias voltage, and concomitantly
satisfies the fluctuation theorem. Extending the counting field to the complex
plane, we investigate the locations of possible singularities of the cumulant
generating function, and exploit them to identify regimes in which the electron
transfer is affected differently by the coupling to the phonons. Within a
large-deviation analysis, we find a kink in the probability distribution,
analogous to a first-order phase transition in thermodynamics, which would be a
unique hallmark of the electron-phonon correlations. This kink reflects the
fact that although inelastic scattering by the phonons once the voltage exceeds
their frequency can scatter electrons opposite to the bias, this will never
generate current flowing against the bias at zero temperature, in accordance
with the fluctuation theorem.

prove that by showing that there is a trap located around $(C^*(\ln\ln

particle typically stays up to time $t$. This is in sharp contrast to what
happens in the ""pure"" Sinai's regime, where the location of this trap is random
on the scale $\ln^2 t$.
