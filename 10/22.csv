patterns to which certain dynamical systems modeling social dynamics tend
spontaneously to be attracted. In this paper we explore situations beyond
self-organization, in particular how to externally control such dynamical
systems in order to eventually enforce pattern formation also in those
situations where this wished phenomenon does not result from spontaneous
convergence. Our focus is on dynamical systems of Cucker-Smale type, modeling
consensus emergence, and we question the existence of stabilization and optimal
control strategies which require the minimal amount of external intervention
for nevertheless inducing consensus in a group of interacting agents. We
provide a variational criterion to explicitly design feedback controls that are
componentwise sparse, i.e. with at most one nonzero component at every instant
of time. Controls sharing this sparsity feature are very realistic and
convenient for practical issues. Moreover, the maximally sparse ones are
instantaneously optimal in terms of the decay rate of a suitably designed
Lyapunov functional, measuring the distance from consensus. As a consequence we
provide a mathematical justification to the general principle according to
which ""sparse is better"" in the sense that a policy maker, who is not allowed
to predict future developments, should always consider more favorable to
intervene with stronger action on the fewest possible instantaneous optimal
leaders rather than trying to control more agents with minor strength in order
to achieve group consensus. We then establish local and global sparse
controllability properties to consensus and, finally, we analyze the sparsity
of solutions of the finite time optimal control problem where the minimization
criterion is a combination of the distance from consensus and of the l1-norm of
the control.

({\nu}{\eta})^0.5 is derived from the analytical solution of the
one-dimensional diffusion equation with a penalization term. The effect of the
error reduction is verified numerically for the one-dimensional diffusion
equation, Burgers' equation, and the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.
The results show that the numerical error is reduced except in the vicinity of
the interface showing overall second-order accuracy, while it converges to a
non-zero constant value as the number of grid points increases for the original
mask function. However, the new approach is effective when the grid resolution
is sufficiently high so that the boundary layer, whose width is proportional to
({\nu}{\eta})^0.5, is resolved. Hence, the approach should be used when an
appropriate combination of {\nu} and {\eta} is chosen with a given numerical
grid.

systems when collective effects (dressing of the stars by their polarization
cloud) are neglected. We start from the BBGKY hierarchy issued from the
Liouville equation and consider an expansion in powers of 1/N in a proper
thermodynamic limit. For $N\rightarrow +\infty$, we obtain the Vlasov equation
describing the evolution of collisionless stellar systems like elliptical
galaxies. At the order 1/N, we obtain a kinetic equation describing the
evolution of collisional stellar systems like globular clusters. This equation
does not suffer logarithmic divergences at large scales since spatial
inhomogeneity is explicitly taken into account. Making a local approximation,
and introducing an upper cut-off at the Jeans length, it reduces to the
Vlasov-Landau equation which is the standard kinetic equation of stellar
systems. Our approach provides a simple and pedagogical derivation of these
important equations from the BBGKY hierarchy which is more rigorous for systems
with long-range interactions than the two-body encounters theory. Making an
adiabatic approximation, we write the generalized Landau equation in
angle-action variables and obtain a Landau-type kinetic equation that is valid
for fully inhomogeneous stellar systems and is free of divergences at large
scales. This equation is less general than the Lenard Balescu-type kinetic
equation recently derived by Heyvaerts (2010) since it neglects collective
effects, but it is substantially simpler and could be useful as a first step.
We discuss the evolution of the system as a whole and the relaxation of a test
star in a bath of field stars. We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck
equation in angle-action variables and provide expressions for the diffusion
coefficient and friction force.

affiliated with a von Neumann algebra N can equivalently be described as
certain real-valued functions on the projection lattice P(N) of the algebra,
which we call q-observable functions. Here, we show that q-observable functions
can be interpreted as generalised quantile functions for quantum observables
interpreted as random variables. More generally, when L is a complete
meet-semilattice, we show that L-valued cumulative distribution functions and
the corresponding L-quantile functions form a Galois connection. An ordinary
CDF can be written as an L-CDF composed with a state. For classical
probability, one picks L=B(\Omega), the complete Boolean algebra of measurable
subsets modulo null sets of a measurable space \Omega. For quantum probability,
one uses L=P(N), the projection lattice of a nonabelian von Neumann algebra N.
Moreover, using some constructions from the topos approach to quantum theory,
we show that there is a joint sample space for all quantum observables, despite
no-go results such as the Kochen-Specker theorem. Specifically, the spectral
presheaf \Sigma\ of a von Neumann algebra N, which is not a mere set, but a
presheaf (i.e., a 'varying set'), plays the role of the sample space. The
relevant meet-semilattice L in this case is the complete bi-Heyting algebra of
clopen subobjects of \Sigma. We show that using the spectral presheaf \Sigma\
and associated structures, quantum probability can be formulated in a way that
is structurally very similar to classical probability.

expansion for the smooth part of the density of states in single-particle
confined systems, our results take the form of a sum over clusters of particles
moving freely around manifolds in configuration space invariant under elements
of the group of permutations. Being asymptotic, our approximation gives
increasingly better results for large excitation energies and we formally
confirm that it coincides with the celebrated Bethe estimate in the appropriate
region. Moreover, our construction gives the correct high energy asymptotics
expected from general considerations, and shows that the emergence of the
fermionic ground state is actually a consequence of an extremely delicate large
cancellation effect. Remarkably, our expansion in cluster zones is naturally
incorporated for systems of interacting particles, opening the road to address
the fundamental problem about the interplay between confinement and

users (PUs) exchange information with the help of a secondary user (SU) that is
equipped with multiple antennas and in return, the SU superimposes its own
messages along with the primary transmission. The fundamental problem in the
considered network is the design of transmission strategies at the secondary
node. It involves three basic elements: first, how to split the power for
relaying the primary signals and for transmitting the secondary signals;
second, what two-way relay strategy should be used to assist the bidirectional
communication between the two PUs; third, how to jointly design the primary and
secondary transmit precoders. This work aims to address this problem by
proposing a transmission framework of maximizing the achievable rate of the SU
while maintaining the rate requirements of the two PUs. Three well-known and
practical two-way relay strategies are considered: amplify-and-forward (AF),
bit level XOR based decode-and-forward (DF-XOR) and symbol level superposition
coding based DF (DF-SUP). For each relay strategy, although the design problem
is non-convex, we find the optimal solution by using certain transformation
techniques and optimization tools such as semidefinite programming (SDP) and
second-order cone programming (SOCP). Closed-form solutions are also obtained
under certain conditions. Simulation results show that when the rate
requirements of the two PUs are symmetric, by using the DF-XOR strategy and
applying the proposed optimal precoding, the SU requires the least power for
relaying and thus reserves the most power to transmit its own signal. In the
asymmetric scenario, on the other hand, the DF-SUP strategy with the
corresponding optimal precoding is the best.

analysis, based on the definition and evaluation of a slope correction factor
and a new form of intercept correction factor. In this improved approach there
exists a basic approximation that neglects certain terms in the general theory,
and focuses on the influence of the form of the tunneling barrier on the values
of basic slope ({\sigma}B) and intercept ({\rho}B) correction factors. Simple
formulae exist that allow these to be evaluated numerically for a barrier of
arbitrary well-behaved form. This paper makes an initial exploration of the
effects of barrier form on FN plot analysis. For a planar emitter, two models
for the correlation-and-exchange (C and E) potential energy (PE) are used. For
the Schottky-Nordheim barrier, it is shown that numerical and analytical
approaches generate equivalent results. This agreement supports the validity of
the numerical methods used. Comparisons with results for the Cutler-Gibbons
barrier show that small differences in the assumed C and E PE make little
difference to values of {\sigma}B and {\rho}B. Schottky's planar image PE has
then been used, in conjunction with the electrostatic PE variation associated
with a spherical emitter model, to explore the influence of apex radius r_a on
correction-factor values, for values of r_a greater than 20 nm. Both {\sigma}B
and {\rho}B increase significantly as r_a decreases, especially {\rho}B. At low
values of barrier field F, {\sigma}B depends approximately linearly on 1/F,
with a slope that depends on r_a. Suggestions are made for how the exploratory
work described in this paper might be extended.

d=3.0 kpc, in good agreement with the near dynamical distance to the HII
region. This population should be located at the near intersection of the
Scutum-Crux arm. A luminous O7II star is likely to be the main source of
ionisation. Many stars are concentrated around the bright nebulosity, where
GLIMPSE images in the mid infrared show the presence of a bubble of excited
material surrounding a cavity that coincides spatially with a number of B0-1V
stars. We interpret this as an emerging cluster, perhaps triggered by the
nearby O7II star. We also find a number of B-type giants. Some of them are
located at approximately the same distance, and may be part of an older
population in the same area, characterised by much lower reddening. A few have
shorter distance moduli and are likely to be located in the Sagittarius arm.
The line of sight in this direction is very complex. Optically visible tracers
delineate two spiral arms, but seem to be absent beyond d~3 kpc. Several HII
regions in this area suggest that the Scutum-Crux arm contains thick clouds

is binary, we also show that the flow property of the forward component of the
solution can fail at the terminal time. In particular, we prove that a Dirac
point mass appears in its distribution, exactly at the location of the jump of
the binary function giving the terminal condition. We provide a detailed
analysis of the breakdown of the Markovian representation of the solution at
the terminal time.

derived from somatic cells (SCs) provide promising resources for regenerative
medicine and medical research, leading to a daily identification of new cell
lines. However, an efficient system to discriminate the cell lines is lacking.
Here, we developed a quantitative system to discriminate the three cell types,
iPSCs, ESCs and SCs. The system contains DNA-methylation biomarkers and
mathematical models, including an artificial neural network and support vector
machines. All biomarkers were unbiasedly selected by calculating an eigengene
score derived from analysis of genome-wide DNA methylations. With 30
biomarkers, or even with as few as 3 top biomarkers, this system can
discriminate SCs from ESCs and iPSCs with almost 100% accuracy, and with
approximately 100 biomarkers, the system can distinguish ESCs from iPSCs with
an accuracy of 95%. This robust system performs precisely with raw data without
normalization as well as with converted data in which the continuous
methylation levels are accounted. Strikingly, this system can even accurately
predict new samples generated from different microarray platforms and the
next-generation sequencing. The subtypes of cells, such as female and male
iPSCs and fetal and adult SCs, can also be discriminated with this system.
Thus, this quantitative system works as a novel general and accurate framework
for discriminating the three cell types, iPSCs, ESCs, and SCs and this strategy
supports the notion that DNA-methylation generally varies among the three cell
types.

a large class of stochastic differential games for which the interaction
between the players is of mean-field type. We implement the Mean-Field Games
strategy developed analytically by Lasry and Lions in a purely probabilistic
framework, relying on tailor-made forms of the stochastic maximum principle.
While we assume that the state dynamics are affine in the states and the
controls, our assumptions on the nature of the costs are rather weak, and
surprisingly, the dependence of all the coefficients upon the statistical
distribution of the states remains of a rather general nature. Our
probabilistic approach calls for the solution of systems of forward-backward
stochastic differential equations of a McKean-Vlasov type for which no
existence result is known, and for which we prove existence and regularity of
the corresponding value function. Finally, we prove that solutions of the
mean-field game as formulated by Lasry and Lions do indeed provide approximate
Nash equilibriums for games with a large number of players, and we quantify the
nature of the approximation.

1998, electronic exchanges have boomed, and by 2010 high frequency trading
accounted for over 70% of equity trades in the US. Such markets are thought to
increase liquidity because of the presence of market makers, who are willing to
trade as counterparties at any time, in exchange for a fee, the bid-ask spread.
In this paper, we propose an equilibrium model showing how such market makers
provide liquidity. The model relies on a codebook for client trades, the
implied alpha. After solving the individual clients optimization problems and
identifying their implied alphas, we frame the market maker stochastic
optimization problem as a stochastic control problem with an infinite
dimensional control variable. Assuming either identical time horizons for all
the clients, or a stochastic partial differential equation model for their
beliefs, we solve the market maker problem and derive tractable formulas for
the optimal strategy and the resulting limit-order book dynamics.

solid-like state following a sudden arrest in dynamics called jamming. In
contrast to jamming in spatially homogeneous systems, jamming in hoppers occurs
under extremely inhomogeneous conditions as the gravity-driven flow of grains
enclosed by rigid walls converges towards a small opening. In this work, we
study velocity fluctuations in a collisional flow near jamming using
event-driven simulations. The average flow in a hopper geometry is known to
have strong gradients, especially near the walls and the orifice. We find, in
addition, a spatially heterogeneous distribution of fluctuations, most striking
in the velocity autocorrelation relaxation times. At high flow rates, the flow
at the center has lower kinetic temperatures and longer autocorrelation times
than at the boundary. Remarkably, however, this trend reverses itself as the
flow rate slows, with fluctuations relaxing more slowly at the boundaries
though the kinetic temperatures remain high in that region. The slowing down of
the dynamics is accompanied by increasing non-Gaussianity in the velocity
distributions, which also have large spatial variations.

predicted to be between 3.03 and 3.88 GPa. The Fermi surfaces of Sc3InX contain
both hole- and electron-like topology which changes as one replaces B with C or
N. The bulk modulus, specific heats, thermal expansion coefficient, and Debye
temperature are calculated as a function both temperature and pressure using
the quasi-harmonic Debye model with phononic effects. The results so obtained
are analysed in comparison to the characteristics of other related compounds.
Moreover optical functions are calculated and discussed for the first time. The
reflectivity is found to be high in the IR-UV regions up to ~ 10.7 eV (Sc3InB,
Sc3InC) and 12.3 eV (Sc3InN), thus showing promise as good coating materials.

performance increases much from V=2 to V=5 or 10, and then is almost constant.
Overall, this can explain the common advice to take V=5---at least in our

linear combinations of individual frequencies are expected to appear not only
by chance, but also as a characteristic signature linked to different physical
phenomena, e.g., nonlinear oscillations, binarity, and rotation. Furthermore it
is very important to identify independent frequencies for modelling purposes.
We show that using high precision data sets delivered by recent space missions,
the distinction between combinations having a real physical meaning and
spurious combinations which only appear by chance gets more and more difficult.
We demonstrate how careful one should be with the interpretation of such
combination frequencies by presenting the statistical distributions derived
from artificial data sets. Based on comparisons to observations, we find that,
despite the high statistical probability of finding combinations in random data
sets (having similar properties to the ones of real stars), there is a
significant difference in the number of the lowest order combinations between
stars with and starts without real combination frequencies. This way, a search
for frequency combinations is very useful when interpreted properly, and when
results are compared to simulations.

(IPDG) method using piecewise linear polynomials for the indefinite time

following: first, the method penalizes not only the jumps of the tangential
component of the electric field across the element faces but also the jumps of
the tangential component of its vorticity field; second, the penalty parameters
are taken as complex numbers of negative imaginary parts. For the differential
problem, we prove that the sesquilinear form associated with the Maxwell
problem satisfies a generalized weak stability (i.e., inf-sup condition) for
star-shaped domains.Such a generalized weak stability readily infers
wave-number explicit a priori estimates for the solution of the Maxwell
problem, which plays an important role in the error analysis for the IPDG
method. For the proposed IPDG method, we show that the discrete sesquilinear
form satisfies a coercivity for all positive mesh size $h$ and wave number $k$
and for general domains including non-star-shaped ones. In turn, the coercivity
easily yields the well-posedness and stability estimates (i.e., a priori
estimates) for the discrete problem without imposing any mesh constraint. Based
on these discrete stability estimates, by adapting a nonstandard error estimate
technique of Fung and Wu (2009), we derive both the energy-norm and the
$L^2$-norm error estimates for the IPDG method in all mesh parameter regimes

  inverse problems with proximal tools",,,,,"cs.NA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a proximal approach to deal with a class of convex variational
problems involving nonlinear constraints. A large family of constraints, proven
to be effective in the solution of inverse problems, can be expressed as the
lower level set of a sum of convex functions evaluated over different, but
possibly overlapping, blocks of the signal. For such constraints, the
associated projection operator generally does not have a simple form. We
circumvent this difficulty by splitting the lower level set into as many
epigraphs as functions involved in the sum. A closed half-space constraint is
also enforced, in order to limit the sum of the introduced epigraphical
variables to the upper bound of the original lower level set. In this paper, we
focus on a family of constraints involving linear transforms of distance
functions to a convex set or $\ell_{1,p}$ norms with $p\in \{1,2,\infty\}$. In
these cases, the projection onto the epigraph of the involved function has a
closed form expression.
  The proposed approach is validated in the context of image restoration with
missing samples, by making use of constraints based on Non-Local Total
Variation. Experiments show that our method leads to significant improvements
in term of convergence speed over existing algorithms for solving similar
constrained problems. A second application to a pulse shape design problem is
provided in order to illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach.

around a compact object has been proposed as a mechanism for low-frequency
(~0.01-70 Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the light curves of X-ray

effects of this precession to produce observable modulations in the X-ray light

binaries the precessing inner disk will quasi-periodically intercept our line
of sight to the compact object. In the case of neutron-star systems this should
have a significant observational effect, since a large fraction of the
accretion energy is released on or near the neutron-star surface. In this

calculation we explicitly sum over the Kaluza-Klein (KK) states with a new
convenient method, which is based on a combined use of zeta function and
dimensional regularization. Among the general class of models we consider we
include a supersymmetric example, 6D gauged chiral supergravity. Although much
of our discussion is more general, we treat in some detail a class of
compactifications, where the extra dimensions parametrize a rugby ball shaped
space with size stabilized by a bulk magnetic flux. The rugby ball geometry
requires two branes, which can host the Standard Model fields and carry both
tension and magnetic flux (of the bulk gauge field), the leading terms in a
derivative expansion. The brane properties have an impact on the KK spectrum
and therefore on the Casimir energy as well as on the renormalization of the
brane operators. A very interesting feature is that when the two branes carry
exactly the same amount of flux, one half of the bulk supersymmetries survives
after the compactification, even if the brane tensions are large. We also
discuss the implications of these calculations for the natural value of the
cosmological constant when the bulk has two large extra dimensions and the bulk
supersymmetry is partially preserved (or completely broken).

or not a condensate exists in the presence of interaction and a general type of
spin-orbit coupling. Here we show that interaction qualitatively changes the
ground state of bosons under Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Any infinitesimal
repulsion forces bosons either to condense at one or two momentum states or to
form a superfragmented state that is a superposition of infinite numbers of
fragmented condensates. The superfragmented state is unstable against the
anisotropy of spin-orbit coupling in systems with large numbers of particles,
leading to the revival of a condensate in current experiments.

when rescaled appropriately as $n\rightarrow\infty$, then the simple random
walks on the graph trees have the Brownian motion on the Brownian continuum
random tree as their scaling limit. Here, this result is extended to
demonstrate the existence of a diffusion scaling limit whenever the volume
measure on the limiting real tree is nonatomic, supported on the leaves of the
limiting tree, and satisfies a polynomial lower bound for the volume of balls.
Furthermore, as an application of this generalisation, it is established that
the simple random walks on a family of Galton-Watson trees with a critical
infinite variance offspring distribution, conditioned on the total number of
offspring, can be rescaled to converge to the Brownian motion on a related
$\alpha$-stable tree.

form of a flared disk develops around their hot stars. During quiescent phases,
this structure is not evident. We propose the formation of a flared neutral
disk-like structure around the rotating white dwarf (WD) in symbiotic binaries.
We applied the wind compression model and calculated the ionization boundaries
in the compressed wind from the WD using the equation of photoionization
equilibrium. During active phases, the compression of the enhanced wind from
the rotating WD can form a neutral disk-like zone at the equatorial plane,
while the remainder of the sphere above/below the disk is ionized. Calculated
hydrogen column density throughout the neutral zone and the emission measure of
the ionized fraction of the wind are consistent with those derived from
observations. During quiescent phases, the neutral disk-like structure cannot
be created because of insufficient mass loss rate. Formation of the neutral
disk-like zone at the equatorial plane is connected with the enhanced wind from
the rotating WD, observed during active phases of symbiotic binaries. This
probably represents a common origin of warm pseudophotospheres, indicated in
the spectrum of active symbiotic binaries with a high orbital inclination.

deceleration since their ejection a century ago; (3) no evidence for anisotropy

also observed at specific directions; (5) the total Halpha+[NII] flux has been
linearly decreasing at a rate of 2.6 % per year in the last decade. The Eastern

is that their size (and hence cost) scales rapidly with telescope aperture. To
try to break this relation alternative new technologies have been proposed,
such as the use of the Integrated Photonic Spectrograph (IPS). Due to their
diffraction-limited nature the IPS is claimed to defeat the harsh scaling law
applying to conventional instruments. In contrast to photonic applications,
devices for astronomy are not usually used at the diffraction limit. Therefore
to retain throughput and spatial information, the IPS requires a photonic
lantern (PL) to decompose the input multimode light into single modes. This is
then fed into either numerous Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs) or a
conventional spectrograph. We investigate the potential advantage of using an
IPS instead of conventional monolithic optics for a variety of capabilities
represented by existing instruments and others planned for Extremely Large
Telescopes. We show that a full IPS instrument is equivalent to an
image-slicer. However, the requirement to decompose the input light into
individual modes imposes a redundancy in terms of the numbers of components and
detector pixels in many cases which acts to cancel out the advantage of the
small size of the photonic components. However, there are specific applications
where an IPS gives a potential advantage which we describe. Furthermore, the
IPS approach has the potential advantage of minimising or eliminating bulk
optics. We show that AWGs fed with multiple single-mode inputs from a PL
require relatively bulky auxiliary optics and a 2-D detector array. A more
attractive option is to combine the outputs of many AWGs so that a 1-D detector
can be used to greatly reduce the number of detector pixels required and
provide efficient adaptation to the curved output focal surface.

steganographic method that functions by compressing overt (voice) data to make
space for the steganogram by means of transcoding. It offers high
steganographic bandwidth, retains good voice quality and is generally harder to
detect than other existing VoIP steganographic methods. In TranSteg, after the
steganogram reaches the receiver, the hidden information is extracted and the
speech data is practically restored to what was originally sent. This is a huge
advantage compared with other existing VoIP steganographic methods, where the
hidden data can be extracted and removed but the original data cannot be
restored because it was previously erased due to a hidden data insertion
process. In this paper we address the issue of steganalysis of TranSteg.
Various TranSteg scenarios and possibilities of warden(s) localization are
analyzed with regards to the TranSteg detection. A steganalysis method based on
MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) parameters and GMMs (Gaussian
Mixture Models) was developed and tested for various overt/covert codec pairs
in a single warden scenario with double transcoding. The proposed method
allowed for efficient detection of some codec pairs (e.g., G.711/G.729), whilst
some others remained more resistant to detection (e.g., iLBC/AMR).

different subgroups provide the same, i.e. shared or redundant, information,

information?
  Recently Williams and Beer proposed such a decomposition based on natural
properties for shared information. While these properties fix the structure of
the decomposition, they do not uniquely specify the values of the different
terms. Therefore, we investigate additional properties such as strong symmetry
and left monotonicity. We find that strong symmetry is incompatible with the
properties proposed by Williams and Beer. Although left monotonicity is a very
natural property for an information measure it is not fulfilled by any of the
proposed measures.
  We also study a geometric framework for information decompositions and ask
whether it is possible to represent shared information by a family of posterior
distributions.
  Finally, we draw connections to the notions of shared knowledge and common
knowledge in game theory. While many people believe that independent variables
cannot share information, we show that in game theory independent agents can
have shared knowledge, but not common knowledge. We conclude that intuition and
heuristic arguments do not suffice when arguing about information.

with N fixed, prove to lead to different restrictions on the target space
geometry of supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-models. We classify all possible
types of hyperkahler target spaces for the cases N=3 and N=4 by making use of
two different realizations for the most general (p,q) supersymmetric
sigma-models: (i) off-shell formulations in terms of N=3 and N=4 projective
supermultiplets; and (ii) on-shell formulations in terms of covariantly chiral
scalar superfields in (2,0) AdS superspace. Depending on the type of N=3,4 AdS
supersymmetry, nonlinear sigma-models can support one of the following target
space geometries: (i) hyperkahler cones; (ii) non-compact hyperkahler manifolds
with a U(1) isometry group which acts non-trivially on the two-sphere of
complex structures; (iii) arbitrary hyperkahler manifolds including compact
ones. The option (iii) is realized only in the case of critical (4,0) AdS
supersymmetry.
  As an application of the (4,0) AdS techniques developed, we also construct
the most general nonlinear sigma-model in Minkowski space with a non-centrally
extended N=4 Poincare supersymmetry. Its target space is a hyperkahler cone
(which is characteristic of N=4 superconformal sigma-models), but the
sigma-model is massive. The Lagrangian includes a positive potential
constructed in terms of the homothetic conformal Killing vector the target
space is endowed with. This mechanism of mass generation differs from the
standard one which corresponds to a sigma-model with the ordinary N=4 Poincare
supersymmetry and which makes use of a tri-holomorphic Killing vector.

transition in this region can be infered using the flux tube model, which is
dual to the Polyakov loop description and which offers a visual picture of what
happens during the transition. The three-point (anti)vertices of a flux tube
network lead to formation of (anti)baryons upon hadronisation. Since there is
no fundamental interaction associated with the baryon number, correlations in
the baryon number distribution at the last scattering surface directly reflect
the preceding pattern of the flux tube vertices in the QGP. An alternating
pattern of vertices and antivertices would lead to an oscillatory signal in the
two-point baryon number correlations, under the experimental conditions
prevalent in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. The strength of the

level of organisation, from molecules to the global ecological system.
According to this thesis: (a) living is information processing, in which memory
is maintained by both molecular states and ecological states as well as the
more obvious nucleic acid coding; (b) this information processing has one
overall function - to perpetuate itself; and (c) the processing method is
filtration (cognition) of, and synthesis of, information at lower levels to
appear at higher levels in complex systems (emergence). We show how information
patterns, are united by the creation of mutual context, generating persistent
consequences, to result in `functional information'. This constructive process
forms arbitrarily large complexes of information, the combined effects of which
include the functions of life. Molecules and simple organisms have already been
measured in terms of functional information content; we show how quantification
may be extended to each level of organisation up to the ecological. In terms of
a computer analogy, life is both the data and the program and its biochemical
structure is the way the information is embodied. This idea supports the
seamless integration of life at all scales with the physical universe. The
innovation reported here is essentially to integrate these ideas, basing
information on the `general definition' of information, rather than simply the
statistics of information, thereby explaining how functional information
operates throughout life.

total irradiance was termed the solar constant. It required radiometers in
space to detect the small variations in solar irradiance on timescales of the
solar rotation and the solar cycle. A part of the difficulty is that there are
no other constant natural daytime sources to which the Sun's brightness can be
compared. The discovery of solar irradiance variability rekindled a
long-running discussion on how strongly the Sun affects our climate. A
non-negligible influence is suggested by correlation studies between solar
variability and climate indicators. The mechanism for solar irradiance
variations that fits the observations best is that magnetic features at the
solar surface, i.e. sunspots, faculae and the magnetic network, are responsible
for almost all variations (although on short timescales convection and p-mode
oscillations also contribute). In spite of significant progress important
questions are still open. Thus there is a debate on how strongly irradiance
varies on timescales of centuries (i.e. how much darker the Sun was during the
Maunder minimum than it is today). It is also not clear how the solar spectrum
changes over the solar cycle. Both these questions are of fundamental
importance for working out just how strongly the Sun influences our climate.
Another interesting question is how solar irradiance variability compares with
that of other cool dwarfs, particularly now that observations from space are
available also for stars.

that the hole-like band (so-called $\gamma$ pocket) is located just below the
Fermi level from the analogy to LaFeAs(O,F) system and the disappearance of the
$\gamma$ pocket yields the suppression of the low-energy spin fluctuations. On
the other hand, in Ca$_4$(Mg,Ti)$_3$Fe$_2$As$_2$O$_{8-y}$ satisfying the
structural optimal condition for higher $T_c$ among the perovskite systems, the
extrinsic contribution, which presumably originates in the Ti moment, is
observed in $1/T_1T$; however, the moderate temperature dependence of $1/T_1T$
appears by its suppression under high magnetic field. In both systems, the high
$T_c$ of $\sim40$ K is realized in the absence of the strong development of the
low-energy spin fluctuations. The present results reveal that the structural
optimization does not induce the strong development of the low-energy spin
fluctuations. If we consider that superconductivity is mediated by spin
fluctuations, the structural optimization is conjectured to provide a benefit
to the development of the high-energy spin fluctuations irrespective to the
low-energy part.

dynamically relaxed, as reported in previous studies. We base our analysis on
new and archival spectroscopic and photometric data for 126 galaxies in the
field of Abell 1995. The study of the hot intracluster medium was performed on
X-ray archival data. Based on 87 fiducial cluster members, we have computed the
average cluster redshift <z>=0.322 and the global radial velocity dispersion
~1300 km/s. We detect two main optical subclusters separated by 1.5 arcmin that
cause the known NE-SW elongation of the galaxy distribution and a significant
velocity gradient in the same direction. As for the X-ray analysis, we confirm
that the intracluster medium is mildly elongated, but we also detect three
X-ray peaks. Two X-ray peaks are offset with respect to the two galaxy peaks
and lie between them, thus suggesting a bimodal merger caught in a phase of
post core-core passage. The third X-ray peak lies between the NE galaxy peak
and a third, minor galaxy peak suggesting a more complex merger. Simple
analytical arguments suggest a merging scenario for Abell 1995, where two main
subsystems are seen just after the collision with an intermediate projection
angle. The high mass of Abell 1995 and the evidence of merging suggest it is
not atypical among clusters with known radio halos. Interestingly, our findings
reinforce the previous evidence for the peculiar dichotomy between the dark
matter and galaxy distributions observed in this cluster.

done by increasing the cascaded quadratic nonlinearity in the new section with
an engineered reduced residual phase mismatch. The low soliton orders in each

  It is essentially shown that for the Cauchy problem and the
initial-boundary-value one of the three-dimensional compressible MHD flows with
initial density allowed to vanish, the strong or smooth solution exists
globally if the density is bounded from above and the velocity satisfies the
Serrin's condition. Therefore, if the Serrin norm of the velocity remains
bounded, it is not possible for other kinds of singularities (such as vacuum
states vanish or vacuum appears in the non-vacuum region or even milder
singularities) to form before the density becomes unbounded. This criterion is
analogous to the well-known Serrin's blowup criterion for the three-dimensional
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, in particular, it is independent of the
temperature and magnetic field and is just the same as that of the barotropic
compressible Navier-Stokes equations.
  As a direct application, it is shown that the same result also holds for the
strong or smooth solutions to the three-dimensional full compressible
Navier-Stokes system describing the motion of a viscous, compressible, and heat

Planets (WASP) planet host stars using high signal-to-noise (S/N) HARPS
spectra. Our line list was carefully selected from the spectra of the Sun and
Procyon, and we made a critical evaluation of the atomic data. The spectral
lines were measured using equivalent widths. The procedures were tested on the
Sun and Procyon prior to be being used on the WASP stars. The effective
temperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity and metallicity were
determined for all the stars. We show that abundances derived from high S/N
spectra are likely to be higher than those obtained from low S/N spectra, as
noise can cause the equivalent width to be underestimated. We also show that
there is a limit to the accuracy of stellar parameters that can be achieved,
despite using high S/N spectra, and the average uncertainty in effective
temperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity and metallicity is 83 K,
0.11 dex, 0.11 km/s and 0.10 dex respectively.

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1210.0490",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A Physical layer Network Coding (PNC) scheme is proposed for the $K$-user
wireless Multiple Access Relay Channel (MARC), in which $K$ source nodes
transmit their messages to the destination node $D$ with the help of a relay
node $R.$ The proposed PNC scheme involves two transmission phases: (i) Phase 1
during which the source nodes transmit, the relay node and the destination node
receive and (ii) Phase 2 during which the source nodes and the relay node
transmit, and the destination node receives. At the end of Phase 1, the relay
node decodes the messages of the source nodes and during Phase 2 transmits a
many-to-one function of the decoded messages. Wireless networks in which the
relay node decodes, suffer from loss of diversity order if the decoder at the
destination is not chosen properly. A novel decoder is proposed for the PNC
scheme, which offers the maximum possible diversity order of $2,$ for a proper
choice of certain parameters and the network coding map. Specifically, the
network coding map used at the relay is chosen to be a $K$-dimensional Latin
Hypercube, in order to ensure the maximum diversity order of $2.$ Also, it is
shown that the proposed decoder can be implemented by a fast decoding
algorithm. Simulation results presented for the 3-user MARC show that the
proposed scheme offers a large gain over the existing scheme for the $K$-user
MARC.

Abelian gauge fields, we are able to solve the Bianchi identity and
supersymmetry conditions to this order. The four-dimensional external
space-time consists of a domain wall solution with moduli fields varying along
the transverse direction. We find that the inclusion of \alpha' corrections
improves the moduli stabilization features of this solution. In this case, one
of the dilaton and the volume modulus asymptotes to a constant value away from
the domain wall. It is further shown that the inclusion of non-perturbative
effects can stabilize the remaining modulus and ""lift"" the domain wall to an
AdS vacuum. The coset SU(3)/U(1)^2 is used as an explicit example to
demonstrate the validity of this AdS vacuum. Our results show that heterotic
nearly K\""ahler compactifications can lead to maximally symmetric
four-dimensional space-times at the non-perturbative level.

evidence of internal inhomogeneity in the local density of states has been
observed with high spatial resolution, and this inhomogeneity appears to be due
to localized metallic behavior. These results facilitate magneto-metric studies

molecular gas of the most luminous of these galaxies with turbulence and/or
large cosmic ray (CR) energy densities U_{CR} rather than far-UV/optical
photons from star-forming sites as the dominant heating sources. Especially in
ULIRGs (L_{IR}>10^{12} L_{\odot}) the Photon Dominated Regions (PDRs) can
encompass at most \sim few% of their molecular gas mass while the large U_{CR}
and the strong turbulence in these merger/starbursts, can volumetrically heat
much of their molecular gas to T_{kin}\sim(100-200)K, unhindered by the high
dust extinctions. Moreover the strong supersonic turbulence in ULIRGs relocates
much of their molecular gas at much higher average densities than in isolated
spirals. This renders low-J CO lines incapable of constraining the properties
of the bulk of the molecular gas in ULIRGs, with substantial and systematic
underestimates of its mass possible when only such lines are used. A

optical frequency standard based on atomic ensembles trapped in an optical
lattice potential inside an optical resonator. Using atoms with a narrow
linewidth transition and population inversion together with a ""bad"" cavity
allows to the realize the superradiant photon emission regime. These schemes
reduce the influence of mechanical or thermal vibrations of the cavity mirrors
on the emitted optical frequency, overcoming current limitation in passive
optical standards. The coherence time of the emitted light is ultimately
limited by the lifetime of the atoms in the optical lattice potential.
Therefore these schemes would produce one light pulse per atomic ensemble
without a phase relation between pulses. Here we study how phase coherence
between pulses can be maintained by using several inverted atomic ensenbles,
introduced into the cavity sequentially by means of a transport mechanism. We
simulate the light emission process using the Heisenberg-Langevin approach and
study the frequency noise of the intracavity field.

class of swarm intelligence based algorithms that mimics the foraging behavior
of honey bees. ABC consists of three groups of bees namely employed, onlooker
and scout bees. In ABC, the food locations represent the potential candidate
solution. In the present study an attempt is made to generate the population of
food sources (Colony Size) adaptively and the variant is named as A-ABC. A-ABC
is further enhanced to improve convergence speed and exploitation capability,
by employing the concept of elitism, which guides the bees towards the best
food source. This enhanced variant is called E-ABC. The proposed algorithms are
validated on a set of standard benchmark problems with varying dimensions taken
from literature and on five engineering design problems. The numerical results
are compared with the basic ABC and three recent variant of ABC. Numerically
and statistically simulated results illustrate that the proposed method is very
efficient and competitive.
