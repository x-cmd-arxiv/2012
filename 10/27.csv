quality factors of various two-dimensional, periodic and aperiodic, dielectric
photonic crystals by using the finite element method (FEM) are reported. The
fundamental equations governing the propagation of electromagnetic waves in
inhomogeneous media are revisited together with the boundary conditions
required for each of the performed calculations. A detailed account of the
eigenvalue and harmonic propagation analysis of the electromagnetic problem is
reported for several periodic and finite-length structures. It is found that
this method reproduces quite well previous results for these lattices obtained
with the standard plane wave method with regards to the eigenvalue analysis
(photonic band structure calculations). However, in contrast with frequency
methods, the finite element method easily allows one to study the time-harmonic
propagation of electromagnetic fields and, thus, to calculate the transmission
coefficient of finite clusters in a natural way. Moreover, the advantages of
using this real space method for structures of arbitrary complexity are also
discussed. In addition, point defect cluster quality factor calculations are
reported by means of FEM and they are compared to the ones obtained with the
FDTD and \texttt{Harminv} methods. As a result, FEM comes out as an effective,
stable, robust, and rigorous tool to study light propagation and confinement in
both periodic and aperiodic dielectric photonic crystals.

It quickly splits into two parts with vortex motions rolling up the poloidal
magnetic field. (2) Owing to the physical mechanism similar to that of the
magneto-rotational instability, the rolled-up poloidal field is bent and
amplified. (3) The magnetic tension of the disturbed poloidal magnetic field
re- duces the vorticity, and the lifting force caused by vortical motion
decreases. (4) The flux tube gets twisted and begins to rise again without
splitting. Investigation of these processes is significant because it shows
that a flux tube without any initial twist can rise to the surface in
relatively weak poloidal fields.

variations, using maps of the o-H2O 1_{10}-1_{01} and 2_{12}-1_{01} transitions
taken with the Herschel-HIFI and PACS instruments, respectively. Water emission
appears clumpy, with individual peaks corresponding to shock spots along the
outflow. The bulk of the 557 GHz line is confined to radial velocities in the
range \pm 10-50 km/s but extended emission associated with the L1448-C extreme
high velocity (EHV) jet is also detected. The H2O 1_{10}-1_{01}/CO(3-2) ratio
shows strong variations as a function of velocity that likely reflect different
and changing physical conditions in the gas responsible for the emissions from
the two species. In the EHV jet, a low H2O/SiO abundance ratio is inferred,
that could indicate molecular formation from dust free gas directly ejected
from the proto-stellar wind. We derive averaged Tkin and n(H2) values of about
300-500 K and 5 10^6 cm-3 respectively, while a water abundance with respect to
H2 of the order of 0.5-1 10^{-6} along the outflow is estimated. The fairly
constant conditions found all along the outflow implies that evolutionary
effects on the timescales of outflow propagation do not play a major role in
the H2O chemistry. The results of our analysis show that the bulk of the
observed H2O lines comes from post-shocked regions where the gas, after being
heated to high temperatures, has been already cooled down to a few hundred K.
The relatively low derived abundances, however, call for some mechanism to
diminish the H2O gas in the post-shock region. Among the possible scenarios, we
favor H2O photodissociation, which requires the superposition of a low velocity
non-dissociative shock with a fast dissociative shock able to produce a FUV
field of sufficient strength.

us to probe the formation and evolution of X-ray binaries on very long
timescales. In this paper, we present results from large-scale population
synthesis models of binary populations in galaxies from z = 0 to 20. We use as
input into our modeling the Millennium II Cosmological Simulation and the
updated semi-analytic galaxy catalog by Guo et al. (2011) to self-consistently
account for the star formation history (SFH) and metallicity evolution of each
galaxy. We run a grid of 192 models, varying all the parameters known from
previous studies to affect the evolution of XRBs. We use our models and
observationally derived prescriptions for hot gas emission to create
theoretical galaxy X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for several redshift bins.
Models with low CE efficiencies, a 50% twins mass ratio distribution, a steeper
IMF exponent, and high stellar wind mass loss rates best match observational
results from Tzanavaris & Georgantopoulos (2008), though they significantly
underproduce bright early-type and very bright (Lx > 10d41) late-type galaxies.
These discrepancies are likely caused by uncertainties in hot gas emission and
SFHs, AGN contamination, and a lack of dynamically formed Low-mass XRBs. In our
highest likelihood models, we find that hot gas emission dominates the emission
for most bright galaxies. We also find that the evolution of the normal galaxy
X-ray luminosity density out to z = 4 is driven largely by XRBs in galaxies
with X-ray luminosities between 10d40 and 10d41 erg/s.

these new generation cosmological surveys? For instance, can we estimate
stellar age and metallicity distributions? Can we separate star-forming
galaxies from AGN? Can we measure emission lines, nebular abundances and
extinction? With what precision?
  To accomplish this, we selected a sample of about 300k galaxies with good S/N
from the SDSS and divided them in two groups: 200k objects and a template
library of 100k. We corrected the spectra to $z = 0$ and converted them to
filter fluxes. Using a statistical approach, we calculated a Probability

Since we have the properties of all the data from the {\sc starlight}-SDSS

PDF (mean, median, etc).
  Our results shows that we retrieve the weighted average of the log of the

6000 stations, with 3427 long-term stations deemed to have sufficient sampling
and quality for climate applications requiring sub-daily resolution. As with
other surface datasets, coverage is heavily skewed towards Northern Hemisphere
mid-latitudes.
  The dataset is constructed from a large pre-existing ASCII flatfile data bank
that represents over a decade of substantial effort at data retrieval,
reformatting and provision. These raw data have had varying levels of quality
control applied to them by individual data providers. The work proceeded in
several steps: merging stations with multiple reporting identifiers;
reformatting to netCDF; quality control; and then filtering to form a final
dataset. Particular attention has been paid to maintaining true extreme values
where possible within an automated, objective process. Detailed validation has
been performed on a subset of global stations and also on UK data using known
extreme events to help finalise the QC tests. Further validation was performed
on a selection of extreme events world-wide (Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the
cold snap in Alaska in 1989 and heat waves in SE Australia in 2009). Although
the filtering has removed the poorest station records, no attempt has been made
to homogenise the data thus far. Hence non-climatic, time-varying errors may
still exist in many of the individual station records and care is needed in
inferring long-term trends from these data.
  A version-control system has been constructed for this dataset to allow for
the clear documentation of any updates and corrections in the future.

Specifically, a slit collimator in front of an x-ray tube is used to shape
x-rays into a fan-beam to illuminate a planar section of an object. Then,
relevant elements such as gold nanoparticles on the fan-beam plane are excited
to generate x-ray fluorescence signals. One or more 2D spectral detectors are
placed to face the fan-beam plane and directly measure x-ray fluorescence data.
Detector elements are so collimated that each element only sees a unique area
element on the fan-beam plane and records the x-ray fluorescence signal
accordingly. The measured 2D x-ray fluorescence data can be refined in
reference to the attenuation characteristics of the object and the divergence
of the beam for accurate elemental mapping. This x-ray fluorescence sectioning
system promises fast fluorescence tomographic imaging without a complex inverse
procedure. The design can be adapted in various ways, such as with the use of a
larger detector size to improve the signal to noise ratio. In this case, the
detector(s) can be shifted multiple times for image deblurring.

collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV using three event
generators, {\it viz.}, UrQMD, HIJING, and THERMINATOR-2. The effect of
centrality selection, resonance production, as well as contributions from
particle species to the net-charge moments and their products have been

calculated using a synthetic model. The goal is to infer typical progenitor
masses and compositions by reproducing the typical chemical composition and
central star masses of planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Galactic bulge. The AGB
tip luminosity and the observation that the observed lack of bright carbon
stars in the bulge are matched by the models.
  Five sets of galactic bulge PNe were analyzed to find typical abundances and
central star of planetary nebulae (CSPN) masses. These global parameters were
matched by the AGB models. These sets are shown to be consistent with the most
massive CSPN having the largest abundances of helium and heavy elements. The
CSPN masses of the most helium rich (He/H$\ga$0.130 or $Y\ga0.34$) PNe are
estimated to be between 0.58 and 0.62$ {\rm M}_{\sun}$. The oxygen abundance in
form $\log{\rm (O/H)}+12$ of these highest mass CSPN is estimated to be
$\approx$8.85.
  TP-AGB models with ZAMS masses between 1.2 and 1.8$ {\rm M}_{\sun}$ with
$Y_{\rm ZAMS}\approx0.31-0.33$ and $Z_{\rm ZAMS}\approx0.19-0.22$ fit the
typical global parameters, mass, and abundances of the highest mass CSPN. The
inferred ZAMS helium abundance of the most metal enriched stars implies
$dY/dZ\sim4$ for the Galactic bulge. These models produce no bright carbon
stars in agreement with observations of the bulge. These models produce an AGB
tip luminosity for the bulge in agreement with the observations. These models
suggest the youngest main sequence stars in the Galactic bulge have enhanced
helium abundance ($Y\approx0.32$) on the main sequence and their ages are
between 2 and 4 Gyrs.

different asset sectors. This paper aims to address the following questions:
  1. Is there statistical evidence that heavy-tailed sub-exponential volume
profiles occur at different levels of the Limit Order Book on the bid and ask
and if so does this happen on intra or interday time scales ?
  2.In futures exchanges, are heavy tail features exchange (CBOT, CME, EUREX,
SGX and COMEX) or asset class (government bonds, equities and precious metals)
dependent and do they happen on ultra-high (<1sec) or mid-range (1sec -10min)

  3.Does the presence of stochastic heavy-tailed volume profile features evolve
in a manner that would inform or be indicative of market participant behaviors,
such as high frequency algorithmic trading, quote stuffing and price discovery

  4. Is there statistical evidence for a need to consider dynamic behavior of

results to verify the empirical findings for an unprecedentedly large set of

  previous version",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we introduce three Markovian couplings of Brownian motions on
smooth Riemannian manifolds without boundary which sit at the crossroad of two
concepts. The first concept is the one of shy coupling put forward in
\cite{Burdzy-Benjamini} and the second concept is the lower bound on the Ricci
curvature and the connection with couplings made in \cite{ReSt}.
  The first construction is the shy coupling, the second one is a
fixed-distance coupling and the third is a coupling in which the distance
between the processes is a deterministic exponential function of time.
  The result proved here is that an arbitrary Riemannian manifold satisfying
some technical conditions supports shy couplings. If in addition, the Ricci
curvature is non-negative, there exist fixed-distance couplings. Furthermore,
if the Ricci curvature is bounded below by a positive constant, then there
exists a coupling of Brownian motions for which the distance between the
processes is a decreasing exponential function of time. The constructions use
the intrinsic geometry, and relies on an extension of the notion of frames
which plays an important role for even dimensional manifolds.
  In fact, we provide a wider class of couplings in which the distance function
is deterministic in Theorem \ref{t:100} and Corollary~\ref{Cor:9}.
  As an application of the fixed-distance coupling we derive a maximum
principle for the gradient of harmonic functions on manifolds with non-negative
Ricci curvature.
  As far as we are aware of, these constructions are new, though the existence
of shy couplings on manifolds is suggested by Kendall in \cite{Kendall}.

  We first elaborate the precise definition of the model with its associated

results given a fixed set of parameters. Then we statistically derive parameter
estimation schemes of the model using maximum likelihood and least
mean-square-errors estimation methods under certain criteria such as AIC to

upon previous measurements using the SPT by tripling the sky area. We report
CMB temperature anisotropy power over the multipole range $650<\ell<3000$. We
fit the SPT bandpowers, combined with the seven-year Wilkinson Microwave

find that the two datasets are consistent and well fit by the model. Adding SPT
measurements significantly improves LCDM parameter constraints; in particular,
the constraint on $\theta_s$ tightens by a factor of 2.7. The impact of
gravitational lensing is detected at $8.1\, \sigma$, the most significant
detection to date. This sensitivity of the SPT+WMAP7 data to lensing by
large-scale structure at low redshifts allows us to constrain the mean
curvature of the observable universe with CMB data alone to be
$\Omega_k=-0.003^{+0.014}_{-0.018}$. Using the SPT+WMAP7 data, we measure the
spectral index of scalar fluctuations to be $n_s=0.9623 \pm 0.0097$ in the LCDM

The SPT measurement of the CMB damping tail helps break the degeneracy that

systems is studied. The self-consistent solutions of a static version of the
system are obtained by using the tau function approach. The self-consistent
solutions appear as an infinite number of topological sectors labeled by $n \in
\IZ_{+}$, such that in each sector the scalar field would evolve continuously
from a trivial configuration to the one with half integer topological charge.
The spinor bound states are found analytically for each topological
configuration of the background scalar field. The bound state energy satisfies
an algebraic equation of degree $2n$, so the study of the energy spectrum finds
a connection to the realm of algebraic geometry. We provide explicit
computations for the topological sectors $n=1,2$. Then, by monitoring the
energy spectrum, including the energy flow of any level across $E_n=0$, we
discuss the vacuum polarization induced by the soliton. It is shown that the
equivalence between the Noether and topological currents and the fact that the
coupling constant is related to the one of the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten
(WZNW) model imply the quantization of the spinor and topological charges.
Moreover, we show that the soliton mass as a function of the boson mass agrees
with the Skyrmes's phenomenological conjecture. Our analytical developments
improve and generalize the recent numerical results in the literature performed
for a closely related model by Shahkarami and Gousheh, JHEP06(2011)116. The
construction of the bound states corresponding to the topological sectors $n
\geq 3$ is briefly outlined.

dispersions, with a median of sigma=301 km s^{-1}. This high value is
consistent with their relatively high stellar masses and compact sizes. We
study their stellar populations using the strength of Balmer absorption lines,
which are not sensitive to dust absorption. We find a large range in Balmer
absorption strength, with many galaxies showing very strong lines indicating
young ages. The median Hdelta_A equivalent width, determined directly or
inferred from the H10 line, is 5.4 Angstroms, indicating a luminosity-weighted
age of ~1 Gyr. Although this value may be biased towards higher values because
of selection effects,high-dispersion galaxies with such young ages are
extremely rare in the local Universe. Interestingly we do not find a simple
correlation with rest-frame U-V color: some of the reddest galaxies have very
strong Balmer absorption lines. These results demonstrate that many
high-dispersion galaxies at z~1.5 were quenched recently. This implies that

February and 2011 October, which encompasses 715 observations with a total

bright X-ray flares observed from Sgr A*. One of the Swift-detected flares may
have been softer than the other five, which would indicate that flares of
similar intensity can have different spectral properties. The Swift campaign
allows us to constrain the occurrence rate of bright (Lx > 1E35 erg/s) X-ray
flares to be ~0.1-0.2 per day, which is in line with previous estimates. This
analysis of the occurrence rate and properties of the X-ray flares seen with

sources detected by upcoming networks of advanced ground-based interferometers
will be challenging due in part to the large number of unrelated astrophysical
transients within the ~10-100 square degree sky localizations. A potential way
to greatly reduce the number of such false positives is to limit detailed
follow-up to only those candidates near galaxies within the GW sensitivity
range of ~200 Mpc for binary neutron star mergers. Such a strategy is currently
hindered by the fact that galaxy catalogs are grossly incomplete within this
volume. Here we compare two methods for completing the local galaxy catalog:
(1) a narrow-band H-alpha imaging survey; and (2) an HI emission line radio
survey. Using H-alpha fluxes, stellar masses (M_star), and star formation rates
(SFR) from galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), combined with HI
data from the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey and the Herschel Reference Survey, we
estimate that a H-alpha survey with a luminosity sensitivity of L_H-alpha =
1e40 erg/s at 200 Mpc could achieve a completeness of f_SFR ~ 75% with respect
to total SFR, but only f_Mstar ~ 33% with respect to stellar mass (due to lack
of sensitivity to early-type galaxies). These numbers are significantly lower
than those achieved by an idealized spectroscopic survey due to the loss of
H-alpha flux resulting from resolving out nearby galaxies and the inability to
correct for the underlying stellar continuum. An HI survey with sensitivity
similar to the proposed WALLABY survey on ASKAP could achieve f_SFR ~ 80% and
f_Mstar ~ 50%, somewhat higher than that of the H-alpha survey. Finally, both
H-alpha and HI surveys should achieve > 50% completeness with respect to the
host galaxies of short duration gamma-ray bursts, which may trace the
population of binary neutron star mergers.

in some cases producing super-luminous or otherwise peculiar supernovae. We use
spherically symmetric hydrodynamical models to estimate the accretion rate at
late times for a range of progenitor masses and radii and explosion energies.
The accretion rate onto the proto-neutron star or black hole decreases as Mdot
~ t^-5/3 at late times, but its normalization can be significantly enhanced at
low explosion energies, in very massive stars, or if a strong reverse shock
wave forms at the helium/hydrogen interface in the progenitor. If the resulting
super-Eddington accretion drives an outflow which thermalizes in the outgoing
ejecta, the supernova debris will be re-energized at a time when photons can
diffuse out efficiently. The resulting light curves are different and more
diverse than previous fallback supernova models which ignored the input of
accretion power and produced short-lived, dim transients. The possible outcomes
when fallback accretion power is significant include super-luminous (> 10^44
ergs / s) Type II events of both short and long durations, as well as luminous
Type I events from compact stars that may have experienced significant mass
loss. Accretion power may unbind the remaining infalling material, causing a
sudden decrease in the brightness of some long duration Type II events. This

vacuum state. First, we study a free massive scalar field. Then, we consider a
strongly coupled field theory with a gravity dual, computing the entanglement
using the gravity solution. In even dimensions, the interesting piece of the
entanglement entropy is proportional to the number of e-foldings that elapsed
since the spherical region was inside the horizon. In odd dimensions it is
contained in a certain finite piece. In both cases the entanglement captures
the long range correlations produced by the expansion.

oxygen temperature with regards to the electron temperature. In addition, we
search for synchrotron emission in the northwestern thermal rim. Methods: This
study is part of a dedicated deep observational project of SN 1006 using
XMM-Newton, which provides us with currently the best resolution spectra of the
bright northwestern oxygen knot. We aim to use the reflection grating
spectrometer to measure the thermal broadening of the O vii line triplet by
convolving the emission profile of the remnant with the response matrix.
Results: The line broadening was measured to be {\sigma}_e = 2.4 \pm 0.3 eV,
corresponding to an oxygen temperature of 275$^{+72}_{-63}$ keV. From the EPIC
spectra we obtain an electron temperature of 1.35 \pm 0.10 keV. The difference
in temperature between the species provides further evidence of
non-equilibration of temperatures in a shock. In addition, we find evidence for
a bow shock that emits X-ray synchrotron radiation, which is at odds with the
general idea that due to the magnetic field orientation only in the NE and SW
region X-ray synchrotron radiation should be emitted. We find an unusual
H{\alpha} and X-ray synchrotron geometry, in that the H{\alpha} emission peaks
downstream of the synchrotron emission. This may be an indication for a
peculiar H{\alpha} shock, in which the density is lower and neutral fraction
are higher than in other supernova remnants, resulting in a peak in H{\alpha}
emission further downstream of the shock.

Here we study its remarkable spectral properties and their evolution using two
spectral models: (i) a single emission component scenario, where the spectrum
is modeled by the empirical Band function, and (ii) a two component scenario,
where thermal (Planck-like) emission is observed simultaneously with a
non-thermal component (a Band function). We find that the latter model fits the
integrated burst spectrum significantly better than the former, and that their
respective spectral parameters are dramatically different: when fit with a Band
function only, the Epeak of the event is unusually soft for a short GRB, while
adding a thermal component leads to more typical short GRB values. Our
time-resolved spectral analysis produces similar results. We argue here that
the two-component model is the preferred interpretation for GRB 120323A, based
on: (i) the values and evolution of the Band function parameters of the two
component scenario, which are more typical for a short GRB, and (ii) the
appearance in the data of a significant hardness-intensity correlation,
commonly found in GRBs, when we employee two-component model fits; the
correlation is non-existent in the Band-only fits. GRB 110721A, a long burst
with an intense photospheric emission, exhibits the exact same behavior. We
conclude that GRB 120323A has a strong photospheric emission contribution,
first time observed in a short GRB. Magnetic dissipation models are difficult
to reconcile with these results, which instead favor photospheric thermal
emission and fast cooling synchrotron radiation from internal shocks. Finally,
we derive a possibly universal hardness-luminosity relation in the source frame
using a larger set of GRBs L,i=(1.59+/-0.84).10^50 (Epeak,i)^(1.33+/-0.07)

constant black hole mass. The M-sigma relationship for the highest-mass (log M

appears to evolve significantly, however most or all of this apparent evolution
can be accounted for by various observational biases due to intrinsic scatter
in the relationship and to uncertainties in observed quantities. The M-sigma
relationship for black holes in the middle mass range (7.5 < log M < 9 solar

of +/- 0.2 dex on any evolution in the M-sigma relationship for quasars out to

feasible at the stationary regime of the process and involves the calculation
of suitable observables in path space for the Relative Entropy Rate and the
corresponding Fisher Information Matrix. The stationary regime is crucial for
stochastic dynamics and here allows us to address the sensitivity analysis of
complex systems, including examples of processes with complex landscapes that
exhibit metastability, non-reversible systems from a statistical mechanics
perspective, and high-dimensional, spatially distributed models. All these
systems exhibit, typically non-gaussian stationary probability distributions,
while in the case of high-dimensionality, histograms are impossible to
construct directly. Our proposed methods bypass these challenges relying on the
direct Monte Carlo simulation of rigorously derived observables for the
Relative Entropy Rate and Fisher Information in path space rather than on the
stationary probability distribution itself. We demonstrate the capabilities of
the proposed methodology by focusing here on two classes of problems: (a)
Langevin particle systems with either reversible (gradient) or non-reversible
(non-gradient) forcing, highlighting the ability of the method to carry out
sensitivity analysis in non-equilibrium systems; and, (b) spatially extended
Kinetic Monte Carlo models, showing that the method can handle high-dimensional

detecting new physics through precision tests of the Standard Model grows more
exciting. Precise experimental and theoretical inputs are required to test the
unitarity of the CKM matrix and to search for new physics effects in rare
decays. Lattice QCD calculations of nonperturbative inputs have reached a
precision at the level of a few percent; in many cases aided by the use of
lattice perturbation theory. This review examines the role of lattice
perturbation theory in B physics calculations on the lattice in the context of
two questions: how is lattice perturbation theory used in the different heavy
quark formalisms implemented by the major lattice collaborations? And what role
does lattice perturbation theory play in determinations of nonperturbative
contributions to the physical processes at the heart of the search for new
physics? Framing and addressing these questions reveals that lattice
perturbation theory is a tool with a spectrum of applications in lattice B
physics.

Interpreting the modulation of stellar light that is caused by star-spots on
the time scale of the rotational period depends on knowing the fundamental
stellar parameters. Constraints on the angular momentum distribution can be
extracted from the true stellar rotational period. By using models with an
internal angular momentum distribution and comparing these with measurements of
rotation periods of subgiant stars we investigate the agreement between
theoretical predictions and observational results. With this comparison we can
also reduce the global stellar parameter space compatible with the rotational
period measurements from subgiant light curves. We can prove that an evolution
assuming solid body rotation is incompatible with the direct measurement of the
rotational periods of subgiant stars. Measuring the rotation periods relies on
two different periodogram procedures, the Lomb-Scargle algorithm and the
Plavchan periodogram. Angular momentum evolution models were computed to give
us the expected rotation periods for subgiants, which we compared with measured
rotational periods. We find evidence of a sinusoidal signal that is compatible
in terms of both phase and amplitude with rotational modulation. Rotation
periods were directly measured from light curves for 30 subgiant stars and
indicate a range of 30 to 100 d for their rotational periods. Our models
reproduce the rotational periods obtained from CoRoT light curves. These new
measurements of rotation periods and stellar models probe the non-rigid
rotation of subgiant stars.

constraining power of the cluster number counts and clustering properties to
forecast limits on the $\fnl$ parameter. The primordial non-Gaussianity effects
on the mass function and halo bias are considered. We adopt self-calibration
for the mass-observable scaling relation, and evaluate constraints for the SPT,
Planck, CCAT--like, SPTPol and ACTPol surveys. We show that the
scale-dependence of halo bias induced by the local NG provides strong
constraints on $\fnl$, while the results from number count are two orders of
magnitude worse. When combining information from number counts and power
spectrum, the \planck\ cluster catalog provides the tightest constraint with
$\sigma_{\fnl}=7$ (68% C.L.) even for relatively conservative assumptions on
the expected cluster yields and systematics. This value is a factor of 2
smaller than the $1\sigma$ error as measured by WMAP CMB measurements, and
comparable to what expected from Planck. We find that the results are mildly
sensitive to the mass threshold of the surveys, but strongly depend on the
survey coverage: a full-sky survey like Planck is more favorable because it can
probe longer wavelengths modes which are most sensitive to NG effects. In
addition, the constraints are largely insensitive to priors on nuisance
parameters as they are mainly driven by the power spectrum probe which has a
mild dependence on the mass-observable relations.

structural components of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using differential
emission measure (DEM) analysis. The DEM analysis is based on the six-passband
EUV observations of solar corona from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard
the \emph{Solar Dynamic Observatory}. The structural components studied include
the hot channel in the core region (presumably the magnetic flux rope of the
CME), the bright loop-like leading front (LF), and coronal dimming in the wake
of the CME. We find that the presumed flux rope has the highest average
temperature ($>$8 MK) and density ($\sim$1.0 $\times10^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$),
resulting in an enhanced emission measure (EM) over a broad temperature range
(3 $\leq$ T(MK) $\leq$ 20). On the other hand, the CME LF has a relatively cool
temperature ($\sim$2 MK) and a narrow temperature distribution similar to the
pre-eruption coronal temperature (1 $\leq$ T(MK) $\leq$ 3). The density in the
LF, however, is increased by 2% to 32% compared with that of the pre-eruption
corona, depending on the event and location. In coronal dimmings, the
temperature is more broadly distributed (1 $\leq$ T(MK) $\leq$ 4), but the
density decreases by $\sim$35% to $\sim$40%. These observational results show
that: (1) CME core regions are significantly heated, presumably through
magnetic reconnection, (2) CME LFs are a consequence of compression of ambient
plasma caused by the expansion of the CME core region, and (3) the dimmings are
largely caused by the plasma rarefaction associated with the eruption.

release in a suspension fiber, which I call a 'creep event', would excite
motion of the test mass that would be coupled to the interferometer's readout.
The random test-mass motion due to a time-sequence of creep events is referred
to as 'creep noise'. In this paper I present an elasto-dynamic calculation for
the test-mass motion due to a creep event. I show that within a simple
suspension model, the main coupling to the optical readout occurs via a
combination of a ""dc"" horizontal displacement of the test mass, and excitation
of the violin and pendulum modes, and not, as was thought previously, via
lengthening of the fiber. When the creep events occur sufficiently frequently
and their statistics is time-independent, the creep noise can be
well-approximated by a stationary Gaussian random process. I derive the
functional form of the creep noise spectral density in this limit, with the

matter distribution is a key requirement for future weak lensing experiments.
Recent studies using hydrodynamic simulations have shown that different
baryonic feedback scenarios lead to significantly different two-point shear
statistics. In this paper we extend earlier work to three-point shear
statistics. We show that, relative to the predictions of dark matter only
models, the amplitude of the signal can be reduced by as much as 30-40% on
scales of a few arcminutes. We find that baryonic feedback may affect two- and
three-point shear statistics differently and demonstrate that this can be used
to assess the fidelity of various feedback models. In particular, upcoming
surveys such as Euclid might be able to discriminate between different feedback
models by measuring both second- and third-order statistics. Because it will
likely remain impossible to predict baryonic feedback with high accuracy from
first principles, we argue in favour of phenomenological models that can
capture the relevant effects of baryonic feedback processes in addition to
changes in cosmology. We construct such a model by modifying the dark
matter-only halo model to characterise the generic effects of energetic
feedback using a small number of parameters. We use this model to perform a
likelihood analysis in a simplified case in which two- and three-point shear
statistics are measured between 0.5 and 20 arcmin and in which the amplitude of
fluctuations, sigma8, the matter density parameter, Om, and the dark energy
parameter, w0, are the only unknown free parameters. We demonstrate that for
weak lensing surveys such as Euclid, marginalising over the feedbac parameters
describing the effects of baryonic processes, such as outflows driven by
feedback from star formation and AGN, may be able to mitigate the bias
affecting Om, sigma8 and w0.

functions arises because of the presence of soft modes and we derive an

at the Gaussian level we obtain many physical quantities: the correlation
length, the exponent parameter that controls the Mode-Coupling dynamical
exponents for the two-point correlation functions, and the prefactor of the
critical part of the four point correlation functions. Moreover we perform a
one-loop computation in order to identify the region in which the mean field
Gaussian approximation is valid. The result is a Ginzburg criterion for the
glass transition. We define and compute in this way a proper Ginzburg number.
Finally, we present numerical values of all these quantities obtained from the

al, Nature Physics 2012], we show that any combination of local common causes
and direct causes satisfying this principle, i.e. propagating at any finite
speed, leads to signalling. This is true even if the common and direct causes
are allowed to propagate at a supraluminal-but-finite speed defined in a
Newtonian-like privileged universal reference frame. Consequently, either there
is supraluminal communication or the conclusion that Nature is nonlocal (i.e.
discontinuous) is unavoidable.

formal systems such as Peano arithmetic. Natural, albeit quite surprising,
topological interpretation of provability logic has been found in the 1970's by
Harold Simmons and Leo Esakia. They have observed that the dual $\Diamond$
modality, corresponding to consistency in the context of formal arithmetic, has
all the basic properties of the topological derivative operator acting on a
scattered space. The topic has become a long-term project for the Georgian
school of logic led by Esakia, with occasional contributions from elsewhere.
  More recently, a new impetus came from the study of polymodal provability
logic GLP that was known to be Kripke incomplete and, in general, to have a
more complicated behavior than its unimodal counterpart. Topological semantics
provided a better alternative to Kripke models in the sense that GLP was shown
to be topologically complete. At the same time, new fascinating connections
with set theory and large cardinals have emerged.
  We give a survey of the results on topological semantics of provability logic
starting from first contributions by Esakia. However, a special emphasis is put

also included a few results that have not been published so far, most notably

has mildly non-circular (NC) beam would, nevertheless, exhibit SI violation.
Further, we show that appropriate observable measures constructed within the
Bipolar spherical harmonic (BipoSH) representation of SI violation capture
subtle NC-beam effects coupled with the scan strategy of the instrument.
  Accompanying their latest 7-year data release, the WMAP team published very
high significance measurements of non-zero BipoSH spectra, A^{20}_{l l} and
A^{20}_{l-2 l}, in the ""W"" and ""V"" band of the experiment. We present a strong
case that the BipoSH measurement are primarily explained by the quadrupolar
(m=2) component of the NC-beams, b_{l2}, of the respective channels. The fact
that subtle levels of non-circularity, e.g., WMAP beams |b_{l2}|/b_{l0} < 0.01,
lead to measurable BipoSH spectra points to the immense promise and potential
of the BipoSH representation. The key result of this work is that using BipoSH
measurements it is possible to estimate an equivalent single hit,'parallel
transported' effective NC-beam that matches both the angular power spectrum and
the non-zero BipoSH measurements of the observed maps. Hence, BipoSH analysis
provides a very simple and effective characterization of CMB maps made with
NC-beam. (Abridged)

intergalactic medium (IGM), X-rays could have a dramatic impact on the thermal
and ionization history of the Universe. We explore this in various signals: (i)
Reionization history: including X-rays results in an earlier, more extended
reionization. Efficient thermal feedback from X-ray heating could yield an
extended, ~10% ionized epoch. (ii) Reionization morphology: a sizable (~10%)
contribution of X-rays to reionization results in a more uniform morphology,
though the impact is modest when compared at the same global neutral fraction,
xH. However, changes in morphology cannot be countered by increasing the bias
of the ionizing sources, making them a robust signature. (iii) The kinetic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect: at a fixed reionization history, X-rays
decrease the kSZ power at l=3000 by ~0.5 microK^2. Our extreme model in which
X-rays dominate reionization is the only one that is marginally consistent with
upper limits from the South Pole Telescope, assuming no thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) - dusty galaxy correlation. Since this extreme model
is unlikely, we conclude that there should be a sizable tSZ-dusty galaxy
signal. (iv) The cosmic 21cm signal: the impact of X-rays on the 21cm power
spectrum during the advanced stages of reionization (xH<0.7) is modest, except
in extreme, X-ray dominated models. The largest impact of X-rays is to govern
IGM heating. In fact, unless thermal feedback is efficient, the epoch of X-ray
heating likely overlaps with the beginning of reionization (xH>0.9). This
results in a 21cm power spectrum which is ~ 10-100 times higher than obtained
from naive estimates ignoring this overlap. However, if thermal feedback is
efficient, the resulting extended epoch between X-ray heating and reionization
could provide a clean probe of the matter power spectrum in emission.

mode. The magnitude of this splitting is found to scale with Sqrt[N], where N
is the number of collectively coupled spins. We control N by changing the
system's temperature and, thereby, the populations of the relevant spin energy
levels. Strong coupling is observed for two distinct transitions between spin
energy states. Our results indicate that at low temperatures nearly all of the
spins in the sample couple with the cavity's resonant mode even though there is
substantial inhomogeneous broadening of the Fe8 spin resonances.

variational approach to the equivalence problem for geometric structures on
manifolds, we consider the problem of equivalence for distributions with fixed
submanifolds of flags on each fiber. We call them flag structures. The
construction of the canonical frames for these structures can be given in the
two prolongation steps: the first step, based on our previous works, gives the
canonical bundle of moving frames for the fixed submanifolds of flags on each
fiber and the second step consists of the prolongation of the bundle obtained
in the first step. The bundle obtained in the first step is not as a rule a
principal bundle so that the classical Tanaka prolongation procedure for
filtered structures can not be applied to it. However, under natural
assumptions on submanifolds of flags and on the ambient distribution, this
bundle satisfies a nice weaker property. The main goal of the present paper is
to formalize this property, introducing the so-called quasi-principle frame
bundles, and to generalize the Tanaka prolongation procedure to these bundles.
Applications to the equivalence problems for systems of differential equations
of mixed order, bracket generating distributions, sub-Riemannian and more
general structures on distributions are given.

the structure and robustness of complex biological and social systems. While
arguments for the link between specialization and productivity are common,
diversity has often been invoked as a hedging strategy, allowing systems to
evolve in response to environmental change. Despite their general appeal, these
arguments have not typically produced quantitative predictions for optimal
levels of functional diversity consistent with observations. One important
reason why these relationships have resisted formalization is the idiosyncratic
nature of diversity measures, which depend on given classification schemes.
Here, we address these issues by analyzing the statistics of professions in
cities and show how their probability distribution takes a universal
scale-invariant form, common to all cities, obtained in the limit of infinite
resolution of given taxonomies. We propose a model that generates the form and
parameters of this distribution via the introduction of new occupations at a
rate leading to individual specialization subject to the preservation of access
to overall function via their ego social networks. This perspective unifies
ideas about the importance of network structure in ecology and of innovation as
a recombinatory process with economic concepts of productivity gains obtained
through the division and coordination of labor, stimulated by scale.

the modifications of the tidal forces due to the supplementary curvature-matter
coupling are obtained in the weak field approximation. The tidal motion of test
particles is directly influenced not only by the gradient of the extra force,
which is basically determined by the gradient of the Ricci scalar, but also by
an explicit coupling between the velocity and the Riemann curvature tensor. As
a specific example, the expression of the Roche limit (the orbital distance at
which a satellite will begin to be tidally torn apart by the body it is
