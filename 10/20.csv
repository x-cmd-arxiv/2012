ultracentrifugation and DNA-based ion-exchange chromatography to produce
aqueous suspensions strongly enriched in armchair nanotubes for spectroscopic

phonons, we provide macroscopic and unambiguous evidence that density gradient
ultracentrifugation can enrich armchair nanotubes. Furthermore, using
conventional, optical absorption spectroscopy in the near-infrared and visible
range, we show that interband absorption in armchair nanotubes is strongly

that observation of the broad, lower frequency (G^{-}) feature is a result of
resonance with non-armchair ""metallic"" nanotubes. These findings regarding the

nanotubes lay the foundation for further spectroscopic studies to probe
many-body physical phenomena in one dimension.

2L$ square, there are approximately $\exp(4KL^2/\pi )$ ways to tile it with
dominos, i.e. with horizontal or vertical $2\times 1$ rectangles, where
$K\approx 0.916$ is Catalan's constant [Kasteleyn '61, Temperley-Fisher '61]. A
conceptually simple (even if computationally not the most efficient) way of
sampling uniformly one among so many tilings is to introduce a Markov Chain
algorithm (Glauber dynamics) where, with rate $1$, two adjacent horizontal
dominos are flipped to vertical dominos, or vice-versa. The unique invariant
measure is the uniform one and a classical question [Wilson
2004,Luby-Randall-Sinclair 2001] is to estimate the time $T_{mix}$ it takes to
approach equilibrium (i.e. the running time of the algorithm). In
[Luby-Randall-Sinclair 2001, Randall-Tetali 2000], fast mixin was proven:
$T_{mix}=O(L^C)$ for some finite $C$. Here, we go much beyond and show that $c
L^2\le T_{mix}\le L^{2+o(1)}$. Our result applies to rather general domain
shapes (not just the $2L\times 2L$ square), provided that the typical height
function associated to the tiling is macroscopically planar in the large $L$
limit, under the uniform measure (this is the case for instance for the
Temperley-type boundary conditions considered in [Kenyon 2000]). Also, our
method extends to some other types of tilings of the plane, for instance the
tilings associated to dimer coverings of the hexagon or square-hexagon
lattices.

cuspy (gamma ~ 1) triaxial models of stellar systems, and we showed that they
were highly stable over time intervals of the order of a Hubble time, even
though they had very large fractions of chaotic orbits (more than 85 per cent
in some cases). The models were grouped in four sets, each one comprising
models morphologically resembling E2, E3, E4 and E5 galaxies, respectively. The
three models within each set, although different, had the same global
properties and were statistically equivalent. In the present paper we use
frequency analysis to classify the regular orbits of those models. The bulk of
those orbits are short axis tubes (SATs), with a significant fraction of long
axis tubes (LATs) in the E2 models that decreases in the E3 and E4 models to
become negligibly small in the E5 models. Most of the LATs in the E2 and E3
models are outer LATs, but the situation reverses in the E4 and E5 models where
the few LATs are mainly inner LATs. As could be expected for cuspy models, most
of the boxes are resonant orbits, i.e., boxlets. Nevertheless, only the (x, y)
fishes of models E3 and E4 amount to about 10 per cent of the regular orbits,
with most of the fractions of the other boxlets being of the order of 1 per
cent or less.

electron fractionalization and give a complete account of their quasiparticles
types, fusion rules, and braiding. We show that the image of the braid group is
finite for a collection of $2n$ fundamental quasiparticles and is a proper
subgroup of the metaplectic representation of $Sp(2n-2,\mathbb{F}_m)\ltimes
H(2n-2,\mathbb{F}_m)$, where $Sp(2n-2,\mathbb{F}_m)$ is the symplectic group
over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_m$ and $H(2n-2,\mathbb{F}_m)$ is the extra
special group (also called the $(2n-1)$-dimensional Heisenberg group) over
$\mathbb{F}_m$. Moreover, the braiding of fundamental quasiparticles can be
efficiently simulated classically. However, computing the result of braiding a
certain type of composite quasiparticle is $# P$-hard, although it is not
universal for quantum computation because it has a finite braid group image.
This a rare example of a topological phase that is not universal for quantum
computation through braiding but nevertheless has $# P$-hard link invariants.
We argue that our models are closely related to recent analyses finding
non-Abelian anyonic properties for defects in quantum Hall systems,
generalizing Majorana zero modes in quasi-1D systems.

process whose continuous and pure jump parts are allowed to follow separate
random time scalings; we devise the martingale structure for a DTC
L\'evy-driven asset and revisit many popular models which fall under this
framework. Postulating different time changes for the underlying L\'evy
decomposition allows to introduce asset price models consistent with the
assumption of a correlated pair of continuous and jump market activities; we
study one illustrative DTC model having this property by assuming that the
instantaneous activity rates follow the the so-called Wishart process. The
theory developed is applied to the problem of pricing claims depending not only
on the price or the volatility of an underlying asset, but also to more
sophisticated derivatives that pay-off on the joint performance of these two
financial variables, like the target volatility option (TVO). We solve the
pricing problem through a Fourier-inversion method; numerical computations

the original variables, the scheme is known to diverge as the time step is
reduced with the ratio of the time step to space step held constant and the
value of this ratio controls how fast the divergence occurs. After introducing
the square root of time variable we prove that the numerical scheme for the
transformed partial differential equation now always converges and that the
ratio of the time step to space step controls the order of convergence,
quadratic convergence being achieved for this ratio below a critical value.
Numerical results indicate that the time change used with an appropriate value

magnetic field from the corona, which propagate through interplanetary space.
CMEs are the most significant drivers of adverse space weather on Earth, but
the physics governing their propagation through the Heliosphere is not well
understood. This is mainly due to the limited fields-of-view and plane-of-sky
projected nature of previous observations. The Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory (STEREO) mission launched in October 2006, was designed to overcome
these limitations. In this thesis, a method for the full three dimensional (3D)
reconstruction of the trajectories of CMEs using STEREO was developed. Using
the 3D trajectories, the true kinematics were derived, which were free from
projection effects. Evidence for solar wind (SW) drag forces acting in
interplanetary space were found, with a fast CME decelerated and a slow CME
accelerated toward typical SW velocities. It was also found that the fast CME
showed a linear dependence on the velocity difference between the CME and the
SW, while the slow CME showed a quadratic dependence. The differing forms of
drag for the two CMEs indicated the forces responsible for their acceleration
may have been different. CMEs are known to generate bow shocks as they
propagate through the corona and SW. Although CME-driven shocks have previously
been detected indirectly via their emission at radio frequencies, direct
imaging has remained elusive due to their low contrast at optical wavelengths.
Using STEREO observations, the first images of a CME-driven shock as it
propagates through interplanetary space from 8 R_Sun to 120 R_Sun (0.5 AU) were
captured. These observations were compared to empirically derived relation and
in general showed good agreement.

cellular networks (HCNs) for interference reduction. However, previous
approaches to CoMP face two major hurdles in HCNs. First, they usually ignore
the inter-cell overhead messaging delay, although it results in an irreducible
performance bound. Second, they consider the grid or Wyner model for base
station locations, which is not appropriate for HCN BS locations which are
numerous and haphazard. Even for conventional macrocell networks without
overlaid small cells, SINR results are not tractable in the grid model nor
accurate in the Wyner model. To overcome these hurdles, we develop a novel
analytical framework which includes the impact of overhead delay for CoMP
evaluation in HCNs. This framework can be used for a class of CoMP schemes
without user data sharing. As an example, we apply it to downlink CoMP
zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF), and see significant divergence from previous
work. For example, we show that CoMP ZFBF does not increase throughput when the
overhead channel delay is larger than 60% of the channel coherence time. We
also find that, in most cases, coordinating with only one other cell is nearly
optimum for downlink CoMP ZFBF.

galaxy metallicities based on single band photometry. However, we show that
galaxy color is typically more effective than luminosity as a predictor of
metallicity. This is a consequence of the correlation between color and the
galaxy mass-to-light ratio and the recently discovered correlation between star
formation rate (SFR) and residuals from the mass-metallicity relation. Using
Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy of 180,000 nearby galaxies, we derive
""LZC relations,"" empirical relations between metallicity (in seven common
strong line diagnostics), luminosity, and color (in ten filter pairs and four

simulations (high resolution and inclusion of the gas physics) and
semi-analytic models (cosmological background and low computational cost), and
integrate them to create a novel tool. This approach allows us to study the
evolution of various galaxy properties, including the treatment of the hot
gaseous halo from which gas cools and accretes onto the central disc, which has
been neglected in many previous studies. This method shows several advantages
over other methods. As only the particles in the regions of interest are
included, the run time is much shorter than in traditional cosmological
simulations, leading to greater computational efficiency. Using cosmological
simulations, we show that multiple mergers are expected to be more common than
sequences of isolated mergers, and therefore studies of galaxy mergers should
take this into account. In this pilot study, we present our method and
illustrate the results of simulating ten Milky Way-like galaxies since z=1. We
find good agreement with observations for the total stellar masses, star

showing that shape analyses searching for a mass peak can probe such gluinos up
to masses of ~ 750 GeV (650 GeV) with 20/fb (5/fb) at the LHC at 8 TeV. This
complements existing search strategies, which also include counting methods
that are inherently more prone to systematic uncertainties. Since
R-parity-violating gluinos lighter than all squarks hadronize before decaying,
we introduce new color-flow variables, ""radial pull"" and ""axis contraction"",
which are sensitive to the color structure of the R-hadron's decay. The former
measures the inward pull of subjets in a fat jet, while the latter quantifies
the inward drift of the $N$-subjettiness axes when changing the distance
measure. We show that they can dramatically improve the discrimination of a
boosted gluino signal versus QCD, ttbar and combinatoric background for
m_gluino ~ m_top. Cuts on axis contraction also noticeably improve the
resonance shape for heavy gluinos with m_gluino > ~500 GeV. With minor
adaptations, these variables could find application in substructure searches
for particles in different color representations or with other decay
topologies. We also compare how several different Monte Carlo generators model

discriminating power of our color-flow observables are robust, and provides
useful guidance for future substructure studies.

accepted theory that accounts for fundamental features of the MJO, including
its propagation speed, planetary horizontal scale, multi-scale features, and
quadrupole structures, remains elusive. In this study, we use a shallow water
model to simulate the MJO. In our model, convection is parameterized as a
short-duration localized mass source, and is triggered when the layer thickness
falls below a critical value. Radiation is parameterized as a steady uniform
mass sink. Slowly eastward propagating (MJO-like) signals and red noise spectra
are observed in our simulations. In the time-longitude domain, MJO-like signals
with multi-scale structures are observed. In the Fourier domain, spectral peaks
associated with the MJO-like signals are observed. In the longitude-latitude
map view, quadrupole vortex structures associated with the MJO-like signals are
observed. We propose that the simulated MJO signal is an interference pattern
of westward and eastward inertia-gravity(WIG and EIG) waves. Its propagation
speed is one half of the speed difference between the WIG and EIG waves. The
horizontal scale of its large-scale envelope is determined by the bandwidth of
the excited waves, and the bandwidth is controlled by number density of
convection events. Our results suggest that the MJO perhaps is not a
large-scale low-frequency wave, in which convection acts as quasi-equilibrium
adjustment. Small-scale high-frequency waves might be important.

we investigate the physical conditions in NGC 604, and quantify the amount of
massive star formation currently taking place. We derive an average age of 4
+/- 1 Myr and a total stellar mass of 1.6 (+1.6)(-1.0) x 10^5 M_sun for the
entire region, in agreement with previous optical studies. Across the region we
find an effect of the X-ray field on both the abundance of aromatic molecules

infrared sources with diameters of about 15 pc and luminosity weighted masses
between 10^3 M_sun and 10^4 M_sun. Their spectral properties indicate that some
of these sources are embedded clusters in process of formation, which together
account for ~8% of the total stellar mass in the NGC 604 system. The variations
of the radiation field strength across NGC 604 are consistent with a sequential
star formation scenario, with at least two bursts in the last few million
years. Our results indicate that massive star formation in NGC 604 is still
ongoing, likely triggered by the earlier bursts.

distribution of the valuations define supply and demand functions. One unit of
the good is auctioned. At successive, discrete time instances, a player is
randomly selected to make a bid (buyer) or an ask (seller). When the maximum of

the auction is closed. The players have to choose the value of their bid or ask

Secondly, we consider user-specific rewards and allow costly communication

chromospheric lines, such as Ca II K, are very sensitive to the presence of
activity on the disk and are an ideal choice for investigating SDR in Sun-as-a

determination of Sun's differential rotation from integrated-sunlight
measurements becomes uncertain. However, our study shows that using the proper
technique, SDR can be detected from these type of measurements even during
periods of extended solar minima. This paper describes results from the
analysis of the temporal variations of Ca II K line profiles observed by the

homotopy limit of a certain tautological functor. This is a simple observation,
which seems to be true in wider context. From the view point of derived Gabriel
topology, this is a derived version of results of J. Lambek about localization
and completion of ordinary rings. However the important point is that we can
obtain a simple formula for the bi-duality modules only when we come to the
derived world from the abelian world.
  We give applications. 1. we give a generalization and an intuitive proof of
Efimov-Dwyer-Greenlees-Iyenger Theorem which asserts that the completion of
commutative ring satisfying some conditions is obtained as a derived
bi-commutator. (We can also prove Koszul duality for dg-algebras with Adams
grading satisfying mild conditions.) 2. We prove that every smashing
localization of dg-category is obtained as a derived bi-commutator of some pure
injective module. This is a derived version of the classical results in
localization theory of ordinary rings.
  These applications shows that our formula together with the viewpoint that a
derived bi-commutator is a completion in some sense, provide us a fundamental
understanding of a derived bi-duality module.

variety of solutions more thoroughly. The code can handle not only regular
solutions, in which no intermediate shocks are involved, but also all types of
non-regular solutions if any. As a first application, we explored the
neighborhood of the initial condition that was first picked up by Brio & Wu
(1988) and has been frequently employed in the literature as a standard problem
to validate numerical codes. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that there
will always be a regular solution, we found an initial condition, for which
there is no regular solution but a non-regular one. The latter solution has
only regular solutions in its neighborhood and actually sits on the boundary of
regular solutions. This implies that the regular solutions are not sufficient
to solve the ideal MHD Riemann problem and suggests that at least some types of
non-regular solutions are physical. We also demonstrate that the non-regular
solutions are not unique. In fact, we found for the Brio & Wu initial condition
that there are uncountably many non-regular solutions. This poses an intriguing
question: why a particular non-regular solution is always obtained in numerical
simulations? This has important ramifications to the discussion of which
intermediate shocks are really admissible.

eclipse depth, has a sinusoidal shape and that the maximum brightness occurs at
the same phase as mid-occultation to within about 5 degrees at 3.6 micron and
to within about 10 degrees at 4.5 micron. The shape and amplitude of the
thermal phase curve imply very low levels of heat redistribution within the
atmosphere of the planet. We also perform a separate analysis to determine the
system geometry by fitting a lightcurve model to the data covering the
occultation and the transit. The secondary eclipse depths we measure at 3.6

imply a very low albedo for WASP-18b. The parameters of the system (masses,

the flux at Spitzer wavelengths from a stellar companion to WASP-18. We find

Fisher matrix forecasts. Mock catalogs of cluster counts expected from the
surveys -- eROSITA, WFXT, RCS2, DES and Planck, along with a mock dataset of
follow-up mass calibrations are analyzed for this purpose. A fair agreement
between MCMC and Fisher results is found only in the case of minimal models.
However, for many cases, the marginalized constraints obtained from Fisher and
MCMC methods can differ by factors of 30-100%. The discrepancy can be
alarmingly large for a time dependent dark energy equation of state, w(a); the
Fisher methods are seen to under-estimate the constraints by as much as a
factor of 4--5. Typically, Fisher estimates become more and more inappropriate
as we move away from LCDM, to a constant-w dark energy to varying-w dark energy
cosmologies. Fisher analysis, also, predicts incorrect parameter degeneracies.
From the point of mass-calibration uncertainties, a high value of unknown
scatter about the mean mass-observable relation, and its redshift dependence,
is seen to have large degeneracies with the cosmological parameters sigma_8 and
w(a) and can degrade the cosmological constraints considerably. We find that
the addition of mass-calibrated cluster datasets can improve dark energy and
sigma_8 constraints by factors of 2--3 from what can be obtained compared to
CMB+SNe+BAO only. Since, details of future cluster surveys are still being
planned, we emphasize that optimal survey design must be done using MCMC
analysis rather than Fisher forecasting. [abridged]

transition at T = Tc which is tunable anywhere between 83 K and 373 K with a
proper choice of the doping level (x). The insulating ferromagnet x= 0
transforms to ferromagnetic metal below Tc for x= 0.1 and the insulator-metal
transition temperature shifts up with increasing x. The magnetization (M)
exhibits an interesting behavior as a function of temperature and doping level.
The field-cooled M(T) of all but x= 0.7 compound show a cusp at a temperature
T* much below Tc. While the Tc increases monotonically with increasing x, T*
increases gradually, attains a maximum value (T*= 137 K) for x= 0.6 and
decreases rapidly thereafter. It is suggested that the decrease of M(T) below
T* is due to ferrimagnetic interaction between Sm(4f) and Mn(3d) sublattices
that promotes spin-reorientation transition of the Mn-sublattice. The observed
anomalous feature in M(T) does not have impact on the dc resistivity. Magnetic
entropy change (delta Sm) was estimated from magnetization isotherms. The sign
of delta Sm is found to change from negative above T* to positive below T*
indicating the coexistence of normal and inverse magnetocaloric effects. delta
Sm is nearly composition independent (-delta Sm is about 1.5 J/Kg K for delta H
= 1 Tesla) and refrigeration capacity lies between 50 and 80 J/kg K for x =

(0.1-10 pc) turbulence and chemical mixing in the interstellar medium.
Identifying such instabilities has always been difficult but recent
observations of a wavelike structure (the Ripples) in the Orion nebula have
been interpreted as a signature of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI),
occurring at the interface between the HII region and the molecular cloud.
However, this has not been verified theoretically. In this letter, we
investigate theoretically the stability of this interface using observational
constraints for the local physical conditions. A linear analysis shows that the
HII/molecular cloud interface is indeed KH unstable for a certain range of
magnetic field orientation. We find that the maximal growth-rates correspond to
typical timescales of a few 1e4 years and instability wavelengths of 0.06 to
0.6 pc. We predict that after 2e5 years the KHI saturates and forms a turbulent
layer of thickness ~0.5 pc. The KHI can remain in linear phase over a maximum
distance of 0.75 pc. These spatial and time scales are compatible with the
Ripples representing the linear phase of the KHI. These results suggest that
the KHI may be crucial to generate turbulence and to bring heavy elements
injected by the winds of massive stars in HII regions to colder regions where
planetary systems around low mass stars are being formed. This could apply to
the transport of 26Al injected by a massive star in an HII region to the
nascent solar-system.

Based on that, several candidate encryption functions are proposed and
compared. We show that, given the secret key available to the legitimate users,
perfect secrecy can be achieved without compromising the capability of the
communication channel. On the other hand, we study the practical design of the
secret-key generation method based on the channel reciprocity. We show that, by
introducing marginal system overhead, the key agreement between the legitimate

of the proposed PLE method is verified through comparisons against other

  and Strongly Coupled Spintronics","Ph.D. Thesis",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The non-perturbative dynamics of quantum field theories is studied using
theoretical tools inspired by string formalism. Two main lines are developed:
the analysis of stringy instantons in a class of four-dimensional N=2 gauge
theories and the holographic study of the minimal model for a strongly coupled
unbalanced superconductor.
  The field theory instanton calculus admits a natural and efficient
description in terms of D-brane models. In addition, the string viewpoint
offers the possibility of generalizing the ordinary instanton configurations.
Even though such generalized, or stringy, instantons would be absent in a
purely field-theoretical, low-energy treatment, we demonstrate that they do
alter the IR effective description of the brane dynamics by introducing
contributions related to the string scale. In the first part of this thesis we
compute explicitly the stringy instanton corrections to the effective
prepotential in a class of quiver gauge theories.
  In the second part of the thesis, we present a detailed analysis of the
minimal holographic setup yielding an effective description of a superconductor
with two Abelian currents. The model contains a scalar field whose condensation
produces a spontaneous symmetry breaking which describes the transition to a
superfluid phase. This system has important applications in both QCD and
condensed matter physics; moreover, it allows us to study mixed electric-spin
transport properties (i.e. spintronics) at strong coupling.

separation of electrons which occurs in Luttinger liquids. A detailed
description of the excitation spectrum can be performed by combining spectra
for charge and anyonic sectors. The anyonic sector is the one of a squeezed
chain of localized interacting anyons, and hence is described by the same
conformal field theory (CFT), with central charge c=1/2 for Ising anyons and
c=7/10 or c=4/5 for Fibonacci anyons with antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic
coupling, respectively. The charge sector is the spectrum of a chain of
hardcore bosons subject to phase shifts which coincide with the momenta of the
combined anyonic eigenstates, revealing a subtle coupling between charge and
anyonic excitations at the microscopic level (which we also find to be present
in Luttinger liquids), despite the macroscopic fractionalization. The combined
central charge extracted from the entanglement entropy between segments of the
chain is shown to be 1+c, where c is the central charge of the underlying CFT

Transitions are possible if the energy eigenvalues of the oscillator $E_i$ and

simple relations: $E_{j}\simeq E_{i}-\hbar\omega_{n}$ (stimulated emission) or
$E_{j}\simeq E_{i}+\hbar\omega_{n}$ (absorption). This indicates that a

We also investigate dependences of ergodic properties on initial ensembles

ensembles: the equilibrium and a typical non-equilibrium ensembles. For both
ensembles, it is shown that the time-averaged mean square displacement (TAMSD)
exhibits a crossover from normal to anomalous diffusion due to the spacial
confinement and this crossover does not vanish even in the long measurement
time limit. Moreover, for the non-equilibrium ensemble, we show that the
probability density function of the diffusion constant of TAMSD follows the
transient Mittag-Leffler distribution, and that scatter in the TAMSD shows a
clear transition from weak ergodicity breaking (an irreproducible regime) to
ordinary ergodic behavior (a reproducible regime) as the measurement time
increases. This convergence to ordinary ergodicity requires a long measurement
time compared to common distributions such as the exponential distribution; in
other words, the weak ergodicity breaking persists for a long time. In
addition, it is shown that, besides the TAMSD, a class of observables also
exhibits this slow convergence to ergodicity. We also point out that, even

behavior is quite similar to that for the non-equilibrium ensemble.

norm minimization problem, which is unpractical to solve. A number of sparse
recovery approaches have appeared in the literature, including l1 minimization
techniques, greedy pursuit algorithms, Bayesian methods and nonconvex
optimization techniques among others. This manuscript introduces a novel two
stage greedy approach, called the Forward-Backward Pursuit (FBP). FBP is an
iterative approach where each iteration consists of consecutive forward and
backward stages. The forward step first expands the support estimate by the
forward step size, while the following backward step shrinks it by the backward
step size. The forward step size is larger than the backward step size, hence
the initially empty support estimate is expanded at the end of each iteration.
Forward and backward steps are iterated until the residual power of the
observation vector falls below a threshold. This structure of FBP does not
necessitate the sparsity level to be known a priori in contrast to the Subspace
Pursuit or Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit algorithms. FBP recovery
performance is demonstrated via simulations including recovery of random sparse
signals with different nonzero coefficient distributions in noisy and
noise-free scenarios in addition to the recovery of a sparse image.

or more stations for VLBI observations aimed at studying an event horizon. To
work as a VLBI station with full collecting area the SMA (or a combination SMA,
JCMT, CSO antennas) would need a processor to enable phased array operation.
This masters project focusses on building such a processor. Back end processing
for high bandwidth radio telescopes has traditionally been done using custom
designed application specific integrated circuits (ASIC). Recent advances in
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology have made FPGAs both powerful
and economically viable for radio astronomy back ends. We have attempted to
take advantage of these advances and built a proof-of-concept 500 MHz phased
array processor for the SMA using FPGAs. The phased array processing is done in
the time domain using high speed sampling and digital delay lines. The design
is capable of spooling the phased sum to a Mark 5b VLBI data recorder. It is
based on hardware built by the Berkeley Wireless Research Center and the
Berkeley Space Science Laboratory. We digitize signals after the 1st SMA
downconvertor using 1024 MHz sampling and have demonstrated the capability to
sum signals from 8 antennas through programmable digital delay lines up to a
precision of (approx) 1/10 the sampling rate i.e. 0.1 ns. To calibrate

solutions of the Schroedinger equation that actually pertains to itself, it is
proposed that quantum computing technology (as opposed to cryptographic
technology) not be based on pure quantum systems such as qubits but instead on
physical systems which by their nature faithfully simulate the solutions of
Schroedinger equations. Every Schroedinger equation is within a unitary
transformation of being a set of mutually independent classical simple harmonic
oscillator equations. Thus classical simple harmonic oscillators, or ""chobits"",
are the mathematically fundamental building blocks for all Schroedinger
equations. In addition, classical harmonic oscillators are, as a practical
matter, far easier to deal with than any pure quantum system -- e.g., their
phases and absolute amplitudes are readily physically accessible, they have
little predilection for environmental decoherence, and they abound as cavity
electromagnetic standing-wave modes. We study in mathematical detail the use of
chobits to compute discrete quantum Fourier transforms, including gates, chobit
counts, and chobit operation counts. The results suggest that thirty chobits
and under a thousand chobit phase operations could generate discrete quantum
Fourier transforms of a billion terms. Chobits can be technologically realized
