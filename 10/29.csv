Q Q-bar, that decay exclusively into a top quark and a W or Z boson. The search
is performed using a sample of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 inverse femtobarns, collected
by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment. The signal region is defined using a
sample of events containing one electron or muon, missing transverse momentum,
and at least four jets with large transverse momenta, where one jet is likely
to originate from the decay of a bottom quark. No significant excess of events
is observed with respect to the standard model expectations. Assuming a strong
pair-production mechanism, quark masses below 675 (625) GeV decaying into tW
(tZ) are excluded at the 95% confidence level.

many steps of a rapidly mixing Markov chain which leaves the target

advantage of multi-core computing to speed up MCMC-based inference, both to

present a parallelizable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for efficiently
sampling from continuous probability distributions that can take advantage of
hundreds of cores. This method shares information between parallel Markov
chains to build a scale-mixture of Gaussians approximation to the density

response to pro-inflammatory stimulus, it exhibits characteristic response -- a
pulse followed by noisy oscillations in concentrations of considerably smaller
amplitude. NF-kB is an important mediator of cellular communication, as it is
both activated by and upregulates production of cytokines, signals used by
white blood cells to find the source of inflammation. While the oscillatory
dynamics of NF-$\kappa$B has been extensively investigated both experimentally
and theoretically, the role of the noise and the lower secondary amplitude has
not been addressed.
  We use a cellular automaton model to address these issues in the context of
spatially distributed communicating cells. We find that noisy secondary
oscillations stabilize concentric wave patterns, thus improving signal quality.
Furthermore, both lower secondary amplitude as well as noise in the oscillation
period might be working against chronic inflammation, the state of
self-sustained and stimulus-independent excitations.
  Our findings suggest that the characteristic irregular secondary oscillations
of lower amplitude are not accidental. On the contrary, they might have evolved
to increase robustness of the inflammatory response and the system's ability to
return to pre-stimulated state.

dimensional distributions. We develop the approximation method presented by
Bedford et al (2012) at which they show that any $n$-dimensional copula density
can be approximated arbitrarily well pointwise using a finite parameter set of
2-dimensional copulas in a vine or pair-copula construction. Our constructive
approach involves the use of minimum information copulas that can be specified
to any required degree of precision based on the available data or experts'
judgements. By using this method, we are able to use a fixed finite dimensional
family of copulas to be employed in a vine construction, with the promise of a
uniform level of approximation.
  The basic idea behind this method is to use a two-dimensional ordinary
polynomial series to approximate any log-density of a bivariate copula function
by truncating the series at an appropriate point. We present an alternative
approximation of the multivariate distribution of interest by considering
orthonormal polynomial and Legendre multiwavelets as the basis functions. We
show the derived approximations are more precise and computationally faster
with better properties than the one proposed by Bedford et al. (2012). We then
apply our method to modelling a dataset of Norwegian financial data that was

the presence of an annual oscillation, but with a lower significance level than

to a peak value at about May 22, which is consistent with both the DAMA
estimate and the expected phase of a dark-matter signal. However, a spectrogram
analysis also shows evidence for oscillations in the frequency band 11 - 13
year-1, that are similar to oscillations found in spectrograms formed from
measurements of the decay rates of 36Cl and 32Si acquired at the Brookhaven

decay and K-capture) measurements point to a solar influence, either by

that annual oscillations in both 133Ba decay measurements and the Troitsk

this end, we introduce antagonistic interactions for which the functionality,
or activity, of a node in a network is incompatible with the functionality, of
the linked nodes in the other interacting networks. In particular, we study the
percolation transition in two interacting networks with purely antagonistic
interaction and different topology. For two antagonistic Poisson networks of
different average degree we found a large region in the phase diagram in which
there is a bistability of the steady state solutions of the percolation
process, i.e. we can find that either one of the two networks might percolate.
For two antagonistic scale-free networks we found that there is a region in the
phase diagram in which, despite the antagonistic interactions, both networks
are percolating. Finally we characterize the rich phase diagram of the
percolation problems on two antagonistic networks, the first one of the two
being a Poisson network and the second one being a scale-free network.

velocity) of the gas that attempts to stream past. Still, small protoplanets in
the Mars--super-Earth range can only bind limited amounts of nebular gas; until
the so-called critical core mass has been reached (~1-10 Earth masses) this gas
is in near hydrostatic equilibrium with the nebula. Here we aim for a general
description of the flow pattern surrounding these low-mass, embedded planets.
Using various simplifying assumptions (subsonic, 2D, inviscid flow, etc), we
reduce the problem to a partial differential equation that we solve numerically
as well as approximate analytically. It is found that the boundary between the
atmosphere and the nebula gas strongly depends on the value of the disc
headwind (deviation from Keplerian rotation). With increasing headwind the
atmosphere decreases in size and also becomes more asymmetrical. Using the
derived flow pattern for the gas, trajectories of small solid particles, which
experience both gas drag and gravitational forces, are integrated numerically.
Accretion rates for small particles (dust) are found to be low, as they closely
follow the streamlines, which curl away from the planet. However, pebble-size
particles achieve large accretion rates, in agreement with previous numerical
and analytical works.

50 Mm within a solar model. We find that helioseismic holography as employed in
a nominal ""lateral-vantage"" or ""deep-focus"" geometry employing quadrants of an
annular pupil is capable of detecting and characterizing the perturbation. A
number of tests of the methodology, including the use of a plane-parallel
approximation, the definition of travel-time shifts, the use of different
phase-speed filters, and changes to the pupils, are also performed. It is found
that travel-time shifts made using Gabor-wavelet fitting are essentially
identical to those derived from the phase of the Fourier transform of the
cross-covariance functions. The errors in travel-time shifts caused by the
plane-parallel approximation can be minimized to less than a second for the
depths and fields of view considered here. Based on the measured strength of
the mean travel-time signal of the perturbation, no substantial improvement in
sensitivity is produced by varying the analysis procedure from the nominal
methodology in conformance with expectations. The measured travel-time shifts
are essentially unchanged by varying the profile of the phase-speed filter or
omitting the filter entirely. The method remains maximally sensitive when
applied with pupils that are wide quadrants, as opposed to narrower quadrants
or with pupils composed of smaller arcs. We discuss the significance of these
results for the recent controversy regarding suspected pre-emergence signatures

without a block erasure. The total number of available level transitions in n
cells is n(q-1), and the write deficiency of C, defined as \delta(C) =
n(q-1)-t, is a measure of how close the code comes to perfectly utilizing all
these transitions. In this paper, we show a construction of flash codes with
write deficiency O(qk\log k) if q \geq \log_2k, and at most O(k\log^2 k)
otherwise.
  An (n,r,\ell,t)q buffer code is a coding scheme for storing a buffer of r
\ell-ary symbols such that for any sequence of t symbols it is possible to
successfully decode the last r symbols that were written. We improve upon a
previous upper bound on the maximum number of writes t in the case where there
is a single cell to store the buffer. Then, we show how to improve a
construction by Jiang et al. that uses multiple cells, where n\geq 2r.

to provide a superb new probe of relativistic gravity and BH properties. Apart
from a precise mass measurement for the BH, one could expect a clean
verification of the dragging of space-time caused by the BH spin. In order to
measure the quadrupole moment of the BH for testing the no-hair theorem of
general relativity (GR), one has to hope for a sufficiently massive BH. In this
respect, a PSR orbiting the super-massive BH in the center of our Galaxy would
be the ultimate laboratory for gravity tests with PSRs. But even for gravity
theories that predict the same properties for BHs as GR, a PSR-BH system would
constitute an excellent test system, due to the high grade of asymmetry in the
strong field properties of these two components. Here we highlight some of the
potential gravity tests that one could expect from different PSR-BH systems,
utilizing present and future radio telescopes, like FAST and SKA.

likelihood analysis, we determine the velocity dispersion profiles in spherical
coordinates ($\sigma_{r}$, $\sigma_{\theta}$, $\sigma_{\phi}$) and the
anisotropy profile ($\beta$). The radial velocity dispersion profile
($\sigma_{r}$) is measured out to a galactocentric radius of $r \sim 60$ kpc,
but due to the lack of proper-motion information, $\sigma_{\theta}$,
$\sigma_{\phi}$ and $\beta$ could only be derived directly out to $r \sim25$
kpc. From a starting value of $\beta\approx 0.5$ in the inner parts
($9<r/\kpc<12$), the profile falls sharply in the range $r \approx 13-18$ kpc,
with a minimum value of $\beta=-1.2$ at $r=17$ kpc, rising sharply at larger
radius. In the outer parts, in the range $25<r/\kpc<56$, we predict the profile
to be roughly constant with a value of $\beta\approx 0.5$. The newly discovered
kinematic anomalies are shown not to arise from halo substructures. We also
studied the anisotropy profile of simulated stellar halos formed purely by
accretion and found that they cannot reproduce the sharp dip seen in the data.
From the Jeans equation, we compute the stellar rotation curve ($v_{\rm circ}$)
of the Galaxy out to $r \sim 25$ kpc. The mass of the Galaxy within $r \lesssim
25$ kpc is determined to be $2.1 \times 10^{11}$ $M_{\sun}$, and with a
3-component fit to $v_{\rm circ}(r)$, we determine the virial mass of the Milky
Way dark matter halo to be $M_{\rm vir} = 0.9 ^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times 10^{12}$
$M_{\sun}$ ($R_{\rm vir} = 249^{+34}_{-31}$ kpc).

the inflating multiverse. We consider a measure based on a probe geodesic which
undergoes an infinite number of passages through crunches. This can be thought
of as the world-line of an eternal ""watcher"", collecting data in an orderly
fashion. We compare this to previous approaches to the measure problem. The
watcher's measure is independent of initial conditions and does not suffer from
ambiguities associated with the choice of a cut-off surface. Another potential
benefit from passing through crunches is that the observations collected by the
watcher may easily depart from ergodicity, in very generic landscapes. This may
significantly alleviate the problem of Boltzmann Brain dominance.

sensing systems for certain types of wireless applications. In such systems, a
group of sensing nodes periodically collect measurements about the signals
being observed in the given geographical region and transmit these measurements
to a central node, which in turn processes this information to recover the
signals. For example, in cognitive radio networks, the signals of interest are
those generated by the primary transmitters and the sensing nodes are the
secondary users. In such networks, it is critically important to be able to
reliably determine the presence or absence of primary transmitters in order to
avoid causing interference. The standard approach to transmit these
measurements from sensor the nodes to the fusion center has been to use
orthogonal channels. Such an approach quickly places a burden on the
control-channel-capacity of the network that would scale linearly in the number
of cooperating sensing nodes. In this paper, we show that as long as one
condition is satisfied: the dynamics of the observed signals are sparse, i.e.,
the observed signals do not change their values very rapidly in relation to the
time-scale at which the measurements are collected, we can significantly reduce
the control bandwidth of the system while achieving the full (linear) bandwidth
performance.

statistical-physical properties of soft-mode turbulence, the spatiotemporal
chaos observed in homeotropically aligned nematic liquid crystals. We found a
dual structure, dynamical crossover associated with violation of time-reversal
invariance, the corresponding time scales satisfying a dynamical scaling law.
To specify the origin of the dual structure, the memory function due to
non-thermal fluctuations has been defined by a projection-operator method and
obtained numerically using experimental results. The results of the memory
function suggest that the non-thermal fluctuations can be divided into Markov
and non-Markov contributions, the latter is called the turbulent fluctuation
(TF). Consequently, the relaxation dynamics is separated into three
characteristic stages: bare-friction, early, and late stages. If the
dissipation due to TFs dominates over that of the Markov contribution, the
bare-friction stage contracts; the early and late stages then configure the
dual structure. The memory effect due to TFs results in the time-reversible
relaxation at the early stage, and the disappearance of the memory by turbulent
mixing leads to a simple exponential relaxation at the late stage. Furthermore,
the memory effect due to TFs is shown to originate from characteristic spatial
coherency called the patch structure.

nova eruptions periodically eject material at high velocities ($\gtrsim 10^3$
km/s) into the red giant wind profile, creating a decelerating shock wave as
circumstellar material is swept up. High circumstellar material densities cause
the shocked wind and ejecta to have very short cooling times of days to weeks.
Thus, the late time evolution of the shell is determined by momentum
conservation instead of energy conservation. We compute and show evolutionary
tracks of shell deceleration, as well as post-shock structure. After sweeping
up all the red giant wind, the shell coasts at a velocity $\sim 100$ km/s,
depending on system parameters. These velocities are similar to those measured
in blue-shifted circumstellar material from the symbiotic nova RS Oph, as well

decomposition for matrices. Although tensor decompositions are generally
intractable to compute, the decomposition of these specially structured tensors
can be efficiently obtained by a variety of approaches, including power
iterations and maximization approaches (similar to the case of matrices). A
detailed analysis of a robust tensor power method is provided, establishing an
analogue of Wedin's perturbation theorem for the singular vectors of matrices.
This implies a robust and computationally tractable estimation approach for
several popular latent variable models.

seeing different behavior for different regions of the Higgs mass. Close to the

outburst, and also did the cross-correlate between its optical light curves and
the quasi-simultaneous X-ray observations from swift. Both the optical and
X-ray light curves of 2007 outburst show multi-peak features.
Quasi-simultaneous optical/X-ray luminosity shows that both the X-ray
reprocessing and viscously thermal emission can explain the observed optical
flux. There is a slightly X-ray delay of 0.6+-0.3 days during the first peak,
while the X-ray emission lags the optical emission by ~2 days during the
rebrightening stage, which suggests that X-ray reprocessing emission
contributes significantly to the optical flux in the first peak, but the
viscously-heated-disk origin dominates the optical flux during rebrightening.
It implies variation of the physical environment of the outer disk, even the
source stayed in low-hard state during the whole outburst. The ~2 day X-ray lag
indicates a small accretion disk of the system, and the optical counterpart was
not detected by OGLE and MOA during quiescence, which constrained it to be
fainter than MI = 7.5 mag. There is a suspected short-time optical flare
detected at MJD = 52583.5 without X-ray counterpart detected, this single flux
increase may imply a magnetic loop reconnection in the outer disk as proposed
by Zurita et al (2003). The observations cover all stages of the outburst,
however, due to the low sensitivity of RXTE/ASM, we cannot conclude whether it
is an optical precursor at the initial rise of the outburst.

non-collinear magnetic interaction is needed to push the Os(4c) bands away from

atmospheres of brown dwarfs and directly imaged giant planets. Motivated by
these observations, we examine the dynamical regime of the circulation in the
atmospheres and interiors of these objects. Brown dwarfs rotate rapidly, and
for plausible wind speeds, the flow at large scales will be rotationally
dominated. We present 3D, global, numerical simulations of convection in the
interior, which demonstrate that, at large scales, the convection aligns in the
direction parallel to the rotation axis. Convection occurs more efficiently at
high latitudes than low latitudes, leading to systematic equator-to-pole
temperature differences that may reach ~1 K near the top of the convection
zone. The interaction of convection with the overlying, stably stratified
atmosphere will generate a wealth of atmospheric waves, and we argue that, as
in the stratospheres of planets in the solar system, the interaction of these
waves with the mean flow will cause a significant atmospheric circulation at
regional to global scales. At large scales, this should consist of stratified
turbulence (possibly organizing into coherent structures such as vortices and
jets) and an accompanying overturning circulation. We present an approximate
analytic theory of this circulation, which predicts characteristic horizontal
temperature variations of several to ~50 K, horizontal wind speeds of ~10-300
m/sec, and vertical velocities that advect air over a scale height in
~10^5-10^6 sec. This vertical mixing may help to explain the chemical
disequilibrium observed on some brown dwarfs. Moreover, the implied large-scale
organization of temperature perturbations and vertical velocities suggests
that, near the L/T transition, patchy clouds can form near the photosphere,
helping to explain recent observations of brown-dwarf variability in the

supersymmetry breaking scale. Here we offer one possible explanation, which
simultaneously addresses also the strong CP and mu problems. We introduce an
axion, and suppose that the Peccei-Quinn and supersymmetry breaking scales are
connected. If we further assume that R-parity is not conserved, then the axion
is required to be dark matter, and the Peccei-Quinn/supersymmetry breaking
scale is required to be at least ~10^12 GeV. Gravity mediation then yields
scalar superpartners with masses of at least ~100 TeV. The gauginos are likely
to obtain loop-factor suppressed masses through anomaly mediation and higgsino
threshold corrections, and thus may be accessible at the LHC. The axion should
be probed at phase II of the ADMX experiment, and signs of R-parity violation
may be seen in the properties of the gauginos.

concerns of modern population genetics. A widely used strategy in this context
is to compare samples from several populations, and to look for genomic regions
with outstanding genetic differentiation between these populations. Genetic
differentiation is generally based on allele frequency differences between
populations, which are measured by Fst or related statistics. Here we introduce
a new statistic, denoted hapFLK, which focuses instead on the differences of
haplotype frequencies between populations. In contrast to most existing
statistics, hapFLK accounts for the hierarchical structure of the sampled
populations. Using computer simulations, we show that each of these two
features - the use of haplotype information and of the hierarchical structure
of populations - significantly improves the detection power of selected loci,
and that combining them in the hapFLK statistic provides even greater power. We
also show that hapFLK is robust with respect to bottlenecks and migration and
improves over existing approaches in many situations. Finally, we apply hapFLK
to a set of six sheep breeds from Northern Europe, and identify seven regions
under selection, which include already reported regions but also several new
ones. We propose a method to help identifying the population(s) under selection
in a detected region, which reveals that in many of these regions selection
most likely occurred in more than one population. Furthermore, several of the
detected regions correspond to incomplete sweeps, where the favourable
haplotype is only at intermediate frequency in the population(s) under
selection.

treats strings as independent identical emitters. Both the short-range (SR)
contribution, originating from the correlation between multiplicities produced
from a single source, and the long-range (LR) contribution, originating from
the fluctuation in the number of sources, are taken into account. The
dependencies of the FB correlation coefficient, $b$, on the windows' rapidity

compared with the preliminary data of ALICE. The analysis of these dependencies
effectively separates the contributions of two above mechanisms. It is also
demonstrated that traditional definitions of FB correlation coefficient $b$
have a strong nonlinear dependence on the acceptance of windows. Suitable
alternative observables for the future FB correlation studies are proposed. The
connection between $b$ and the two-particle correlation function, $C_2$, is
traced, as well as its connection to the untriggered di-hadron correlation
analysis. Using a model independent analysis, it is shown that measurement of

constraints for stellar evolutionary theory.
  Previous spectral analyses of the exciting star of the nebula A 35, BD-22
3467, were based on He+C+N+O+Si+Fe models only. For our analysis, we use
state-of-the-art fully metal-line blanketed NLTE model atmospheres that
consider opacities of 23 elements from hydrogen to nickel. For the analysis of
high-resolution and high-S/N (signal-to-noise) FUV (far ultraviolet, FUSE) and
UV (HST/STIS) observations, we combined stellar-atmosphere models and
interstellar line-absorption models to fully reproduce the entire observed UV
spectrum.
  The best agreement with the UV observation of BD-22 3467 is achieved at Teff
= 80 +/- 10 kK and log g =7.2 +/- 0.3. While Teff of previous analyses is
verified, log g is significantly lower. We re-analyzed lines of silicon and
iron (1/100 and about solar abundances, respectively) and for the first time in
this star identified argon, chromium, manganese, cobalt, and nickel and
determined abundances of 12, 70, 35, 150, and 5 times solar, respectively. Our
results partially agree with predictions of diffusion models for DA-type white
dwarfs. A combination of photospheric and interstellar line-absorption models
reproduces more than 90 % of the observed absorption features. The stellar mass
is M ~ 0.48 Msun.
  BD-22 3467 may not have been massive enough to ascend the asymptotic giant
branch and may have evolved directly from the extended horizontal branch to the
white dwarf state. This would explain why it is not surrounded by a planetary
nebula. However, the star, ionizes the ambient interstellar matter, mimicking a
planetary nebula.

high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. It is revealed that dark matter
haloes of ~10^4M_sun can produce first luminous objects with the aid of dark
matter cusps. Therefore, the mass of first objects is smaller by roughly two
orders of magnitude than in the previous prediction. This implies that the
number of Pop III stars formed in the early universe could be significantly
larger than hitherto thought. Secondly, the feedback by photo-ionization and
photo-dissociation photons in the first objects is explored with radiation
hydrodynamic simulations, and it is demonstrated that multiple stars can form
in a 10^5M_sun halo. Thirdly, the fragmentation of an accretion disk around a
primordial protostar is explored with photo-dissociation feedback. As a result,
it is found that the photo-dissociation can reduce the mass accretion rate onto
protostars. Also, protostars as small as 0.8M_sun may be ejected and evolve
with keeping their mass, which might be detected as ""real first stars"" in the
Galactic halo. Finally, state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamic simulations are
performed to investigate the internal ionization of first galaxies and the
escape of ionizing photons. We find that UV feedback by forming massive stars
enhances the escape fraction even in a halo as massive as > 6* 10^9M_sun, while
it reduces the star formation rate significantly. This may have a momentous
impact on the cosmic reionization.

radiating particles in radio halos is not universal, and that inefficient
mechanisms of particle acceleration are responsible for their origin. We also
found a variety of brightness distributions, i.e. centrally peaked as well as
clumpy halos. Even though the thermal and relativistic plasma tend to occupy
the same cluster volume, in some cases a positional shift between the radio and
X-ray peaks of emission is evident. Our observations also revealed the

games, both played on the edge set of a random board $G\sim \gnp$. In
Maker-Breaker games there are two players, denoted by Maker and Breaker. In
each round, Maker claims one previously unclaimed edge of $G$ and Breaker
responds by claiming $b$ previously unclaimed edges. We consider the
Hamiltonicity game, the perfect matching game and the $k$-vertex-connectivity
game, where Maker's goal is to build a graph which possesses the relevant
property. Avoider-Enforcer games are the reverse analogue of Maker-Breaker
games with a slight modification, where the two players claim at least 1 and at
least $b$ previously unclaimed edges per move, respectively, and Avoider aims
to avoid building a graph which possesses the relevant property.
  Maker-Breaker games are known to be ""bias-monotone"", that is, if Maker wins
the $(1,b)$ game, he also wins the $(1,b-1)$ game. Therefore, it makes sense to
define the critical bias of a game, $b^*$, to be the ""breaking point"" of the
game. That is, Maker wins the $(1,b)$ game whenever $b\leq b^*$ and loses
otherwise. An analogous definition of the critical bias exists for
Avoider-Enforcer games: here, the critical bias of a game $b^*$ is such that
Avoider wins the $(1,b)$ game for every $b > b^*$, and loses otherwise.
  We prove that, for every $p=\omega(\frac{\ln n}{n})$, $G\sim\gnp$ is
typically such that the critical bias for all the aforementioned Maker-Breaker
games is asymptotically $b^*=\frac{np}{\ln n}$. We also prove that in the case
$p=\Theta(\frac{\ln n}{n})$, the critical bias is $b^*=\Theta(\frac{np}{\ln
n})$. These results settle a conjecture of Stojakovi\'c and Szab\'o. For
Avoider-Enforcer games, we prove that for $p=\Omega(\frac{\ln n}{n})$, the
critical bias for all the aforementioned games is $b^*=\Theta(\frac{np}{\ln
n})$.

processes. A model-independent upper limit of 0.86 +/- 0.06 fb on the product

prepare four different initial clouds having different magnetic field strengths

the rotation axis. First, we calculate the evolution of such clouds from the
prestellar stage until long after protostar formation. Then, we calculate the
polarization of thermal dust emission expected from the simulation data. We
create polarization maps with arbitrary viewing angles and compare them with
observations. Using this procedure, we confirmed that the polarization
distribution projected on the celestial plane strongly depends on the viewing
angle of the cloud. Thus, by comparing the observations with the polarization
map predicted by the simulations, we can roughly determine the angle between
the direction of the global magnetic field and the line of sight. The
configuration of the polarization vectors also depends on the viewing angle. We
find that an hourglass configuration of magnetic field lines is not always
realized in a collapsing cloud when the global magnetic field is misaligned
with the cloud rotation axis. Depending on the viewing angle, an S-shaped
configuration of the magnetic field (or the polarization vectors) appears early
in the protostellar accretion phase. This indicates that not only the magnetic
field but also the cloud rotation affects the dynamical evolution of such a
cloud. In addition, by comparing the simulated polarization with actual
observations, we can estimate properties of the host cloud such as the
evolutionary stage, magnetic field strength, and rotation rate.

(see [Ann. Appl. Probab. 7 (1997) 110-120]) that, when the variance of the
proposal scales inversely proportional to the dimension $n$ whereas time is
accelerated by the factor $n$, a diffusive limit is obtained for each component
of the Markov chain if this chain starts at equilibrium. This paper extends
this result when the initial distribution is not the target probability
measure. Remarking that the interaction between the components of the chain due
to the common acceptance/rejection of the proposed moves is of mean-field type,
we obtain a propagation of chaos result under the same scaling as in the
stationary case. This proves that, in terms of the dimension $n$, the same
scaling holds for the transient phase of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as
near stationarity. The diffusive and mean-field limit of each component is a
diffusion process nonlinear in the sense of McKean. This opens the route to new
investigations of the optimal choice for the variance of the proposal
distribution in order to accelerate convergence to equilibrium (see [Optimal

investigate the band structure of polycrystalline graphene tuned by externally
imposed strains and intrinsic mismatch strains at the GB by density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. We found that graphene with symmetrical GBs
typically has zero band gap even with large uniaxial and biaxial strain.
However, some particular asymmetrical GBs can open a band gap in graphene and
their band structures can be substantially tuned by external strains. A maximum
band gap about 0.19 eV was observed in matched-armchair GB (5, 5) | (3, 7) with
a misorientation of {\theta}=13o when the applied uniaxial strain increases to
9%. Although mismatch strain is inevitable in asymmetrical GBs, it has a small
influence on the band gap of polycrystalline graphene.

regions and sunspot zones provide a nonlinear feedback mechanism that limits
the amplitude of a Babcock-Leighton-type solar dynamo and determines the
variation of the cycle strength. This hypothesis is tested with surface flux
transport simulations including converging latitudinal flows that depend on the
surface distribution of magnetic flux. The inflows modulate the build-up of
polar fields (represented by the axial dipole) by reducing the tilt angles of
bipolar magnetic regions and by affecting the cross-equator transport of
leading-polarity magnetic flux. With flux input derived from the observed
record of sunspot groups, the simulations cover the period between 1874 and
1980 (corresponding to solar cycles 11 to 20). The inclusion of the inflows
leads to a strong correlation of the simulated axial dipole strength during
activity minimum with the observed amplitude of the subsequent cycle. This in
agreement with empirical correlations and in line with what is expected from a
Babcock-Leighton-type dynamo. The results provide evidence that the latitudinal
inflows are a key ingredient in determining the amplitude of solar cycles.

Exact formulas for the metric coefficients in Fermi coordinates are derived.
Sharp universal upper bounds for the proper radii of leaves of the foliation by

at fixed times of the comoving observer. It is proved that the radius at proper

Bayesian model comparison. In this paper we explicitly calculate the Bayes
factors for all models that are linear with respect to their parameters. We do
this in order to test the so called Jeffreys' scale and determine analytically
how accurate its predictions are in a simple case where we fully understand and
can calculate everything analytically. We also discuss the case of nested

we discuss the importance of choosing the right basis in the context of models

includes up to 50 rotational levels within nine vibrational levels for the
ground and A excited states in the radiative photochemical code ProDiMo. We
took CO collisions with hydrogen molecules, hydrogen atoms, helium, and
electrons into account. We estimated the missing collision rates using standard

impact on the population of ro-vibrational v > 1 levels. The v = 1 rotational
levels are populated at rotational temperatures between the radiation
temperature around 4.6 micron and the gas kinetic temperature. The UV pumping
efficiency increases with decreasing disc mass. The consequence is that the
vibrational temperatures, which measure the relative populations between the
vibrational levels, are higher than the disc gas kinetic temperatures
(suprathermal population). Rotational temperatures from fundamental transitions
derived using optically thick 12CO lines do not reflect the gas kinetic
temperature. CO pure rotational levels with energies lower than 1000 K are
populated in LTE but are sensitive to a number of vibrational levels included
in the model. The 12CO pure rotational lines are highly optically thick for
transition from levels up to Eupper=2000 K. (abridged)

logic (each element is either definitely in or not in a subset, i.e., either

agree with this ""properties all the way down"" picture of micro-reality. Are
there other coherent alternative views of reality? A logic of partitions, dual
to the Boolean logic of subsets (partitions are dual to subsets), was recently
developed along with a logical version of information theory. In view of the
subset-partition duality, partition logic is the alternative to Boolean subset
logic and thus it abstractly describes the alternative dual view of
micro-reality. Perhaps QM is compatible with this dual view? Indeed, when the
mathematics of partitions using sets is ""lifted"" from sets to vector spaces,
then it yields the mathematics and relations of quantum mechanics. Thus the
vision of micro-reality abstractly characterized by partition logic matches
that described by quantum mechanics. The key concept explicated by partition
logic is the old idea of ""objective indefiniteness"" (emphasized by Shimony).
Thus partition logic, logical information theory, and the lifting program
provide the back story so that the old idea then yields the objective
indefiniteness interpretation of quantum mechanics.

environment and strong space constraints are addressed with very thin pixel
sensors active thickness in the range of (75-150) mum, and the development of

associated multiresolution analyses. Furthermore, they provided examples of
complete orthonormal wavelet systems in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ which only require
a single generating wavelet. Although work had been done to smooth these
wavelets, which are by definition discontinuous on the frequency domain,
nothing had been explicitly done over $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d >1$. This paper, along
with another one cowritten by the author, finally addresses this issue.
Smoothing does not work as expected in higher dimensions. For example, Bin
Han's proof of existence of Schwartz class functions which are Parseval frame
wavelets and approximate Parseval frame wavelet set wavelets does not easily
generalize to higher dimensions. However, a construction of wavelet sets in
$\hat{\mathbb{R}}^d$ which may be smoothed is presented. Finally, it is shown
that a commonly used class of functions cannot be the result of convolutional
smoothing of a wavelet set wavelet.

formation of planets and planetary systems such as our own. But care must be

the Herschel Space Observatory provides a new view on the origin of the
far-infrared and sub-millimeter excesses observed.
  Aims: We review the nature of previously known transitional disks in the
Chamaeleon I star-forming region with Herschel data.
  Methods: We analyze Herschel PACS and SPIRE images of the young star T54
together with ancillary images. We also analyze its spectral energy
distribution and indications from optical and mid-infrared spectroscopy.
  Results: We detect extended emission in the PACS 70 \mu m image ~6"" off
source at a position angle of 196{\deg} from T54. The emission detected at
longer wavelength (PACS 100, 160, SPIRE 250 and 350 \mu m) is also offset from
the position of the star. This suggests that the excess observed in the
far-infrared part of the SED is not fully associated with T54.
  Conclusions: Herschel images show that the far-infrared excess seen in T54 is
not due to a transitional disk but to extended emission south-west of the
source. The object still shows point-like and now downscaled excess at
mid-infrared wavelengths, but its origin cannot be constrained without higher
spatial resolution data. However, different indications point towards an
evolved disk or extended unresolved emission close to the source.

mass model of a deflector and determine cosmological parameters. We here
present an analysis of the time-delay distribution of multiply imaged sources
behind 17 strong lensing galaxy clusters with well-calibrated mass models. We
find that for time delays less than 1000 days, at z=3.0, their logarithmic
probability distribution functions are well represented by P (log \Delta t)=5.3
x 10^-4 \Delta t^\beta M_250^-2\beta, with \beta=0.77, where M_250 is the
projected cluster mass inside 250 kpc (in 10^14 M_sun), and \beta is the
power-law slope of the distribution. The resultant probability distribution
function enables us to estimate the time-delay distribution in a lensing
cluster of known mass. For a cluster with M_250=2 x 10^14 M_sun, the fraction
of time delays less than 1000 days is approximately 3%. Taking Abell 1689 as an
example, its dark halo and brightest galaxies, with central velocity
dispersions larger than 500 km/s, mainly produce large time delays, while
galaxy-scale mass clumps are responsible for generating smaller time delays. We
estimate the probability of observing multiple images of a supernova in the
known images of Abell 1689. A two-component model of estimating the supernova
rate is applied in this work. For a magnitude threshold of m_AB=26.5, the
yearly rate of Type Ia (core-collapse) supernovae with time delays less than
1000 days is 0.004 +- 0.002 (0.029 +- 0.001). If the magnitude threshold is
lowered to m_AB ~ 27.0, the rate of core-collapse supernovae suitable for time
delay observation is 0.044 +- 0.015 per year.

characteristic example for this class of applications is given by the
Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), a widely spread tool in computational
biology. GWAS entails the solution of up to trillions ($10^{12}$) of correlated
generalized least-squares problems, posing a daunting challenge: the
performance of petaflops ($10^{15}$ floating-point operations) over terabytes
of data.
  In this paper, we design an algorithm for performing GWAS on multi-core
architectures. This is accomplished in three steps. First, we show how to
exploit the relation among successive problems, thus reducing the overall
computational complexity. Then, through an analysis of the required data
transfers, we identify how to eliminate any overhead due to input/output
operations. Finally, we study how to decompose computation into tasks to be
distributed among the available cores, to attain high performance and
scalability. With our algorithm, a GWAS that currently requires the use of a
supercomputer may now be performed in matter of hours on a single multi-core
node.
  The discussion centers around the methodology to develop the algorithm rather
than the specific application. We believe the paper contributes valuable

Farzad et al. proved the NP-completeness for finding a square root for girth 4
while they gave a polynomial time algorithm for computing a square root of
girth at least six. Adamaszek and Adamaszek proved that if a graph has a square
root of girth six then this square root is unique up to isomorphism. In this
paper we consider the characterization and recognition problem of graphs that
are square of graphs of girth at least five. We introduce a family of graphs
with exponentially many non-isomorphic square roots, and as the main result of
this paper we prove that the square root finding problem is NP-complete for
square roots of girth five. This proof is providing the complete dichotomy
theorem for square root problem in terms of the girth of the square roots.

exploiting the statistical power of Stage IV weak lensing surveys will require
additive biases A<1.8e-12 and multiplicative biases M<4.0e-3. These can be
allocated between individual budgets in hardware, calibration data and

analysis from space. If used on fainter galaxies or for 3D cosmic shear
tomography, existing algorithms would need calibration on simulations to avoid
introducing bias at a level similar to the statistical error. Requirements on

entropy formula for general non-extremal asymptotically flat black holes in
four dimensions can be understood in terms of an underlying conformal symmetry.
A recent implementation of this idea, carried out by Cveti\v{c} and Larsen,
involves the replacement of a conformal factor in the original geometry by an
alternative conformal factor in such a way that the near-horizon behavior and
thermodynamic properties of the black hole remain unchanged, while only the
asymptotics or ""environment"" of the geometry are modified. The solution thus
obtained, dubbed ""subtracted geometry"", uplifts to an asymptotically
AdS$_{3}\times S^{2}$ black hole in five dimensions, and an AdS/CFT
interpretation is then possible. Building on this intuition we show that, at
least in the static case, the replacement of the conformal factor can be
implemented dynamically by means of an interpolating flow which we construct
explicitly. Furthermore, we show that this flow can be understood as the effect
of irrelevant perturbations from the point of view of the dual two-dimensional
CFT, and we identify the quantum numbers of the operators responsible for the
flow. This allows us to address quantitatively the validity of CFT computations
for these asymptotically flat black holes and provides a framework to
systematically compute corrections to the CFT results.

cool components. This results in a complex environment that is ideal for
studying the latter stages of stellar evolution along with interactions within
binary systems. As a star approaches the end of its life, in particular the red
giant phase, it exhausts its supply of core hydrogen and begins burning its way
through successively heavier elements. Red giants lose mass in the form of a
dense wind that will replenish the interstellar medium with chemical elements
that are formed through nuclear processes deep in the stellar interior. When
these elements reach the interstellar medium they play a central role in both
stellar and planetary evolution, as well as providing the essential
constituents needed for life. The undoubted significance of these cool giants
means the study of their atmospheres is necessary to help understand our place
in the Universe. This thesis presents Hubble Space Telescope observations of
the symbiotic system EG Andromedae as an insight into red giant stars. EG And
is one of the brightest and closest symbiotic systems and consists of a red
giant primary along with a white dwarf. The presence of the white dwarf in the
system allows spatially resolved examination of the red giant primary. The
benefits of using such a system to better understand the base of red giant
chromospheres is shown. Along with the observations of EG And, new HST
observations of an isolated red giant spectral standard HD148349 are described.
The similarity between the isolated spectral standard and the red giant primary
of EG And is demonstrated, showing that much of the information gleaned from a
symbiotic system can be applied to the general red giant population. Using both
ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy, the atmosphere of EG And and HD148349 are
investigated and contrasted.

in purport of warning the world of a global conspiracy of occultists. Among the
documents he gathered to support his thesis was the personal account of a
sailor by the name of Gustaf Johansen, describing an encounter with an
extraordinary island. Johansen`s descriptions of his adventures upon the island
are fantastic, and are often considered the most enigmatic (and therefore the
highlight) of Thurston`s collection of documents.
  We contend that all of the credible phenomena which Johansen described may be
explained as being the observable consequences of a localized bubble of
spacetime curvature. Many of his most incomprehensible statements (involving
the geometry of the architecture, and variability of the location of the
horizon) can therefore be said to have a unified underlying cause.
  We propose a simplified example of such a geometry, and show using numerical
computation that Johansen`s descriptions were, for the most part, not simply
the ravings of a lunatic. Rather, they are the nontechnical observations of an
intelligent man who did not understand how to describe what he was seeing.
Conversely, it seems to us improbable that Johansen should have unwittingly
given such a precise description of the consequences of spacetime curvature, if
the details of this story were merely the dregs of some half remembered fever
dream.
  We calculate the type of matter which would be required to generate such
exotic spacetime curvature. Unfortunately, we determine that the required
matter is quite unphysical, and possess a nature which is entirely alien to all
of the experiences of human science. Indeed, any civilization with mastery over
such matter would be able to construct warp drives, cloaking devices, and other
exotic geometries required to conveniently travel through the cosmos.

Although no clear anomaly is found in transport properties as a function of

by both optical and photoemission spectroscopies. ARPES reveals that a nearly
filled band with negative curvature, close enough from the Fermi level at 300K
to produce metallic-like behaviour as observed in optical conductivity spectra.
At low temperature, the band structure is strongly modified, yielding to an
insulating state with a optical gap of 120 meV. An accurate (3+1)D analysis of
x-ray diffraction data shows that, although a phase transition does not occur,
structural distortions increase as temperature is decreased, and vanadium
clusterization is enhanced. We found that the changes of electronic properties

  on hybrid metal-semiconductor nanowires","6 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the past few years, many of the fascinating and previously almost
unconceivable properties predicted for those novel, artificial, man-made
materials, so called metamaterials, were demonstrated to be not only a tangible
reality, but a very useful one. However, plenty of the best achievements in
that newly discovered field are far from having a direct translation to the, in
many aspects more interesting, high frequency range, without being burdened not
only by technological difficulties, but also conceptual ones. Of particular
importance within the realm of optical metamaterials having a negative index of
refraction, often designated negative-index metamaterials (NIM), is the issue
of simultaneously achieving a strong response of the system and low associated
losses. In the present work, we demonstrate the possibility to use hybrid
metal-semiconductor nanowires to obtain an isotropic optical NIM, with very
strong electric and magnetic responses, which exhibits extremely low losses
(about two orders of magnitude better than present optical NIMs).

and explore their use in music theory, in two different contexts. In the first,
we show that many of the most familiar chord and scale types in Western music
appear as extremal elements in the partial order induced by set inclusion on
pitch class sets of Tn-type. In the second, we propose a partial order that
models the brightness aspect of timbre. We use this order to compare the
brightness of six wind instruments, and find that the results conform to
intuition. We also use the order to pose sound design problems of a certain
type, which can be solved efficiently using linear programming.

rain formation in monsoon clouds is presented. The model is based on classical
statistical physical concepts and satisfies the principle of maximum entropy
production. Atmospheric flows exhibit selfsimilar fractal fluctuations that are
ubiquitous to all dynamical systems in nature, such as physical, chemical,
social, etc and are characterized by inverse power law form for power (eddy
energy) spectrum signifying long-range space-time correlations. A general
systems theory model for atmospheric flows developed by the author is based on
the concept that the large eddy energy is the integrated mean of enclosed
turbulent (small scale) eddies. This model gives scale-free universal governing
equations for cloud growth processes. The model predicted cloud parameters are
in agreement with reported observations, in particular, the cloud dropsize
distribution. Rain formation can occur in warm clouds within 30minutes lifetime
under favourable conditions of moisture supply in the environment.

fermions is discussed from the viewpoint of an effective field theory. Although
the fermion-potentials are effectively represented as terms similar to the
$a$-coefficients in the theory of standard-model extension, their magnitudes
are very large and their physical implications are different. A possibility is
shown that the fermion-potentials are detectable by neither the deviations from
conventional energy-momentum conservations, the neutrino-oscillations, the
CPT-violation in neutral meson systems, nor the gravitational effects.

homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model filled with
perfect fluid and dark energy components is studied by generalizing the recent
results (Amirhashchi et al. in Int. J. Theor. Phys. 50: 3529, 2011b). The two
sources are claimed to interact minimally so that their energy momentum tensors
are conserved separately. The conception of time-dependent deceleration
parameter (DP) with some suitable assumption yields an average scale factor $a
= [\sinh (\alpha t)]^{\frac{1}{n}}$, with $\alpha$ and $n$ being positive
arbitrary constants. For $0 < n \leq 1$, this generates a class of accelerating
models while for $n > 1$, the models of universe exhibit phase transition from
early decelerating phase to present accelerating phase which is supported with
the results from recent astrophysical observations. It is observed that the
transition red shift ($z_{t}$) for our derived model with $q_{0} = -0.73$ is
$\cong 0.32$. This is in good agreement with the cosmological observations in
the literature. Some physical and geometric properties of the model along with
physical acceptability of cosmological solutions have been discussed in detail.

fractal universe. We find that one can always rewrite the Friedmann equation of
the fractal universe in the form of the entropy balance relation $ \delta Q=T_h
d{S_h}$, where $ \delta Q $ and $ T_{h} $ are the energy flux and Unruh
temperature seen by an accelerated observer just inside the apparent horizon.
We find that the entropy $S_h$ consists two terms, the first one which obeys
the usual area law and the second part which is the entropy production term due
to nonequilibrium thermodynamics of fractal universe. This shows that in a
fractal universe, a treatment with nonequilibrium thermodynamics of spacetime
may be needed. We also study the generalized second law of thermodynamics in
the framework of fractal universe. When the temperature of the apparent horizon
and the matter fields inside the horizon are equal, i.e. $T=T_h$, the
generalized second law of thermodynamics can be fulfilled provided the
deceleration and the equation of state parameters ranges either as $-1 \leq q <
0 $, $- 1 \leq w < - 1/3$ or as $q<-1$, $w<-1$ which are consistent with recent
observations. We also find that for $T_h=bT$, with $b<1$, the GSL of
thermodynamics can be secured in a fractal universe by suitably choosing the
fractal parameter $\beta$.
